Within the context of recurrent neural network training with TensorFlow, specifically when utilizing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layers, deciding when to reset their internal states—either after each epoch or each batch—fundamentally impacts the model’s learning process and its ability to capture sequential dependencies. The appropriate choice is not arbitrary; it’s dictated by the nature of the input data and the desired modeling behavior.

My practical experience building a time-series forecasting model for electricity consumption revealed the nuanced implications of this choice. Initially, I defaulted to resetting states every batch, a practice common in many introductory tutorials. This yielded an acceptable, albeit suboptimal, result. However, analyzing error patterns revealed a tendency for the model to be overly sensitive to short-term fluctuations and struggled to extract longer-term trends like seasonal changes that spanned across multiple batches within a single epoch. Further experimentation demonstrated that resetting states every *epoch*, rather than each batch, allowed the model to retain temporal context across multiple batches, improving its ability to model such longer-term dependencies. This transition dramatically improved forecasting accuracy, emphasizing the critical role of state management in recurrent neural networks.

The core principle revolves around how the network's internal memory is intended to operate: specifically, whether sequential dependencies within a sequence span multiple batches. When training on sequences that are broken into smaller batches, resetting the hidden states after each batch essentially forces the network to treat each batch as an independent input sequence. Information accumulated from the previous batch is discarded. This is appropriate when each batch represents an independent sequence, as might occur with natural language processing, where sentences in a large corpus are not inherently related. By contrast, when the sequence is a continuous entity broken down for practical batch processing, the inter-batch dependencies need to be captured.

Resetting the states after each *epoch*, rather than after each batch, maintains the contextual information from one batch to the next. This enables the LSTM or GRU to accumulate and utilize information over a larger temporal scope within a single epoch of training. Crucially, however, the hidden and cell states *must* still be reset at the *beginning* of every epoch. This ensures each epoch starts with a clean slate and prevents any state bleed-over that would corrupt training. The length of these preserved dependencies can be controlled by the length of the data sequence and the batch size. In time-series data or other scenarios where long-term patterns are crucial, propagating state throughout an entire epoch is often the preferred method.

Here are three specific code examples, each with a brief explanation, illustrating the practice:

**Example 1: Resetting States Every Batch (Typical Default)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Assume 'data' is a tensor of sequences broken into batches
def build_model(input_shape, num_units, output_units):
    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
    lstm = LSTM(num_units, return_sequences=False)(inputs)
    outputs = Dense(output_units)(lstm)
    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    return model

# Assume data_batch is one batch from the larger dataset
input_shape = (10, 5)
num_units = 64
output_units = 3
model = build_model(input_shape, num_units, output_units)

# Training loop
num_epochs = 5
batch_size = 32
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.001)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in range(num_batches): # Pseudocode for iterating over batches
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(data_batch) # model is called on the batch
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.MSE(labels, predictions)) # Loss calculation

      gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
      optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

      # No state reset required at end of each batch.
      # states are reset automatically for next batch due to not using return_state=True
```

This example demonstrates the basic case where the LSTM layer's states are effectively reset after processing each batch, due to default behaviour and lack of manual state management. The network treats each batch independently, and there is no propagation of information from one batch to the next. This method is suitable for scenarios where sequence independence between batches is assumed. The `return_sequences = False` flag also prevents the return of the LSTM states during a forward pass.

**Example 2: Resetting States Every Epoch with manual state management (Recommended for time-series)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def build_stateful_model(input_shape, num_units, output_units, batch_size):
    inputs = Input(batch_shape=(batch_size, input_shape[0], input_shape[1])) # Batch size included
    lstm = LSTM(num_units, return_state=True, stateful=True)(inputs)
    outputs = Dense(output_units)(lstm[0]) # Output from 0th output of tuple
    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    return model

input_shape = (10, 5)
num_units = 64
output_units = 3
batch_size = 32

model = build_stateful_model(input_shape, num_units, output_units, batch_size)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.001)
num_epochs = 5

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Reset states at the beginning of each epoch.
    model.reset_states()

    for batch in range(num_batches): # Pseudocode for iterating over batches
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(data_batch) # states now passed from previous batch
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.MSE(labels, predictions))

      gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
      optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

```

In this example, we utilize a 'stateful' LSTM layer and explicitly reset the states at the beginning of *each epoch*. The states are passed automatically between batches. Importantly, we specify the `batch_input_shape` to the `Input` layer so Tensorflow understands how to manage statefulness. This method is suitable for time series, and any case where sequential information across batches must be retained. The `return_state=True` flag causes the LSTM layer to return its internal states as the second output of the layer. However, as the output of the network only contains the output from the LSTM unit, we access only the first member of the returned tuple `lstm[0]`.

**Example 3: State Management with Model Subclassing (Alternative Method)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

class StatefulModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, num_units, output_units):
        super(StatefulModel, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = LSTM(num_units, return_state=True, stateful=True)
        self.dense = Dense(output_units)

    def call(self, inputs):
        lstm_output, _, _ = self.lstm(inputs) # only interested in the output of the LSTM
        output = self.dense(lstm_output)
        return output

    def reset_states(self):
        self.lstm.reset_states()

input_shape = (10, 5)
num_units = 64
output_units = 3
batch_size = 32

model = StatefulModel(num_units, output_units)
# Build the model
model(tf.zeros(shape=(batch_size, input_shape[0], input_shape[1])))

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.001)
num_epochs = 5

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.reset_states()

    for batch in range(num_batches): # Pseudocode for iterating over batches
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(data_batch)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.MSE(labels, predictions))

      gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
      optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

```

This final example demonstrates how to achieve the same state reset functionality with custom model subclassing. We encapsulate both the LSTM layer and the state reset logic within a custom class, resulting in more organized code that can be easier to maintain. This approach also allows more intricate customization of the forward pass if required. The `reset_states` method is the same as the previous method but has been moved into the class definition to allow a common place to clear the hidden states. Again, the model states are cleared at the start of each epoch and then persisted between batches. The line `model(tf.zeros(shape=(batch_size, input_shape[0], input_shape[1])))` is required to trigger the initialisation of the weights in the model, as TensorFlow models do not do so until a forward pass has been conducted.

In summary, the choice of whether to reset LSTM/GRU states per epoch or per batch hinges entirely upon the dependencies present in the input sequences. When the dataset forms long temporal sequences that have been broken down into batches, resetting per *epoch* while maintaining a reset at the start of each epoch is vital for capturing long-term dependencies. When there are not explicit dependencies between batches, resetting per batch may be sufficient, and will be the default behaviour of an LSTM/GRU layer in TensorFlow. Always validate the efficacy of each approach using appropriate metrics and model evaluation practices.

Further study in recurrent neural network best practices would prove beneficial. The Keras documentation regarding recurrent layers offers valuable insights. Also, research concerning sequential data handling in TensorFlow, particularly concerning stateful layers, can improve model performance. Textbooks that address sequence modelling, especially within time-series analysis, will deepen one’s understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of state management in LSTMs and GRUs.
