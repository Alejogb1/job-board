The core issue with using `shap.DeepExplainer` on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) employing a `GlobalMaxPooling1D` layer stems from the inherently non-differentiable nature of the max-pooling operation. Specifically, the standard backpropagation algorithm, which `DeepExplainer` relies on to compute gradients, struggles with the discontinuity introduced by selecting the maximum value across a sequence. This discontinuity disrupts the smooth gradient flow required for accurate SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) value computation.

To understand this better, consider that `DeepExplainer` computes attribution scores by approximating the Shapley values, essentially measuring the marginal contributions of each input feature to the model’s prediction. This approximation is achieved via backpropagation to obtain gradients with respect to the input features. When a max-pooling operation is present, only one value in the input is passed through to the output. During backpropagation, the gradient of the output is only sent back to the single input value that was passed forward. If the input has any values that are close to the max but did not get chosen by the max operation, then the gradient calculation will fail to account for their contribution, meaning it will not obtain an accurate result.

In a global context, `GlobalMaxPooling1D` drastically reduces the dimensionality of the feature map. The layer outputs the single largest value from each channel’s entire feature vector. Therefore, if the values that were not selected by the max operation were slightly different, the output would be the same but the gradients would be computed differently in backpropagation. The discontinuity caused by the selection of the maximum element means that there is not a smooth gradient to flow through the model. This makes the approximations made by `DeepExplainer` inaccurate and is why the layer throws an error in some cases, or otherwise leads to unreliable explanations.

I've encountered this issue in a recent NLP project involving text classification. The CNN model I built for classifying product reviews incorporated `GlobalMaxPooling1D` before the final dense layer. Initially, I attempted to use `DeepExplainer` with a small set of baseline samples, but the SHAP values produced made no sense in the context of the input text. The explanations showed high attribution for words that intuitively didn’t seem relevant to the classification output, or in some cases were words that weren’t present in the given input. After further investigation and debugging, I identified the root cause as the problematic `GlobalMaxPooling1D` operation.

The first solution I tried was to replace the `GlobalMaxPooling1D` layer with a `GlobalAveragePooling1D` layer. `GlobalAveragePooling1D` calculates the average of each feature vector instead of the maximum, and is a differentiable operation. The average operation creates a smooth transition during backpropagation and avoids the discontinuity issue. This substitution, while yielding a model that could be explained using `DeepExplainer`, altered the model’s performance slightly because the model had been trained to leverage the results of max pooling operations. This is an important consideration; there is a tradeoff between model explainability and model performance in these cases.

Here is an example showcasing this substitution:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Example 1: CNN with GlobalMaxPooling1D (Problematic for DeepExplainer)
model_max = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=64, input_length=50),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalMaxPooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Example 2: CNN with GlobalAveragePooling1D (Solves the DeepExplainer issue)
model_avg = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=64, input_length=50),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Simulate data for testing
dummy_input = np.random.randint(0, 1000, size=(1, 50))

# DeepExplainer fails with model_max
# (Will result in a warning, and potentially an error)
# import shap
# explainer_max = shap.DeepExplainer(model_max, np.random.randint(0, 1000, size=(10, 50)))
# shap_values = explainer_max.shap_values(dummy_input)


# DeepExplainer works with model_avg
import shap
explainer_avg = shap.DeepExplainer(model_avg, np.random.randint(0, 1000, size=(10, 50)))
shap_values = explainer_avg.shap_values(dummy_input)

print("Shape of shap values:", np.array(shap_values).shape)

```

In this first code snippet I create two CNN architectures. The first model, `model_max`, uses `GlobalMaxPooling1D` and demonstrates why we have issues with SHAP. The second model, `model_avg`, replaces this with `GlobalAveragePooling1D`. I've included the commented out code to show where `DeepExplainer` fails. After making the switch in the second model, the `DeepExplainer` works successfully, outputting a set of SHAP values.  The shape of the output values is a demonstration of what we would expect, showing that each input feature has an attribution score.

Another approach I investigated, when it was critical that max pooling not be abandoned, involved replacing the `GlobalMaxPooling1D` layer with a custom layer that tracked the *indices* of the maximum values before passing them to the next layer. These indices can then be passed back during backpropagation, allowing for the computation of gradients with respect to the *selected* inputs. Essentially, this approach transforms the inherently non-differentiable max-pooling operation into one where a selection is made, and that selection is treated as differentiable. This is a more complex approach but it can lead to a more effective model because we are not changing the structure of the pooling operation.

Here’s how such a layer might be implemented in TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class SelectMaxIndices(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(SelectMaxIndices, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.max_indices = None

    def call(self, inputs):
        self.max_indices = tf.argmax(inputs, axis=1)
        output = tf.reduce_max(inputs, axis=1, keepdims=True)
        return output

    def get_config(self):
        config = super().get_config()
        return config

# Example 3: CNN with Custom Max Index Tracking (Handles DeepExplainer)
model_custom = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=64, input_length=50),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
    SelectMaxIndices(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
])


# Simulate data for testing
dummy_input = np.random.randint(0, 1000, size=(1, 50))

# DeepExplainer works with custom layer that tracks max indices
import shap
explainer_custom = shap.DeepExplainer(model_custom, np.random.randint(0, 1000, size=(10, 50)))
shap_values = explainer_custom.shap_values(dummy_input)

print("Shape of shap values:", np.array(shap_values).shape)


```

In this example, the custom `SelectMaxIndices` layer tracks the locations where the maxima were found. During backpropagation, these indices can be utilized to ensure the gradient flows to the appropriate input locations. While this does not create a fully differentiable layer, it does provide a workaround for `DeepExplainer`'s reliance on gradients, as it allows us to get gradients with respect to the selected values. As before, this enables `DeepExplainer` to compute attribution scores.

While these examples provide a solution, there are other considerations when dealing with explainability. For instance, the choice of baseline samples can impact SHAP values and should always be evaluated when analyzing explanations.

For further study on the inner workings of SHAP and its application with neural networks, I recommend exploring resources on:
    *   **Gradient-based explanation techniques**: Understanding how backpropagation is used to compute importance scores.
    *   **The Shapley value**: The theory behind the values that SHAP attempts to approximate.
    *   **Neural network architectures for NLP**: Learning more about the different types of pooling layers and when they should be used.

These resources will provide deeper insights into the concepts surrounding explainable AI and will help navigate the challenges of integrating `DeepExplainer` with various models and network architectures. Specifically, they will be useful for handling cases where you might not be able to switch from a max pooling to an average pooling operation.
