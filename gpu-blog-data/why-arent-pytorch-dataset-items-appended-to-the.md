The core issue lies in the mechanism PyTorch uses for data loading and the interaction of exception handling with iterator behavior.  In my experience debugging large-scale image classification pipelines, I've encountered this problem repeatedly.  The crucial detail is that PyTorch's `DataLoader` utilizes iterators, and exceptions raised during data processing typically halt iteration, preventing subsequent items from being accessed.  Simple appending to a list outside the iteration loop won't resolve this because the iterator itself terminates upon encountering the exception.

To clarify, let's examine the typical data loading process.  A `Dataset` class provides access to individual data points via `__getitem__`.  The `DataLoader` then iterates over the dataset, potentially applying transforms and batching.  When an exception arises within `__getitem__`, the iterator's state is irrevocably changed, preventing further retrieval of items from the dataset using that particular iterator instance. The exception doesn't simply skip the problematic item; it terminates the process of iterating through the `DataLoader`.

This behavior is consistent with standard Python iterator practices. Iterators are designed to be single-pass constructs.  Once an exception breaks the iteration, the iterator is effectively exhausted.  Attempting to append items after the exception will only add items that were successfully processed *before* the failure; the remaining items will be inaccessible.  This is not a PyTorch-specific quirk but rather a fundamental aspect of iterator functionality.

To address this, I've implemented several strategies over the years, each with its own trade-offs.  Let's illustrate them with code examples.

**Example 1:  Exception Handling within `__getitem__` and Separate List Accumulation**

This approach focuses on graceful handling of exceptions within the `__getitem__` method of the custom dataset class. Instead of letting the exception propagate and halt the `DataLoader`, we catch it, log it (or take other appropriate action), and continue processing.  Crucially, we maintain a separate list outside of the `DataLoader` to store successfully processed data.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        try:
            # Simulate potential exceptions; replace with your actual data loading logic
            if idx % 5 == 0:
                raise ValueError("Simulated error at index {}".format(idx))
            item = torch.tensor(self.data[idx])
            return item
        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Error processing item at index {idx}: {e}")
            return None  # or handle the error differently


data = list(range(100))
dataset = MyDataset(data)
full_data = []  #List to hold data outside of the DataLoader

dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10)

for batch in dataloader:
  for item in batch:
    if item is not None:
      full_data.extend(item.tolist())  #append only successful data items
print(len(full_data)) # Verify the number of items in the list.

```

Here, the `ValueError` is caught, a message is printed, and `None` is returned.  The `for` loop in the main section then checks for `None` before appending, ensuring only valid data makes it to `full_data`.


**Example 2:  Using a `try-except` block around the DataLoader iteration**

This approach encapsulates the `DataLoader` iteration itself within a `try-except` block. While this won't allow item-specific exception handling within `__getitem__`, it prevents the entire process from halting on the first exception.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

# (MyDataset class remains the same as in Example 1)

data = list(range(100))
dataset = MyDataset(data)
full_data = []

dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10)

try:
    for batch in dataloader:
        for item in batch:
            if item is not None:
                full_data.extend(item.tolist())
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred during data loading: {e}")


print(len(full_data)) # Verify the number of items in the list.

```

This approach is simpler but provides less fine-grained control over exception handling;  all exceptions raised during iteration are caught by the outer `except` block.

**Example 3:  Creating a Custom Iterator with Error Handling**

For maximum control, one can bypass the `DataLoader` altogether and create a custom iterator that handles exceptions explicitly.  This provides the most flexibility but increases complexity.

```python
import torch

class MyIterator:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.idx = 0
        self.processed = []

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.idx >= len(self.data):
            raise StopIteration
        try:
            # Simulate potential exceptions
            if self.idx % 5 == 0:
                raise ValueError("Simulated error at index {}".format(self.idx))
            item = torch.tensor(self.data[self.idx])
            self.idx += 1
            self.processed.append(item)
            return item
        except ValueError as e:
            print(f"Error processing item at index {self.idx}: {e}")
            self.idx += 1  # Increment index to move to the next item
            return self.__next__() #Recursively call to process next item

data = list(range(100))
my_iterator = MyIterator(data)
full_data = []
for item in my_iterator:
    full_data.append(item.tolist())

print(len(full_data))
print(len(my_iterator.processed)) # shows items successfully processed

```

This custom iterator catches exceptions, logs them, and continues processing subsequent items.  The `processed` list within the iterator tracks the successfully processed data.

**Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation on `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes.  A comprehensive Python tutorial on iterators and generators.  A textbook on software engineering principles emphasizing exception handling and robust code design.  These resources will help solidify your understanding of the underlying concepts. Remember that careful consideration of exception handling is paramount for building reliable data loading pipelines in any machine learning project.  The choice between these strategies depends on the level of control needed and the complexity that can be tolerated.
