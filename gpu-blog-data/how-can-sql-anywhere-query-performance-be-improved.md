SQL Anywhere query performance optimization is fundamentally about understanding the interplay between data structure, query design, and available resources.  My experience over the past decade, working with diverse SQL Anywhere deployments ranging from embedded systems to enterprise-level data warehouses, highlights the crucial role of indexing in achieving significant performance gains.  Improperly designed or missing indexes frequently account for the most easily rectified performance bottlenecks.

**1.  Clear Explanation: A Multifaceted Approach**

Optimizing SQL Anywhere query performance requires a systematic approach encompassing several key areas.  While a poorly written query can cripple even the most meticulously tuned database, the underlying data structure is the foundation upon which all else is built.  Therefore, effective optimization begins with analyzing data access patterns and identifying potential inefficiencies.  This involves reviewing query execution plans, which provide detailed information about how SQL Anywhere is processing the request. The plan shows the steps taken to retrieve data, including table scans, index lookups, and joins.  Bottlenecks often manifest as full table scans, indicating the absence of appropriate indexing or inefficient query formulation.

Once the bottlenecks are identified, the following strategies can be employed:

* **Indexing:** This is arguably the single most effective technique.  Appropriate indexes drastically reduce the amount of data SQL Anywhere needs to examine to answer a query.  Choosing the correct index type (B-tree, hash, etc.) and columns is critical. For example, composite indexes, combining multiple columns, are beneficial for queries involving multiple `WHERE` clause conditions.  Over-indexing, however, can negatively impact insert, update, and delete operations.  A balance needs to be struck between improved read performance and write performance overhead.

* **Query Optimization:** This involves rewriting queries to leverage database features efficiently.  Common optimizations include avoiding `SELECT *`, using appropriate join types (inner, left, right, full), optimizing `WHERE` clause conditions, and avoiding functions within `WHERE` clauses if they prevent the use of indexes.  The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) can often improve readability and potentially execution speed by allowing the database to optimize subqueries more effectively.

* **Data Partitioning:**  For very large datasets, partitioning allows the database to manage data more efficiently.  By distributing data across multiple physical files, queries can often be limited to specific partitions, greatly reducing processing time.  However, this requires careful planning and consideration of potential partitioning overhead.

* **Resource Allocation:** Ensuring sufficient server resources, including memory and CPU, is essential.  Insufficient resources can lead to performance degradation, regardless of query optimization efforts. Monitoring server performance and adjusting resource allocation as needed is a crucial ongoing task.

* **Database Statistics:** SQL Anywhere relies on statistics to estimate the cost of different query execution plans.  Outdated statistics can lead to suboptimal plan choices. Regularly updating database statistics is therefore essential for maintaining performance.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Illustrating the impact of indexing.**

Consider a table `Customers` with columns `CustomerID` (INT, primary key), `Name` (VARCHAR(255)), and `City` (VARCHAR(255)).  The following query without an index on `City` will likely perform poorly for large datasets:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = 'New York';
```

Adding an index on the `City` column significantly improves this:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IX_City ON Customers (City);
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = 'New York';
```

The execution plan will now show an index seek instead of a full table scan, dramatically reducing the time taken.

**Example 2:  Optimizing JOIN operations.**

Assume we have two tables, `Orders` (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate) and `Customers` (CustomerID, Name).  The following query might be inefficient:

```sql
SELECT o.OrderID, c.Name
FROM Orders o, Customers c
WHERE o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID;
```

Using explicit JOIN syntax and specifying the JOIN type provides better readability and enables the optimizer to choose the most efficient strategy:


```sql
SELECT o.OrderID, c.Name
FROM Orders o
INNER JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID;
```

An `INNER JOIN` only returns matching rows; consider `LEFT JOIN` or `RIGHT JOIN` if you need to include all rows from one table regardless of matches in the other.

**Example 3:  Improving `WHERE` clause efficiency.**

Consider a query using a function within the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE UPPER(ProductName) = 'WIDGET';
```

This prevents the use of an index on `ProductName`. Rewriting the query to avoid the function call can significantly improve performance:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductName = 'widget';
```

Alternatively, if case-insensitive matching is required and an index is crucial, create a functional index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IX_ProductName_Upper ON Products (UPPER(ProductName));
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE UPPER(ProductName) = 'WIDGET';
```

This allows efficient index lookup despite the function call in the `WHERE` clause.  However, remember that functional indexes have storage and maintenance overhead.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding, consult the official SQL Anywhere documentation.  It provides comprehensive details on query optimization techniques and best practices.  Consider exploring SQL Anywhere's built-in profiling tools to analyze query performance and identify specific bottlenecks.  Finally, investment in training on database administration and query optimization principles provides long-term benefits and prevents repeated performance issues.  Proficient use of database management tools is also crucial for effective monitoring and troubleshooting.
