The failure of a model to train when explicitly applying gradients often stems from a mismatch between the computed gradients and the model's internal state, specifically concerning weight update mechanisms and numerical stability.  In my experience debugging large-scale neural networks for image recognition, this manifested as seemingly inexplicable stagnation, despite apparent successful gradient computation.  The core issue isn't necessarily incorrect gradient calculation, but rather the improper handling of these gradients during the weight update phase.


**1. Explanation:**

The training process involves iteratively adjusting model parameters (weights and biases) based on the calculated gradients.  These gradients, representing the direction and magnitude of the error's influence on each parameter, are typically computed via backpropagation.  The process appears straightforward: compute the gradient, multiply it by a learning rate, and subtract the resulting value from the current weight. However, several subtle issues can derail this apparently simple procedure.

First, inconsistencies can arise from differing data types and precision.  Gradients computed using floating-point arithmetic (e.g., `float32`) can accumulate numerical errors, particularly in deep networks with numerous layers and complex operations. These small errors, when repeatedly compounded over many iterations, can lead to significant deviations from the true gradient, preventing effective training.  Second, improper handling of gradient accumulation can disrupt the optimization process.  If gradients from multiple batches or data points are not aggregated correctly before updating weights, the modelâ€™s parameters will be adjusted erratically. Third, the learning rate itself can play a crucial role.  An excessively large learning rate can lead to oscillations around the optimal solution, while a learning rate that's too small can result in painfully slow convergence or stagnation. Finally, the model architecture itself may contribute to training instability.  For example, poorly designed architectures, especially those with vanishing or exploding gradients, can hamper effective weight updates even with correctly computed gradients.

My experience troubleshooting this included instances where the calculated gradients were ostensibly correct, verified through independent checks, yet the model refused to learn. In those instances, the subtle inaccuracies introduced by the limited precision of floating-point numbers, coupled with an inappropriately chosen learning rate, proved to be the culprits.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential pitfalls and best practices for applying gradients during model training.  These examples assume a basic understanding of automatic differentiation and backpropagation.  Note that these examples employ simplified scenarios for illustrative purposes.


**Example 1: Incorrect Gradient Accumulation:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simplified model with one weight
weight = np.array([0.5], dtype=np.float32)

# Gradient calculation (simplified)
gradients = []
for i in range(3):
    gradient = np.array([i], dtype=np.float32)  # Simulate gradient calculation
    gradients.append(gradient)

# Incorrect accumulation: direct addition without consideration for scaling
accumulated_gradient = sum(gradients)

# Weight update (learning rate = 0.1)
weight -= 0.1 * accumulated_gradient

print(f"Weight after update: {weight}")
```
This example demonstrates how direct summation of gradients without proper scaling (e.g., averaging over batches) can lead to erratic weight updates.


**Example 2: Numerical Instability due to Data Type:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simplified model with one weight
weight = np.array([0.5], dtype=np.float64) # Higher Precision

# Gradient calculation (simplified)
gradients = []
for i in range(100000):
    gradient = np.array([1e-10], dtype=np.float64) #Small gradient
    gradients.append(gradient)

accumulated_gradient = np.mean(gradients, axis=0) #Correct Accumulation


# Weight update (learning rate = 1)
weight -= 1 * accumulated_gradient


print(f"Weight after update: {weight}")
```

This example highlights the importance of data types. Using higher precision (`float64`) can mitigate numerical instability resulting from the cumulative effect of many small gradient updates.  Here, the use of `np.mean` for averaging ensures correct accumulation.


**Example 3:  Adaptive Learning Rate:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simplified model with one weight
weight = np.array([0.5], dtype=np.float32)
learning_rate = 0.1

# Gradient calculation (simplified - example of a single gradient)
gradient = np.array([-0.2], dtype=np.float32)

#Adaptive Learning rate adjustment based on gradient magnitude:
# Simple example, replace with more sophisticated approaches like Adam, RMSprop etc.
if np.abs(gradient) > 0.5:
    learning_rate *= 0.5  # Reduce learning rate if gradient is large
elif np.abs(gradient) < 0.1:
    learning_rate *= 1.1 #Increase learning rate if gradient is small


# Weight update
weight -= learning_rate * gradient

print(f"Weight after update: {weight}, Learning Rate: {learning_rate}")
```

This example showcases the use of an adaptive learning rate, a common technique to improve training stability.  The learning rate is dynamically adjusted based on the gradient's magnitude; larger gradients lead to smaller learning rate steps to avoid overshooting, and smaller gradients lead to a larger learning rate to prevent slow convergence. This is a simplified example; more robust adaptive learning rate algorithms like Adam or RMSprop are generally preferred in practice.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend studying relevant sections in "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville, focusing on chapters covering backpropagation, optimization algorithms, and numerical computation.  Furthermore, exploring the mathematical foundations of gradient descent and its variants would prove beneficial.  Finally, examining the source code of established deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch can provide valuable insights into practical implementations of gradient-based training.
