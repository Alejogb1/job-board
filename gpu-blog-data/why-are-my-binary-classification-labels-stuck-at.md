In my experience debugging numerous PyTorch classification models, a consistently observed issue causing predicted labels to remain at 0, despite training, stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` functions in conjunction with model output. Specifically, it is imperative to remember `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` expects raw, unnormalized *logits* as input, not probability distributions. Failing to provide logits, particularly when using a softmax activation *within* the model itself, can lead to this “stuck at zero” phenomenon. The loss function's internal calculation of softmax combined with the natural log effectively negates the probabilities, often creating numerically unstable gradients that halt learning and drive predicted classifications towards a single, dominant class (typically the zero-indexed one).

Let’s examine this issue through a step-by-step explanation. Firstly, a binary classification problem, while conceptually straightforward, still benefits from using `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, despite having only two classes. This is because the function efficiently manages both the softmax and negative log-likelihood calculation. Crucially, it assumes that the input is a tensor of unnormalized scores. These scores, or logits, represent the model's confidence in each class *before* any probability normalization. When using `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` with two classes, one would typically expect a tensor of shape `(batch_size, 2)`, where each row holds the raw score for the "negative" class and the "positive" class respectively.

The problem arises when the model output already incorporates a softmax layer. If the model’s final layer is, for example, `nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(input_dim, 2), nn.Softmax(dim=1))`, the output from this module is already a probability distribution between 0 and 1. `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` takes this probability distribution, applies an *internal* softmax and natural log, effectively undoing the model's softmax, creating an unstable situation during the backpropagation. The gradients become near zero or highly inconsistent, leading to minimal to no weight updates and the classifier remains non-functional and tends to assign everything to a single, usually the zero-index class, or “negative” class. This results in the loss hovering at a high, unchanging value.

Let's illustrate this using code examples. Consider a naive model structure designed for binary classification, coupled with a training loop:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Generate dummy data
X_train = torch.randn(100, 10)
y_train = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))

train_dataset = TensorDataset(X_train, y_train)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=10)

# Incorrect Model structure - includes softmax
class IncorrectBinaryClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 2),
            nn.Softmax(dim=1)  # Incorrect application of softmax within the model
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)

model = IncorrectBinaryClassifier(10)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()


# Training Loop
for epoch in range(5):
    for inputs, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

# Check Predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    test_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
    prediction = model(test_input)
    print(f"Predicted probablities: {prediction}")
    predicted_class = torch.argmax(prediction, dim=1)
    print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}")
```

In the above example, the `IncorrectBinaryClassifier` includes a softmax operation as the final activation. This means the output of the model `outputs` represents a probability distribution, not logits. When passed to `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` it creates the instability explained before, and the loss will be large and unchanging, and the predicted class will almost certainly be zero.

To correct this, the softmax layer needs to be removed from the model itself and the loss function `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` needs to be provided with raw logits. This will allow the `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` to perform its intended softmax and calculate the cross-entropy. Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
# Correct Model Structure - removes softmax
class CorrectBinaryClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = nn.Linear(input_dim, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)  # Output raw logits

model = CorrectBinaryClassifier(10)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(5):
    for inputs, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

# Check Predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    test_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
    prediction = model(test_input)
    print(f"Predicted Logits: {prediction}")

    probabilities = torch.softmax(prediction, dim=1)
    print(f"Predicted probablities: {probabilities}")
    predicted_class = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=1)
    print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}")
```

Notice that we have removed `nn.Softmax(dim=1)` from within the model class and the prediction has been done with the `torch.softmax` function. The model now outputs raw logits and `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` performs the softmax and calculates the loss correctly. As a result the classifier should now learn and predict.

Finally, it can be useful to examine when using `torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`. This loss function is specifically designed for binary classification and expects logits as input, just like `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, however, its expectation is slightly different when it comes to the target labels. `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` expects target labels to have the same shape as the logit output. Instead of class indexes such as `[0, 1, 0, 1]`, it expects `[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]` or similar shaped target tensors, representing the probability of the output. This can be seen in the following example:

```python
# Correct usage with nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss
class BinaryClassifierBCE(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = nn.Linear(input_dim, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
      return self.model(x).squeeze() # Output single logit for positive class

model = BinaryClassifierBCE(10)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(5):
    for inputs, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        labels = labels.float() # convert to tensor of floats
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels) # Loss expects same shape as output
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

# Check Predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    test_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
    prediction = model(test_input)
    print(f"Predicted logit: {prediction}")

    probability = torch.sigmoid(prediction)
    print(f"Predicted probability: {probability}")

    predicted_class = (probability > 0.5).int()
    print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}")
```
The `BinaryClassifierBCE` model now only outputs one logit value. `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` expects a target tensor of the same shape as the output and expects these to be either 0.0 or 1.0 floating point values. Therefore the target labels need to be converted to a floating point tensor. The sigmoid function has been used on the output to calculate probability.

In summary, the core issue of `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` consistently producing only 0 predictions in a binary classification problem is generally caused by feeding pre-normalized probability distributions (obtained after the model has performed softmax) instead of raw logits. Always ensure that when using `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` or `nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` , the final model output is a tensor of logits.

For further study, I would recommend exploring the official PyTorch documentation on `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, `torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`, and the detailed tutorials focused on classification. I also find research articles on activation functions and proper network output scaling to be invaluable for a robust understanding. Books covering deep learning concepts such as "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville provide extensive background on the underlying mathematical principles.
