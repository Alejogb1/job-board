Nailgun's efficiency stems from its ability to maintain a persistent JVM instance, eliminating the JVM startup overhead inherent in repeatedly executing Java programs.  This is particularly advantageous when invoking Java tools frequently, such as during a build process or interactive development workflow.  My experience integrating Nailgun into large-scale build systems for Android applications highlighted its significant performance improvements.  Let's address its implementation on Debian Stretch.

**1.  Explanation:**

Nailgun operates by establishing a client-server architecture. The server, a persistent Java Virtual Machine process, listens for incoming requests. Clients, typically scripts or build tools, communicate with the server, sending the Java class to execute and any necessary arguments.  The server executes the code within its pre-existing JVM, returns the output, and remains available for subsequent requests. This contrasts with the traditional approach of launching a new JVM for each execution, which incurs considerable latency.

On Debian Stretch, installing Nailgun involves several steps. First, ensure the required Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed. Debian Stretch, being a rather old distribution, might require manual repository addition for newer JDK versions.  Secondly, download the Nailgun server and client from the official source.  The server is then started as a background process, typically using a systemd service for stability and automatic restarts. The client, a small executable, is then invoked to send Java class execution requests to the server.

The crucial aspect lies in properly configuring the Nailgun server, specifically handling environment variables, classpaths, and potential security implications. Improper configuration can lead to unexpected behavior, classpath resolution failures, or security vulnerabilities.  I have personally encountered issues stemming from incorrect setting of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` when integrating Nailgun with native libraries used in some of my Java projects.  Careful consideration must be given to the server's permissions and its interaction with the system environment.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Simple Hello World**

```java
// HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world from Nailgun!");
    }
}
```

To execute this with Nailgun, first compile it:  `javac HelloWorld.java`. Then, using the Nailgun client (assuming it's in your PATH): `nailgun HelloWorld`.  This command sends the compiled `HelloWorld.class` to the Nailgun server for execution. The output, "Hello, world from Nailgun!", will be displayed on the console.  Note that the classpath needs no explicit specification for simple programs like this; the Nailgun server correctly resolves the location of the compiled class.

**Example 2: Handling Arguments**

```java
// ArgProcessor.java
public class ArgProcessor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length > 0) {
            System.out.println("Received arguments: " + String.join(", ", args));
        } else {
            System.out.println("No arguments received.");
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates argument handling. Compile it as before.  Executing  `nailgun ArgProcessor arg1 arg2 arg3` will print "Received arguments: arg1, arg2, arg3".  This showcases Nailgun's ability to seamlessly pass arguments from the client to the server, facilitating interaction with the Java program.  The server correctly interprets and delivers these arguments to the `main` method.


**Example 3: Utilizing External Libraries (More Advanced)**

```java
// LibraryUser.java
import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils; // Example library

public class LibraryUser {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = StringUtils.isBlank(args[0]) ? "Default Input" : args[0];
        System.out.println("Processed input: " + StringUtils.reverse(input));
    }
}
```

This program requires the Apache Commons Lang library.  This illustrates a more complex scenario.  Before compiling, ensure the Apache Commons Lang JAR is accessible. One approach is to set the `CLASSPATH` environment variable before compilation and execution of the `nailgun` client command, ensuring the Nailgun server can find the required libraries within the classpath environment. For instance: `export CLASSPATH=/path/to/commons-lang3-3.12.0.jar:$CLASSPATH; javac LibraryUser.java; nailgun LibraryUser "This is a test"`

The output will be "tset a si sihT Processed input:". This highlights Nailgun's ability to manage programs reliant on external libraries, a critical feature for real-world Java applications.  Failure to properly set the classpath during compilation or server startup will result in `ClassNotFoundException`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, consult the official Nailgun documentation.  Reviewing systemd service configuration guides for Debian will be crucial for ensuring robust server operation.  Understanding Java classpath mechanisms is essential for managing dependencies in more complex applications. A comprehensive Java textbook covering advanced topics such as classloading will prove beneficial. Finally,  familiarity with shell scripting, particularly for managing environment variables and launching processes, will improve the integration of Nailgun into your workflows.
