MobileNetV2, when used out-of-the-box from TensorFlow Hub or the Keras Applications API, often appears to lack explicit categorical output layers despite being trained for image classification. This omission stems from the transfer learning paradigm that underpins its typical usage, rather than a flaw in the model itself. The pre-trained model, readily available, has a classification layer – usually a fully connected layer followed by a softmax – removed, leaving users with feature embeddings rather than class probabilities. I've encountered this situation frequently when adapting pre-trained models for custom tasks.

The core of MobileNetV2, and indeed most convolutional neural networks for image processing, is the feature extraction stage. This stage, composed of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and activation functions, progressively transforms the input image into a high-dimensional, abstract representation. Think of it as distilling the essential visual information from an image into a set of numbers. When the model is trained on ImageNet, the classification layer that follows is fine-tuned to map these features to the 1000 ImageNet categories. However, for transfer learning, where we aim to leverage this pre-trained feature extractor for different classification problems, this classification layer is generally irrelevant or inadequate. We might want to classify images into a few custom categories or even use the embeddings for non-classification tasks such as similarity matching.

TensorFlow’s pre-trained models from both TensorFlow Hub and Keras Applications are designed to facilitate this flexibility. Instead of providing the fully trained model with classification outputs, they truncate the network at the last global average pooling layer. This means the output is a 1280-dimensional feature vector, often referred to as the bottleneck feature representation for MobileNetV2. This approach provides two advantages: it reduces the size of the pre-trained model and gives developers complete freedom to add a custom classification layer suitable for their specific use case. This output also captures the learned representation from training on the original data without bias toward the specific classification problem.

Let me demonstrate with some code examples. First, accessing MobileNetV2 from TensorFlow Hub:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
import numpy as np

# Load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model from TensorFlow Hub
module_url = "https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/feature_vector/4"
model = hub.KerasLayer(module_url)

# Create a dummy input tensor of shape (1, 224, 224, 3)
input_image = np.random.rand(1, 224, 224, 3).astype(np.float32)

# Pass the dummy input through the model
output_features = model(input_image)

# Print the shape of the output
print(f"Output feature shape: {output_features.shape}") # Output: Output feature shape: (1, 1280)
```

In this first example, the TensorFlow Hub model outputs a tensor with a shape of (1, 1280). This 1280-dimensional vector represents the features extracted from the input image. There are no class probabilities here. If I want to build a classifier, I need to add a new layer that maps these 1280 features to my desired classes.

Here's a second example where I use Keras Applications to load MobileNetV2:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GlobalAveragePooling2D
import numpy as np

# Load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model without the classification layer
base_model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Apply global average pooling to get the feature vectors
pooling_layer = GlobalAveragePooling2D()

# Create a dummy input tensor
input_image = np.random.rand(1, 224, 224, 3).astype(np.float32)

# Pass the dummy input through the feature extractor and pooling layer
feature_vector = pooling_layer(base_model(input_image))

# Print the shape of the output
print(f"Output feature shape: {feature_vector.shape}") # Output: Output feature shape: (1, 1280)

```

The `include_top=False` argument in `MobileNetV2()` ensures that the top classification layer is excluded. Additionally, global average pooling is explicitly added to obtain the feature representation. Again, the output is a (1, 1280) tensor representing the encoded image. The key point here is that the `include_top=False` argument is the common way to remove that final classification layer.

Finally, I can build a simple classification model by adding custom dense layers to the output from MobileNetV2:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNetV2
from tensorflow.keras.layers import GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import numpy as np

# Load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model without the classification layer
base_model = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
pooling_layer = GlobalAveragePooling2D()

# Define the classification layer
num_classes = 10
dense_layer = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')

# Build the custom model
inputs = base_model.input
features = pooling_layer(base_model.output)
outputs = dense_layer(features)
custom_model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

# Create a dummy input tensor
input_image = np.random.rand(1, 224, 224, 3).astype(np.float32)

# Get the output probabilities from custom model
class_probabilities = custom_model(input_image)
print(f"Output probabilities shape: {class_probabilities.shape}") # Output: Output probabilities shape: (1, 10)

```
Here, we take the feature extractor from the previous example, and append a `Dense` layer, initialized with random weights, and a `softmax` activation to generate the class probabilities for a 10-class problem. Now the model can provide outputs that are more suitable for our task.

In summary, the absence of explicit category outputs in pre-trained MobileNetV2 models is a deliberate design choice to facilitate transfer learning. The models are truncated to output generic feature embeddings, empowering developers to tailor the final classification layers to their unique requirements.  To work with these models for image classification tasks, one needs to add a new fully connected layer or layers to adapt these embeddings for the specific classes.

For those seeking to deepen their understanding of this process, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation for both TensorFlow Hub and Keras Applications. In particular, the pages detailing model loading and custom layer integration. Furthermore, the literature on transfer learning and fine-tuning of deep convolutional networks can prove invaluable. The seminal paper on MobileNetV2 will also offer insights into its architecture and design choices. Numerous online courses covering deep learning with TensorFlow will also be useful, particularly those with hands-on exercises. I've found these resources and a good grasp of the concepts of transfer learning and embedding spaces key to successfully using these powerful pre-trained models.
