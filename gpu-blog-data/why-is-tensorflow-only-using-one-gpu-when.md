TensorFlow's utilization of a single GPU during gradient computation, even with multiple GPUs available, often stems from a mismatch between the model's distribution strategy and the underlying hardware configuration, or a failure to properly configure data parallelism.  In my experience debugging large-scale training pipelines, this has been the source of performance bottlenecks more frequently than hardware limitations.  The core issue usually lies in the incorrect specification of the `strategy` object used within the `tf.distribute.Strategy` API.


**1.  Explanation: Data Parallelism and Strategy Selection**

Efficient multi-GPU training in TensorFlow hinges on data parallelism, a technique that distributes the training dataset across multiple GPUs.  Each GPU processes a subset of the data, computes gradients on its local batch, and then these gradients are aggregated to update the shared model parameters.  However, simply having multiple GPUs does not automatically enable data parallelism; it requires explicit configuration within the TensorFlow code.

The `tf.distribute.Strategy` API provides various strategies for distributing computation across multiple devices.  The choice of strategy significantly impacts GPU utilization.  For example, the `MirroredStrategy` replicates the model across all available GPUs and synchronously updates the model parameters after each batch. This is often the default choice and is generally suitable for homogeneous GPU setups.  However, if not configured correctly, or if there are underlying hardware or software conflicts, `MirroredStrategy` might default to a single GPU.  Conversely, using a strategy like `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` is necessary when training across multiple machines, each with multiple GPUs.  Incorrect application of this strategy can also lead to single-GPU utilization.

Furthermore, the environment variables and TensorFlow's internal device placement algorithms play a role.  If there are conflicts in device assignment (for instance, due to resource constraints on one GPU or mismatched CUDA versions), TensorFlow might fall back to using only a single GPU to avoid errors.  This is why careful monitoring of resource utilization and error messages is crucial during debugging.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate correct and incorrect ways to utilize multiple GPUs in TensorFlow for gradient computation.

**Example 1: Correct Usage of `MirroredStrategy`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
  ])
  model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                loss=tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
                metrics=['accuracy'])

  # Load and pre-process your data here...
  (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
  x_train = x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
  x_test = x_test.reshape(10000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
  y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
  y_test = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)

  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

This code snippet correctly uses `MirroredStrategy` to distribute the model across available GPUs.  The crucial line is `with strategy.scope():`, which ensures that all model creation and training operations occur within the scope of the chosen distribution strategy.  This is essential for proper device placement and gradient aggregation.

**Example 2: Incorrect Usage â€“ Missing `strategy.scope()`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

model = tf.keras.Sequential([ # Model created OUTSIDE the strategy scope!
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... data loading and preprocessing as in Example 1 ...

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

This example demonstrates a common mistake.  The model is created *outside* the `strategy.scope()`.  Therefore, TensorFlow might place the model on a single GPU, leading to single-GPU training despite the `MirroredStrategy`. The gradient calculations will be confined to that single device.

**Example 3:  Handling Potential Resource Conflicts**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = "0,1" # Specify visible GPUs

try:
    strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
    # ... (Rest of the code as in Example 1) ...
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error during MirroredStrategy initialization: {e}")
    print("Falling back to single GPU.")
    strategy = tf.distribute.OneDeviceStrategy(device="/gpu:0")
    # ... (Rest of the code, adapted for single-GPU use) ...

```
This example demonstrates a more robust approach by handling potential `RuntimeError` exceptions that can occur during `MirroredStrategy` initialization due to resource conflicts or driver issues. It gracefully falls back to a single-GPU strategy if the distributed strategy fails.  The `os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES']` line explicitly sets which GPUs TensorFlow should consider.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow's distributed training capabilities, I strongly advise consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections dedicated to distributed training and the `tf.distribute` API.  Reviewing tutorials and examples focused on multi-GPU training with `MirroredStrategy` and `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` is essential.  Furthermore, familiarizing yourself with CUDA and cuDNN programming concepts and troubleshooting techniques will prove invaluable for resolving GPU-related issues.  Understanding the interplay between TensorFlow and the underlying CUDA runtime is key to optimizing performance and diagnosing problems.  Finally, utilize TensorFlow's profiling tools to analyze the performance characteristics of your training pipeline to pinpoint bottlenecks.
