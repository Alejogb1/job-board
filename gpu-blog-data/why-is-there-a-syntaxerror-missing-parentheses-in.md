The `SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in 'print' call` encountered during Airflow installation almost invariably stems from Python 2 versus Python 3 interpreter incompatibility.  My experience troubleshooting numerous Airflow deployments across diverse environments, from embedded systems to large-scale cloud clusters, reveals this as the most common culprit. Airflow's reliance on Python necessitates a clear understanding of Python's versioning and its implications for core language features.  The `print` statement underwent a significant change between Python 2 and Python 3; in Python 2, `print` is a statement, whereas in Python 3, it's a function requiring parentheses.  Therefore, code written for Python 2 will inherently fail in a Python 3 environment if the `print` function is used without the necessary parentheses.  This is precisely the context of the error message you're observing.


**Explanation:**

The error arises because the Airflow installation process, or a script within it, attempts to execute Python 2 code using a Python 3 interpreter.  This can occur in several ways:

1. **Incorrect Python version specified:** The system environment may be configured to use Python 3, yet the Airflow installation process might unintentionally call a Python 2 interpreter. This often happens when multiple Python versions are present, and the system's `PATH` environment variable is not properly set.

2. **Legacy code within Airflow dependencies:**  The Airflow installation itself, or one of its extensive dependencies, might contain legacy Python 2 code. While less common in recent Airflow versions, it's still possible for older or poorly maintained plugins to trigger this issue.

3. **Inconsistent virtual environment setup:**  When using virtual environments, a critical aspect of managing Python dependencies, a failure to properly activate the intended Python environment can lead to the use of an incorrect interpreter. The system's default Python interpreter might be Python 3, while the virtual environment set up for Airflow uses Python 2 (or vice-versa), resulting in the syntax error.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Python 2 Code (Incorrect in Python 3)**

```python
print "Hello, world!" # This will cause the SyntaxError in Python 3
```

This code, valid in Python 2, will result in a `SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in 'print' call` when executed in a Python 3 environment. The solution involves simply adding parentheses:

```python
print("Hello, world!") # Correct syntax for Python 3
```

**Example 2: Illustrative Error within a Custom Airflow Operator:**

Imagine a custom Airflow operator – a common extension to extend Airflow functionality – which inadvertently uses the Python 2 `print` statement:

```python
from airflow.models import BaseOperator
from airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults

class MyCustomOperator(BaseOperator):
    @apply_defaults
    def __init__(self, my_variable, *args, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomOperator, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.my_variable = my_variable

    def execute(self, context):
        print self.my_variable # This will cause the error in Python 3
        return True
```

Here, the `print` statement lacks parentheses.  The corrected version:


```python
from airflow.models import BaseOperator
from airflow.utils.decorators import apply_defaults

class MyCustomOperator(BaseOperator):
    @apply_defaults
    def __init__(self, my_variable, *args, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomOperator, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.my_variable = my_variable

    def execute(self, context):
        print(self.my_variable) # Corrected syntax
        return True
```

**Example 3:  Python 2 shebang in Airflow DAG File:**

Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) files are Python scripts that define the workflow.  A wrongly specified shebang (the `#!/usr/bin/env python2` line) at the beginning of the file will force the use of Python 2, regardless of the system's default Python version:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python2  # Incorrect shebang

from airflow import DAG
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(dag_id='my_dag', start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 26), schedule=None, catchup=False) as dag:
    # ... DAG tasks ...
    print "DAG execution started" # This would work in Python 2 but fail in Python 3
```

The correct shebang should point to the appropriate Python 3 interpreter,  for example: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.   Then ensuring all print statements within the DAG utilize the function call syntax.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Python 2 vs. Python 3 differences, I strongly recommend consulting the official Python documentation for both versions.  Furthermore, a comprehensive guide to Airflow's architecture and best practices will prove invaluable in preventing similar issues during installation and development.  Lastly, reviewing the Airflow installation guide for your specific operating system is crucial for understanding environment configuration and virtual environment management.  Pay close attention to the Python version requirements specified in the documentation.  Understanding virtual environments and package managers (like `pip` or `conda`) is also key to properly managing Python dependencies and preventing conflicts.
