The core challenge in reshaping a 2D PyTorch tensor into three dimensions lies in understanding the inherent dimensionality and the desired output structure.  A crucial consideration is the total number of elements, which must remain constant throughout the transformation.  Failing to account for this will lead to errors, commonly `RuntimeError: shape '[… ]' is invalid for input of size […]`.  My experience debugging these issues, primarily stemming from projects involving image processing and time-series analysis, reinforces the importance of careful consideration of element count and the intended shape's implications.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Reshaping a 2D tensor in PyTorch involves re-interpreting the existing data within a new dimensional arrangement.  Given a 2D tensor of shape `(H, W)`, where H represents the height and W the width, transforming it into a 3D tensor requires explicitly defining the new dimensions.  The common approach is to introduce a new dimension representing either channels, depth, or a similar concept, depending on the application.  The final shape will typically be expressed as `(D, H, W)`, where D represents the newly added dimension.  The value of D is constrained by the original size:  `D * H * W = total_elements`. If `D` cannot evenly divide the total number of elements, the operation will fail.  Consequently, careful calculation and selection of `D` are necessary. Several PyTorch functions facilitate this process, primarily `view()` and `reshape()`.  `view()` returns a view of the original tensor, sharing underlying data, while `reshape()` may return a copy depending on memory considerations.  Choosing between them depends on memory efficiency considerations. If memory is tight, and the operation can be performed in-place, `view()` is preferred.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Adding a Channel Dimension**

This example illustrates adding a channel dimension often necessary when dealing with grayscale images.  A grayscale image is inherently 2D (height, width), but many PyTorch models expect a 3D input (channels, height, width), where the channel dimension represents the single grayscale channel.

```python
import torch

# Original 2D tensor representing a grayscale image
grayscale_image = torch.randn(28, 28)  # Example: 28x28 grayscale image

# Add a channel dimension using unsqueeze()
# unsqueeze(0) adds a dimension at index 0, hence before height
image_with_channel = grayscale_image.unsqueeze(0)

print("Original shape:", grayscale_image.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([28, 28])
print("Reshaped shape:", image_with_channel.shape) # Output: torch.Size([1, 28, 28])

#Verification: Check total elements remain the same.
assert grayscale_image.numel() == image_with_channel.numel()
```

`unsqueeze()` provides a concise and efficient way to add a singleton dimension without directly specifying the target shape. This is particularly useful for adding channel dimensions.  The assertion verifies data integrity.  The added channel contains just one value for the grayscale image.


**Example 2: Reshaping using `view()`**

This example demonstrates using `view()` for a more complex reshape operation. Here, we transform a 2D tensor into a 3D tensor with a specified depth.  `view()` is chosen here because it is highly efficient for this kind of operation and will return a view, rather than copy, of the original tensor.

```python
import torch

# Original 2D tensor
tensor_2d = torch.arange(24).reshape(6, 4)

# Reshape to 3D tensor (D, H, W)
# Calculating D to ensure the total number of elements remain the same.
d = 2
h = 6
w = 4
tensor_3d = tensor_2d.view(2, 6, 2) #We reshape into (2, 6, 2) instead of (2, 6, 4) to show error handling


try:
    tensor_3d = tensor_2d.view(d, h, w)  #Attempt to create a 3D view with the wrong dimension.
    print("Reshaped tensor (Incorrect D value):", tensor_3d)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

tensor_3d = tensor_2d.view(3,2,4) # Correct dimensions.
print("Reshaped tensor (Correct D value):", tensor_3d)
assert tensor_2d.numel() == tensor_3d.numel()
```

This example highlights the importance of checking for the correct total number of elements.  The `try-except` block elegantly handles potential `RuntimeError` exceptions, enhancing robustness.


**Example 3: Reshaping using `reshape()`**

This example uses `reshape()`, emphasizing its ability to handle more complex reshaping scenarios, even those involving contiguous memory layouts.  The difference from `view()` is subtle here, but in larger tensors, `reshape()` might return a copy to maintain contiguous memory if necessary.

```python
import torch

# Original 2D tensor
tensor_2d = torch.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)

# Reshape to a 3D tensor (Depth, Height, Width)
tensor_3d = tensor_2d.reshape(2, 3, 2)

print("Original shape:", tensor_2d.shape) # Output: torch.Size([3, 4])
print("Reshaped shape:", tensor_3d.shape) # Output: torch.Size([2, 3, 2])

#Verification: Check total elements remain the same.
assert tensor_2d.numel() == tensor_3d.numel()

# Demonstrate that reshape can also handle changes that are not easily done with view
tensor_3d_2 = tensor_2d.reshape(4, 3) #reshape to a different 2d tensor with same dimensions.
print("Alternative Reshape:", tensor_3d_2.shape) #Output: torch.Size([4, 3])
```

This showcases `reshape()`'s flexibility.  It handles reshaping to different dimensions, potentially requiring data copying, unlike `view()`, which requires dimensions to be compatible with the original memory layout.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation is invaluable.  A strong grasp of linear algebra fundamentals is crucial.  Exploring introductory materials on tensor manipulation and reshaping techniques will significantly aid understanding.  Furthermore, working through practical examples, similar to those presented, within a Jupyter Notebook environment facilitates interactive learning and experimentation.  Finally, becoming comfortable with debugging PyTorch code, particularly errors related to tensor shapes and memory allocation, is vital for efficient problem-solving.
