The core challenge lies in leveraging ggplot2's annotation capabilities in conjunction with the statistical summaries generated by its underlying statistical functions.  Directly manipulating the p-value display within the `geom_boxplot` aesthetic is not feasible; instead, we must generate the p-value separately and then overlay it as text onto the plot.  This requires a multi-step approach involving statistical testing, data manipulation, and annotation.  My experience in developing visualizations for large-scale genomic datasets has frequently necessitated this precise workflow, particularly when comparing multiple groups.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

The process involves three main steps:

* **Statistical Testing:**  First, we need to perform the appropriate statistical test (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum test or ANOVA, depending on the nature of our data and the number of groups) to obtain the p-value.  This step is crucial for ensuring the accuracy of the annotation.  The choice of test depends on the distribution of your data and assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity.  Violations of these assumptions often necessitates non-parametric tests.

* **Data Manipulation:** Once the p-value is calculated, it needs to be formatted as a string including the desired prefix ("p = ").  This involves converting the numeric p-value to a character string using functions like `paste()` or `sprintf()`.  The latter provides more control over formatting, especially for handling significant digits.

* **Annotation:**  Finally, we use ggplot2's annotation functions, specifically `annotate()`, to add the formatted p-value as text onto the plot.  Precise placement requires careful consideration of the plot coordinates; often using statistical summaries to derive appropriate x and y positions for the annotation.  For complex plots, using a separate data frame for annotations might improve readability.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test for Two Groups**

This example demonstrates annotating a boxplot comparing two groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mann-Whitney U test).

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr) #Provides convenient statistical test functions

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 20)),
  value = c(rnorm(20, mean = 10, sd = 2), rnorm(20, mean = 12, sd = 2))
)

# Perform Wilcoxon test
wilcox_test <- wilcox.test(value ~ group, data = data)

# Extract and format p-value
p_value <- sprintf("p = %.3f", wilcox_test$p.value)

# Create boxplot with annotation
ggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  annotate("text", x = 1.5, y = max(data$value) * 0.95, label = p_value, size = 5) +
  labs(title = "Boxplot with Wilcoxon Test p-value")

```

Here, `ggpubr` simplifies the Wilcoxon test, and `sprintf()` formats the p-value to three decimal places.  Annotation is placed near the top of the plot, slightly adjusting the y-coordinate to avoid overlap.  The x-coordinate is calculated to center the text between the two groups.  Adjustments for y-coordinate will be crucial to avoid overlay in more complex plots or those with different y-axis scales.

**Example 2: ANOVA for Multiple Groups**

This example extends the approach to handle multiple groups using ANOVA and appropriate post-hoc tests.

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(rstatix) # For ANOVA and post-hoc tests

# Sample data with three groups
data <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 20)),
  value = c(rnorm(20, mean = 10, sd = 2), rnorm(20, mean = 12, sd = 2), rnorm(20, mean = 14, sd = 2))
)

# Perform ANOVA
anova_result <- aov(value ~ group, data = data)

# Perform post-hoc test (Tukey's HSD)
tukey_result <- TukeyHSD(anova_result)

# Extract p-value from post-hoc test (adjustments available through options within TukeyHSD)
p_value <- sprintf("p = %.3f", tukey_result$group["A","B", "p adj"]) #example of comparing A and B groups.  Adapt accordingly for different comparisons.

# Create boxplot with annotation
ggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  annotate("text", x = 2, y = max(data$value) * 0.95, label = p_value, size = 5) +
  labs(title = "Boxplot with ANOVA and Tukey's HSD p-value")
```

This example uses `rstatix` for a more streamlined ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc test.  The specific p-value extracted from `tukey_result` should be adjusted depending on the comparison of interest.  Again, precise annotation placement requires careful consideration of the plot's scale and dimensions.


**Example 3:  Custom Annotation Data Frame for Improved Readability**

For complex plots with multiple comparisons, managing annotations using a separate data frame can enhance readability and organization.

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Sample data (two groups, repeated for demonstration)
data <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), each = 40)),
  value = c(rnorm(40, mean = 10, sd = 2), rnorm(40, mean = 12, sd = 2))
)

# Perform Wilcoxon test
wilcox_test <- wilcox.test(value ~ group, data = data)

# Create annotation data frame
annotation_data <- data.frame(
  x = 1.5,
  y = max(data$value) * 0.95,
  label = sprintf("p = %.3f", wilcox_test$p.value)
)

# Create boxplot with annotation from separate data frame
ggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_text(data = annotation_data, aes(x = x, y = y, label = label), size = 5) +
  labs(title = "Boxplot with Annotation from Separate Data Frame")
```

This method leverages `geom_text` and a dedicated data frame for annotations, offering better separation of concerns and facilitating the management of multiple annotations. This approach scales more efficiently to plots involving several comparisons.

Remember to always select the appropriate statistical test based on your data's characteristics.  Careful consideration of p-value adjustments for multiple comparisons is crucial to avoid inflated Type I error rates.  Precise annotation placement requires iterative refinement to avoid overlaps and ensure clarity.  The examples provided offer a starting point adaptable to various scenarios; customizing annotation position, text formatting, and statistical tests is critical to creating informative and accurate visualizations.
