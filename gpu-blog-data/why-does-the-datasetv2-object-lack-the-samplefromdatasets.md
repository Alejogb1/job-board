DatasetV2's design, specifically its focus on lazy evaluation and graph-based transformations, inherently precludes a method like 'sample_from_datasets' in the manner one might expect from a more eagerly evaluated dataset representation. My experience migrating several complex machine learning pipelines from TensorFlow 1.x to TensorFlow 2 has highlighted this fundamental architectural shift and its ramifications for data handling.

The key difference stems from the core design principles: TensorFlow 1.x's `tf.data.Dataset` often operated more akin to traditional Python iterables, facilitating operations like sampling a subset readily. In contrast, `DatasetV2` within TensorFlow 2 is not a container of actual data but rather a blueprint for a computation graph. This graph describes how data is loaded, transformed, and eventually provided to the model. The datasets themselves are essentially nodes in this graph. Directly sampling from multiple input datasets prior to graph execution would fundamentally conflict with this lazy-execution, graph-based paradigm.

The function ‘sample_from_datasets’ implies a need to concurrently access and iterate through multiple datasets, typically to combine elements in some fashion (e.g., interleaved sampling or weighted selection).  If we directly sampled from different datasets using eager Python-like iteration, as might be attempted with a hypothetical `dataset.sample_from_datasets()`, the benefits of deferred execution and graph optimization provided by DatasetV2 are lost. The framework is designed to perform these data manipulations as a unified part of the overall computational graph, leveraging optimizations at the framework level. Therefore, directly sampling prior to that point does not fit the operational framework.

To achieve the desired effect of sampling from multiple datasets, one needs to think in terms of graph-based operations that the DatasetV2 API provides. Instead of using a single magical function, we use combinations of the available DatasetV2 methods. Consider the common scenario of needing to interleave elements from two distinct datasets:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming dataset1 and dataset2 have been created as tf.data.Dataset objects
dataset1 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.range(10))
dataset2 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.range(10, 20))

# Interleave elements from dataset1 and dataset2
interleaved_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.zip((dataset1, dataset2)).flat_map(
    lambda a, b: tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([a, b])
)


for element in interleaved_dataset.take(6): # Limit the output to 6 elements for example
    print(element)

```
In this example, `tf.data.Dataset.zip()` combines corresponding elements from the two datasets into tuples. The `flat_map` then transforms each tuple into a new dataset and combines those new datasets. This has the effect of outputting one element from dataset1, then one element from dataset2, and so on.  This is analogous to an interleaved sampling strategy, without directly violating the graph's lazy execution. The ‘interleaving’ itself is part of the defined computational graph.

Consider another case,  where you want to select datasets based on a probability distribution. This may mimic a situation where different datasets hold data of differing importance or quantity:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

dataset1 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.range(10))
dataset2 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.range(10, 20))
dataset3 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.range(20, 30))
datasets = [dataset1, dataset2, dataset3]

# Define the probability of selecting each dataset
dataset_probs = [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]

# Create a choice dataset.
choice_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.random.categorical(tf.math.log([dataset_probs]), num_samples=100))
choice_dataset = choice_dataset.map(lambda x: tf.cast(x, tf.int32))

# Use experimental.choose_from_datasets to select from datasets
chosen_dataset = tf.data.experimental.choose_from_datasets(datasets, choice_dataset)

for i, element in enumerate(chosen_dataset.take(10)): # Limit output to 10 for example
   print(f"Output {i}: {element}")

```

Here, `tf.data.experimental.choose_from_datasets()` allows the dynamic selection of data from a list of datasets based on the `choice_dataset`, with a random selection driven by probabilities defined in  `dataset_probs`. Again, the selection is an operation within the computation graph; no manual sampling occurs in the Python environment.

A final illustration pertains to situations requiring a mix of different input datasets but where their processing is also different. For this, the `tf.data.Dataset.concatenate()` method combined with careful processing pipelines before concatenation becomes useful. Imagine two datasets, one with images and another with corresponding text descriptions:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data; in real applications, image paths, text paths etc., would be used.
image_data = np.random.rand(10, 32, 32, 3) # 10 random images
text_data = [f"text {i}" for i in range(10)]

image_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(image_data)
text_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(text_data)

def process_image(image):
    # Image preprocessing as needed
    image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, dtype=tf.float32)
    return image

def process_text(text):
    # Text processing (e.g., tokenization)
    return tf.strings.split(text).to_tensor()

processed_image_dataset = image_dataset.map(process_image)
processed_text_dataset = text_dataset.map(process_text)

# Create the joint dataset by combining data with the same structure
zipped_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.zip((processed_image_dataset, processed_text_dataset))

for image, text in zipped_dataset.take(3):
    print(f"Image shape: {image.shape}, Text: {text}")

```

In this example, the data from the images and texts is not directly mixed; it is prepared using individual processing pipelines via `map()` before being combined into a new dataset with the same structure using `zip()`. The combination via `zip` implies that the overall dataset size matches the size of the smallest input dataset. In more advanced uses, these individual processed datasets can be combined with techniques mentioned above (`choose_from_datasets`).

In summary, the absence of `sample_from_datasets` in DatasetV2 isn't a deficiency but rather a consequence of its fundamentally different design. Instead of direct sampling, one employs `tf.data.Dataset` transformations such as `zip`, `flat_map`, `choose_from_datasets`, and `concatenate`, along with data processing via `map`. These operations become integral parts of the TensorFlow graph, enabling efficient data loading and pre-processing, while maintaining the advantages of lazy evaluation and graph optimization.

For further comprehension, reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data.Dataset` is crucial.  Additionally,  examining practical examples of data pipelines, especially those involving multiple data sources, is highly beneficial. Exploring tutorials that demonstrate the creation of complex data pipelines using `tf.data` is another helpful strategy. Finally, the TensorFlow API documentation concerning `tf.data.experimental` can provide insight into newer features for data manipulation. These resources collectively provide a thorough understanding of  how to best handle data manipulations within the TensorFlow 2 ecosystem.
