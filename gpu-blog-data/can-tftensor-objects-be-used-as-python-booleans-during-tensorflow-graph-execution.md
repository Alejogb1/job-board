Directly assigning a TensorFlow `tf.Tensor` object to a variable expecting a Python boolean will not work as expected within a TensorFlow graph's execution. These operations require explicit conversion. The behavior stems from the nature of graph execution in TensorFlow: operations are not performed immediately; instead, they're added to a symbolic computation graph. During the graph construction phase, `tf.Tensor` objects represent symbolic references to future values, rather than concrete, directly usable values.

When you attempt to use a `tf.Tensor` in a context where a Python boolean is expected (e.g., within an `if` statement or boolean logic operations), Python's truthiness evaluation rules kick in during graph construction. This can be misleading because the TensorFlow graph construction process does not evaluate the actual contents of the tensor, rather whether it is a tensor object. This results in the tensor always being evaluated as `True` in Python boolean expressions during graph construction, irrespective of what the tensor might evaluate to during runtime. This is not the desired behavior when implementing conditional logic within a TensorFlow model.

To properly use boolean logic based on tensor values during graph execution, TensorFlow offers specific operations that allow conversion of tensors containing boolean data (`tf.bool`) or numeric data to true booleans suitable for conditional evaluation in the graph. These operations result in boolean `tf.Tensor` objects whose values are determined during graph execution, not during construction.

For example, to create a boolean tensor indicating whether one tensor is equal to another, we would use `tf.equal`. This function does not return a python bool, but a `tf.Tensor` of `tf.bool` type that, upon execution, evaluates to whether each element matches another. Similarly, to convert a numeric tensor into a boolean tensor, we might utilize functions like `tf.greater`, `tf.less`, etc. The result of these operations is then suitable for use with TensorFlow's conditional logic operations like `tf.cond` or `tf.where`. These operations evaluate the boolean tensor and execute the appropriate branch of code based on its run time value.

Let's illustrate with some code examples:

**Example 1: Incorrect usage (during graph construction)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(10)

is_greater = a > b # this produces a tf.Tensor(False) *during graph execution*, not Python Boolean False

# Incorrect: this code *always* executes the else block, regardless of a and b values
if is_greater:
  result = a * 2
  print ("Inside if, it won't reach this during graph construction")
else:
  result = b * 2
  print ("Inside else, it always prints this during graph construction")


with tf.Session() as sess:
  actual_result = sess.run(result)
  print (f"Result during runtime : {actual_result}") #prints 20
```

In this example, `is_greater` results in a `tf.Tensor` object of dtype `tf.bool`, which evaluates to `False` when the session executes. However, during graph construction, the `if` condition will always execute the `else` branch. The reason is that the Python `if` statement does not wait for the `tf.Tensor` to be resolved. It treats `is_greater` as a truthy value (since it's a tensor object). Consequently, the output during graph construction will always display the text from the 'else' statement. The runtime session evaluation will execute the correct tensorflow graph resulting in the value being 20.

**Example 2: Correct usage with `tf.cond`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(10)


is_greater = tf.greater(a, b) # Correct: Produces a boolean tensor

# Correct use of tf.cond to apply branch based on tensorflow execution
result = tf.cond(is_greater, lambda: a * 2, lambda: b * 2)


with tf.Session() as sess:
    actual_result = sess.run(result)
    print (f"Result during runtime : {actual_result}") #prints 20

c = tf.constant(15)
is_greater_c = tf.greater(c,b)
result_2 = tf.cond(is_greater_c, lambda: c*2, lambda: b*2)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    actual_result_2 = sess.run(result_2)
    print (f"Result during runtime : {actual_result_2}") #prints 30
```

Here, `tf.greater` generates a boolean `tf.Tensor`. `tf.cond` takes this boolean tensor as its first argument. The two subsequent lambda functions specify the computation to perform depending on the outcome of the boolean. This ensures that the correct branch is taken at run time when the value of `is_greater` is determined, which will return different results based on the comparison. The outputs from this code show two different runtime values as the comparison of `a>b` will resolve differently than `c>b`.

**Example 3: Correct usage with `tf.where`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4])
b = tf.constant([5, 1, 7, 1])

comparison = tf.greater(a,b) # element wise boolean comparison
# element wise conditional selection, result has the same shape as input
result = tf.where(comparison, a ,b)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    actual_result = sess.run(result)
    print (f"Result during runtime : {actual_result}") #prints [5 2 7 4]
```

In this example, `tf.greater` performs an element-wise comparison creating a boolean `tf.Tensor`, which `tf.where` utilizes to conditionally select elements from `a` or `b`, resulting in a new tensor containing values from either `a` or `b` based on their element wise comparison. This operation returns a result with the same dimensions, unlike `tf.cond` which returns a single value. The output prints an array of [5 2 7 4] which is the element-wise result of conditional selection based on the comparison.

In summary, `tf.Tensor` objects cannot be directly used as Python booleans within the graph construction phase of TensorFlow. One must utilize TensorFlow's boolean operations like `tf.equal`, `tf.greater`, or other comparison operations that return boolean tensors and then use constructs like `tf.cond` or `tf.where` to implement conditional logic within the computational graph, ensuring computations are based on runtime values rather than construction-time evaluation.

For further understanding, I would suggest reading TensorFlowâ€™s official documentation regarding the following topics:

1.  **TensorFlow tensors**: Understand the differences between the tensor representations and python representations. Pay attention to how and when computations are performed.
2.  **Conditional execution with `tf.cond` and `tf.where`**: Learn about the uses and restrictions of these important flow control operations.
3.  **Boolean operations in TensorFlow**: Review the various functions used for creating boolean tensors such as comparison operations.

Understanding how TensorFlow handles tensors and conditional logic is critical for effectively constructing accurate and efficient models. Avoiding the pitfalls of incorrect boolean handling will prevent many common errors when working with TensorFlow.
