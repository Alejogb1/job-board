The most common reason for email scripts failing to send through a Gmail account stems from Google's robust security measures and authentication protocols.  My experience troubleshooting email delivery issues over the past decade, primarily working on large-scale marketing automation projects, reveals that neglecting these security aspects is the almost-universal culprit.  Insufficient authorization, incorrect configuration of SMTP settings, and neglecting less obvious security features like App Passwords often lead to seemingly inexplicable delivery failures.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Gmail, and other major email providers, employ multiple layers of security to prevent unauthorized access and spam.  Simply configuring your script with a username and password is rarely sufficient.  These providers actively detect and block attempts to send emails using unauthorized applications. This is especially true for bulk email sending, which triggers stricter scrutiny.

The core issue lies in how applications authenticate themselves to Gmail's SMTP server.  Instead of directly using your standard Gmail password, the recommended approach involves generating an App Password specifically for the application accessing your account.  This isolates the script's access, preventing compromise of your main account credentials.  Failure to use App Passwords exposes your account to potential security breaches and almost certainly results in failed email deliveries as Gmail blocks the authentication attempt.

Beyond App Passwords, the SMTP server settings themselves must be meticulously configured.  Incorrect port numbers, missing SSL/TLS encryption, and improperly formatted sender addresses can all hinder successful delivery.  Further complicating matters, Gmail imposes sending limits based on factors including the sender's reputation, the volume of emails sent, and the content of the emails themselves.  Exceeding these limits results in temporary or permanent sending blocks.  Finally, the content of the emails themselves can trigger spam filters, leading to emails being relegated to the spam folder or blocked entirely.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate email sending using Python, focusing on secure practices and addressing common failure points.  I've omitted error handling for brevity but strongly recommend thorough error handling in production environments.

**Example 1: Python with Gmail's App Password (Recommended)**

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

# Gmail account credentials (replace with your own)
sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
receiver_email = "recipient_email@example.com"
app_password = "your_app_password"  # Generate this in your Google account settings

# Create message
msg = MIMEMultipart()
msg['From'] = sender_email
msg['To'] = receiver_email
msg['Subject'] = "Test Email"
msg.attach(MIMEText("This is a test email.", 'plain'))

# Connect to Gmail SMTP server using SSL/TLS
with smtplib.SMTP_SSL("smtp.gmail.com", 465) as smtp:
    smtp.login(sender_email, app_password)
    smtp.send_message(msg)

print("Email sent successfully!")
```

This example leverages the `smtplib` library and utilizes an App Password for secure authentication.  The `SMTP_SSL` context manager ensures secure communication over TLS.  Remember to replace placeholder values with your actual credentials and recipient's email address.


**Example 2: Python with Incorrect SMTP Settings (Illustrative of Failure)**

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
receiver_email = "recipient_email@example.com"
password = "your_gmail_password" #INCORRECT: DO NOT USE REGULAR PASSWORD

msg = MIMEText("This email will likely fail.")

try:
    with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587) as smtp: #Incorrect port
        smtp.starttls()
        smtp.login(sender_email, password)
        smtp.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, msg.as_string())
        print("Email sent successfully!")
except smtplib.SMTPAuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Authentication error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This example intentionally uses an incorrect port (587 instead of 465 for SSL) and the regular password, which will almost certainly lead to authentication failure.  This highlights the critical importance of proper configuration and the use of App Passwords. Note the inclusion of rudimentary error handling, though a more robust approach is necessary for production.


**Example 3: Node.js with App Password (Alternative Language)**

```javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'gmail',
    auth: {
        user: 'your_email@gmail.com',
        pass: 'your_app_password'
    }
});

const mailOptions = {
    from: 'your_email@gmail.com',
    to: 'recipient_email@example.com',
    subject: 'Test Email from Node.js',
    text: 'This is a test email sent from Node.js.'
};

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
    if (error) {
        console.error('Error sending email:', error);
    } else {
        console.log('Email sent:', info.response);
    }
});

```

This example demonstrates email sending using Node.js and the `nodemailer` library.  Similar to the Python example, it utilizes an App Password for secure authentication.  The `nodemailer` library simplifies the process of constructing and sending emails.  Remember to install the `nodemailer` package using `npm install nodemailer`.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* Consult the official documentation for your chosen email library (e.g., `smtplib` for Python, `nodemailer` for Node.js). Pay close attention to security best practices.
* Review Google's documentation on setting up App Passwords for less secure applications.  This is crucial for avoiding authentication errors.
* Investigate your email provider's sending limits and best practices to avoid triggering spam filters or exceeding sending quotas. This may involve reviewing their policies on bulk emailing or implementing email authentication protocols like DKIM, SPF, and DMARC.  Understanding and adhering to these will prevent your emails from being marked as spam.
* Explore advanced debugging techniques for email delivery, including analyzing email headers for detailed information on delivery failures.  This will provide valuable insights into why your emails might be blocked or sent to the spam folder.




By addressing these aspects — securing your credentials with App Passwords, correctly configuring SMTP settings, and understanding your email provider's sending policies — you significantly improve the chances of your email script succeeding and reliably sending emails through your Gmail account. Remember that consistently failing to send emails suggests a configuration issue within your script or a security protocol being triggered by Gmail. Addressing each element described above, starting with the App Password usage, should resolve most email delivery problems.
