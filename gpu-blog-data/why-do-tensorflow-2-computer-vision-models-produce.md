The discrepancy in predictions between a TensorFlow 2 computer vision model evaluated on a batched dataset and the same model evaluated on individual, unbatched tensors from that dataset often stems from the inherent batch processing mechanism implemented within many TensorFlow layers, most notably in batch normalization. My experience working on image segmentation tasks for autonomous vehicles highlighted this issue quite acutely. During initial debugging, validation metrics were inexplicably inconsistent with per-image inference tests. Understanding the nuanced interplay of batch normalization and its implications is crucial to resolving such discrepancies.

The core of the problem lies in how Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) layers operate. These layers are designed to normalize the activations of a layer *across* a batch of input data. Specifically, during training, BatchNorm calculates the mean and variance of the activations *within* each batch. It then uses these batch-specific statistics to normalize the data. At inference time, if the model is in inference mode (determined using `training=False` in model calls, or via `model.eval()`), these calculated batch statistics are not used. Instead, the moving average mean and variance, accumulated throughout training, are used for normalization. However, when you pass individual images (unbatched tensors) to a model after training, BatchNorm no longer has the statistical context of a batch to operate on. It then uses the inference time moving average statistics, which is the *correct* behavior.

The problem arises if the model is *not* in inference mode when passing unbatched tensors, which is quite a common source of this problem. In training mode, even at inference, BatchNorm will calculate the mean and variance of the single image that has been passed to the layer. This single image mean and variance will naturally be very different from the means and variances the model has learned over thousands of images in batches. This often leads to predictions that are significantly different from those generated by batched inference using the model’s learned statistics.

To understand this fully, let’s explore a few code examples:

**Example 1: Demonstrating Batched Inference**

This example sets up a simplified CNN with a BatchNorm layer. We will then perform batched inference with the correct `training=False` mode.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple CNN model with BatchNorm
class SimpleCNN(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')
        self.bn1 = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
        self.pool1 = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))
        self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, x, training=False):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.bn1(x, training=training) #Correct use of training arg
        x = self.pool1(x)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.dense1(x)
        return x

# Create dummy image data and model
model = SimpleCNN()
dummy_images = np.random.rand(10, 28, 28, 3).astype(np.float32)
batch_of_images = tf.constant(dummy_images)

# Perform batched inference with correct training=False arg
predictions_batch = model(batch_of_images, training=False).numpy()

print("Shape of batched predictions:", predictions_batch.shape)
print("Sample from batched predictions:", predictions_batch[0])
```

*   *Explanation*: This code defines a simple convolutional neural network (`SimpleCNN`) including a BatchNorm layer. I then create a batch of dummy images and perform inference using the model, ensuring that `training=False` is passed to the call function, thus ensuring BatchNorm uses inference statistics. The shape and sample predictions are then printed. This is the standard way to perform inference and should produce consistent predictions when used with batched or unbatched tensors, *if* the `training` argument is passed correctly.

**Example 2: Unbatched Inference (Incorrect training=True case)**

Here is a demonstrative example that highlights how things go wrong if `training=True` is used with unbatched data. Note that there is *no* batching in this loop. We will be performing inference on each individual unbatched tensor within our training mode:

```python
# Unbatched Inference with training=True (incorrect)
predictions_unbatched_incorrect = []
for img in dummy_images:
    img_tensor = tf.constant(img[np.newaxis, ...]) # adding batch dim for single image
    prediction = model(img_tensor, training=True).numpy() #Incorrect use of training arg
    predictions_unbatched_incorrect.append(prediction)

predictions_unbatched_incorrect = np.array(predictions_unbatched_incorrect).squeeze()
print("Shape of incorrectly unbatched predictions:", predictions_unbatched_incorrect.shape)
print("Sample from incorrectly unbatched predictions:", predictions_unbatched_incorrect[0])
```

*   *Explanation*: This code iterates through each dummy image. Each image is converted to a tensor with a batch dimension (necessary to be a valid model input), and then passed to the model with `training=True` explicitly, forcing BatchNorm to recalculate its statistics on just a single image.  The resulting predictions are very likely to be different from those produced by correct batched inference. This situation mimics the original question of the inconsistency in predictions. The per-image variance computation within BatchNorm causes the inconsistency in output compared to batched input.

**Example 3: Unbatched Inference (Correct training=False case)**

In this final example, the unbatched inference is performed correctly:

```python
# Unbatched Inference with training=False (Correct)
predictions_unbatched_correct = []
for img in dummy_images:
  img_tensor = tf.constant(img[np.newaxis, ...])
  prediction = model(img_tensor, training=False).numpy() #Correct use of training arg
  predictions_unbatched_correct.append(prediction)

predictions_unbatched_correct = np.array(predictions_unbatched_correct).squeeze()
print("Shape of correctly unbatched predictions:", predictions_unbatched_correct.shape)
print("Sample from correctly unbatched predictions:", predictions_unbatched_correct[0])

#verify that predictions_batch is the same as predictions_unbatched_correct
print("Are batched and unbatched (correct) predictions equal?:", np.allclose(predictions_batch, predictions_unbatched_correct))
```

*   *Explanation*: The core difference here is that we set `training=False` during inference on each image. This ensures the moving average statistics accumulated during training are used, instead of per-image mean and variances. When these statistics are used, you can see that the batched output and the unbatched (but correctly used) outputs are close or exactly equal as the final line verifies.

In summary, the source of the discrepancies between the batched and unbatched predictions is solely due to incorrect usage of the `training` argument. If you use `training=False` when passing either batches or individual tensors, the outputs will match. Using the wrong mode on unbatched tensors will invalidate the normalization of the data.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For those encountering these discrepancies, I suggest further exploration of the following areas:

1.  **TensorFlow Keras API Documentation:** Carefully review the documentation for `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization` focusing on the `training` argument, and note when the `model.call` method’s `training` argument needs to be set to `False` for inference.

2.  **TensorFlow Model Building Guides:** Review examples in the official guides on how to structure and train your model. They typically provide the correct usage and conventions for both training and inference.

3.  **Batch Normalization Theory:** Deep dive into the theory behind Batch Normalization, and the distinction between its behavior during training and inference. It's critical to understand the statistical context involved.

By carefully reviewing these materials and ensuring the correct `training` argument is used with the `call()` method of your models, you can avoid these problematic prediction inconsistencies. The behavior described is consistent and predictable once you understand the underlying mechanics of how the layer operates.
