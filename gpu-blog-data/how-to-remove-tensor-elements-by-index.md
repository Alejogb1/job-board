Tensor element removal by index presents a nuanced challenge, hinging significantly on the desired outcome and the underlying framework.  Directly deleting elements in-place within a tensor is generally inefficient and often unsupported by optimized tensor libraries.  Instead, the optimal approach typically involves constructing a new tensor containing only the desired elements. This process, while seemingly straightforward, demands careful consideration of indexing and potential performance implications, especially with large tensors.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects involving large-scale simulations has reinforced this understanding.

**1.  Explanation of Methodologies**

Tensor element removal by index effectively boils down to selective element retrieval and subsequent tensor reshaping or reconstruction.  The most efficient approach leverages boolean indexing or advanced indexing features provided by modern tensor libraries like NumPy (Python), TensorFlow, or PyTorch.  These libraries offer vectorized operations, making element selection significantly faster than iterative approaches.

Boolean indexing involves creating a boolean array of the same shape as the tensor, where `True` indicates elements to be retained and `False` indicates elements to be removed.  This boolean array is then used to index the original tensor, returning a new tensor comprising only the elements corresponding to `True` values.

Advanced indexing allows for more complex selection criteria.  For instance, one can use integer arrays to specify the indices of the elements to be kept directly, or a combination of integer and boolean arrays for fine-grained control.

Crucially, understanding the tensor's dimensionality is vital.  For multi-dimensional tensors, the indexing scheme must accurately reflect the desired element selection across all axes.  Failure to account for this can lead to incorrect results or unexpected tensor shapes.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate tensor element removal using NumPy, illustrating boolean and advanced indexing. I've chosen NumPy due to its widespread usage and accessibility within the broader scientific computing community.  Adaptation to other frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch follows a similar logic, albeit with some syntactic variations.

**Example 1: Boolean Indexing**

```python
import numpy as np

# Original tensor
tensor = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Boolean array indicating elements to keep (elements greater than 4)
mask = tensor > 4

# New tensor with only elements satisfying the condition
new_tensor = tensor[mask]

#Output: array([5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
print(new_tensor)


#Reshaping if necessary to maintain the original dimensions.
new_tensor_reshaped = new_tensor.reshape((2,3))

#Output: array([[5,6,7],[8,9,0]]) - Note:0 used to pad
print(new_tensor_reshaped)

```

This example demonstrates the use of a boolean mask (`mask`) to select elements greater than 4.  The resulting `new_tensor` contains only these elements, flattened into a 1D array.  Note the necessity to handle potential size mismatches and reshape if original dimension needs to be maintained. In this reshaping I have added 0 to pad the missing element. More sophisticated handling of shape changes may be necessary depending on the application.


**Example 2: Advanced Indexing with Integer Arrays**

```python
import numpy as np

# Original tensor
tensor = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Indices of elements to keep
rows = np.array([0, 2])
cols = np.array([1, 2])

# New tensor containing selected elements
new_tensor = tensor[rows, cols]

#Output: array([2, 9])
print(new_tensor)
```

Here, integer arrays `rows` and `cols` specify the row and column indices of the elements to be retained.  This technique provides flexibility when dealing with specific element locations.


**Example 3: Combining Boolean and Advanced Indexing**

```python
import numpy as np

tensor = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])

# Boolean condition
condition = tensor > 3

#Advanced indexing using the boolean array
new_tensor = tensor[condition]

#Output: array([4, 5, 6, 7, 8])

#Reshaping to maintain a 2D structure.
new_tensor_reshaped = new_tensor.reshape( (2,2))

#Output: array([[4, 5], [6, 7]]) - Note: 8 is lost because reshaping demands it
print(new_tensor_reshaped)
```

This example showcases the combination of boolean and advanced indexing for a three-dimensional tensor. The boolean condition selects elements greater than 3.  The reshaping attempts to reconstruct a 2D array, which leads to the loss of an element. Handling of resulting shapes needs careful consideration in the context of the application.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a comprehensive understanding of tensor manipulation, I recommend exploring the official documentation of your chosen tensor library (NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch).  Furthermore, textbooks on linear algebra and numerical computation provide a solid foundation for understanding the underlying mathematical principles.  Finally, detailed tutorials available online can assist in practical application of these techniques.  Focusing on vectorized operations is crucial for optimization. Remember to profile your code to identify performance bottlenecks, particularly with very large tensors.
