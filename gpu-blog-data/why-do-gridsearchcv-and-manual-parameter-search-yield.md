The discrepancy in Mean Squared Error (MSE) values obtained from GridSearchCV and manual parameter search in Keras models often stems from subtle, yet critical, differences in how these methods handle training data splits, model initialization, and the optimization process itself. I’ve encountered this behavior numerous times during model development, and it almost always points towards a hidden parameter interaction or a misunderstanding of the underlying mechanics.

GridSearchCV, by design, performs a systematic exploration of a predefined hyperparameter space. It relies on k-fold cross-validation, typically splitting the dataset into ‘k’ folds, training a model on ‘k-1’ folds, and validating it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated ‘k’ times, with each fold acting as the validation set once. Importantly, within each fold, GridSearchCV might randomly initialize the model weights for each hyperparameter combination it evaluates. This randomization, while necessary for exploration, can introduce variance in the reported performance metrics. Because GridSearchCV provides an averaged MSE over the cross-validation folds, it’s a robust estimation but does not train a final model on the entire dataset. Once you choose a best model from GridSearchCV it needs to be trained on entire data to provide a final model.

Manual parameter search, on the other hand, typically involves training the model on a training set and evaluating its performance on a separate validation set. It's an approach that gives you much tighter control over the process. However, because of the tight control it means that you need to implement your own logic. This may involve techniques such as splitting a single hold-out set for each run, using a fixed random initialization, using a particular optimizer, or using a different technique for early stopping. This process, without careful management, is prone to biases from fixed splits and random initializations that may be very beneficial to specific hyperparameter combinations, leading to performance variation that differs from the average reported by GridSearchCV. Additionally, manual search often lacks the statistical robustness that cross-validation provides, making the single reported MSE value susceptible to variability in the train/test split.

The discrepancies in MSE often stem from these specific areas. Firstly, random weight initialization can cause significantly different performance even for models with identical hyperparameters. A lucky weight initialization might lead to quick and efficient learning while an unlucky one may hinder learning progress. Secondly, the specific dataset splitting, used by GridSearchCV versus a manual split, impacts the amount and character of the training data seen by the models. Finally, the choice of optimization algorithm, learning rate, and early stopping criteria can each be controlled during a manual parameter search and each can alter the model's convergence trajectory and impact reported MSE. I’ve seen a seemingly insignificant change in the optimizer, used in the manual parameter search versus what GridSearchCV implicitly does, make a dramatic impact on a model’s MSE.

Here are examples to further illustrate these points:

**Example 1: Demonstrating the impact of different validation splits:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Generate synthetic dataset
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y = 2*X[:, 0] + 3*X[:, 1] - X[:, 2] + 0.5*X[:, 3] + 0.1*X[:, 4] + np.random.randn(100)*0.1

# Manual Search - Different splits for each hyperparameter
def manual_search_mse(learning_rate):
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate), loss='mse')
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, verbose=0)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    return mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# GridSearchCV-like split with fixed training data
def fixed_split_mse(learning_rate):
     X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
     model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
     model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate), loss='mse')
     model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, verbose=0)
     y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
     return mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Illustrative run
manual_mse_1 = manual_search_mse(0.001)
manual_mse_2 = manual_search_mse(0.01)
fixed_mse_1 = fixed_split_mse(0.001)
fixed_mse_2 = fixed_split_mse(0.01)

print(f"Manual search MSE (LR=0.001): {manual_mse_1:.4f}")
print(f"Manual search MSE (LR=0.01): {manual_mse_2:.4f}")
print(f"Fixed split search MSE (LR=0.001): {fixed_mse_1:.4f}")
print(f"Fixed split search MSE (LR=0.01): {fixed_mse_2:.4f}")

```
*Commentary:* The ‘manual_search_mse’ function simulates how a manual parameter search might use *different* random splits for each parameter combination. The ‘fixed_split_mse’ function uses the *same* random split for each hyperparameter combination, closer to how GridSearchCV works internally with cross-validation where some data is held out for validation. Note that because both approaches still rely on a random initialization, running this code multiple times is likely to show different MSE values but the trend should remain where different splits provide more variance.

**Example 2: Demonstrating impact of different weight initialization:**
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Generate synthetic dataset
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y = 2*X[:, 0] + 3*X[:, 1] - X[:, 2] + 0.5*X[:, 3] + 0.1*X[:, 4] + np.random.randn(100)*0.1

# Fixed initialization
def fixed_initialization_mse(learning_rate, seed):
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    tf.random.set_seed(seed)
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate), loss='mse')
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, verbose=0)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    return mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Randomized initialization (GridSearchCV default)
def random_initialization_mse(learning_rate):
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate), loss='mse')
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, verbose=0)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    return mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)


# Illustrative run
fixed_mse_seed_1 = fixed_initialization_mse(0.01, 123)
fixed_mse_seed_2 = fixed_initialization_mse(0.01, 456)
random_mse = random_initialization_mse(0.01)

print(f"Fixed initialization MSE (seed=123): {fixed_mse_seed_1:.4f}")
print(f"Fixed initialization MSE (seed=456): {fixed_mse_seed_2:.4f}")
print(f"Random initialization MSE : {random_mse:.4f}")
```

*Commentary:*  This example highlights how fixing random seed affects the outcome. Note how both calls to 'fixed_initialization_mse' produce repeatable results because they specify the same seed. However, their results differ because they have different seeds. These results will also likely differ from 'random_initialization_mse'. In GridSearchCV, there is a random initialization within each k-fold validation step. This is not always the case in manual parameter search.

**Example 3: Illustrating optimizer settings and early stopping differences**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
# Generate synthetic dataset
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y = 2*X[:, 0] + 3*X[:, 1] - X[:, 2] + 0.5*X[:, 3] + 0.1*X[:, 4] + np.random.randn(100)*0.1

#Manual Parameter Tuning with different optimizer and Early Stopping.
def manual_search_mse_optimizer_earlystopping(learning_rate):
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=learning_rate)
  callback = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=10)
  model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse', metrics=['mse'])
  model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_split=0.2, epochs=100, verbose=0, callbacks=[callback])
  y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
  return mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# GridSearchCV default - Adam with no early stopping
def gridsearch_default(learning_rate):
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
   model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate), loss='mse', metrics=['mse'])
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   return mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)


# Illustrative run
manual_mse = manual_search_mse_optimizer_earlystopping(0.01)
grid_mse = gridsearch_default(0.01)


print(f"Manual search MSE with SGD and early stopping : {manual_mse:.4f}")
print(f"GridSearch Default MSE with Adam and no early stopping: {grid_mse:.4f}")
```
*Commentary:* This example shows how changing the optimizer (SGD versus Adam) and including a callbacks (such as EarlyStopping) will change the performance of a model. GridSearchCV provides a high level api which makes these kinds of fine level tuning difficult. This can result in differing results with a manual approach.

To mitigate these discrepancies, I suggest a few techniques. First, explicitly set random seeds before all critical operations. Secondly, rigorously align the train/test splits used in both GridSearchCV and manual parameter searches. Thirdly, control the optimizer and early stopping parameters that GridSearchCV implicitly uses. Finally, perform multiple runs with varying weight initializations, averaging the validation MSE from manual parameter search.

Resources that might be beneficial include documentation on scikit-learn's model selection API, particularly the cross-validation strategies, Keras' optimizer documentation, and resources detailing early stopping and hyperparameter tuning in deep learning.
