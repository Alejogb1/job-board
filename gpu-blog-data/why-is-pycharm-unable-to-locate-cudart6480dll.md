The inability of PyCharm to locate `cudart64_80.dll` typically arises from an environment configuration issue, specifically within the Python interpreter’s search path or the operating system's dynamic link library (DLL) loading mechanism. This .dll, integral to CUDA 8.0, is essential for running applications that leverage NVIDIA GPUs for accelerated computation. My experience deploying machine learning models in production environments has repeatedly exposed this particular pitfall. The problem is not typically a deficiency in PyCharm itself, but rather in how it interacts with the system's broader configuration.

The core issue stems from the fact that Python, when executing within PyCharm or any other environment, does not inherently know where to find system-level DLLs. The system, in this case, Windows, has a defined order in which it searches for such files when a program requests them. This search order usually involves: 1) the directory from which the application loaded; 2) the system directory; 3) the windows directory; 4) the directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable; and 5) some other less common paths. The failure point is almost always within the `PATH` environment variable or the specific directory containing the CUDA toolkit installation.

When a Python library or module attempts to use CUDA functionality (e.g., through libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch), it relies on Windows to resolve the dependency on `cudart64_80.dll`. If this library is not present at any location the system searches, the application fails with an error usually indicating "cannot find cudart64_80.dll" or a similar message that indirectly points to DLL loading issues. PyCharm, as the integrated development environment (IDE), is merely acting as the execution vehicle; therefore, the root cause is not within PyCharm’s core functions but the external configuration.

Let’s illustrate with specific scenarios and code examples demonstrating how this problem manifests:

**Scenario 1: Missing CUDA Directory in PATH Environment Variable**

In this common case, the CUDA 8.0 toolkit is installed, but the directory containing `cudart64_80.dll` is not included within the system’s `PATH` environment variable.  My typical symptom is an import failure within a script relying on CUDA. Consider the following simple Python script:

```python
# my_cuda_script.py

import tensorflow as tf

try:
    # Attempt a CUDA operation that should fail if DLL is not found
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], shape=[1, 3], dtype=tf.float32)
        b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 1], dtype=tf.float32)
        c = tf.matmul(a, b)
        print(c)
except tf.errors.InternalError as e:
    print(f"CUDA Error: {e}")

```

Executing this script in PyCharm, with no path information, leads to an `InternalError` from TensorFlow because the CUDA runtime is missing, thus displaying the error. The core problem is that  `cudart64_80.dll` cannot be found at runtime. The fix would require one to add the directory containing `cudart64_80.dll`, typically `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\bin` to the system's `PATH` environment variable.

**Scenario 2: Incorrect Version of cudart64.dll**

Another common error occurs when a more recent version of CUDA is installed. For instance, a machine may have CUDA 10 or 11 installed, which includes a `cudart64_100.dll` or `cudart64_110.dll`, respectively. However, if a project is specifically configured to require the `cudart64_80.dll` the system will throw an error. This scenario isn’t about the file being *missing*, but the wrong version existing.  Again, the error occurs at the import statement or during the first use of a CUDA-enabled library like TensorFlow. For illustration purposes let’s assume the script is similar, but there is a version mismatch:

```python
# cuda_version_mismatch.py
import tensorflow as tf
try:
    # Attempt a CUDA operation that should fail if version mismatch
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], shape=[1, 3], dtype=tf.float32)
        b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 1], dtype=tf.float32)
        c = tf.matmul(a, b)
        print(c)
except tf.errors.InternalError as e:
    print(f"CUDA Error: {e}")
except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Module Error: {e}")
```

This version of the script would produce an error even if a newer version of the CUDA toolkit is present because the libraries have been compiled to use `cudart64_80.dll`. The resolution involves locating a valid installation of CUDA 8.0 and ensuring its directory containing `cudart64_80.dll` is present in the `PATH`.  Furthermore, you must ensure the Python packages being used, like TensorFlow or PyTorch, are compatible with CUDA 8.0, rather than a more modern CUDA Toolkit version.

**Scenario 3:  Conflicting PYTHONPATH Settings**

While less frequent, a badly configured `PYTHONPATH` can also contribute to issues, particularly if there are custom environment modifications or the use of virtual environments. For example, a project may have its own CUDA toolkit installation, and the directory is being pointed to an incorrect folder. While not directly a DLL issue, this wrong path may result in a cascade of errors, or implicitly cause the DLL loading to fail. In my experience, it's always important to have a clean and clear Python environment. For demonstration, here's an example of how `PYTHONPATH` can cause such an issue:

```python
#python_path_issue.py
import os
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    print(f"Python Path: {os.environ.get('PYTHONPATH', 'Not set')}")
    # Attempt a CUDA operation that should fail if version mismatch
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], shape=[1, 3], dtype=tf.float32)
        b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 1], dtype=tf.float32)
        c = tf.matmul(a, b)
        print(c)
except tf.errors.InternalError as e:
    print(f"CUDA Error: {e}")
except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Module Error: {e}")

```
In this scenario, the `PYTHONPATH` variable can interfere with the standard DLL loading process, leading to an error where `cudart64_80.dll` is not found.  While the system's `PATH` may be correct, Python is explicitly searching in areas specified by `PYTHONPATH`, and if the correct path is not present there, the DLL loading will fail. This requires scrutinizing the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable and cleaning it to ensure it does not point to conflicting or incorrect paths. Virtual environments often help in isolating these types of issues.

In summary, PyCharm isn't responsible for the missing DLL. The IDE simply executes Python code within an environment subject to these system-level settings.  The key troubleshooting steps are always to verify the CUDA toolkit installation, the system's PATH environment variable, and the appropriate DLL version and to scrutinize `PYTHONPATH` settings. Always ensure the correct version of the CUDA toolkit is installed, is on the path, and that the specific libraries being utilized are compiled against this version.

For further resources, I would recommend consulting the official NVIDIA CUDA documentation, particularly the installation guides. Additionally, reviewing Python documentation on setting up environments and environment variables. Lastly, relevant forums pertaining to libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch often have good sections discussing common CUDA issues. These materials will provide more context to the solutions I have described here.
