CUDA, at its core, is an extension to C++ for parallel computing on NVIDIA GPUs, and while it provides considerable power, it's vital to understand that its programming model differs from standard CPU-based C++. Lambda expressions in CUDA, therefore, operate within these constraints and limitations. While they introduce a level of convenience, they do not inherently bring true polymorphism, recursion, or the full spectrum of object-oriented programming paradigms as traditionally understood in a C++ environment. Here's a breakdown based on my experience with CUDA kernel development.

**1. Lambda Expressions in CUDA and Function Pointers:**

CUDA lambdas, like any other function object or ordinary function in CUDA kernels, are ultimately converted into function pointers by the CUDA compiler (nvcc). These function pointers, while flexible enough to enable some forms of abstraction, are not the dynamic dispatch mechanism necessary for true polymorphism. Specifically, polymorphic behavior, in the classical sense, requires virtual function tables (v-tables), which dynamically select the correct implementation of a method based on an object’s runtime type. CUDA device code does not have support for v-tables or runtime type information (RTTI) as these features would introduce prohibitive overheads in the massively parallel context.

Instead, CUDA leverages static polymorphism, often achieved through templates or function overloading at compile time. Therefore, when you use a lambda in a CUDA kernel, you aren’t creating objects that can dynamically behave in different ways, but rather creating function pointers that map to a specific implementation known at compile time. You can use templated kernels and templated lambdas to achieve similar ends but this is not dynamic runtime polymorphism. Similarly, the limitations of CUDA’s device-side memory model, especially its lack of dynamic allocation within kernels, significantly constrain how one can instantiate objects and maintain complex state needed for standard object oriented programming.

**2. Polymorphism Limitations in CUDA Lambdas:**

While we can pass lambdas as arguments to template functions in CUDA kernels, their utility in achieving dynamic polymorphism is limited. The template substitution will create a new kernel for each distinct lambda type, which differs from classical runtime polymorphism.

Consider this example:

```cpp
template <typename Func>
__global__ void apply_func(float *out, const float *in, int size, Func func) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    out[i] = func(in[i]);
  }
}

__device__ float square(float x) { return x * x; }
__device__ float cube(float x) { return x * x * x; }


int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    float *host_in = new float[size];
    float *host_out = new float[size];
    // Initialize host_in with data
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) { host_in[i] = static_cast<float>(i); }
    float *device_in, *device_out;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&device_in, size * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&device_out, size * sizeof(float));
    cudaMemcpy(device_in, host_in, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Using a named device function:
    apply_func<<<blocks,threads>>>(device_out,device_in,size, square);
    cudaMemcpy(host_out, device_out, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    // Now host_out has the result of the square function.

     // Using a named device function:
    apply_func<<<blocks,threads>>>(device_out,device_in,size, cube);
    cudaMemcpy(host_out, device_out, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

   // Using a Lambda:
   auto sqrt_func = [] __device__ (float x) { return sqrtf(x); };
    apply_func<<<blocks,threads>>>(device_out, device_in, size, sqrt_func);
    cudaMemcpy(host_out, device_out, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    // Now host_out has the result of the square root function
   delete[] host_in;
   delete[] host_out;
   cudaFree(device_in);
   cudaFree(device_out);
    return 0;
}
```

In the example, `apply_func` is a templated kernel. Each call to `apply_func` using `square`, `cube`, or the `sqrt_func` lambda will create a new, specialized kernel compiled with that specific function. The generated code will be optimized for the function type passed to the template. There is no dynamic dispatch here – the compiler generates specific versions of `apply_func` for each lambda type and named device function.

**3. Recursion Limitations in CUDA:**

Recursion is generally difficult in CUDA because it heavily relies on the stack. CUDA threads have limited stack size, and deep recursion can quickly lead to stack overflow errors, especially when running thousands of threads in parallel. While it's possible to implement tail-recursive functions, which can be optimized into loop-like constructs, true general recursion is highly discouraged and practically non-viable. Lambdas, operating within this restriction, do not provide any mechanism to circumvent these limitations.

For instance:

```cpp
// This recursive function is NOT viable on the GPU:
__device__ unsigned int factorial_recursive(unsigned int n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1); // Stack overflow danger
  }
}

// An Iterative implementation that is feasible:
__device__ unsigned int factorial_iterative(unsigned int n) {
    unsigned int result = 1;
    for (unsigned int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        result *= i;
    }
    return result;
}

__global__ void compute_factorial(unsigned int *out, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        out[i] = factorial_iterative(i + 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 10;
    unsigned int* out_host = new unsigned int[n];
    unsigned int* out_device;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&out_device, n*sizeof(unsigned int));
    compute_factorial<<<blocks,threads>>>(out_device, n);
    cudaMemcpy(out_host, out_device, n*sizeof(unsigned int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

   //out_host now contains factorial results
   delete[] out_host;
   cudaFree(out_device);
    return 0;
}
```

The `factorial_recursive` function is not suitable for CUDA, while `factorial_iterative` is. The limitations of the CUDA stack means that lambdas, or any function, are subject to the same restrictions.

**4. Object-Oriented Programming and CUDA:**

The object oriented paradigm, with its reliance on objects encapsulating data and methods, faces significant hurdles in the CUDA environment. While you can define simple structs as POD (Plain Old Data) and pass them to kernels, you cannot create classes with virtual functions, constructors, destructors, or other class-specific features. This is again due to the lack of RTTI, dynamic memory allocation, and the specific CUDA memory model that doesn't align with typical object lifetime management. While you can encapsulate operations in device functions and pass parameters as data to be processed in parallel, such approaches cannot be described as object-oriented in the classical sense.

A simple struct may be used to encapsulate related data which may be processed in parallel.
```cpp
struct DataPacket {
   float value_1;
   float value_2;
   int ID;
};

__global__ void process_data(float *out, const DataPacket* in, int size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
      out[i] = (in[i].value_1 * in[i].value_2) + static_cast<float>(in[i].ID);
    }
}
int main() {
   int size = 1024;
    DataPacket *host_packets = new DataPacket[size];
    float *host_out = new float[size];

   for (int i = 0; i < size; i++){
    host_packets[i].ID = i;
    host_packets[i].value_1 = i * 0.5f;
    host_packets[i].value_2 = i * 0.25f;
   }

    DataPacket *device_packets;
    float* device_out;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&device_packets, size * sizeof(DataPacket));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&device_out, size * sizeof(float));
    cudaMemcpy(device_packets, host_packets, size * sizeof(DataPacket), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


    process_data<<<blocks,threads>>>(device_out, device_packets, size);
    cudaMemcpy(host_out, device_out, size*sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);


    //host_out now has the results of the kernel calculation
    delete[] host_out;
    delete[] host_packets;
    cudaFree(device_out);
    cudaFree(device_packets);

    return 0;
}
```

This example does utilize a struct, but it is more accurately described as a data container rather than a classical object with associated behavior. In brief, CUDA device code is not meant to handle objects in the way that general purpose CPU code does.

**5. Resource Recommendations:**

To gain a better understanding of CUDA limitations, specifically with regards to device code:

*   **NVIDIA CUDA Documentation**: The official CUDA documentation offers comprehensive technical information about the programming model, compiler behavior, and memory architecture.
*   **CUDA C++ Programming Guide**: The programming guide provides examples and best practices for writing efficient CUDA code, including the use of templates and function objects.
*   **Books and Academic papers on GPU computing**: Resources from academic publications and books on parallel computing and GPU architecture can deepen the understanding of the architectural limitations that affect these programming decisions.

In conclusion, while CUDA lambdas enhance code expressiveness, they do not enable true polymorphism, dynamic recursion, or full object-oriented capabilities as understood in traditional C++ development. They operate within the constraints of CUDA's device-side environment, serving as function pointers with templated kernel specializations, as well as being subject to the limitations of the device-side memory model.
