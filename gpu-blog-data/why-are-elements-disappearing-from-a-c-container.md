In my experience, elements vanishing from a C++ container often stem from issues related to invalidating iterators and references, particularly in scenarios involving dynamic resizing or modification of the underlying data structure. When working with containers like `std::vector`, `std::deque`, or even some node-based structures like `std::list` or `std::set`, care must be taken to avoid inadvertently triggering behavior that makes existing accessors meaningless. The core problem isn’t that elements are literally disappearing in a magic sense; rather, operations are conducted that invalidate previously obtained iterators and references, causing subsequent accesses to lead to undefined behavior, which manifests as seemingly lost data. Let's unpack why this happens and examine some scenarios using `std::vector` as the primary example due to its common use and susceptibility to these issues.

Fundamentally, `std::vector` stores its data in contiguous memory. When the vector's capacity is exhausted—meaning there isn't any pre-allocated room for new elements—and a `push_back` (or `emplace_back`) operation occurs, the vector typically allocates a new, larger block of memory, copies all existing elements to this new location, and then inserts the new element. Crucially, this reallocation process invalidates all previously existing iterators and references because the memory location of the elements has changed. Any attempt to use those now-dangling accessors is problematic.

Consider an iterative removal scenario. Suppose one loops through the vector using iterators, attempting to erase elements based on some condition, and modifies the iterator within the loop body incorrectly. This is a common source of frustration. Erasing an element within a vector also invalidates iterators past the erased position. This happens because, upon deletion, all elements after the erased location are shifted back by one position to maintain contiguity, thus the original location for those iterators is no longer valid.

The problem is exacerbated when one assumes that operations that don't explicitly modify the container's size will never cause an invalidation. For instance, accessing elements using the bracket `[]` operator or `at()` method returns references. If these references are held, and then a resize operation happens elsewhere that would lead to a relocation, these references become invalid too, even if the element at the location remains the same conceptually. The issue isn't with the element disappearing per se; the memory location the reference points to might now contain something completely different (or be unmapped).

Below are three code snippets, each demonstrating different mechanisms of element 'disappearance' via iterator/reference invalidation. Each example is coupled with commentary explaining what goes wrong.

**Example 1: Iterator invalidation via incorrect loop logic.**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};

  for (auto it = nums.begin(); it != nums.end(); ++it) {
    if (*it % 2 == 0) {
      nums.erase(it); // Problematic: invalidates 'it'
    }
  }

  // Subsequent uses of 'it' in loop (if any) are now undefined behavior,
  // even if there was a '++it' afterward.

  for (const auto& num : nums) {
    std::cout << num << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Here, the code iterates through a vector of integers. Upon finding an even number, it uses `erase()` which invalidates the current iterator `it`. Moreover, the loop increment `++it` after the erase is performed on invalid iterator. This leads to undefined behavior. The correct way to handle this situation would be to use the returned iterator from the `erase()` method as the next position. The above would likely lead to a crash (or unexpected output), because the internal pointer that the `it` object holds becomes meaningless at the point it’s used again in loop. The correct implementation is present in the next example.

**Example 2: Corrected Iterator Handling**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};

    for (auto it = nums.begin(); it != nums.end(); ){
    if (*it % 2 == 0) {
      it = nums.erase(it); // Correct: 'it' is updated by erase return value
    }
    else {
        ++it;
    }
  }
  for (const auto& num : nums) {
      std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This example presents the fix for the above mentioned problem. The iterator returned by erase() is assigned to the iterator variable, and this is guaranteed to point to the next element. This way iterator is never invalid. If you do not erase the element, you increment the iterator as normal.

**Example 3: Reference Invalidation due to Resize**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> nums;
  nums.reserve(5);  // Reserve space to avoid early reallocations during initial pushes
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i){
        nums.push_back(i);
    }
  int& ref = nums[2]; // Obtain a reference
    
  std::cout << "Ref before push_back: " << ref << std::endl;

  nums.push_back(100); // Triggers reallocation (capacity was 5 initially)
   
   std::cout << "Ref after push_back: " << ref << std::endl; // Undefined behavior
    
   for (const auto& num : nums) {
      std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

In this instance, the `std::vector` initially has a capacity of 5, reserved up front and then filled with 5 integer values. A reference (`ref`) to the element at index 2 is created, prior to expansion. Later, pushing back one more element triggers reallocation, as a new, larger block of memory needs to be allocated to house the new element and all the old elements. At this point, the old memory is freed, and thus the reference to memory that contains the element at index 2 is now invalid. When this invalid reference is later used in std::cout statement, it leads to undefined behavior. The expected behavior could be a crash, unexpected value printed or sometimes it might seem like nothing is wrong, as a location may be available in memory and accessible, but it is still incorrect and should be avoided. The reference loses its context.

To mitigate these problems, I highly recommend taking the following approaches: When working with `std::vector`, prioritize using range-based for loops or algorithms that don't require direct manual manipulation of iterators where possible. For more complex modifications during iteration, carefully use the iterators returned by operations like `erase` and be aware of how operations such as `insert` or `resize` can invalidate accessors. Consider using node-based containers such as `std::list` or `std::set` if you need frequent insertions or deletions, where iterators may be more stable although insertion and deletions themselves may have performance implications.

Additionally, familiarize yourself with the documentation for the specific standard library containers you are using. Understand which operations invalidate iterators, and use `reserve()` and `capacity()` appropriately to avoid unnecessary reallocations in scenarios where you know the final size of the container in advance. Books on effective modern C++ are particularly beneficial, and you can also find in-depth explanations of the Standard Library on resources provided by standards committee papers.
