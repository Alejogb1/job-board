The core issue with unexpected results from `tf.random.normal()` often stems from a misunderstanding of its interaction with TensorFlow's graph execution model and the management of random seeds.  In my experience debugging large-scale TensorFlow models, inconsistent random number generation has frequently been traced to improper seed management, particularly within distributed training environments or when utilizing TensorFlow's eager execution mode alongside graph mode operations.  Failure to properly initialize or manage the seed leads to non-reproducible results, which manifest as unexpected output from `tf.random.normal()`.

**1. Explanation of Random Number Generation in TensorFlow:**

TensorFlow's random number generation relies on pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs).  These PRNGs are deterministic; given the same seed, they will produce the same sequence of "random" numbers.  The crucial element is the seed value.  Without explicitly setting a seed, TensorFlow will use a default seed, which is often derived from system time or other volatile factors. This explains why, without explicit seed control, repeated executions of code employing `tf.random.normal()` frequently yield differing results.

The impact of this becomes significantly more pronounced in distributed training scenarios. Each worker in a distributed setting will, by default, use a different seed, leading to each worker producing a unique sequence of random numbers.  This necessitates global seed management if consistent results across workers are desired.

Furthermore, the interaction between eager execution and graph mode can exacerbate issues.  If parts of your code are executed eagerly and others in a graph, the management of the random state can become complex, often leading to unexpected outputs.  Within a `tf.function` (which defines a TensorFlow graph), the random number generation is typically managed differently than in eager mode, necessitating attention to seed initialization within these contexts.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Unseeded Random Number Generation (Non-Reproducible):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# No seed specified - results vary on each run
for _ in range(3):
  random_numbers = tf.random.normal((3, 3))
  print(random_numbers.numpy())
```

This example demonstrates the inherent variability without seed control.  Each execution will produce a different output tensor because TensorFlow will utilize a different seed for each run.

**Example 2: Seeded Random Number Generation (Reproducible):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Set a fixed seed for reproducibility
tf.random.set_seed(42)

for _ in range(3):
  random_numbers = tf.random.normal((3, 3))
  print(random_numbers.numpy())
```

This example explicitly sets a global seed using `tf.random.set_seed(42)`.  Now, each execution will produce the identical output.  The `42` is arbitrary; you can choose any integer.  However, consistency requires using the same seed each time.

**Example 3:  Handling Seeds within `tf.function`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def generate_random_numbers(seed):
  tf.random.set_seed(seed)  # Setting seed within the function
  return tf.random.normal((3, 3))

# Different seeds generate different, but reproducible numbers *within each function call*
seed1 = 10
seed2 = 20
print(generate_random_numbers(seed1).numpy())
print(generate_random_numbers(seed2).numpy())
print(generate_random_numbers(seed1).numpy()) # Will be identical to the first call with seed1
```

This example showcases the essential practice of setting the seed *within* a `tf.function`.  This ensures that the random number generation within the compiled graph remains consistent across multiple executions of the function.  Note that the global seed set by `tf.random.set_seed()` outside the function might still influence the initial state of the PRNG within the `tf.function`, but the local seed guarantees reproducibility within the functionâ€™s scope.  If the local seed is not set, changing the global seed might unexpectedly alter the numbers generated by the `tf.function`.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's internals, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on random number generation, eager execution, and graph construction.  Furthermore, understanding the concepts of pseudo-random number generators and their properties is crucial.  A good textbook or online resource covering numerical methods and probability would be highly beneficial.  Finally, explore advanced techniques for managing randomness in large-scale distributed training if you are undertaking such projects, as the complexity increases considerably.  Pay close attention to the nuances of how random number generators are implemented in distributed environments.  These resources will enable you to diagnose and prevent issues related to the unpredictable behavior of `tf.random.normal()`.  Thoroughly examining the documentation on TensorFlow's operational model and the execution of graphs versus eager mode will likely prove invaluable.  Consider reviewing materials on reproducibility in scientific computing.
