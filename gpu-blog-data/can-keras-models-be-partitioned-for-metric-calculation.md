The inherent structure of Keras models, specifically the sequential nature of data flow during the `fit` method, doesn't directly support partitioning the model itself for independent metric calculation on distinct subsets of the data.  However, achieving the effect of partitioned metric calculation is achievable through strategic data manipulation and custom callback implementation.  My experience optimizing large-scale model training highlighted this limitation and necessitated the development of several workarounds.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The challenge arises because Keras's built-in metrics are calculated cumulatively over the entire dataset (or epoch) processed by the `fit` method.  There's no intrinsic mechanism to interrupt this process, calculate metrics on a portion, and then resume with a different portion using the same model instance. This limitation stems from the model’s design: it processes data in batches, accumulating gradients and metric updates until an epoch or the entire dataset is processed.

To simulate partitioned metric calculation, we must divide the dataset into partitions beforehand. Then, we can leverage either the Keras `evaluate` method on each partition independently or implement a custom callback that monitors and records metrics at specific points during training, effectively mimicking partitioned evaluation.

The `evaluate` method offers a cleaner approach for post-training analysis. It provides precise metrics on distinct datasets without modifying the training process.  However, this approach provides no insight into the metric evolution during training on each partition.

Implementing a custom callback offers a more dynamic solution, allowing real-time monitoring of metrics on each partition during training. This approach provides granular insights into how each partition affects the model’s performance over training epochs. However, it requires a deeper understanding of Keras callbacks and may introduce some computational overhead.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Using `evaluate` for Post-Training Partitioned Metrics**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Assume 'X' and 'y' are your feature and label data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Further partition the training data
X_train_part1, X_train_part2, y_train_part1, y_train_part2 = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)


model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... your model layers ...
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10) # Train on entire training set

part1_metrics = model.evaluate(X_train_part1, y_train_part1, verbose=0)
part2_metrics = model.evaluate(X_train_part2, y_train_part2, verbose=0)
test_metrics = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)

print(f"Part 1 Metrics: {part1_metrics}")
print(f"Part 2 Metrics: {part2_metrics}")
print(f"Test Metrics: {test_metrics}")
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward post-training approach. The model is trained on the entire training set, and then `evaluate` is used to calculate metrics separately for each predefined partition.  This method is efficient for obtaining final metrics on distinct subsets of your data but doesn't provide insights during the training process itself.


**Example 2: Custom Callback for Real-time Partitioned Metrics**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

class PartitionedMetricCallback(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, X_partitions, y_partitions, metrics=['mae']):
        super(PartitionedMetricCallback, self).__init__()
        self.X_partitions = X_partitions
        self.y_partitions = y_partitions
        self.metrics = metrics

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        for i, (X_part, y_part) in enumerate(zip(self.X_partitions, self.y_partitions)):
            results = self.model.evaluate(X_part, y_part, verbose=0)
            for metric_name, metric_value in zip(self.model.metrics_names, results):
                logs[f'partition_{i+1}_{metric_name}'] = metric_value

# Assume X_partitions and y_partitions are lists of your partitioned data
model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... your model layers ...
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[PartitionedMetricCallback(X_partitions, y_partitions)])
```

This demonstrates a custom callback that evaluates metrics on each partition at the end of every epoch.  The callback's `on_epoch_end` method computes and stores metrics for each partition, adding them to the `logs` dictionary accessible after each epoch's completion.  Note the reliance on pre-partitioned data.


**Example 3: Handling Imbalanced Partitions with Weighted Metrics**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_sample_weight

# Assume X_partitions and y_partitions are lists of your partitioned data, potentially imbalanced.

class WeightedPartitionedMetricCallback(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, X_partitions, y_partitions, metrics=['mae']):
        super(WeightedPartitionedMetricCallback, self).__init__()
        self.X_partitions = X_partitions
        self.y_partitions = y_partitions
        self.metrics = metrics

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        for i, (X_part, y_part) in enumerate(zip(self.X_partitions, self.y_partitions)):
            weights = compute_sample_weight('balanced', y_part) # Handle class imbalance
            results = self.model.evaluate(X_part, y_part, sample_weight=weights, verbose=0)
            for metric_name, metric_value in zip(self.model.metrics_names, results):
                logs[f'partition_{i+1}_{metric_name}'] = metric_value

# ...rest of the code similar to Example 2...

```

This example addresses potential class imbalances within partitions by incorporating sample weights.  `compute_sample_weight` from scikit-learn generates weights that adjust for class imbalances, ensuring a fairer metric assessment.  This is crucial when dealing with heterogeneous datasets.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The Keras documentation itself is the primary resource. Thoroughly understanding Keras callbacks, the `fit` and `evaluate` methods, and the underlying workings of TensorFlow's computation graph is vital.  Exploring advanced topics in machine learning, such as handling class imbalance and evaluating model performance on diverse data distributions, would provide further context.  Study of relevant statistical concepts regarding stratified sampling and hypothesis testing also proves beneficial.  Finally, reviewing examples of custom Keras callbacks and their implementation will significantly enhance your understanding.
