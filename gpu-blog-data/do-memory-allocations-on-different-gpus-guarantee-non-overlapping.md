GPU memory management, particularly across multiple discrete GPUs, presents a nuanced landscape where guarantees of non-overlapping allocations are not absolute. While intuitively one might expect distinct address spaces per GPU, the underlying hardware and driver implementations often introduce complexities that require careful consideration for developers aiming for robust, portable applications. My experience building large-scale distributed machine learning systems, involving multiple GPUs on different physical machines, has made these nuances quite apparent.

Generally, each discrete GPU possesses its own dedicated memory space, often referred to as device memory. This memory is physically separate from the host (CPU) memory and from the memory of other GPUs. When you allocate memory on a specific GPU through a library such as CUDA or OpenCL, you are effectively requesting a region within that specific device's memory. The device driver manages these allocations, maintaining internal data structures to keep track of used and available memory regions.

However, it's important to realize that the *logical* separation provided by the APIs does not automatically imply *physical* isolation. While a driver will certainly prevent two allocations *within* the same GPU's memory from overlapping, there's no inherent guarantee that allocations across different GPUs won't *appear* to share addresses, especially in virtualized environments or in systems with shared memory addressing modes.

The illusion of distinct address spaces is primarily maintained by the driver software. When an application requests memory on a particular GPU, the driver typically allocates memory using a virtual address within that GPU's address space. These virtual addresses are not directly mapped to physical addresses. Instead, the GPU's memory management unit (MMU), in conjunction with the driver, performs a translation from virtual to physical addresses. The MMU ensures that a virtual address within GPU A is ultimately mapped to a physical memory region belonging to GPU A, even if a similar virtual address was also allocated on GPU B. This is analogous to the virtual address spaces used by operating systems on the host CPU.

The crux of the matter lies in the fact that even though different GPUs might use identical virtual address ranges, the underlying physical addresses will be located on their respective device memories. This means that direct pointer manipulation, assuming all allocations reside in a shared physical address space, is not guaranteed to work and may result in data corruption, undefined behavior, or even system crashes.

The allocation process and the mapping of virtual to physical addresses is transparent to the application. For example, when using CUDA, functions like `cudaMalloc` or `cudaMallocManaged` allocate memory on the GPU without explicitly revealing any underlying physical addressing details. The same principle applies to other GPU programming APIs like OpenCL and DirectCompute.

It is crucial to emphasize that application code should never rely on the assumption that memory allocations on different GPUs will have unique virtual addresses. While it might often happen to be the case, it is unsafe to write code that depends on this behavior, especially across different driver versions or system configurations. The only guarantee provided by the APIs is the isolation of memory regions allocated on the *same* device. Communication between devices always needs to be facilitated by explicit data transfer operations using specific functions (e.g., `cudaMemcpy` in CUDA) or by using managed memory (e.g., `cudaMallocManaged`).

Below are three illustrative code examples, each with accompanying commentary. These examples demonstrate the allocation process and highlight the importance of understanding the virtual address abstraction. These examples use the CUDA API, but the core concepts are analogous across different GPU programming APIs.

**Code Example 1: Basic Allocation on Two GPUs**
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

    if (deviceCount < 2) {
        std::cerr << "At least two GPUs are required." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    int device0 = 0;
    int device1 = 1;
    cudaSetDevice(device0);

    float* devPtr0;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&devPtr0, 1024 * sizeof(float));
    
    cudaSetDevice(device1);
    float* devPtr1;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&devPtr1, 1024 * sizeof(float));

    std::cout << "GPU 0 Pointer Address: " << devPtr0 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "GPU 1 Pointer Address: " << devPtr1 << std::endl;
    cudaFree(devPtr0);
    cudaFree(devPtr1);
    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* This example allocates memory on two different GPUs. The addresses of `devPtr0` and `devPtr1`, as printed on the console, will likely be different. However, they *might* be numerically the same if there is no clash of allocated memory regions. Even if they were the same, it does *not* imply that they point to the same physical memory region.  They represent virtual addresses in the context of their respective GPUs. The essential point is that you should never depend on comparing the raw pointer values across different GPUs.

**Code Example 2: Data Copying Between GPUs**
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

    if (deviceCount < 2) {
        std::cerr << "At least two GPUs are required." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    int device0 = 0;
    int device1 = 1;
    
    cudaSetDevice(device0);
    float* devPtr0;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&devPtr0, 1024 * sizeof(float));
    
    cudaSetDevice(device1);
    float* devPtr1;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&devPtr1, 1024 * sizeof(float));
    
    float* hostPtr = new float[1024];
    for(int i = 0; i<1024; ++i)
       hostPtr[i] = static_cast<float>(i);
        
    cudaSetDevice(device0);
    cudaMemcpy(devPtr0, hostPtr, 1024 * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaSetDevice(device1);
    cudaMemcpy(devPtr1, devPtr0, 1024 * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice); //copy from device 0 to device 1. Note that the device settings must be correct here.
    
    cudaMemcpy(hostPtr, devPtr1, 1024 * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    
    for(int i = 0; i<1024; ++i)
       if(hostPtr[i] != static_cast<float>(i)){
           std::cout << "Error data copied incorrectly at element" << i << std::endl;
           return 1;
       }
    
    std::cout << "Data correctly copied between GPUs" << std::endl;

    cudaSetDevice(device0);
    cudaFree(devPtr0);
    cudaSetDevice(device1);
    cudaFree(devPtr1);
    delete[] hostPtr;
    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* This example illustrates the correct method for data transfer between GPUs. Notice that `cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice` is used, rather than just copying data via a shared memory pointer which is undefined behaviour. We must explicitly use the appropriate `cudaMemcpy` function with the correct device setting to transfer data between the allocated device memories. Attempting to access `devPtr0` directly from the context of `device1` would lead to errors or data corruption. The `cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice` function takes care of this internally.

**Code Example 3: Managed Memory**
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

    if (deviceCount < 2) {
        std::cerr << "At least two GPUs are required." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    
    float* managedPtr;
    cudaMallocManaged((void**)&managedPtr, 1024 * sizeof(float));
    for(int i = 0; i < 1024; ++i)
        managedPtr[i] = static_cast<float>(i);

    int device0 = 0;
    int device1 = 1;
    cudaSetDevice(device0);
    for(int i = 0; i < 1024; ++i)
        managedPtr[i] *= 2.0f;

    cudaSetDevice(device1);
    for(int i = 0; i < 1024; ++i)
        managedPtr[i] += 10.0f;

    for (int i = 0; i < 1024; i++){
        if(managedPtr[i] != (static_cast<float>(i) * 2.0f + 10.0f) ){
           std::cout << "Error at element " << i << std::endl;
           return 1;
        }
    }
    std::cout << "Managed memory correctly accessed from multiple GPUs" << std::endl;
    cudaFree(managedPtr);

    return 0;
}
```
*Commentary:* This example demonstrates using managed memory. When memory is allocated using `cudaMallocManaged`, the CUDA runtime manages data migration between the CPU and all GPUs. Here, each GPU modifies the same logical memory region. This alleviates the need for manual memory transfers but the underlying operations still involve transfers as managed memory is not true shared memory between GPUs. It is recommended that explicit synchronization between device accesses is used. However, the point here is to demonstrate that a single virtual pointer location can be accessed by different devices, but that doesn't mean that the actual memory is shared between the devices.
For further study, I would suggest exploring documentation and books specific to GPU programming. Specifically, look into the programming guides for CUDA and OpenCL. I would also recommend investigating material on topics such as GPU memory architecture, virtual memory management, and memory access patterns for optimal performance. Studying examples of data parallelism across multiple devices also offers key insight. These resources will help solidify an understanding of the nuances of multi-GPU memory management beyond the scope of this discussion.
