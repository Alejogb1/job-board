The "Invalid datetime. It must be bigger than the last one" error in PyAlgoTrade when handling custom CSV date formats stems fundamentally from a violation of the inherent chronological ordering assumption within the library's data structures.  PyAlgoTrade, by design, expects time series data to be strictly monotonically increasing; each subsequent datetime entry must be later than the preceding one.  My experience debugging similar issues in high-frequency trading data pipelines points directly to inconsistencies in the date parsing process as the primary culprit. This often arises from incorrect format strings, data entry errors in the source CSV, or flawed data preprocessing steps.

Let's address this by examining potential causes and solutions.  The core issue lies in the transformation of your string-formatted dates in the CSV into Python `datetime` objects, which PyAlgoTrade subsequently uses for its internal time indexing.  Any deviation from the expected format or the presence of non-chronological data will trigger this error.

**1.  Thorough Date Format Specification:**

The most common source of the error is an incorrect format string provided to the `datetime.strptime()` function.  The format string must precisely match the date and time representation in your CSV.  In my past work with a large financial data provider, a seemingly insignificant mismatch between ‘%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S’ and ‘%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f’ (the latter including microseconds) resulted in precisely this error, leading to hours of debugging.  Verify every component – year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and any fractional seconds – ensuring complete correspondence.

**2.  Data Preprocessing and Error Handling:**

Before feeding data into PyAlgoTrade, robust preprocessing is vital. This involves systematically checking for and handling potential errors within your CSV.  My experience suggests integrating checks within a data ingestion pipeline can prevent these errors from propagating further.  The pipeline should be structured to detect and either correct or discard problematic entries.  Simply skipping invalid entries and logging them can prevent the program from crashing.

**3.  Consistent Time Zone Handling:**

Inconsistencies in time zones are another significant source of problems.  If your CSV data lacks explicit time zone information, but your system's local time zone differs from the data's original time zone, the resulting `datetime` objects will be misinterpreted, leading to ordering violations.  Always ensure your data uses a consistent time zone, explicitly specifying it within the `datetime` object creation.  Applying a time zone conversion during data ingestion and standardizing to a common time zone (such as UTC) is crucial.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Correct date parsing with explicit time zone:**

```python
import datetime
from pyalgotrade import bar
from pyalgotrade.barfeed import yahoofeed

# Assuming your CSV has a column 'date' with format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' in UTC
def load_csv(filename, timezone='UTC'):
    """Loads CSV data, handling time zone information and potential errors."""
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as csvfile:
            reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
            header = next(reader)  # Assuming the first line is header
            date_index = header.index('date') #find the column index for date
            open_index = header.index('open')  # find the index of the open column
            # ... other columns ...
            bars = []
            last_datetime = None
            for row in reader:
                try:
                    dt_str = row[date_index]
                    dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(dt_str, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
                    dt = dt.replace(tzinfo=pytz.timezone(timezone))  #Important!
                    if last_datetime is not None and dt <= last_datetime:
                        raise ValueError("Invalid datetime. It must be bigger than the last one.")
                    bar_data = bar.BasicBar(dt, float(row[open_index]), ..., ..., ..., ...)  # add other data as needed
                    bars.append(bar_data)
                    last_datetime = dt
                except ValueError as e:
                    print(f"Skipping invalid row: {row}, Error: {e}")
        return bars
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filename}' not found.")
        return []

# ... rest of the code to create and use the barfeed ...
```

**Example 2:  Handling missing data:**


```python
import pandas as pd
#...previous imports

def load_csv_handle_missing(filename, timezone='UTC'):
    df = pd.read_csv(filename)
    df['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', errors='coerce')
    df['datetime'] = df['datetime'].dt.tz_localize(timezone)
    df = df.dropna(subset=['datetime'])
    df = df.sort_values('datetime') #Ensure chronological order after handling missing data
    df = df.reset_index(drop=True)

    bars = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        dt = row['datetime']
        if index > 0 and dt <= df['datetime'][index - 1]:
            print(f"Skipping duplicate or out-of-order datetime at index: {index}")
            continue
        #Construct your bar
        bar_data = bar.BasicBar(dt, row['open'], ..., ..., ..., ...)
        bars.append(bar_data)

    return bars
```

This example uses pandas for more efficient data handling and error detection.  The `errors='coerce'` argument in `pd.to_datetime` converts invalid dates to `NaT` (Not a Time), which are then easily removed.


**Example 3:  Custom BarFeed with validation:**

```python
from pyalgotrade.barfeed import basefeed

class ValidatedBarFeed(basefeed.BarFeed):
    def __init__(self, frequency, timezone):
        super().__init__(frequency)
        self.__timezone = timezone
        self.__lastDateTime = None

    def addBarsFromSequence(self, bars):
        for bar in bars:
            if self.__lastDateTime is not None and bar.getDateTime() <= self.__lastDateTime:
                raise ValueError("Invalid datetime. It must be bigger than the last one.")
            self.__lastDateTime = bar.getDateTime()
            super().addBar(bar.getDateTime(), bar)


# ... usage:
feed = ValidatedBarFeed(frequency, timezone)
feed.addBarsFromSequence(bars) # bars being the output of one of the previous functions

```

This custom `BarFeed` subclass performs explicit validation before adding each bar, providing a more integrated solution within PyAlgoTrade itself.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The PyAlgoTrade documentation, especially the sections on `barfeed` and creating custom feeds.  A good text on Python datetime handling.  A comprehensive guide to data preprocessing and cleaning in Python.  And lastly,  a reference on time zone handling in Python.  These resources, if carefully consulted, will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and best practices for avoiding these types of errors.
