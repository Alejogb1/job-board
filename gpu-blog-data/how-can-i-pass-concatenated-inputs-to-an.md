The core challenge in passing concatenated inputs to an LSTM layer in Keras lies in managing the tensor dimensionality and ensuring compatibility with the LSTM's expected input shape.  In my experience working on time-series anomaly detection systems, I frequently encountered this issue, particularly when incorporating diverse feature sets.  The LSTM expects a three-dimensional tensor of shape `(samples, timesteps, features)`.  Improperly concatenated inputs often violate this expectation, leading to `ValueError` exceptions during model compilation or training.

My approach centers on meticulous pre-processing to ensure the concatenated input tensor conforms to the LSTM's requirements.  This involves careful consideration of both the individual input tensors' shapes and their relative temporal alignment.  Failure to align temporal dimensions will result in incorrect sequential information being fed to the LSTM, severely impacting performance and potentially leading to nonsensical results.

Let's examine the solution through three scenarios, each illustrating a distinct aspect of the problem and its resolution.


**Scenario 1: Concatenating multiple time series with the same timesteps.**

This is the simplest case.  Assume we have two time series, `series_a` and `series_b`, both possessing 100 timesteps and representing distinct features (e.g., temperature and humidity).  Each series is initially a NumPy array of shape `(100,)`.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
series_a = np.random.rand(100)
series_b = np.random.rand(100)

# Reshape to (samples, timesteps, features) before concatenation
series_a = np.expand_dims(series_a, axis=0) #shape (1,100)
series_b = np.expand_dims(series_b, axis=0) #shape (1,100)

series_a = np.expand_dims(series_a, axis=2) #shape (1,100,1)
series_b = np.expand_dims(series_b, axis=2) #shape (1,100,1)

# Concatenate along the feature axis
concatenated_series = np.concatenate((series_a, series_b), axis=2) #shape (1,100,2)

# Define the LSTM model
model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(100, 2)),
    Dense(1) #example output layer, adjust according to task
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') #adjust to appropriate loss function

model.fit(concatenated_series, np.random.rand(1), epochs=10) #replace with your target variable

```

Here, we first reshape each series to `(1, 100, 1)` to represent a single sample with 100 timesteps and 1 feature.  The `np.concatenate` function then combines these along the feature axis (axis=2), resulting in a tensor of shape `(1, 100, 2)`.  This is directly fed to the LSTM layer with the correctly specified `input_shape`.


**Scenario 2: Concatenating time series with different numbers of timesteps.**

This scenario requires padding or truncation to achieve uniform timestep lengths. Let’s say `series_c` has 120 timesteps and `series_d` has 80.  We’ll truncate to the shorter length.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
series_c = np.random.rand(120)
series_d = np.random.rand(80)

min_timesteps = min(len(series_c), len(series_d))

series_c = series_c[:min_timesteps]
series_d = series_d[:min_timesteps]

series_c = np.expand_dims(series_c, axis=0)
series_c = np.expand_dims(series_c, axis=2)
series_d = np.expand_dims(series_d, axis=0)
series_d = np.expand_dims(series_d, axis=2)


concatenated_series = np.concatenate((series_c, series_d), axis=2)

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(min_timesteps, 2)),
    Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

model.fit(concatenated_series, np.random.rand(1), epochs=10)

```

This code snippet demonstrates truncation.  Alternatively, padding with zeros or a mean value could be employed to match the longest timeseries.  Choose the method which is most appropriate for the nature of the data and the problem at hand.  Incorrect padding can lead to model bias.

**Scenario 3: Concatenating features with different sampling rates.**

This represents a more complex situation.  Consider `series_e`, sampled at 1Hz, and `series_f`, sampled at 10Hz.  A direct concatenation would be meaningless. We need resampling.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data - simulating different sampling rates
series_e = np.random.rand(100) # 1Hz, 100 seconds
series_f = np.random.rand(1000) # 10Hz, 100 seconds

# Resample series_f to match series_e's sampling rate
x_f = np.linspace(0, 99, 1000)
x_e = np.linspace(0, 99, 100)
f = interp1d(x_f, series_f)
series_f_resampled = f(x_e)

# Now concatenate as in Scenario 1
series_e = np.expand_dims(series_e, axis=0)
series_e = np.expand_dims(series_e, axis=2)
series_f_resampled = np.expand_dims(series_f_resampled, axis=0)
series_f_resampled = np.expand_dims(series_f_resampled, axis=2)

concatenated_series = np.concatenate((series_e, series_f_resampled), axis=2)

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(100, 2)),
    Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

model.fit(concatenated_series, np.random.rand(1), epochs=10)

```

Here, we leverage `scipy.interpolate.interp1d` for resampling. This method can be adapted for other interpolation techniques depending on the context. Remember that resampling introduces approximation, so choosing the appropriate method is crucial.



In conclusion, effectively passing concatenated inputs to an LSTM layer in Keras mandates careful attention to data pre-processing.  Ensuring consistent timestep lengths and compatible dimensionality are paramount for model stability and accuracy.  The choice of padding, truncation, or resampling techniques depends strongly on the specifics of your dataset and task.  Careful consideration of these aspects will significantly improve the robustness and predictive capabilities of your LSTM model.
