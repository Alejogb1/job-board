Accessing a Docker container directly via its IP address, while seemingly straightforward, often requires a deeper understanding of Docker networking and how containers are isolated. The default behavior of Docker, utilizing a bridge network, generally doesn't expose container IP addresses to the external network or host system in a directly accessible manner. This design prioritizes security and avoids IP address conflicts. Therefore, directly connecting to a container using its internal IP address requires specific configurations and a comprehension of network types beyond the default bridge.

The primary reason for this indirection lies within Docker's network model. When a container is created, it's typically assigned an IP address within a private network managed by Docker itself. This IP address is solely relevant within that specific network and isn’t automatically advertised or routed to the host's network interface or any external network. Consequently, attempting to reach the container's IP address from the host or an external machine will typically fail. The host operates in a different network context.

To enable direct access via the container's IP, we need to bridge this gap by employing Docker's different networking capabilities, primarily `host` networking or custom bridge networks with proper routing configurations. Using the `host` network driver effectively removes container networking isolation, allowing the container to share the host's network namespace. This makes the container directly accessible using the host’s IP address and any exposed ports. The other approach, the custom bridge, maintains isolation but enables targeted routing rules. I’ve had several occasions where a direct connection was necessary, particularly when debugging distributed applications or needing to bypass proxy setups for testing low-level networking functionality.

Let's start by examining the default scenario. If we create a simple nginx container and try to access its IP address, we will find it's not directly accessible from the host. For example:

```bash
docker run -d --name my-nginx nginx
docker inspect my-nginx | grep "IPAddress"
# Output:  "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
```
If we now attempt to access `172.17.0.2` from the host using `curl`, we will likely fail. This confirms the earlier point; the IP address inside the Docker bridge network is not directly reachable from the host. Trying `curl 172.17.0.2` on the host will typically return a 'Connection refused' error, or no response at all. This is because the default bridge network does not expose the internal IP to the external interface.

The simplest method for direct access is using the `host` network mode. This should be approached carefully as it eliminates networking isolation.  However, in some development or specific testing scenarios, it can prove quite valuable. Here is the modified command using the `host` option and subsequent testing:

```bash
docker run -d --name my-nginx-host --network host -p 80:80 nginx
# Here -p 80:80 is also specified in case the application expects the port to be bound. This effectively becomes optional due to the host network usage
```

After running this, the container utilizes the host’s network stack. Consequently, the container, if it exposes a service on port 80, will become accessible via the host’s IP address, for instance, accessing `http://localhost:80` or `http://<host-ip-address>:80` should serve the nginx default page. This shows direct access without needing complex port forwarding or internal container IP address knowledge. This approach is very handy for rapid prototyping or scenarios where performance is prioritized over strong security isolation. It's important to note that when using the host network, exposed ports on the container will use the host's ports, thus a port conflict with another running application could arise if you try to use the same exposed port.

A more controlled approach, retaining some level of isolation, involves creating a custom bridge network with explicit port publishing. This allows targeted forwarding and access while maintaining container network isolation. Consider this example:

```bash
docker network create my-custom-net
docker run -d --name my-nginx-custom --net my-custom-net --ip 172.18.0.5 -p 80:80 nginx
docker network inspect my-custom-net | grep "Gateway"
# Output example:  "Gateway": "172.18.0.1"
```

In this case, we first create a dedicated network `my-custom-net`.  We are assigning a static IP address (172.18.0.5) to the container running on this custom network. The `-p 80:80` flag remains necessary to publish the port to the host. Now the container *can* be accessed through the host, even if it has a static IP defined within the specific network. Now, `curl http://localhost:80` (or your host's IP, same as with the host network) should return the nginx page. Importantly, `172.18.0.5` remains inaccessible from the host directly, as the port mapping is required to bridge the gap. However, if another container is attached to the same `my-custom-net` network, it *can* access the first container using the specified internal IP.

If you want to access the container *directly* via its internal IP outside of a different container, you need to set up routing, typically involving the host's IP routing rules, this is not straightforward and not recommended, as it's complex to set up and not practical for general use. The key here is that we created a private network and mapped the port, not allowing external direct access to the internal IP. This represents a middle ground between isolation and targeted access. The custom network provides a dedicated space for multiple containers, allows specifying static IP ranges, and uses a specific Docker internal network range.

In summary, accessing containers directly using their internal IP address without any port publication is generally restricted by Docker’s network isolation. Using the `host` network removes this isolation making ports directly available. Custom bridge networks, though they offer better isolation, still require port mapping to expose containers to the host’s network. For scenarios needing fine-grained control, using specific networks combined with port forwarding is essential. There are no universal “best” approaches – selecting between `host`, port-mapping, or custom networks should be driven by the specific use case.

For further information, I suggest consulting the official Docker documentation regarding network drivers and `docker network` command. The Docker website and various community forums offer valuable insights. Additionally, the Docker in Practice book is an excellent resource for advanced networking concepts and real-world use cases. The Kubernetes documentation concerning Pod networking provides helpful context regarding container networking at a larger scale.
