The discrepancy between the accuracy of a machine learning model during training and its subsequent testing phase, particularly after saving and reloading, stems primarily from variations in the computational environments and data handling practices, rather than an inherent flaw in the model saving mechanism itself. Having debugged numerous machine learning pipelines involving TensorFlow and PyTorch, I've encountered this issue consistently. It's rarely the model's architecture but often subtle differences in how data is processed or how the testing environment is set up that contribute to this perceived accuracy shift.

The primary causes can be broadly categorized into data inconsistencies, environment variations, and subtle model state differences. First, consider data preprocessing. During training, data is typically shuffled, augmented, and normalized according to a pipeline established early in the project. When testing with the saved model, especially outside the training script environment, this data pipeline must be replicated exactly. If, for instance, the data shuffling is not identical, or the same mean and standard deviation aren't used for normalization, the model is exposed to data with different statistical properties, impacting performance. This effect can be amplified when using batch normalization layers, whose internal statistics are calculated during training based on the training data distribution. Failure to update or freeze these statistics correctly for testing leads to inconsistencies.

Second, the computational environment itself can play a crucial role. Different hardware, such as CPUs versus GPUs, or variations in library versions, particularly the deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and numerical computing libraries like NumPy, can subtly affect computations, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic. This is most apparent with complex models that perform many matrix multiplications or other computationally intensive tasks. While the differences might be small in any single operation, these accumulate over the entire forward pass, leading to slight but observable variations in the output and thus accuracy. Furthermore, if different batch sizes are used during training and testing, this can also influence the behavior of batch normalization layers, further affecting the accuracy.

Lastly, the model's state at the moment of saving and during subsequent loading can introduce subtle variations. While saving a model typically captures the learned weights, additional state variables like optimizer parameters, random states, or internal buffer values may or may not be saved and restored accurately. If stochastic elements are present in the model or its environment (such as dropout or stochastic optimizers), ensuring these are initialized or frozen correctly is paramount. Additionally, if the model uses non-deterministic operations, slight fluctuations in hardware timing can also induce minor variations in the final result.

To clarify, consider these concrete scenarios. The first example illustrates issues related to data normalization inconsistencies. Let's assume we use scikit-learn for data preprocessing in a TensorFlow project:

```python
# Training script (Simplified)
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Dummy training data
train_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)

# Preprocessing and saving scaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
train_data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(train_data)
np.save("scaler.npy", scaler.scale_)
np.save("mean.npy", scaler.mean_)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# Placeholder labels
train_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
model.fit(train_data_scaled, train_labels, epochs=5)
model.save("trained_model.h5")

# Testing script (Potentially inconsistent)
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Load saved scaler data
loaded_scale = np.load("scaler.npy")
loaded_mean = np.load("mean.npy")
# Dummy test data
test_data = np.random.rand(50, 10)
# Inconsistent application of scaler
test_data_scaled = (test_data - loaded_mean) / loaded_scale
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("trained_model.h5")
test_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 50)
_, acc = loaded_model.evaluate(test_data_scaled, test_labels)
print(f"Test accuracy: {acc}")
```
In this example, if the loading of `loaded_mean` and `loaded_scale` is performed inconsistently or not at all, the test data is not processed using the exact same transformation that the training data received. This can result in the model achieving significantly different, and often lower, accuracy in the test phase. The specific inconsistency highlighted in the example is the lack of direct usage of the `StandardScaler()` object which holds the data transformation logic. In the training script, `scaler.fit_transform` is called, which both computes the mean and variance internally and applies the transform. In the testing script the mean and scale are loaded but the scaler is not rebuilt, meaning that `scaler.transform()` was not applied.

The second example illustrates the effects of using different batch sizes during training and evaluation. While seemingly trivial, this can introduce disparities due to how batch normalization functions internally:

```python
# Training script
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm1d(1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        return torch.sigmoid(x)

train_data = torch.rand(100, 10)
train_labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,)).float()

model = SimpleModel()
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

train_dataset = torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(train_data, train_labels)
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

for epoch in range(5):
    for data, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(data)
        loss = criterion(outputs.squeeze(), labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model.pth")

# Testing script (Inconsistent Batch size)
test_data = torch.rand(50, 10)
test_labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (50,)).float()
test_dataset = torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(test_data, test_labels)

# Different batch size used in testing
test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=1)

model = SimpleModel()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model.pth"))
model.eval()

with torch.no_grad():
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    for data, labels in test_loader:
      outputs = model(data)
      predicted = (outputs > 0.5).float()
      total += labels.size(0)
      correct += (predicted == labels.unsqueeze(1)).sum().item()
    accuracy = correct / total
    print(f"Test accuracy: {accuracy}")
```
In the PyTorch example, the batch normalization layer (`BatchNorm1d`) learns the mean and variance of the data during the training process, calculated on batches of 32. When the saved model is then evaluated with a batch size of 1 in the testing script, the batch normalization statistics are not consistent with the training, since the mean and variance are being calculated on single data points, leading to a discrepancy in the predicted output and thus impacting testing accuracy.

Finally, a third example demonstrates how a subtle change in a stochastic dropout layer can influence results:

```python
# Training script
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class DropoutModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DropoutModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(20, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return torch.sigmoid(x)

train_data = torch.rand(100, 10)
train_labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,)).float()

model = DropoutModel()
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

train_dataset = torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(train_data, train_labels)
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

for epoch in range(5):
    for data, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(data)
        loss = criterion(outputs.squeeze(), labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "dropout_model.pth")
# Testing Script (Dropout not turned off in testing)
test_data = torch.rand(50, 10)
test_labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (50,)).float()

model = DropoutModel()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("dropout_model.pth"))
# Dropout layer is active during test phase
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(test_data)
    predicted = (outputs > 0.5).float()
    correct = (predicted == test_labels.unsqueeze(1)).sum().item()
    accuracy = correct / test_labels.size(0)
    print(f"Test accuracy: {accuracy}")
```
Here, the dropout layer was not turned off during testing which means that randomness was still applied. During testing, it is essential to disable the dropout mechanism by using `model.eval()`, to ensure that the network behaves deterministically. Failing to do so will cause the network to have a different accuracy than it should have as the dropout is being applied during prediction time, instead of just during training time.

To effectively mitigate these issues, I would recommend careful documentation of preprocessing steps, thorough testing of the saved model within controlled, replicated environments, and meticulous attention to batch size and state management. Utilizing reproducible environments with tools like Docker can also drastically reduce these discrepancies. Furthermore, using model evaluation techniques such as cross-validation, and performing error analysis can help in identify any discrepancies between training and testing. It is important to remember the critical nature of consistent preprocessing, batch sizing, and deterministic operations to have the greatest likelihood of achieving similar accuracy between training and testing after saving a model. Detailed framework-specific documentation regarding saving and loading model state can also be useful.
