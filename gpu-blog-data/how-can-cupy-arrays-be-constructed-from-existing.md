Directly accessing GPU memory via raw pointers is a powerful, yet complex capability when working with libraries like CuPy. I’ve encountered this scenario multiple times in embedded deep learning projects where I directly manage low-level memory allocation for maximum performance. Understanding how to correctly bridge pre-allocated GPU memory into CuPy arrays without data copies is crucial for both speed and avoiding common pitfalls.

The core challenge lies in the fact that CuPy typically manages its own GPU memory pool using `cudaMalloc`. When you possess a raw pointer allocated through a different mechanism, or even through another library that uses CUDA, you must instruct CuPy to interpret that memory block as an array, effectively bypassing its typical allocation and data transfer routines. This involves using CuPy’s `cupy.ndarray` constructor with specific arguments, often utilizing the `__cuda_array_interface__` or a similar mechanism for pointer identification. Failure to do this correctly can lead to data corruption, memory access violations, or unexpected program crashes, particularly when CuPy’s garbage collection attempts to deallocate memory it doesn't own.

To effectively create CuPy arrays from raw GPU pointers, one needs to understand the interplay between CUDA’s memory management and CuPy’s array abstractions. You do not directly insert a raw `void*` or `uintptr_t` into the `cupy.ndarray` constructor. Instead, you need to wrap the pointer in a Python object that exposes the necessary metadata about the memory block, primarily the data pointer, the data type, and the array shape and strides. The `__cuda_array_interface__` is one such mechanism that’s widely adopted for data exchange between CUDA-aware libraries. If you’re working with a pre-allocated memory block without a `__cuda_array_interface__` you will need to construct a custom Python object with the necessary attributes. This custom object functions as a container for the essential parameters that describe the pre-existing memory region.

Let’s examine three practical code examples that illustrate these principles.

**Example 1: Using a Dummy Object with `__cuda_array_interface__`**

This example demonstrates the general method where an object with `__cuda_array_interface__` is used. This is frequently the case when using other libraries that provide array objects with that attribute, such as Numba’s cuda arrays. For demonstration purposes, I'll fabricate a minimal interface:

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np
import ctypes

class FakeCudaArray:
    def __init__(self, ptr, shape, dtype):
        self.ptr = ptr
        self.shape = shape
        self.dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
        self.strides = (self.dtype.itemsize,) if len(self.shape) == 1 else (self.dtype.itemsize * self.shape[1], self.dtype.itemsize) if len(self.shape) == 2 else None
    
    @property
    def __cuda_array_interface__(self):
        return {
            'shape': self.shape,
            'typestr': self.dtype.str,
            'data': (self.ptr, False),
            'strides': self.strides,
            'version': 1,
        }

# Allocate raw CUDA memory (mimicking external allocation)
size = 1024 * 4  # Allocate space for 1024 floats
ptr = cp.cuda.runtime.deviceMalloc(size)

# Initialize the raw memory with data (optional)
data = cp.arange(1024, dtype=cp.float32)
cp.cuda.runtime.memcpy(ptr, data.data.ptr, size, cp.cuda.runtime.memcpyKind.cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice)


# Create a fake cuda array object pointing to the raw memory
shape = (1024,)
dtype = 'float32'
fake_array = FakeCudaArray(ptr, shape, dtype)


# Construct the CuPy array from the fake object
cupy_array = cp.asarray(fake_array)

print(cupy_array)  # Shows the cupy array with the data
cp.cuda.runtime.deviceFree(ptr)
```

In this example, `FakeCudaArray` simulates an external library providing a GPU array. The `__cuda_array_interface__` property defines the structure required for CuPy to understand the memory layout. The key points are 'shape', 'typestr' (data type), 'data' (a tuple containing the raw pointer and a flag indicating if the data is read-only), and 'strides' (byte distances between array elements, in case it’s a multi-dimensional array). Crucially, CuPy does not perform a deep copy; it directly references the memory indicated by the pointer, which was previously allocated using `cp.cuda.runtime.deviceMalloc` and initialized. We must remember to free the memory allocated by `deviceMalloc` when no longer needed.

**Example 2: Using `from_dlpack` Function**

This example illustrates another approach, using the `from_dlpack` function, which can handle objects with a `__dlpack__` function. This function is similar to `__cuda_array_interface__`, but it is more general and can describe tensors across multiple frameworks.

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np
import ctypes
import pycuda.driver as cuda

class DlpackDummyArray:
    def __init__(self, ptr, shape, dtype):
        self.ptr = ptr
        self.shape = shape
        self.dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
        self.strides = (self.dtype.itemsize,) if len(self.shape) == 1 else (self.dtype.itemsize * self.shape[1], self.dtype.itemsize) if len(self.shape) == 2 else None

    def __dlpack__(self):
        return self

    def __dlpack_device__(self):
        return ('cuda', 0) # assuming a single CUDA device

    def to_dlpack(self):
        return {
            'shape': self.shape,
            'typestr': self.dtype.str,
            'data': (int(self.ptr), False),
            'strides': self.strides,
        }

# Allocate raw CUDA memory (mimicking external allocation)
size = 1024 * 4  # Allocate space for 1024 floats
ptr = cp.cuda.runtime.deviceMalloc(size)

# Initialize the raw memory with data (optional)
data = cp.arange(1024, dtype=cp.float32)
cp.cuda.runtime.memcpy(ptr, data.data.ptr, size, cp.cuda.runtime.memcpyKind.cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice)

# Create a dummy dlpack array
shape = (1024,)
dtype = 'float32'
dlpack_array = DlpackDummyArray(ptr, shape, dtype)

# Construct the CuPy array from the dlpack object
cupy_array = cp.from_dlpack(dlpack_array)

print(cupy_array)  # Shows the cupy array with the data

cp.cuda.runtime.deviceFree(ptr)
```

The `DlpackDummyArray` object exposes the `__dlpack__` and `__dlpack_device__` methods. The key here is the `to_dlpack()` function which generates a structure that is compatible with the DLPack protocol, which `cp.from_dlpack()` function uses to ingest data from other frameworks. Note that `data` member is now an integer pointer instead of the pointer itself. `cp.from_dlpack()` will internally convert it back to a pointer. Similar to Example 1, CuPy now refers to the raw memory without copying the data. The important takeaway here is that we are directly working with memory that was allocated outside CuPy’s control.

**Example 3: Modifying the Memory**

This final example demonstrates what happens when the original memory is modified. The CuPy array will reflect that.

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np
import ctypes

class FakeCudaArray:
    def __init__(self, ptr, shape, dtype):
        self.ptr = ptr
        self.shape = shape
        self.dtype = np.dtype(dtype)
        self.strides = (self.dtype.itemsize,) if len(self.shape) == 1 else (self.dtype.itemsize * self.shape[1], self.dtype.itemsize) if len(self.shape) == 2 else None

    @property
    def __cuda_array_interface__(self):
        return {
            'shape': self.shape,
            'typestr': self.dtype.str,
            'data': (self.ptr, False),
            'strides': self.strides,
            'version': 1,
        }
        
# Allocate raw CUDA memory (mimicking external allocation)
size = 1024 * 4  # Allocate space for 1024 floats
ptr = cp.cuda.runtime.deviceMalloc(size)

# Initialize the raw memory with data
data = cp.arange(1024, dtype=cp.float32)
cp.cuda.runtime.memcpy(ptr, data.data.ptr, size, cp.cuda.runtime.memcpyKind.cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice)

# Create a fake cuda array object pointing to the raw memory
shape = (1024,)
dtype = 'float32'
fake_array = FakeCudaArray(ptr, shape, dtype)

# Construct the CuPy array from the fake object
cupy_array = cp.asarray(fake_array)

#Modify the original memory
new_data = cp.arange(1024, 2048, dtype=cp.float32)
cp.cuda.runtime.memcpy(ptr, new_data.data.ptr, size, cp.cuda.runtime.memcpyKind.cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice)

# The cupy_array will show the modified data
print(cupy_array)

cp.cuda.runtime.deviceFree(ptr)
```

As you can observe, modifying the memory via a separate `memcpy` affects the content of the Cupy array since both objects are pointing to the same memory region. Therefore, careful memory management and thread safety are of paramount importance when working with raw pointers and shared memory access.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, consult the official CuPy documentation, paying close attention to sections concerning memory management and interoperability with other libraries. Explore materials on CUDA’s runtime API, specifically `cudaMalloc` and `cudaMemcpy`, to understand the underlying mechanisms. Examining the documentation for `__cuda_array_interface__` and the DLPack protocol will provide insight into data exchange methods used for GPU arrays. Finally, studying best practices in memory management with CUDA will also prove useful.
