The Flex profiler, while a valuable tool for performance analysis in ActionScript 3 applications, often fails to display expected results due to a confluence of factors ranging from compiler optimization to the profiler's inherent sampling limitations. I’ve encountered this issue repeatedly across different projects, ranging from complex interactive data visualizations to simpler game interfaces, consistently finding that discrepancies stem from a gap between perceived execution flow and the profiler’s representation.

One primary reason for unexpected profiler data lies in the nature of just-in-time (JIT) compilation performed by the Adobe Flash Player. The ActionScript bytecode, compiled from source code, is not directly executed. Rather, the Flash Player's JIT engine dynamically translates portions of this bytecode into optimized machine code at runtime. This optimization process, which can involve inlining methods, loop unrolling, and other performance-enhancing transformations, can drastically alter the actual execution path compared to what's implied by the source code. Therefore, the profiler, operating by sampling the execution stack at specific intervals, might attribute execution time to a method that was optimized away or heavily modified by the JIT compiler. For example, a frequently called, small helper method might appear to have insignificant processing time, not because it’s inherently fast, but because the JIT compiler has effectively folded its functionality into other surrounding operations.

The sampling frequency of the Flex profiler further contributes to the potential inaccuracies. The profiler does not monitor every single line of execution continuously. It intermittently checks the execution stack, capturing snapshots at predefined intervals. This sampling approach inherently introduces a level of statistical approximation. Short-lived functions or those that execute very rapidly might be missed entirely, leading to underreporting of their execution time. Conversely, longer-running functions are more likely to be captured multiple times, leading to over-representation. In situations where a significant amount of processing occurs within a relatively small time window, the profiler's samples might not be fine-grained enough to isolate the precise bottleneck.

Additionally, the profiler's instrumentation overhead can subtly affect the application's performance profile. The act of attaching the profiler injects additional code into the runtime, modifying the application's execution environment. While the overhead is typically minimal, it isn’t zero. This overhead is rarely uniform, possibly skewing the performance data in certain contexts. For instance, frequent calls to heavily optimized native methods could show relatively higher durations than they would without profiling, due to the additional instrumentation overhead placed around them. Similarly, events and callbacks, which are heavily intertwined into the framework’s execution, might have their timing influenced by the profiler.

Finally, the developer’s understanding of the underlying runtime mechanisms plays a critical role in correctly interpreting the profiler data. Misinterpretations often arise from assuming that execution flow follows the lines of code verbatim. Instead, a nuanced understanding of how ActionScript’s event model, display list rendering, and memory management influence execution timings is essential. I’ve seen instances where developers attributed slowness to computationally intensive code, when the actual bottleneck was the excessive use of display list manipulation without proper caching or batching.

Here are three code examples demonstrating these discrepancies, based on my experience.

**Example 1: JIT Optimization Impact**

```actionscript
public class TestClass
{
    private var _iterations:int = 100000;

    public function loopFunction():void
    {
        for (var i:int = 0; i < _iterations; i++)
        {
            smallHelperFunction(i);
        }
    }

    private function smallHelperFunction(value:int):int
    {
        return value * 2;
    }

    public function simpleFunction():int
    {
        var result:int = 0;
        for (var i:int = 0; i < _iterations; i++)
        {
           result += (i*2);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

In this scenario, the expectation might be that both `loopFunction` and `simpleFunction` consume similar processing times, since both contain similar loop constructs. However, the JIT compiler is likely to inline the `smallHelperFunction` inside `loopFunction`, effectively merging its logic into the loop's body. Meanwhile, `simpleFunction`'s calculation is done inline, resulting in it being optimized effectively. When profiled, `loopFunction` might appear to be significantly faster than expected, or have its times attributed to the loop, not the helper, while `simpleFunction` might appear more expensive if the compiler does not optimize it well. The profiler thus obscures the fact that `smallHelperFunction` is being executed.

**Example 2: Sampling Limitations**

```actionscript
public class EventDispatcherClass extends EventDispatcher
{
    public function fireVeryFastEvent():void
    {
       for (var i:int = 0; i < 500; i++)
       {
           dispatchEvent(new Event("fast_event"));
       }
    }
}
```

Here, the `fireVeryFastEvent` function dispatches a burst of events rapidly. If the sampling interval of the profiler is not small enough, these events might be missed or under-represented entirely. The profiler could instead register the time as if `fireVeryFastEvent` took little time and instead attribute more time to the event listener if the listener is more complicated. It will appear that the event dispatching has little effect, while actually having a performance impact when many listeners are used.

**Example 3: Instrumentation Overhead & Display List**

```actionscript
    import flash.display.Sprite;
    import flash.geom.Point;

    public class DisplayTest extends Sprite
    {
       private var _iterations:int = 100;

       public function createAndMoveSprites():void
       {
          for(var i:int = 0; i < _iterations; i++)
          {
              var sprite:Sprite = new Sprite();
              addChild(sprite);
              sprite.graphics.beginFill(0xFF0000);
              sprite.graphics.drawCircle(0,0,10);
              sprite.graphics.endFill();
              sprite.x = i * 15;
              sprite.y = i* 15;
              // this next line is very expensive
              sprite.cacheAsBitmap = true;

          }
       }
    }
```

In this example, the loop iterates over adding new display objects to the screen, making them visible. The line setting `cacheAsBitmap` is a very expensive operation, as it causes the object to be rasterized into a bitmap. While the code might appear to have a uniform execution time per loop, profiling might indicate that the time spent on each sprite significantly varies. A notable portion of time, potentially misattributed to methods involved in draw operations, is consumed by rendering the display list. The instrumentation overhead added by the profiler might be significant in this case due to the high number of display object manipulations. The rendering engine’s internal operations could also obscure the profiling data, especially if the scene rendering has performance overheads.

To effectively interpret Flex profiler data, one must be mindful of these underlying complexities. A developer must also consider alternative profiling techniques, such as explicit timer instrumentation within the code to validate the profiler’s findings. These techniques can use `flash.utils.getTimer` to measure how long code sections take. Additionally, manual stepping through the code with breakpoints, coupled with performance analysis techniques, such as memory monitoring and display list analysis, provides better contextual information.

I recommend exploring resources such as official Adobe documentation on ActionScript performance optimization, blog posts from ActionScript developers discussing practical experiences with performance tuning, and the source code of relevant ActionScript libraries. Focusing on resources that delve into the intricacies of the Flash Player's runtime and compiler will lead to a more profound understanding of the limitations of the profiler and help in crafting optimized solutions. Deeply understanding the architecture of ActionScript and its underlying engine will allow you to make sense of profiling data. These steps can lead to a better understanding and effective use of the flex profiler.
