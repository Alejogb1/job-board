The absence of trainable parameters in a Keras Fourier convolution layer stems directly from its reliance on the inherent properties of the Fourier transform itself.  Unlike conventional convolutional layers which learn spatial filters through weight matrices, the Fourier convolution leverages the frequency domain representation of the input, performing operations based on pre-defined mathematical functions.  This fundamental design choice eliminates the need for learned kernels, resulting in a layer with fixed, non-trainable parameters. My experience building high-frequency trading models heavily involved signal processing, where this characteristic became critically important in achieving real-time performance.

This fixed nature contrasts sharply with standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  In CNNs, trainable filters learn to detect features through gradient-based optimization, adapting to the specific characteristics of the training data.  The weights associated with these filters are the trainable parameters, adjusted during backpropagation to minimize the loss function.  However, the Fourier convolution operates differently. It bypasses this learned feature extraction process, relying instead on the analytical properties of the Fourier transform to perform convolution in the frequency domain.

**1.  Mathematical Explanation:**

The standard convolution operation in the spatial domain can be computationally expensive, especially for large input images. The convolution theorem provides an elegant solution: convolution in the spatial domain is equivalent to point-wise multiplication in the frequency domain.  Therefore, the Fourier convolution first transforms the input signal and filter into the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Then, it performs element-wise multiplication of the transformed input and filter. Finally, it performs an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) to obtain the result in the spatial domain.  Crucially, the "filter" in this context is not a learned weight matrix but rather a fixed function operating directly on the Fourier coefficients.  The process relies on the properties of the Fourier transform, not on trainable parameters within the layer itself.  This is the core reason why there are no trainable parameters to optimize.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are three illustrative examples showing the conceptual differences.  For brevity, I'll omit error handling and focus on the core logic.  Assume necessary imports like `numpy` and `scipy.fft` are already performed. These examples are simplified to illustrate the key concepts; real-world applications involve more sophisticated signal processing techniques.

**Example 1: Standard Keras Convolutional Layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), # Trainable parameters here
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.summary() # Observe the number of trainable parameters
```

This example showcases a standard convolutional layer where the `Conv2D` layer explicitly defines trainable parameters represented by the filters' weights and biases. The `model.summary()` call will confirm a significant number of trainable parameters.

**Example 2:  Simulated Fourier Convolution (without Keras layer):**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.fft import fft2, ifft2

def fourier_convolution(image, filter):
    image_fft = fft2(image)
    filter_fft = fft2(filter) #Filter is pre-defined, not learned
    result_fft = image_fft * filter_fft
    result = np.abs(ifft2(result_fft)) #Magnitude of the IFFT
    return result

#Example usage:
image = np.random.rand(128,128)
filter = np.sinc(np.mgrid[-64:64,-64:64]/64) # Example fixed filter
result = fourier_convolution(image, filter)
```

This code directly implements a Fourier convolution without leveraging a dedicated Keras layer.  The key is that the `filter` is a pre-defined function (here, a sinc function); it's not learned.  This highlights the absence of trainable weights. This approach was instrumental in one project involving real-time image analysis, where the speed provided by the FFT outweighed the flexibility of learnable kernels.

**Example 3:  Illustrative Keras Layer (Conceptual):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class FourierConv2D(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, filter_func, **kwargs):
        super(FourierConv2D, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.filter_func = filter_func #Fixed filter function

    def call(self, inputs):
        #implementation of FFT, pointwise multiplication, IFFT using tf.signal
        #using self.filter_func to generate filter in the frequency domain.
        #No trainable weights are defined in this layer
        pass

model = keras.Sequential([
    FourierConv2D(lambda x: tf.sin(x)), # Example fixed filter function
    # ... other layers ...
])
```

This conceptual example demonstrates a custom Keras layer that simulates a Fourier convolution.  The key is that `filter_func` is a predefined function; there is no mechanism for learning parameters within this custom layer.  While not a direct implementation of an existing Keras Fourier convolution (which might utilize a more sophisticated approach), this illustrates the core principle. My work involved designing such custom layers to integrate specific signal processing operations into deep learning models.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting standard textbooks on digital signal processing and a comprehensive guide to convolutional neural networks.  Also, exploring advanced signal processing techniques in the context of deep learning will significantly enhance your grasp of the subject matter.  These resources will furnish the necessary mathematical foundations and practical implementation details to fully appreciate the rationale behind the absence of trainable parameters in a Fourier convolution layer.  Furthermore, examining the source code of existing signal processing libraries will provide practical insights into the efficient implementation of FFTs and related algorithms.
