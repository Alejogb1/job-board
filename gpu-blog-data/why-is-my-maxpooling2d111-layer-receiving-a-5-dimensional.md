The issue stems from a common misunderstanding regarding the expected input format for Keras' `MaxPooling2D` layer.  While the error message points to a five-dimensional input, the root cause almost certainly lies in the preceding layers' output shape, specifically an improperly handled batch dimension or the inclusion of an unintended channel dimension.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous deep learning projects, ranging from image classification to time-series forecasting, this five-dimensional error frequently indicates a misalignment between the model's architecture and the data preprocessing pipeline.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The `MaxPooling2D` layer, a core component in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), expects a four-dimensional input tensor. This tensor follows the convention `(batch_size, height, width, channels)`.  The `batch_size` represents the number of independent samples processed simultaneously; `height` and `width` define the spatial dimensions of the input feature maps; and `channels` represents the number of feature maps.  Receiving a five-dimensional input suggests an extra dimension has been inadvertently added. This extra dimension is frequently the result of one of two scenarios:

* **Incorrect data reshaping:** The input data, likely loaded from a file or generated through preprocessing, might not be correctly reshaped to the expected four-dimensional format. This often happens when dealing with datasets where the sample dimension is not explicitly handled or when concatenating multiple feature maps without proper consideration of the tensor structure.

* **Unintended channel expansion:**  A previous layer in the model, possibly a convolutional layer (`Conv2D`) or a custom layer, may be unintentionally outputting a five-dimensional tensor.  This can occur due to an incorrect specification of the `filters` parameter in a convolutional layer, leading to an extra dimension representing a further subdivision of the feature maps. This is less common than the first scenario, but warrants investigation.


To rectify this, one needs to meticulously review the data preprocessing steps and inspect the output shapes of all layers preceding the `max_pooling2d_111` layer.  The key is to identify where the extra dimension originates and correct the underlying cause.  Simply reshaping the input will only mask the problem; it is crucial to pinpoint and resolve the root issue to maintain model integrity and reproducibility.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Here are three scenarios illustrating potential causes and their solutions. These examples leverage Keras with TensorFlow backend, but the principles apply broadly across other deep learning frameworks.

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Reshaping**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import MaxPooling2D

# Incorrectly shaped data (extra dimension)
incorrect_data = np.random.rand(10, 28, 28, 1, 1)  # Batch, Height, Width, Channels, UNEXPECTED DIMENSION

# Correct Reshape
correct_data = np.reshape(incorrect_data, (10, 28, 28, 1))

# Model definition
model = keras.Sequential([
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2), input_shape=(28, 28, 1))
])

#Attempting to use incorrect data would result in a dimension mismatch
#model.predict(incorrect_data)  #This will throw an error.

#Correct Prediction
model.predict(correct_data)  #This will run without errors.

print(f"Correct data shape: {correct_data.shape}")
```

This example demonstrates how an extra dimension in the input data can be corrected using `np.reshape`. The comment highlights where the error would occur if not corrected. This situation commonly arises during data loading, where a dimensionality mismatch occurs between the loaded data and the expected input format of the model.


**Example 2: Unintended Channel Expansion in a Convolutional Layer**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D

# Model with potential issue in convolutional layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(filters=1, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), #This layer will output 4D tensor
    Conv2D(filters= (1,1), kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'), # Incorrect filter specification resulting in a 5D output
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2))
])

# Sample input data
input_data = np.random.rand(10, 28, 28, 1)

#Attempt to use the model would throw an error. The second convolutional layer is the culprit.
#model.predict(input_data)


#Corrected Model
corrected_model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(filters=1, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), #This layer will output 4D tensor
    Conv2D(filters=1, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'), # Correct filter specification resulting in a 4D output
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2))
])

corrected_model.predict(input_data) #This works without errors.
print(f"Corrected model summary:\n{corrected_model.summary()}")
```

This illustrates a scenario where an incorrectly configured `Conv2D` layer can produce a five-dimensional output. Note the difference between the `filters` specification in the problematic and corrected models.  Inspecting model summaries (`model.summary()`) is crucial for identifying such inconsistencies.



**Example 3:  Data Preprocessing Error (Time Series)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import MaxPooling1D, Reshape

# Simulate time-series data with an extra dimension
incorrect_timeseries = np.random.rand(10, 1, 100, 1) #Batch, unexpected dimension, timesteps, features

#Correct Reshape
correct_timeseries = np.reshape(incorrect_timeseries,(10,100,1))

#Model using 1D MaxPooling, suitable for time series data.
model = keras.Sequential([
    Reshape((100,1),input_shape=(100,1)),
    MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
])


#Attempting prediction without correction would result in error
#model.predict(incorrect_timeseries)

#Correct prediction
model.predict(correct_timeseries)

print(f"Shape after correction: {correct_timeseries.shape}")
```

This demonstrates a scenario with time series data where an improperly handled dimension might lead to the same error.  The `Reshape` layer is used here to correct the data. This highlights the importance of checking the data structure before feeding it into the model, especially when dealing with data formats that may not be immediately compatible with the expected input shape of the layers.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of CNNs and tensor manipulation in Keras, I recommend consulting the official Keras documentation, particularly sections on convolutional layers and data preprocessing.  Exploring introductory and advanced materials on deep learning frameworks will significantly improve your ability to debug similar issues.  Additionally, leveraging a debugger within your IDE for detailed step-by-step examination of tensor shapes during model execution is invaluable.  Finally, reviewing examples of CNN architectures commonly used for your task will help to learn common practices and potential pitfalls to avoid.
