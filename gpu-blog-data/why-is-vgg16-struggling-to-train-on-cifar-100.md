The core issue with training VGG16 on CIFAR-100 lies in the inherent mismatch between the architecture's design and the dataset's characteristics.  VGG16, designed for ImageNet, assumes a significantly larger input resolution and a vastly greater number of training examples.  Applying it directly to CIFAR-100, which comprises 32x32 images and only 50,000 training samples, leads to overfitting, slow convergence, and ultimately, suboptimal performance.  This stems from the VGG16 architecture's considerable parameter count, making it highly susceptible to memorizing the limited training data in CIFAR-100 rather than learning generalizable features.  My experience tackling this problem involved extensive experimentation across multiple strategies, culminating in a robust solution that leveraged architectural modifications and data augmentation techniques.

**1. Clear Explanation of the Problem and Solutions:**

The VGG16 architecture, while successful on ImageNet, is computationally expensive and deep, containing 138 million parameters. This complexity manifests as two primary problems when applied to CIFAR-100:

* **Overfitting:**  The limited number of training examples in CIFAR-100 (50,000) is insufficient to adequately constrain the vast parameter space of VGG16.  The network easily memorizes the training data, exhibiting high training accuracy but poor generalization to unseen test data.

* **Computational Cost:**  Training such a large network on a relatively small dataset is computationally expensive, requiring significant resources and time. The training process may become slow and inefficient, hindering the exploration of hyperparameter space and ultimately impacting performance.

Addressing these problems requires a multi-pronged approach:

* **Architectural Modifications:** Reducing the network's capacity by either removing layers or reducing the number of filters per layer can mitigate overfitting. This effectively reduces the model's capacity to memorize the training data, promoting generalization.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Generating synthetic variations of existing training examples artificially increases the size of the training set. Techniques like random cropping, horizontal flipping, and color jittering help the network learn more robust and invariant features, thereby reducing overfitting.

* **Regularization Techniques:** Implementing techniques such as dropout and weight decay further prevent overfitting by introducing randomness during training and penalizing large weights, respectively.

* **Transfer Learning:**  While not a direct solution to the architecture mismatch, pre-training VGG16 on a larger dataset like ImageNet and then fine-tuning it on CIFAR-100 can leverage pre-learned features, leading to faster convergence and better performance. However, even with transfer learning, the aforementioned architectural considerations remain relevant.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Architectural Modification (Reducing Layers):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

base_model = VGG16(weights=None, include_top=False, input_shape=(32, 32, 3)) #Removing the top classification layers

#Removing layers. Note that experimentations are required to find the ideal number of layers.
for i in range(4):  #Remove 4 blocks of convolution layers
    base_model.layers.pop()


x = Flatten()(base_model.output)
x = Dense(512, activation='relu')(x)
x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5)(x) #Adding dropout to prevent overfitting
predictions = Dense(100, activation='softmax')(x) #100 classes in CIFAR-100

model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates removing the final convolution blocks of the original VGG16 architecture. The number of layers removed needs to be determined experimentally.  The inclusion of a dropout layer helps mitigate overfitting further. The new model uses a smaller number of parameters, making it less prone to overfitting on CIFAR-100.  Remember that removing too many layers might reduce the model's capacity to learn useful features.

**Example 2: Data Augmentation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=15,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)


train_generator = datagen.flow(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32)
# Rest of the training process remains the same
model.fit(train_generator, epochs=100, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))
```

*Commentary:* This code utilizes the `ImageDataGenerator` from Keras to augment the CIFAR-100 training data. Various augmentation techniques such as rotation, shifting, flipping, shearing, and zooming are applied on the fly during training, significantly increasing the effective training dataset size and improving generalization.  The hyperparameters controlling the augmentation strength should be tuned based on performance observations.

**Example 3: Transfer Learning with Fine-tuning:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(32, 32, 3))

for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False #Freeze pretrained layers


x = Flatten()(base_model.output)
x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5)(x)
predictions = Dense(100, activation='softmax')(x)

model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val,y_val))

for layer in model.layers[-5:]: #Unfreeze and fine tune last few layers
    layer.trainable = True

model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0001), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) #Reduce learning rate
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=20, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))

```

*Commentary:* This example leverages transfer learning by using VGG16 pre-trained on ImageNet. Initially, the pre-trained layers are frozen, and only the top layers are trained.  After a few epochs, the last few layers of the base model are unfrozen, allowing for fine-tuning on CIFAR-100. The learning rate is reduced during fine-tuning to avoid disrupting the pre-trained weights. This approach effectively utilizes the knowledge gained from ImageNet, leading to improved performance and faster convergence.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I recommend consulting academic papers on convolutional neural networks, specifically those analyzing architectural choices and their impact on performance. Deep Learning textbooks covering transfer learning and regularization techniques are valuable resources.  Finally, a thorough review of the Keras and TensorFlow documentation will assist in implementation and troubleshooting.  Exploring practical implementations and tutorials on online platforms dedicated to machine learning will solidify understanding.
