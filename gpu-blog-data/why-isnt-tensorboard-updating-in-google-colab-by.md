TensorBoard's lack of per-batch updates in Google Colab stems primarily from the asynchronous nature of its logging mechanisms and the inherent limitations of Colab's runtime environment.  I've encountered this numerous times during my work on large-scale image classification projects, and the solution isn't simply a matter of changing a configuration flag.  The core issue lies in the interplay between TensorBoard's writer, the Colab kernel's execution model, and the frequency of data flushing.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorBoard operates by writing summary events to log files.  These events, representing metrics like loss, accuracy, and gradients, are generated during training.  The `tf.summary` API, or its equivalent in other frameworks, handles this writing process.  However, this writing isn't instantaneous.  For efficiency, the writers typically buffer events before writing them to disk.  This buffering minimizes the I/O overhead, which is particularly critical in environments with limited resources like Colab instances.  The default behavior is to flush these buffers periodically (e.g., after a certain number of events or a time interval), not necessarily after each batch.  In Colab's ephemeral nature, this asynchronous write operation combined with potential kernel interruptions can lead to a delay or complete omission of per-batch updates in the TensorBoard visualization.

Furthermore, Colab's runtime environment has its own constraints.  The kernel might be preempted for resource allocation or recycling, interrupting the writing process.  Even if the summary events are written to the log files, the TensorBoard server running locally or remotely might not immediately reflect these updates. The server needs to parse the log files, and this process also involves some latency.  Therefore, the absence of real-time, per-batch updates isn't a bug but a consequence of these interacting factors.

**2. Code Examples:**

To illustrate this, let's consider three scenarios with accompanying code snippets and explanations.

**Example 1: Basic Logging with `tf.summary` (TensorFlow):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... model definition ...

# Create a summary writer
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('./logs')

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in range(batches_per_epoch):
        # ... training step ...
        with writer.as_default():
            tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=epoch * batches_per_epoch + batch)
            tf.summary.scalar('accuracy', accuracy, step=epoch * batches_per_epoch + batch)
    # Explicit flush after each epoch for better visualization
    writer.flush()
```

This example demonstrates basic scalar logging using TensorFlow's `tf.summary`. The crucial aspect here is the `writer.flush()` call at the end of each epoch.  While it doesn't guarantee per-batch updates, forcing a flush at the end of each epoch significantly improves the visualization by reducing the buffering delay.  Note that even with this,  there might still be a slight delay due to the asynchronous nature of the writing process and network transfer speeds.

**Example 2:  Manual Buffering Control (TensorFlow):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... model definition ...

writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('./logs')

# Reduce buffering to improve the likelihood of seeing per-batch updates.
# However, this may negatively impact performance significantly
buffer_size = 1 # try 1, or some small value

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in range(batches_per_epoch):
      # ... training step ...
      with writer.as_default():
          tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=epoch * batches_per_epoch + batch)
          # Manual flush after every batch; This will slow down the training. Use cautiously
          writer.flush()
```

Here, I've tried to force more frequent flushes.  While setting `buffer_size` to a low value or even 1 might *appear* to increase the frequency of updates, the substantial performance penalty this introduces usually outweighs the benefit.  The overhead from frequent disk writes can drastically slow down the training process, especially with larger datasets.  This approach is not recommended for production-level training.  It primarily serves as a demonstrative example of directly interacting with the buffer mechanism.

**Example 3:  Using `SummaryWriter` in PyTorch:**

```python
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter

# ... model definition ...

writer = SummaryWriter('./logs')

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in range(batches_per_epoch):
        # ... training step ...
        writer.add_scalar('loss', loss.item(), epoch * batches_per_epoch + batch)
        writer.add_scalar('accuracy', accuracy.item(), epoch * batches_per_epoch + batch)
    # Explicit flush after each epoch for better visualization
    writer.flush()
    writer.close() #Explicitly close the writer at the end of each epoch
```

This example demonstrates a similar approach using PyTorch's `SummaryWriter`.  The key takeaway here remains the same: the `writer.flush()` and `writer.close()` calls at the end of the epoch help to mitigate the issue but donâ€™t fully solve it. The asynchronous nature of the logging remains.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To further understand the intricacies of TensorBoard logging, consult the official TensorBoard documentation for your specific framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).  Pay close attention to sections on customizing the writing process and its impact on performance.  Furthermore, studying asynchronous I/O operations and buffering techniques within the context of Python and your chosen deep learning framework will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms.  Finally, reviewing advanced topics on distributed training and logging within Colab's environment will provide valuable context for optimizing the logging process in distributed settings.  Understanding network latency and Colab's resource limitations is also critical.
