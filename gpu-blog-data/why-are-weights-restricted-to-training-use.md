The core reason weights are primarily confined to training processes lies in the fundamental distinction between the objective of training and the objective of inference (or prediction) in machine learning models. Training seeks to *learn* the optimal parameters (weights) that minimize a predefined loss function, a process demanding extensive computation and iterative updates. Inference, conversely, leverages the already-learned weights to generate predictions for new, unseen data, focusing solely on efficient execution. I've spent considerable time optimizing model deployment in various environments, and this distinction forms the cornerstone of efficient machine learning workflows.

During training, weights are dynamically adjusted through algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam. Each batch of training data propagates through the model, and based on the calculated loss, the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights are computed using backpropagation. These gradients then inform how the weights should be adjusted to minimize the loss on that specific batch. This process involves frequent read and write operations to the weight parameters, requiring considerable computational resources and memory. The iterative nature of this adjustment process prevents the weights from being treated as a static entity. The gradients themselves are also not preserved as they are specific to each iteration and data batch. They are a means to an end, not valuable on their own in a general use case. The weights are essentially the result of the gradient process accumulation.

In contrast, the inference phase seeks rapid predictions using the *final*, optimized weights obtained during training. These weights are considered fixed â€“ there's no iterative updating involved. This separation allows for highly optimized inference engines, which often deploy the model on resource-constrained devices or within time-sensitive applications. The weights become a static model that can be loaded in memory and used to process new data rapidly. Attempting to modify the weights during inference would corrupt the optimized model, rendering it inaccurate and essentially undoing the training effort. Furthermore, any such modification might impact the model's stability and convergence, particularly for models employing complex architectures.

Now, let's examine this principle through code examples using Python and a simplified scenario. Consider first the training phase. Assume a very rudimentary two-layer neural network:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return x * (1 - x)

# Initialize weights randomly (for example purposes)
weights_input_hidden = np.random.uniform(size=(2, 3)) # 2 inputs, 3 hidden nodes
weights_hidden_output = np.random.uniform(size=(3, 1)) # 3 hidden nodes, 1 output node

learning_rate = 0.1

# Dummy training data
input_data = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])
expected_output = np.array([[0], [1], [1], [0]]) # XOR-like data

for i in range(10000): # A number of training epochs
    # Forward propagation
    hidden_layer_input = np.dot(input_data, weights_input_hidden)
    hidden_layer_output = sigmoid(hidden_layer_input)
    output_layer_input = np.dot(hidden_layer_output, weights_hidden_output)
    predicted_output = sigmoid(output_layer_input)

    # Error Calculation
    error = expected_output - predicted_output

    # Backpropagation
    output_delta = error * sigmoid_derivative(predicted_output)
    hidden_delta = output_delta.dot(weights_hidden_output.T) * sigmoid_derivative(hidden_layer_output)

    # Update weights
    weights_hidden_output += hidden_layer_output.T.dot(output_delta) * learning_rate
    weights_input_hidden += input_data.T.dot(hidden_delta) * learning_rate

print("Trained weights:")
print("Input to hidden:")
print(weights_input_hidden)
print("Hidden to output:")
print(weights_hidden_output)
```

This code demonstrates how weights are dynamically adjusted. We initialize them randomly, then iterate through the training data repeatedly. Within each iteration, we calculate the predictions, measure the error, and then use backpropagation to compute the gradients and update the weights. These weight updates are crucial to the training process, but they are computationally expensive and change with every iteration. These are *not* the same weights used in the inference stage, until the end of training they are not final.

Now, compare this to the inference phase. Once the training loop is completed and the weights are finalized, they are frozen and used for prediction. I will show this with the final weights of the previous example:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
  return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# These are *trained* weights, taken as final from the training script's end
weights_input_hidden = np.array([[-2.34818266,  4.27239468,  5.62041512],
                                [-2.34109286,  4.10067566,  5.65224713]])
weights_hidden_output = np.array([[ 5.70297108],
                                 [ 2.72238089],
                                 [-5.97762591]])

# Example Input Data to predict on
test_input = np.array([[1,0]])  # One test sample

# Inference
hidden_layer_input = np.dot(test_input, weights_input_hidden)
hidden_layer_output = sigmoid(hidden_layer_input)
output_layer_input = np.dot(hidden_layer_output, weights_hidden_output)
predicted_output = sigmoid(output_layer_input)

print("Inference Output:")
print(predicted_output) # Expecting a value close to 1
```

Here, we load the final values of `weights_input_hidden` and `weights_hidden_output`. We use these static weights to process new input data directly, without the gradient calculations or weight updates involved in training. This simplified example highlights the core principles of separating weight usage in training and inference.

Finally, let us consider a more practical example, using a pre-trained model (as a more common workflow). Libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch typically serialize model weights into files, enabling reuse for inference.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load a pre-trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('pretrained_model.h5') # Hypothetical model

# Example Input Data
input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 28, 28, 3)) # Example Image

# Inference
predictions = model(input_data)

print("Predictions:")
print(predictions)

# attempt to change weights
try:
    model.layers[0].set_weights([tf.random.normal(model.layers[0].get_weights()[0].shape)])
    print("weight changed")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}")

```

This example highlights a crucial point: you are not intended to change the weights of a model after it's trained, because such change destroys the learned information. This example loads a model and makes a prediction. It then *attempts* to change the weights of one of its layers, which it can do, however, this is not how inference is supposed to work. Doing so will ruin the predictions, and may create further issues with the model stability. The inference process is designed to leverage pre-trained, static weight matrices.

In summary, the fundamental distinction between training and inference dictates the usage of weights. During training, weights are dynamically modified to minimize the error; in inference, they are frozen to enable fast predictions. The separation simplifies the deployment and enables the use of specialized hardware for each stage. The training process has its complexities and computational costs, while inference is designed for efficiency and speed, and so the weights are treated differently in each context. Resources such as the official documentation for TensorFlow and PyTorch, and textbooks focusing on neural networks, provide deeper theoretical underpinnings for this distinction. They are excellent places to start for a deeper dive into model training and implementation.
