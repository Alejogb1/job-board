Precisely measuring the execution time of multiple CUDA kernels necessitates a nuanced approach beyond simply using CUDA's event timers around each kernel launch individually.  Over my years working on high-performance computing projects, I've encountered significant overhead associated with kernel launch latency and data transfer, which significantly impact the accuracy of simple timing mechanisms. This necessitates careful consideration of synchronization and the inclusion of all relevant operations within the timing scope.

The most reliable method involves using CUDA events strategically, bracketing the entire sequence of kernel launches and data transfers.  Treating each kernel in isolation risks omitting the crucial time spent in memory transfers, which often dominate the overall computation time, particularly for applications with complex data dependencies between kernels.  This holistic approach provides a much more accurate representation of the true computational cost.

My approach hinges on the precise placement of CUDA events.  These events mark specific points in the execution stream, allowing for accurate measurement of elapsed time. The `cudaEventRecord()` function records an event on a stream, while `cudaEventElapsedTime()` calculates the time difference between two recorded events. However, simple sequential recording isn't enough.  We need to ensure proper synchronization to avoid race conditions and obtain meaningful results. This is crucial when multiple streams are employed for concurrent kernel execution.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The timing process involves the following steps:

1. **Event Creation:**  Create two CUDA events using `cudaEventCreate()`.  These events, conventionally termed "start" and "stop," mark the beginning and end of the entire kernel execution sequence.  Error checking after each CUDA call is paramount to ensure the reliability of the measurements.

2. **Start Event Recording:** Record the "start" event on the stream where the first kernel is launched using `cudaEventRecord()`.  This is crucial, as it marks the precise point where the entire process begins.

3. **Kernel Launches and Data Transfers:** Execute all CUDA kernels and necessary data transfers (e.g., `cudaMemcpy()`) sequentially or concurrently on designated streams.  Careful planning of data dependencies between kernels is vital to maintain correct execution order.

4. **Stop Event Recording:**  After the final kernel completes and all relevant data transfers are finished, record the "stop" event on the stream containing the final kernel execution using `cudaEventRecord()`.  It's imperative that the "stop" event follows the completion of *all* operations to be timed.  Synchronization mechanisms like `cudaStreamSynchronize()` may be necessary to ensure that all operations on a given stream have completed before recording the "stop" event.

5. **Elapsed Time Calculation:** Use `cudaEventElapsedTime()` to calculate the time elapsed between the "start" and "stop" events. This provides the total execution time, encompassing kernel executions, data transfers, and synchronization overhead.

6. **Event Destruction:**  Cleanly destroy the CUDA events using `cudaEventDestroy()` to release resources.  Failure to do so can lead to resource leaks.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Sequential Kernel Execution**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>

int main() {
  cudaEvent_t start, stop;
  cudaEventCreate(&start);
  cudaEventCreate(&stop);

  // Kernel 1 launch and data transfer
  cudaEventRecord(start, 0); // Record start event on default stream
  // ... Kernel 1 code ...
  // ... Data transfer after Kernel 1 ...

  // Kernel 2 launch and data transfer
  // ... Kernel 2 code ...
  // ... Data transfer after Kernel 2 ...

  cudaEventRecord(stop, 0); // Record stop event on default stream
  cudaEventSynchronize(stop); // Ensure event is recorded before calculating time

  float milliseconds = 0;
  cudaEventElapsedTime(&milliseconds, start, stop);
  std::cout << "Total execution time: " << milliseconds << " ms" << std::endl;

  cudaEventDestroy(start);
  cudaEventDestroy(stop);
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates timing a sequence of kernels executed on the default stream.  The crucial aspect is that the `cudaEventRecord()` calls precisely bracket the entire execution sequence.

**Example 2: Concurrent Kernel Execution using Multiple Streams**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  cudaEvent_t start, stop;
  cudaEventCreate(&start);
  cudaEventCreate(&stop);

  cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);

  cudaEventRecord(start, 0); // Start event on default stream

  // Launch Kernel 1 on stream1
  // ... Kernel 1 launch on stream1 ...

  // Launch Kernel 2 on stream2
  // ... Kernel 2 launch on stream2 ...

  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1); // Ensure stream1 is complete
  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream2); // Ensure stream2 is complete

  cudaEventRecord(stop, 0); // Stop event on default stream
  cudaEventSynchronize(stop);

  float milliseconds = 0;
  cudaEventElapsedTime(&milliseconds, start, stop);
  std::cout << "Total execution time: " << milliseconds << " ms" << std::endl;

  cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);
  cudaEventDestroy(start);
  cudaEventDestroy(stop);
  return 0;
}
```

This example shows how to time concurrent kernel launches using multiple streams.  The `cudaStreamSynchronize()` calls are crucial here to ensure that both streams complete before recording the "stop" event.  Note that the start event is still recorded on the default stream.

**Example 3: Handling Data Transfer Overheads**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // ... event and stream creation ...

  cudaEventRecord(start, 0);

  // Data transfer to GPU
  // ... cudaMemcpy to device ...

  // Kernel Launch
  // ... Kernel 1 ...

  // Data transfer from GPU
  // ... cudaMemcpy from device ...

  cudaEventRecord(stop, 0);
  cudaEventSynchronize(stop);

  // ... time calculation and event destruction ...
  return 0;
}
```

This showcases how to include data transfer operations within the timing scope.  This is especially important since memory transfer times can significantly affect the overall performance, frequently outweighing the pure kernel computation time.  Omitting these operations would yield inaccurate timing results.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA Programming Guide, the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide, and a comprehensive text on parallel computing and GPU programming are essential resources.  Understanding memory management and stream synchronization is critical for accurate and efficient CUDA programming.  Focus on understanding the intricacies of CUDA streams and how they can be used to optimize performance and minimize overhead when working with multiple kernels.  Thorough testing and profiling are invaluable for refining your timing methods and identifying potential bottlenecks.
