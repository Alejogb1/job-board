A discrepancy between Python's `requests` library successfully fetching data via a GET request and the same request failing in Postman frequently stems from subtle differences in how each handles request headers, particularly the `User-Agent` and potentially other headers involved in content negotiation. Over several years of developing RESTful API clients and troubleshooting integration issues, I've consistently observed this behavior pointing to client-specific deviations in the HTTP request composition. The target server often relies on these headers to determine not just the client type, but also its capabilities.

The `requests` library, by default, often sends a `User-Agent` header that identifies itself as a Python-based client, containing information about the Python version and the `requests` library version. Conversely, Postman, unless explicitly configured, usually sends its own `User-Agent` string indicating its identity as a testing application. This difference, while seemingly minor, can have significant ramifications if the server uses the `User-Agent` for various tasks including blocking requests from generic or test clients, content filtering, or serving different types of responses.

Another common source of the inconsistency is how Postman handles request settings related to automatic headers. Postman allows users to define various settings, like "Automatically follow redirects" or "Encoding" which could deviate from the default behavior of `requests` without explicit specification. It's not uncommon to overlook discrepancies in how these behaviors are configured within the tool. Additionally, subtle issues could arise from differences in handling cookies or other specific header values, especially if the server relies on them for authentication or session management.

Here are three illustrative code examples highlighting how these discrepancies can occur and how to address them:

**Example 1: Basic GET Request with Modified User-Agent**

The first example demonstrates the simplest case. Initially, we attempt a GET request using `requests` without modifications. Then, we simulate a scenario where a server might reject a generic `User-Agent` and require a specific browser-like identifier. In this situation, Postman would require explicit `User-Agent` modification to succeed.

```python
import requests

# Initial request using the default User-Agent from requests.
url = "https://example.com/api/data"  # Replace with actual endpoint
response_default = requests.get(url)

if response_default.status_code == 200:
    print("Default requests User-Agent: Success")
else:
    print(f"Default requests User-Agent: Failed, status code: {response_default.status_code}")

# Request with a custom User-Agent mimicking a browser
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36"
}
response_custom = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

if response_custom.status_code == 200:
    print("Custom User-Agent: Success")
else:
    print(f"Custom User-Agent: Failed, status code: {response_custom.status_code}")
```

In this example, the first request may succeed or fail depending on the server's handling of default `requests` header. The second request with the custom `User-Agent` mimics a browser, and is more likely to succeed when dealing with servers enforcing a specific `User-Agent` pattern. This shows the importance of matching headers with server requirements. If this server required the custom `User-Agent`, the Postman request would fail without adding an identical header.

**Example 2: Content Negotiation and Accept Header**

This example demonstrates how the `Accept` header, used for content negotiation, impacts the response. The server might provide different response formats depending on which `Accept` header is sent.

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://example.com/api/data"

# Request with no explicit Accept header.
response_no_accept = requests.get(url)
print("No Accept header, status:", response_no_accept.status_code)
# If response.headers.get('content-type') == 'application/json'
# print(response_no_accept.json()) if it returns JSON

# Request for JSON content with an explicit Accept header
headers_json = {"Accept": "application/json"}
response_json = requests.get(url, headers=headers_json)

print("Accept: application/json, status:", response_json.status_code)
if response_json.status_code == 200:
    try:
      print(json.dumps(response_json.json(), indent=4))
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
      print("Response was not JSON despite Content-Type.")

# Request for XML content with Accept header
headers_xml = {"Accept": "application/xml"}
response_xml = requests.get(url, headers=headers_xml)
print("Accept: application/xml, status:", response_xml.status_code)
# Handle XML if successful

```

This illustrates how specifying an `Accept` header impacts the response and how a server might handle requests with varying `Accept` headers, returning JSON or XML. The server might default to a content type that `requests` handles gracefully but might not have been selected by the Postman configuration leading to apparent failures. Postman requires you to explicitly add headers to replicate this behavior.

**Example 3: Cookies and Session Handling**

This example illustrates a scenario where a server relies on cookies for session management, causing discrepancies when they are not handled correctly.

```python
import requests

url = "https://example.com/api/securedata"

# No cookies initially
response_no_cookie = requests.get(url)
print("No cookies, Status:", response_no_cookie.status_code)

# Assume first successful request sets a cookie
session = requests.Session()
response_first = session.get(url)
print("Initial request status:", response_first.status_code)
if response_first.status_code == 200:
    response_with_cookie = session.get(url)
    print("Request with cookie, Status:", response_with_cookie.status_code)

```

This example highlights that the `requests` library can maintain sessions by automatically handling cookies. Without using a `Session` object, the cookies aren't persisted. If a server expects a specific cookie for authentication or tracking, then Postman, without cookie support explicitly turned on, might fail while the python session would succeed. Likewise, if the server *rejects* cookies sent from a testing tool, this would be another case where Postman and Python might show opposite behavior.

To diagnose a discrepancy, itâ€™s important to inspect the raw HTTP requests generated by both Python and Postman. Tools like Wireshark can be invaluable for capturing and comparing the exact requests being sent. Comparing each header and the overall request structure helps to pinpoint the source of the problem. Often, the issue is not within the actual API but in how the requests are assembled, particularly concerning the `User-Agent`, `Accept`, and cookie handling.

I would recommend exploring the documentation for both `requests` and Postman as your first resource. Specifically, sections discussing `requests` custom headers and session management and Postman's headers, request settings, and cookie handling are crucial for troubleshooting. In addition to that, understanding HTTP specifications for headers is key for understanding what each header does and how it could impact your request behavior. If you are working with any particular frameworks on the backend, reading their sections on content-negotiation and error handling may also be beneficial. Remember, the key lies in meticulously recreating the exact conditions under which the Python script is succeeding when using Postman.
