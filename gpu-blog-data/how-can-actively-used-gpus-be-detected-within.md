TensorFlow's `MirroredStrategy` provides a straightforward mechanism for distributing training across multiple GPUs, but identifying which GPUs are *actively* utilized during a specific training run requires a nuanced approach beyond simply checking available devices.  My experience developing large-scale neural network models for natural language processing highlighted the importance of this distinction;  a seemingly available GPU might be occupied by another process, leading to unexpected performance bottlenecks or even outright failures.  Therefore, effective GPU utilization monitoring necessitates inspecting the strategy's internal device assignment during execution.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`MirroredStrategy` distributes variables and operations across available GPUs, replicating them to ensure parallel processing. However, the strategy itself doesn't directly expose a list of *actively* used devices.  Instead, it assigns devices based on their availability at the time of strategy instantiation.  The crucial point is that the assigned devices might not all be actively utilized throughout the entire training process, particularly if the model architecture or data pipeline exhibits uneven computational demands across different GPUs.  For instance, a layer involving large matrix multiplications could heavily load one GPU while another remains relatively idle.


To determine which GPUs are actively involved, we must examine the device placement of individual operations *during* the training process.  This can be achieved through TensorFlow's profiling tools or by incorporating custom logging mechanisms within the training loop to track the device assigned to each operation.  Profiling tools offer a comprehensive overview, whereas custom logging offers more granular control and tailored insights relevant to specific parts of the model.  However, both require modification of the training script.  Simply querying available devices prior to `MirroredStrategy` initialization will not reveal the dynamic device utilization throughout the training process.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Utilizing TensorFlow Profiler**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

# ... Your model definition and training loop ...

profiler = tf.profiler.Profiler(graph=strategy.extended.master_session.graph)

# Profile during a specific step or epoch
profiler.profile_name_scope('training_step_100')
profiler.add_step(100)  #Replace with your step number.

profiler.serialize_to_file('profile_log') # Generates a profile file for analysis.


# Post-processing using the profiler tool (TensorBoard)
```

This example leverages TensorFlow's built-in profiler.  It records the execution profile during a specific training step (e.g., step 100). The generated profile log can then be visualized and analyzed using TensorBoard, providing detailed information on device usage, memory allocation, and operation execution times, allowing for identification of actively used GPUs.  Note that profiling adds overhead, so it's not suitable for continuous monitoring during prolonged training runs.  It's best used for targeted analysis of specific training phases or performance bottlenecks.


**Example 2: Custom Logging of Device Placement**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

def log_device(op):
  print(f"Operation {op.name} placed on device: {op.device}")

with strategy.scope():
  # ... Model definition ...
  for op in tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph().get_operations():
      log_device(op)


# ... Training loop ...
```

This example demonstrates a custom logging mechanism.  It iterates through the operations in the TensorFlow graph after model definition and prints the device assigned to each operation. This provides a static snapshot of device placement before training commences.  While not revealing dynamic shifts in device usage during the training loop itself, this method effectively shows the initial device allocation by the `MirroredStrategy`, potentially uncovering imbalances in model architecture that may lead to uneven GPU usage.  To track dynamic changes, the `log_device` function would need integration within the training loop, potentially after each batch or epoch.


**Example 3:  Enhanced Custom Logging with Dynamic Tracking**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

active_gpus = set()

def log_device_dynamic(op):
  global active_gpus
  active_gpus.add(op.device)
  print(f"Operation {op.name} placed on device: {op.device} at step {step}")


with strategy.scope():
  # ... Model definition ...

# ... Training loop ...
for step, (x, y) in enumerate(dataset):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      # ... forward pass ...
      for op in tape.watched_variables(): # track gradients
          log_device_dynamic(op)
      # ... loss calculation ...
    # ... backward pass and optimization ...
    print(f"Active GPUs at step {step}: {active_gpus}")
```

This enhanced approach integrates the custom logging directly into the training loop.  The `active_gpus` set dynamically tracks the devices used during each training step.  The crucial change lies in the inclusion of `log_device_dynamic` within the training loop, called during each step.  By inspecting the `active_gpus` set after each step (or at intervals), we get a dynamic view of GPU utilization, capturing the variability across the training run.  This approach necessitates a modification of the training loop, adding some computational overhead; however, it provides granular insights into the dynamic GPU usage profile.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides detailed explanations of `MirroredStrategy` and its functionalities.  Thorough exploration of the TensorFlow Profiler's capabilities and its integration with TensorBoard is invaluable.  Studying examples of distributed training within the TensorFlow tutorials and examining various techniques for custom logging within TensorFlow graphs will be beneficial.  Finally, consultation of research papers focusing on large-scale model training and performance optimization, particularly those dealing with GPU utilization analysis, would significantly improve understanding of the complex dynamics involved.
