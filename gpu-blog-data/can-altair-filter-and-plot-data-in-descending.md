The Altair visualization library, while powerful, doesn't directly support sorting data within its plotting functions based on a pre-calculated sum.  This limitation necessitates a preprocessing step where data is aggregated and sorted prior to feeding it into Altair. My experience working with large-scale data analysis pipelines has highlighted the efficiency gains from this approach, avoiding computationally expensive sorting operations within the plotting process itself.

**1.  Explanation:**

Altair's strength lies in declarative data visualization.  You describe the visual encoding (marks, channels, etc.) and Altair handles the rendering.  It doesn't inherently manage data transformations such as sorting based on external calculations (like a sum X).  Therefore, the workflow needs to be broken into distinct steps:

a) **Data Aggregation:**  Calculate the sum X for each relevant grouping in your dataset. This often involves using Pandas or similar data manipulation libraries.  The aggregation function will depend on the structure of your data;  it might involve `groupby()` and `sum()` operations.

b) **Data Sorting:**  After aggregation, sort the resulting data based on the calculated sum X in descending order.  This is typically accomplished using Pandas' `sort_values()` function.

c) **Data Visualization:**  Finally, pass the pre-sorted, aggregated data to Altair for plotting.  This ensures Altair receives data already structured for the desired visual representation.

Failure to separate these steps leads to inefficient processing and potentially incorrect visualizations.  Altair is optimized for visualization; it's not a general-purpose data manipulation tool.  Using Pandas or similar for preprocessing allows for cleaner, more manageable code and improved performance.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Simple Bar Chart of Summed Values**

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = {'Category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'],
        'Value': [10, 20, 15, 5, 25, 10]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Aggregate and sort
df_agg = df.groupby('Category')['Value'].sum().reset_index()
df_agg = df_agg.sort_values('Value', ascending=False)

# Altair chart
chart = alt.Chart(df_agg).mark_bar().encode(
    x='Category:N',
    y='Value:Q'
)
chart.show()
```

This example showcases a basic workflow.  First, the data is grouped by 'Category' and the sum of 'Value' is calculated for each category. Then, `sort_values()` arranges the categories in descending order based on their sum. Finally, Altair generates a bar chart representing the sorted data.


**Example 2:  Handling Multiple Aggregations**

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = {'Category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'],
        'Value1': [10, 20, 15, 5, 25, 10],
        'Value2': [5, 10, 12, 8, 15, 7]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)


# Aggregate and sort by the sum of Value1 and Value2
df_agg = df.groupby('Category').agg({'Value1': 'sum', 'Value2': 'sum'}).reset_index()
df_agg['Total'] = df_agg['Value1'] + df_agg['Value2']
df_agg = df_agg.sort_values('Total', ascending=False)

# Altair chart showing both Value1 and Value2
chart = alt.Chart(df_agg).mark_bar().encode(
    x='Category:N',
    y='Total:Q',
    color='Category:N'
).properties(title='Sum of Value1 and Value2 by Category')
chart.show()

```

This expands on Example 1 by including multiple aggregated columns ('Value1' and 'Value2').  A new 'Total' column is created representing the sum of these two columns and then used as the basis for sorting.


**Example 3:  More Complex Data Structure**

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

# Sample data with nested structure (replace with your actual data)
data = {'Region': ['North', 'South', 'East', 'West'],
        'City': [['CityA', 'CityB'], ['CityC', 'CityD'], ['CityE'], ['CityF', 'CityG', 'CityH']],
        'Sales': [100, 150, 80, 200]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Explode the nested City column
df_exploded = df.explode('City').reset_index(drop=True)

# Aggregate and sort
df_agg = df_exploded.groupby('City')['Sales'].sum().reset_index()
df_agg = df_agg.sort_values('Sales', ascending=False)

# Altair chart
chart = alt.Chart(df_agg).mark_bar().encode(
    x='City:N',
    y='Sales:Q'
).properties(title='Sales by City (Sorted Descending)')

chart.show()
```

This final example demonstrates handling a more complex data structure. The 'City' column contains lists, necessitating the use of `explode()` to create a single row per city before aggregation and sorting. This highlights the importance of preprocessing for effectively using Altair with diverse data layouts.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further exploration, I recommend consulting the official Altair documentation, particularly the sections on data transformations and encoding.  A comprehensive guide on Pandas data manipulation would also be beneficial for mastering the preprocessing aspects.  Finally, a general textbook on data visualization principles can provide a valuable theoretical foundation.  Understanding these resources will empower you to tackle far more intricate data visualization challenges.
