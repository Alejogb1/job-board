Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), a metric designed to assess the perceived quality between two images, presents a unique challenge when evaluating the performance of multi-input, multi-output Keras models. Traditional Keras metrics, often computed on a per-output basis, struggle with the holistic nature of SSIM, particularly when applied to outputs with varying spatial characteristics or when the overall structural relationships between inputs and outputs are of importance. My work in developing a video upscaling model, a multi-input (low-resolution frames, optical flow) and multi-output (high-resolution frames) system, required careful consideration of how SSIM could be integrated into the evaluation process. The issue stems from SSIM's requirement for two complete images for comparison, while a Keras model produces outputs that must be matched against corresponding ground truths.

Calculating SSIM for such models cannot rely directly on Keras' built-in metrics. We must define a custom metric function that operates after the model's predictions and the ground truth targets are processed. The core of this function will leverage an existing SSIM implementation from a library like `TensorFlow` or `skimage`. The fundamental challenge is to pair the predicted outputs with their corresponding ground truths and then compute the SSIM for each pair. These individual SSIM values can then be averaged, or otherwise aggregated, to provide an overall measure of model performance.

I've found it effective to implement the metric in three key steps: data preparation, the core SSIM computation, and output aggregation. Data preparation involves ensuring that model outputs and ground truths are in a suitable format, often as TensorFlow tensors, and that any necessary reshaping or rescaling is done to make the inputs compatible with the chosen SSIM implementation. The core SSIM calculation applies the chosen SSIM function to each prediction-target pair and collects the results. Output aggregation then consolidates these individual SSIM scores into a single metric suitable for use within Keras.

Let’s consider three progressively complex implementations, showcasing how one might approach this problem.

**Example 1: Single Output, Basic SSIM**

This is the simplest scenario and serves as a foundation. Assume our model has one output, and both the predicted output and ground truth are single images:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_ssim(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Calculates SSIM for a single output model.

    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth tensor.
        y_pred: Predicted tensor.

    Returns:
        Average SSIM value across the batch.
    """

    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.image.ssim(y_true, y_pred, max_val=1.0))


# Example Usage within model compilation:
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=[custom_ssim])
```

In this case, `tf.image.ssim` is used directly. We expect `y_true` and `y_pred` to have the same dimensions: `(batch_size, height, width, channels)`. The `max_val` parameter should be set according to the image value range, typically `1.0` for images scaled to [0,1].  `tf.reduce_mean` computes the average SSIM value across the batch, providing a single scalar value. This approach works well if the model is producing a single image as its output.

**Example 2: Multi-Output, Independent SSIM**

Now, let's consider a scenario with multiple outputs where each output is an image and must be evaluated independently:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def multi_output_ssim(y_true, y_pred):
    """
     Calculates SSIM for a multi-output model, averaging SSIM per output.

    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth list of tensors.
        y_pred: Predicted list of tensors.

    Returns:
       Average SSIM across all outputs.
    """
    ssim_values = []
    for true_output, pred_output in zip(y_true, y_pred):
         ssim_values.append(tf.reduce_mean(tf.image.ssim(true_output, pred_output, max_val=1.0)))
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.stack(ssim_values))

# Example Usage within model compilation (assuming y_true and y_pred are lists)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=[multi_output_ssim])
```

This function expects `y_true` and `y_pred` to be lists of tensors, where each element corresponds to a specific output. We iterate through the outputs, computing SSIM for each pair and appending to a list. The final `tf.reduce_mean` calculates the average SSIM across all the outputs.  This method is suitable when we want to treat each output as an independent image and evaluate them separately. For the video upscaling model, this might apply if we were independently assessing the quality of separate high-resolution frame outputs.

**Example 3: Multi-Input, Multi-Output, SSIM Aggregation**

Finally, consider the case of our video upscaling model, where multiple inputs contribute to multiple outputs, and we wish to represent this more complex structure:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def aggregated_ssim(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Calculates SSIM for multi-input, multi-output. Aggregate individual
    output SSIMs using a weighted approach.

    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth list of lists of tensors (grouped by input).
        y_pred: Predicted list of lists of tensors (grouped by input).

    Returns:
        Aggregated SSIM weighted by input groups.
    """
    total_ssim = 0.0
    total_weight = 0.0

    for true_input_group, pred_input_group in zip(y_true, y_pred): # Iterate through input groups
        group_ssim = []
        for true_output, pred_output in zip(true_input_group, pred_input_group): # Iterate through outputs within the group.
            group_ssim.append(tf.reduce_mean(tf.image.ssim(true_output, pred_output, max_val=1.0)))
        
        # Add weighting to individual groups. In this case, all the same weight.
        group_weight = 1.0/len(y_true) # Equal weight for all inputs
        total_ssim += tf.reduce_mean(tf.stack(group_ssim)) * group_weight
        total_weight += group_weight

    return total_ssim / total_weight


# Example Usage: Model produces and is trained on an input set of sequential low-resolution frames.
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=[aggregated_ssim])
```
In this more sophisticated function,  `y_true` and `y_pred` are lists of lists of tensors. Each nested list corresponds to an input group. For example, if there were three consecutive low-resolution frames contributing to the generation of 3 high-resolution frames, then there would be 3 nested lists in both the `y_true` and `y_pred` variables. Each of these inner lists contains the predicted and ground truth outputs corresponding to a specific input group. The inner loops perform SSIM calculations for each predicted-target pair. The outer loop, in this example, sums the average SSIM score for each input group with a weighting factor. Here, I am using an equal weighting for each input group; however, the `group_weight` variable can be adjusted to fine-tune the relative importance of each input group. This flexible approach can accommodate models with different numbers of inputs and outputs while ensuring the overall structural similarity is measured effectively.

These examples highlight that calculating SSIM for multi-input, multi-output models requires careful construction of a custom metric function. The core concept remains the same: compute SSIM for each predicted-target pair and then aggregate these scores to produce a single metric. The complexity arises in how these pairings are established and how the individual SSIM values are combined. Choosing the right aggregation method will depend on the specific model architecture and the desired behavior of the metric. It is critical to tailor the metric function according to the way that the model produces outputs and to carefully interpret the metric’s resulting values in light of this implementation.

For further exploration, I would recommend consulting the TensorFlow documentation on `tf.image.ssim`, as well as exploring the `skimage.metrics` module, which provides a similar implementation in a scikit-image context. Understanding the underlying mathematics of the SSIM algorithm, typically outlined in the original research papers, can also provide additional insights and aid in proper usage. Reading related posts and technical discussions on communities such as Stack Overflow, particularly those focused on image analysis and deep learning metrics, provides valuable practical perspectives. Finally, consider researching advanced image quality metrics beyond SSIM, such as those based on human visual perception.
