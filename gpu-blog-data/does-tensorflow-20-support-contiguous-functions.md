TensorFlow 2.0's handling of contiguous operations is nuanced and depends heavily on the context.  While it doesn't offer a direct, dedicated "contiguous function" primitive in the same way some lower-level array libraries might, the concept of contiguous memory allocation and its impact on performance is central to achieving optimal efficiency within the framework.  My experience optimizing large-scale deep learning models has taught me that understanding TensorFlow's memory management and leveraging its capabilities indirectly is crucial for realizing contiguous-like behavior.

**1. Explanation:**

TensorFlow, particularly in its eager execution mode (the default in 2.0), doesn't explicitly guarantee contiguous memory layout for tensors unless specific measures are taken.  The primary reason is TensorFlow's flexibility. It aims to handle diverse data structures and operations efficiently, sometimes involving dynamic tensor shapes and operations that can lead to non-contiguous allocations.  This flexibility comes at the cost of potentially fragmented memory.  However, several strategies help mitigate this:

* **`tf.reshape` and `tf.transpose` with careful consideration:** These operations can rearrange data in memory, but improper use might result in non-contiguous tensors.  If used correctly, they allow restructuring data for better cache locality, mimicking contiguous access patterns.  The key is to understand how these functions affect memory layout. For instance, reshaping a tensor to be row-major (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) significantly impacts data access speed, particularly when used with subsequent matrix operations.

* **`tf.Tensor.numpy()` and NumPy:**  For computationally intensive operations on smaller tensors where performance is paramount, converting tensors to NumPy arrays (`tf.Tensor.numpy()`) allows leveraging NumPy's optimized routines which often benefit from contiguous memory.  However, this involves data transfer overhead, making it inefficient for extremely large tensors or situations requiring frequent TensorFlow-NumPy conversions.

* **`tf.data.Dataset` with appropriate optimization:**  When dealing with large datasets, utilizing `tf.data.Dataset` pipelines and its associated optimization strategies is crucial. Methods like `prefetch`, `map`, and `batch` can improve data throughput and reduce the frequency of non-contiguous memory accesses.  Properly configuring buffer sizes and prefetching strategies can lead to efficient data loading and processing, effectively simulating contiguous data access.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating Reshape for Contiguous-like Access**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Non-contiguous tensor (Example: result of a sparse operation)
tensor_non_contiguous = tf.sparse.to_dense(tf.sparse.SparseTensor([[0,0],[1,1],[2,2]],[10,20,30],[3,3]))

# Reshape to enforce row-major contiguous memory layout
tensor_contiguous = tf.reshape(tensor_non_contiguous, [9]) 

# Verify shape and data; Note: this only checks the order, not memory layout explicitly.
print(tensor_contiguous.shape)
print(tensor_contiguous.numpy())

# Subsequent operations on tensor_contiguous are likely to be faster.
result = tf.reduce_sum(tensor_contiguous)
print(result.numpy())
```

*Commentary:* This example shows how `tf.reshape` can restructure a potentially non-contiguous tensor into a 1D array with a contiguous layout.  While it doesn't guarantee absolute contiguity at the memory level, the linear arrangement optimizes subsequent operations.  Verification is done through NumPy for illustrative purposes; more sophisticated memory inspection tools might be needed for deeper analysis.

**Example 2:  Leveraging NumPy for Small-scale Operations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# TensorFlow tensor
tensor_tf = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Convert to NumPy array
tensor_np = tensor_tf.numpy()

# Perform NumPy operations (often optimized for contiguous arrays)
result_np = np.dot(tensor_np, tensor_np.T)

# Convert back to TensorFlow tensor if necessary
result_tf = tf.constant(result_np)

print(result_tf)
```

*Commentary:* This demonstrates the use of NumPy for matrix multiplication. NumPy typically operates on arrays with contiguous memory layout, making this approach faster for smaller tensors.  The overhead of conversion between TensorFlow tensors and NumPy arrays needs to be considered, especially when handling extensive data exchange.

**Example 3: Optimizing Data Loading with `tf.data.Dataset`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.random.uniform([1000, 100]))

# Optimize the dataset pipeline
dataset = dataset.batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE) #Batching and prefetching

# Process the dataset
for batch in dataset:
    # Operations on 'batch' will likely benefit from improved data locality.
    processed_batch = tf.math.reduce_mean(batch, axis=1)
    #Process processed batch
```

*Commentary:* This illustrates the optimization of data loading using `tf.data.Dataset`.  `batch` and `prefetch` improve data locality. `AUTOTUNE` lets TensorFlow determine the optimal prefetch buffer size dynamically, adapting to the system's resources.  This reduces the likelihood of frequent memory accesses to scattered data points, effectively simulating a contiguous data stream.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections on memory management,  `tf.data`, and performance optimization, are invaluable resources.  Advanced topics like custom operators and memory allocation strategies, covered in more specialized TensorFlow literature and research papers, can further enhance understanding and provide more fine-grained control.  Finally, understanding linear algebra and the memory layout implications of different matrix operations is fundamental to optimizing TensorFlow performance for large-scale projects.  A strong foundation in NumPy's efficient array manipulation techniques is also beneficial.
