The core challenge in implementing the Taylor expansion of cos(x) + 1 using TensorFlow lies not in the mathematical formulation itself, but in optimizing the computation for efficiency and numerical stability, particularly for large numbers of terms or unusual input ranges.  My experience developing high-performance numerical computation libraries has highlighted the critical role of careful consideration of these factors.  Directly translating the mathematical formula into TensorFlow code can lead to performance bottlenecks and inaccuracies.

The Taylor expansion of cos(x) around x=0 is given by:

cos(x) = Σ (from n=0 to ∞) [(-1)^n * x^(2n)] / (2n)!

Therefore, cos(x) + 1 becomes:

cos(x) + 1 = 1 + Σ (from n=0 to ∞) [(-1)^n * x^(2n)] / (2n)!

Implementing this in TensorFlow necessitates a careful approach to handle the summation efficiently.  A naive implementation using a simple loop can be computationally expensive, especially for high-order approximations.  Furthermore,  the factorial term (2n)! can lead to numerical overflow for larger values of n.  Therefore, strategies to mitigate these issues are crucial.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The most efficient approach involves utilizing TensorFlow's vectorization capabilities and employing techniques to avoid explicit factorial calculations.  We can compute the terms iteratively, leveraging the relationship between successive terms.  Specifically, the (n+1)th term can be calculated from the nth term using a recursive formula.  This avoids repeated calculations and reduces computational overhead significantly.  Additionally, employing TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities can further enhance efficiency in gradient-based computations.  Moreover, appropriate data types (e.g., tf.float64 for higher precision) must be selected to minimize numerical errors, particularly for larger values of x.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Iterative Implementation**

This example showcases an iterative approach, calculating each term and adding it to the running sum.  It avoids explicit factorial calculations, instead computing the next term based on the previous one.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def taylor_cos_plus_one_iterative(x, num_terms):
  """
  Computes cos(x) + 1 using iterative Taylor expansion.

  Args:
    x: TensorFlow tensor representing the input value.
    num_terms: The number of terms in the Taylor expansion.

  Returns:
    TensorFlow tensor representing cos(x) + 1.
  """
  x = tf.cast(x, tf.float64) # Ensure high precision
  result = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float64)
  term = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float64)
  for n in range(1, num_terms):
    term *= -x*x / ((2*n -1) * (2*n)) #Efficient recursive term calculation
    result += term
  return result

# Example usage:
x = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float64)
num_terms = 10
approximation = taylor_cos_plus_one_iterative(x, num_terms)
print(f"Approximation of cos(1.0) + 1 with {num_terms} terms: {approximation.numpy()}")
```

**Example 2:  TensorFlow's `tf.while_loop` for Dynamic Computation**

This example demonstrates a more flexible approach using `tf.while_loop`, allowing for dynamic determination of the number of terms based on a convergence criterion rather than a fixed number.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def taylor_cos_plus_one_dynamic(x, tolerance=1e-8):
  """
  Computes cos(x) + 1 using dynamic Taylor expansion with a convergence criterion.

  Args:
    x: TensorFlow tensor representing the input value.
    tolerance: The convergence tolerance.

  Returns:
    TensorFlow tensor representing cos(x) + 1.
  """
  x = tf.cast(x, tf.float64)
  result = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float64)
  term = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float64)
  n = tf.constant(1, dtype=tf.int32)
  
  def condition(n, result, term):
    return tf.greater(tf.abs(term), tolerance)

  def body(n, result, term):
    term *= -x*x / ((2*n -1) * (2*n))
    result += term
    return n + 1, result, term

  _, result, _ = tf.while_loop(condition, body, [n, result, term])
  return result

# Example usage:
x = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float64)
approximation = taylor_cos_plus_one_dynamic(x)
print(f"Approximation of cos(1.0) + 1 with dynamic terms: {approximation.numpy()}")
```


**Example 3:  Using `tf.math.cos` for Comparison and Validation**

This example employs TensorFlow's built-in `tf.math.cos` function to compare the accuracy of the Taylor expansion against a highly optimized implementation.  This serves as a validation step, essential in numerical computation to ensure the accuracy of the custom implementation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float64)
num_terms = 10
approximation_iterative = taylor_cos_plus_one_iterative(x, num_terms)
approximation_dynamic = taylor_cos_plus_one_dynamic(x)
true_value = tf.math.cos(x) + 1.0

print(f"Iterative Approximation: {approximation_iterative.numpy()}")
print(f"Dynamic Approximation: {approximation_dynamic.numpy()}")
print(f"True Value: {true_value.numpy()}")
print(f"Iterative Error: {tf.abs(approximation_iterative - true_value).numpy()}")
print(f"Dynamic Error: {tf.abs(approximation_dynamic - true_value).numpy()}")
```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of numerical computation in TensorFlow, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically focusing on sections related to automatic differentiation and optimization techniques.   Furthermore, texts on numerical analysis and scientific computing offer valuable insights into the intricacies of approximating functions and managing numerical errors. Finally, reviewing research papers focusing on efficient implementations of Taylor expansions within machine learning frameworks would prove beneficial.  This multi-pronged approach will equip you with the necessary knowledge to tackle more complex numerical challenges within TensorFlow.
