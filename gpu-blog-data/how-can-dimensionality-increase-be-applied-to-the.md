The inherent limitation of the MNIST dataset, its two-dimensional nature representing grayscale pixel intensity, often necessitates dimensionality increase for improved performance in certain machine learning tasks.  This is particularly true when employing models sensitive to feature representation or tackling problems beyond simple image classification. My experience working on anomaly detection within handwritten digit images highlighted this need acutely.  Directly feeding the raw 28x28 pixel data to a model often resulted in suboptimal results compared to approaches that leveraged richer feature spaces.

**1. Clear Explanation of Dimensionality Increase Techniques for MNIST:**

Dimensionality increase in the context of MNIST involves transforming the 784-dimensional feature vector (28x28 pixels) into a higher-dimensional representation.  This isn't about simply adding noise; it's about generating new features that capture more nuanced information about the handwritten digits. Several strategies exist to achieve this.

* **Kernel Methods:**  Methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with appropriate kernel functions implicitly map the data into a higher-dimensional space.  The kernel function defines this mapping without explicitly computing the high-dimensional representation.  Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels are a common choice, allowing for non-linear separation in the original space by mapping into a high-dimensional feature space where linear separation is possible.  This is computationally efficient as the mapping is implicit.  However, the choice of kernel parameters (e.g., gamma in RBF) significantly impacts performance.

* **Explicit Feature Engineering:** This involves creating new features from the existing pixel data. This could include:
    * **Statistical Features:** Calculating features such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of pixel intensities across different regions of the image. These capture higher-order statistics of the pixel distribution.
    * **Wavelet Transforms:** Decomposing the image into different frequency bands using wavelet transforms provides features representing different levels of detail. This is especially useful for capturing subtle variations in stroke thickness and curvature.
    * **Gabor Filters:** Applying Gabor filters of different orientations and frequencies generates features representing edges and textures at different scales.  This captures directional information absent in simple pixel intensity.

* **Autoencoders:**  Deep learning offers the possibility of learning a higher-dimensional representation using autoencoders.  An autoencoder consists of an encoder that maps the input to a latent space of higher dimensionality, and a decoder that reconstructs the input from the latent representation.  By forcing the autoencoder to reconstruct the input accurately, we encourage the latent representation to capture essential information, potentially in a more effective way than manually engineered features.  The bottleneck layer of the encoder represents the higher-dimensional features.  Variations like variational autoencoders (VAEs) introduce probabilistic elements for better generalization and latent space exploration.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Feature Engineering using Statistical Features**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load MNIST dataset
mnist = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1)
X, y = mnist["data"], mnist["target"]

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature engineering: Calculate mean and variance of pixel intensities
def add_stats(X):
    mean = np.mean(X, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    variance = np.var(X, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    return np.concatenate((X, mean, variance), axis=1)

X_train_ext = add_stats(X_train)
X_test_ext = add_stats(X_test)

# Subsequent model training...
```

This example demonstrates simple statistical feature engineering.  Mean and variance of pixel intensities are added as new features, increasing the dimensionality of the dataset.  More sophisticated statistical features could be incorporated for richer representation.

**Example 2:  Applying Gabor Filters**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml

# ... (Load MNIST data as in Example 1) ...

def apply_gabor(image):
    gabor_features = []
    for theta in np.arange(0, np.pi, np.pi / 4):
        for ksize in (3, 5, 7):
            kern = cv2.getGaborKernel((ksize, ksize), 1, theta, 10, 0.5, 0, ktype=cv2.CV_32F)
            filtered_img = cv2.filter2D(image.reshape(28, 28), cv2.CV_32F, kern)
            gabor_features.extend(filtered_img.flatten())
    return np.array(gabor_features)

extended_X_train = np.array([apply_gabor(img) for img in X_train])
extended_X_test = np.array([apply_gabor(img) for img in X_test])

# ... (Subsequent model training...)
```

This example uses Gabor filters to extract texture features.  The resulting features significantly increase the dimensionality of the dataset, capturing information about orientation and frequency.  Efficient implementation might require parallelization for large datasets.  Careful selection of Gabor filter parameters (ksize, theta) is crucial.


**Example 3:  Using an Autoencoder for Dimensionality Increase**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, Reshape
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
# ... (Load MNIST data as in Example 1) ...

# Define the autoencoder architecture (example with increased dimensionality)
input_img = Input(shape=(784,))
encoded = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(input_img)  # Increased dimensionality
decoded = Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')(encoded)
autoencoder = Model(input_img, decoded)
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Train the autoencoder
autoencoder.fit(X_train, X_train, epochs=50, batch_size=256, shuffle=True, validation_data=(X_test, X_test))

# Extract the higher-dimensional representation (encoded features)
encoder = Model(input_img, encoded)
X_train_encoded = encoder.predict(X_train)
X_test_encoded = encoder.predict(X_test)

# ... (Subsequent model training with X_train_encoded and X_test_encoded) ...

```

This example utilizes a simple autoencoder to learn a higher-dimensional representation (1024 dimensions). The latent space representation captures compressed, yet potentially more informative features.  The architecture and training parameters significantly impact the quality of the learned representation.  Experimentation with different architectures, activation functions, and optimizers is essential.
