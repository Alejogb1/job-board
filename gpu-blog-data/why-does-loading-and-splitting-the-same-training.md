The discrepancy in model performance stemming from seemingly identical training data loading and splitting procedures often originates from variations in the random seed used during the data shuffling process.  In my experience debugging inconsistencies across model training runs, failing to explicitly set the random seed across all relevant functions – particularly data loaders and splitting utilities – is a common oversight.  This seemingly minor detail significantly impacts reproducibility, leading to variations in the training and validation sets, and consequently, distinct model outputs.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue lies in the inherent randomness of most data splitting techniques. Libraries like scikit-learn’s `train_test_split` or TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset.shuffle` utilize pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs).  These PRNGs produce deterministic sequences of numbers, but their output is contingent upon an initial value, the "seed".  If the seed is not explicitly defined, the system employs a default seed, typically derived from the system clock or other sources of unpredictable entropy.  This means that each run of your code will generate a different sequence, resulting in a different shuffling of your data. Consequently, the resulting training and validation sets, though derived from the same dataset, will possess different compositions. This variation leads directly to differing model training dynamics and ultimately, different model performances.  Furthermore, even seemingly minor changes in the overall execution environment (e.g., different processor cores, operating systems, or even library versions) can subtly affect the PRNG’s behavior, further compounding the problem.

Moreover, the process isn't limited to the initial split. Many training methodologies involve further data augmentation or preprocessing steps that may themselves introduce randomness. If these steps also lack explicit seed setting, the variability will be further amplified, obscuring the actual effects of your model's architecture and hyperparameters.  One often forgets that even deterministic operations can be influenced by the order of data, particularly when using methods sensitive to data distribution.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inconsistent `train_test_split` Usage:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = np.random.rand(100, 10) # Feature data
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100) # Target variable

# Inconsistent seed usage:
X_train1, X_test1, y_train1, y_test1 = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
X_train2, X_test2, y_train2, y_test2 = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Verify inconsistency:
print(np.array_equal(X_train1, X_train2)) # Likely False
```

This example demonstrates the inherent randomness of `train_test_split`.  Without a specified `random_state`, each invocation will produce a different split.  Adding `random_state=42` (or any other integer) ensures consistent results across multiple executions.

**Example 2:  Reproducible Data Shuffling with TensorFlow:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

data = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

# Inconsistent shuffling:
shuffled_data1 = data.shuffle(buffer_size=10) # Default seed
shuffled_data2 = data.shuffle(buffer_size=10) # Default seed, different order

# Consistent shuffling:
shuffled_data3 = data.shuffle(buffer_size=10, seed=42)
shuffled_data4 = data.shuffle(buffer_size=10, seed=42)

# Verify:  Note that `reshuffle_each_iteration` affects this
for item in shuffled_data3.take(10): print(item.numpy())
for item in shuffled_data4.take(10): print(item.numpy()) # Same as above

```

This illustrates the importance of setting the `seed` parameter within TensorFlow’s `shuffle` function.  Note that `reshuffle_each_iteration=False` is crucial for reproducibility across epochs.

**Example 3:  Handling Randomness in Custom Data Loaders (PyTorch):**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data, labels, transform=None):
        self.data = data
        self.labels = labels
        self.transform = transform

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        sample = {'data': self.data[idx], 'labels': self.labels[idx]}
        if self.transform:
            sample = self.transform(sample)
        return sample

# ... (data loading and preprocessing) ...
dataset = MyDataset(data, labels)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True, worker_init_fn=lambda worker_id: np.random.seed(42 + worker_id))
```

This shows how to manage randomness within a custom PyTorch data loader. The `worker_init_fn` ensures that each worker in a multi-process data loading scenario receives a unique but reproducible seed, derived from the base seed.  This is vital for parallel processing where multiple threads might concurrently access the data.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The documentation for your specific machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) regarding random number generation and seed setting is paramount.  Consult the respective official documentation to fully understand the implications of random seed usage in each function.  Textbooks focusing on reproducible machine learning and scientific computing will also provide valuable background on the broader subject of numerical reproducibility.  Finally, review papers and blog posts discussing best practices for reproducible research in machine learning should be consulted to establish a holistic understanding of this crucial aspect of the ML workflow.  Pay close attention to discussions on the impact of random seed setting on model training and evaluation metrics.
