The discrepancy between Valgrind's reported execution time and measurements obtained using `rdtsc` (read time-stamp counter) stems fundamentally from the differing methodologies employed.  Valgrind operates as an instrumentation framework, inserting code to monitor and analyze program behavior, significantly altering the program's execution profile. Conversely, `rdtsc` relies on a hardware counter, providing a direct (though not always precise) measure of CPU cycles, potentially unperturbed by software-level instrumentation.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications has highlighted this difference repeatedly, leading to considerable debugging challenges.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Valgrind, in its various forms (Memcheck, Cachegrind, Callgrind, etc.), intercepts system calls and modifies the program's instruction stream. This instrumentation incurs overhead – additional instructions are executed for the sake of monitoring. This overhead can significantly inflate the perceived execution time reported by Valgrind, particularly for CPU-bound tasks.  The added instructions include checks for memory errors, cache misses, and branch prediction statistics, all of which contribute to the discrepancy. The time spent performing these checks isn't reflected in the raw `rdtsc` count, which simply measures the CPU cycles consumed by the instrumented *and* the Valgrind-inserted code.

`rdtsc`, while seeming straightforward, presents its own complexities.  Its accuracy depends on several factors:  CPU frequency scaling (turbo boost, power saving modes), hyper-threading, and the presence of multiple CPU cores.  The counter's value is only meaningful within the same core and under consistent clock frequency conditions.  Moreover, the precise relationship between `rdtsc` counts and actual wall-clock time can be difficult to determine accurately, especially in modern multi-core systems with varying clock speeds. Modern CPUs may even implement virtualization techniques that impact the direct interpretation of `rdtsc` output. Therefore, interpreting `rdtsc` necessitates careful consideration of the execution environment.  I've personally encountered significant discrepancies between `rdtsc` measurements on different CPU architectures even for the same code, a problem only partially mitigated through calibration techniques.

The fundamental difference then lies in the measurement granularity. Valgrind provides a high-level, application-centric perspective on execution time, inclusive of its own instrumentation overhead. `rdtsc`, on the other hand, offers a low-level, hardware-centric view focusing solely on CPU cycle counts, largely ignoring the instrumentation overhead.  Therefore, direct comparison is inherently flawed.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Loop (Illustrating Overhead)**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>

int main() {
  long long start_tsc = __rdtsc();
  long long sum = 0;
  for (long long i = 0; i < 1000000000; ++i) {
    sum += i;
  }
  long long end_tsc = __rdtsc();
  auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  for (long long i = 0; i < 1000000000; ++i) {
    sum += i;
  }
  auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  std::cout << "rdtsc cycles: " << end_tsc - start_tsc << std::endl;
  std::cout << "chrono duration: " << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end - start).count() << " ms" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the basic usage of both `rdtsc` and `std::chrono` for time measurement. The difference between the two measurements will reflect, to some degree, the overhead introduced by the operating system’s timekeeping mechanisms, compared to the more direct, raw CPU cycle count.  Running this code under Valgrind will show a substantially larger execution time due to Valgrind’s instrumentation.  The difference accentuates the overhead.

**Example 2: Memory-Intensive Operation (Highlighting Valgrind's Memory Checks)**

```c++
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> largeVector(100000000);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < largeVector.size(); ++i) {
    largeVector[i] = i;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This code creates a large vector.  Running this under Valgrind's Memcheck will reveal a significant slowdown due to the intensive memory access checks performed by Valgrind. `rdtsc` will only measure the CPU cycles directly spent in the loop, missing the overhead of Valgrind’s checks for memory leaks, out-of-bounds accesses, and other memory-related issues.  The discrepancy will be substantial here.

**Example 3:  Function Call Overhead (Illustrating Indirect Effects)**

```c++
#include <iostream>

void myFunction() {
  // Some computation here.
}

int main() {
  long long start_tsc = __rdtsc();
  for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
    myFunction();
  }
  long long end_tsc = __rdtsc();
  std::cout << "rdtsc cycles: " << end_tsc - start_tsc << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This example showcases how even a seemingly small function call can significantly impact the difference. Valgrind will instrument the `myFunction` call, adding overhead not captured by `rdtsc`.  This difference can be amplified by the loop, making the divergence between the two measurements more pronounced.  The call stack tracing inherent in Valgrind's functionality adds to this overhead.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   **Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual:** For a comprehensive understanding of the `rdtsc` instruction and its limitations.
*   **Valgrind Documentation:**  Thorough understanding of Valgrind’s inner workings, including instrumentation techniques and their impact on performance.
*   **Advanced Computer Architecture Texts:** To gain a deeper insight into CPU architecture, caching mechanisms, and performance bottlenecks.  This provides the theoretical underpinnings for understanding discrepancies.


In conclusion, the disagreement between Valgrind and `rdtsc` measurements is not a bug but a consequence of the fundamental differences in their methodologies.  Valgrind’s comprehensive instrumentation introduces overhead not captured by the raw `rdtsc` count.  Accurate performance analysis requires understanding these differences and selecting appropriate tools and metrics based on the specific requirements of the analysis.  Blindly comparing these two methods often leads to misinterpretations and incorrect conclusions.
