During my time developing neural network models for autonomous drone navigation, I’ve encountered instances where the Adam optimizer in Keras fails to compute gradients as expected, resulting in stalled training or highly suboptimal model performance. This isn’t typically a problem with Adam itself, but rather stems from how it interacts with the upstream computational graph, or from subtle coding errors that disrupt the gradient flow.

The core issue often lies in the manner in which Keras tracks operations for differentiation. Specifically, Keras relies on TensorFlow’s Autodiff mechanism to build a computation graph, allowing for the application of backpropagation and gradient calculation. When gradients appear to be absent, the most probable cause is an interruption in this graph, or the application of a non-differentiable operation that effectively blocks the backpropagation process. Let’s explore common scenarios and their solutions.

One primary culprit is modifying a tensor *in-place* using non-TensorFlow operations. If an intermediate tensor used in the forward pass is altered directly using functions from libraries like NumPy, the graph built by TensorFlow to track gradient dependencies will become invalid. This is because TensorFlow is unaware of the changes made outside of its computational context. This leads to the optimizer attempting to use an incorrect gradient or, in severe cases, no gradient at all. In-place modifications bypass the proper tracking necessary for backpropagation. The solution here is to exclusively use TensorFlow operations when manipulating tensors involved in training.

Another potential issue emerges with incorrect input tensor shapes or data types. Mismatched tensor dimensions between layers or incompatible data types for different operations prevent correct matrix multiplication or other mathematical transformations that are crucial for the model. These mismatches often lead to a silent failure, where operations proceed using zero-value placeholders (implicitly cast to compatible data types), thereby negating the gradients. Ensure input layers and intermediate tensors always have defined and compatible shapes, and perform any necessary casts and reshaping within the TensorFlow framework.

Furthermore, the improper implementation of custom layers or loss functions can cause this problem. When one defines a custom layer, ensuring its associated `call()` method correctly utilizes TensorFlow operations and returns a proper output is paramount. Similarly, if one defines a custom loss function without considering the differentiability of the defined operations within the computation graph, the resulting gradients will be zero. For custom layers and functions, I generally use TensorFlow’s automatic differentiation utilities, such as `tf.GradientTape`, for explicit definition and verification of gradient calculation.

Let's illustrate these issues with concrete examples:

**Example 1: In-place Modification:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Dummy layer
class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def call(self, inputs):
    numpy_array = inputs.numpy()
    numpy_array += 1  # In-place modification!
    output_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(numpy_array)
    return output_tensor

# Model creation
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(2,)),
    CustomLayer(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Example data and target
x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.constant([[5.0], [9.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Training
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y_pred = model(x)
  loss = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(y, y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables) # Gradients will be mostly zeros!
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

In this example, the `CustomLayer` modifies the input tensor using NumPy's in-place addition. When `tape.gradient()` is called, it fails to track the modifications made outside of the TensorFlow graph. The consequence is that gradients are either zero or based on the original un-modified tensor. The correct approach would be to use a TensorFlow addition: `tf.add(inputs, 1.0)`.

**Example 2: Shape Mismatch:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Model creation
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3),  # Output shape: (batch_size, 3)
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)   # Output shape: (batch_size, 1)
])

# Mismatched data shape
x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]], dtype=tf.float32) # Shape: (2, 3)
y = tf.constant([[5.0], [9.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Training
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(y, y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables) # Gradients will exist but be incorrect!
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```
Here, the input `x` has shape (2, 3), while the input layer expects (batch_size, 2). Although the code *runs* thanks to TensorFlow's implicit shape adjustments, the resulting tensors used for forward propagation have incorrect values, resulting in improper gradients.  It's imperative that the data shape corresponds exactly to the shape assumed in the model. The solution involves either adjusting the shape of `x` to (2, 2) or modifying the model's input layer to expect (batch_size, 3) .

**Example 3: Non-differentiable Custom Loss Function:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    diff = y_true - y_pred
    # Applying numpy, outside TF gradient tracking
    abs_diff = np.abs(diff.numpy()) 
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.convert_to_tensor(abs_diff))


model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.constant([[5.0], [9.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y_pred = model(x)
  loss = custom_loss(y, y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables) # Gradients are None
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

In this case, I am using NumPy’s `abs` to compute the absolute difference of tensors outside of TensorFlow’s computational graph. Consequently, when calculating the derivative of the loss function with respect to the model's weights, TensorFlow doesn't have the necessary information about this operation.  The solution lies in using the TensorFlow version `tf.abs(diff)` to compute the absolute value, allowing TensorFlow to keep track of all operations in the gradient calculation.

To debug these situations, I've found the following resources immensely valuable, though I can’t provide specific links: TensorFlow documentation regarding custom layers and models, particularly details on `tf.GradientTape`; the TensorFlow official tutorials on differentiation and backpropagation; and the Keras documentation on working with optimizers. Finally, manually inspecting tensors using print statements or a debugger will always help.

In summary, a lack of gradients during training with the Adam optimizer is seldom a problem with the optimizer itself but rather with the manner in which TensorFlow has constructed or interpreted the computational graph. In-place modifications using non-TensorFlow methods, input shape or type mismatches, and the improper implementation of custom components like layers or loss functions are all potential root causes. Diligent attention to these details can readily resolve most situations involving missing or incorrect gradients during Keras model training.
