The core challenge in calculating loss at intermediate layers in a Keras model without explicitly outputting them lies in manipulating the computation graph dynamically.  Directly accessing intermediate activations necessitates a deeper understanding of Keras' backend and its operational mechanics than simply defining a model and compiling it.  My experience building and optimizing large-scale convolutional neural networks for image recognition has highlighted the necessity of this nuanced approach, particularly when dealing with complex architectures or custom loss functions requiring layer-specific feedback.

**1. Explanation:**

Keras, by default, constructs a sequential computation graph where the output of one layer serves as the input to the next.  The final output layer is where the standard loss function is applied.  Accessing intermediate layers for separate loss calculations requires circumventing this sequential flow.  This cannot be achieved simply through slicing the model.  Instead, one must either employ functional APIs to define a custom model with multiple outputs or leverage Keras' backend functionalities to tap into the internal computational nodes.  The former offers greater clarity and maintainability, whereas the latter provides a more direct, albeit potentially less readable, solution.

The crucial element is understanding that the model's `compile` method defines the loss function and optimization process *for the final output layer*.  To calculate loss at intermediate layers, we need to explicitly specify separate loss functions for each of these layers and then combine them appropriately (e.g., using weighted averaging).  Attempting to "slice" the model during the forward pass ignores this fundamental design principle and will not yield the desired results.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Functional API approach for multiple outputs and losses**

This approach provides the clearest and most maintainable solution for calculating losses at different layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten

# Define the model using the functional API
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
x = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(inputs)
x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
intermediate_output = Flatten()(x)  # Output for intermediate loss
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(intermediate_output)
outputs = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

# Define separate loss functions
loss1 = keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy() # For the final output
loss2 = keras.losses.MeanSquaredError() # For the intermediate layer

# Create a model with multiple outputs
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[outputs, intermediate_output])

# Compile with separate loss weights
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss={'dense_2': loss1, 'flatten': loss2}, # Naming corresponds to layer names
              loss_weights={'dense_2': 1.0, 'flatten': 0.5},
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model (using appropriate data)
model.fit(x_train, {'dense_2': y_train, 'flatten': y_intermediate}, epochs=10)
```


This code defines a model with two outputs â€“ the final classification and the intermediate feature vector. The `loss_weights` parameter allows us to control the relative importance of each loss during training.  Note the naming of the outputs in the `loss` dictionary needs to match the layer names within the model.



**Example 2: Custom training loop with backend manipulation (advanced)**

This approach directly accesses intermediate tensors using the Keras backend, providing more control but sacrificing readability and maintainability.  I have personally found this method beneficial for optimizing specialized architectures where the functional API might be insufficient.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

model = keras.Sequential([Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
                          Dense(10, activation='softmax')])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred, intermediate_activation):
  loss1 = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()(y_true, y_pred)
  loss2 = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(intermediate_activation)) #Example intermediate loss
  return loss1 + 0.2 * loss2 # Example weighting

for epoch in range(10):
  for x_batch, y_batch in train_dataset:
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
          intermediate_layer_output = model.layers[0](x_batch) #Access the output of the first layer
          predictions = model(x_batch)
          loss = custom_loss(y_batch, predictions, intermediate_layer_output)

      gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
      optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

This uses a custom training loop.  It explicitly retrieves the output of an intermediate layer (`model.layers[0](x_batch)`) and incorporates it into the loss calculation. This approach requires careful handling of tensor shapes and data types.



**Example 3:  Using Keras callbacks for intermediate layer logging (not loss calculation)**

While not directly calculating loss, this method provides a way to monitor activations during training, which can be useful for debugging and understanding model behavior.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback

class IntermediateLayerOutput(Callback):
    def __init__(self, layer_name):
        self.layer_name = layer_name
        self.outputs = []

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        layer_output = self.model.get_layer(self.layer_name).output
        self.outputs.append(layer_output)


model = keras.Sequential([Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
                          Dense(10, activation='softmax')])

callback = IntermediateLayerOutput('dense') #Name should match layer name

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[callback])
```

This example demonstrates a custom callback that extracts the output of a specified layer after each epoch.  The stored outputs can then be used for analysis, visualization, or further processing, but not directly for loss calculation during training.
