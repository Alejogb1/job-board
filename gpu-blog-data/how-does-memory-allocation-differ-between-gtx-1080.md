The fundamental difference in memory allocation between the GTX 1080 Ti, Tesla K80, and Tesla V100 GPUs for a given PyTorch model boils down to their differing memory architectures, capacities, and bandwidth.  My experience working with these architectures across various deep learning projects highlighted the significant implications of these differences, particularly concerning model size and training batch sizes.  While PyTorch abstracts away much of the underlying hardware specifics, understanding these architectural nuances is crucial for optimizing performance and avoiding out-of-memory errors.

**1. Architectural Differences and their Impact on Memory Allocation:**

The GTX 1080 Ti, a consumer-grade GPU, utilizes the Pascal architecture, featuring a relatively simpler memory controller compared to the Tesla K80 and V100.  The Tesla K80, based on the Kepler architecture, features two GK210 GPUs interconnected, resulting in a larger memory capacity but potentially slower access compared to a single, unified memory architecture. The Tesla V100, utilizing the Volta architecture, boasts significant advancements including HBM2 high-bandwidth memory and NVLink for enhanced inter-GPU communication. This translates to drastically higher memory bandwidth and potentially more efficient memory allocation for large models.

These architectural disparities directly impact how PyTorch manages memory.  In the case of the GTX 1080 Ti, with its limited memory capacity (typically 11GB), careful attention must be paid to model size and batch size.  Exceeding the available memory results in immediate and often catastrophic out-of-memory (OOM) errors.  The Tesla K80, with its larger memory capacity (24GB), offers more flexibility, but the divided memory architecture can introduce performance bottlenecks due to data transfer overhead between the two GK210 GPUs. Finally, the Tesla V100, with its high memory capacity (typically 16GB or 32GB variants) and high bandwidth, allows for significantly larger models and batch sizes.  However, even with the V100, efficient memory management remains crucial for optimal performance, especially in scenarios involving multiple GPUs.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following PyTorch code snippets demonstrate how memory allocation manifests differently across these GPUs. Note that the exact memory usage will vary depending on the specific model, batch size, and other factors.  The examples focus on illustrating the different approaches necessary depending on the hardware constraints.

**Example 1: GTX 1080 Ti – Handling Limited Memory:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a relatively small model to fit within GTX 1080 Ti's memory
class SmallModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SmallModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(1000, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

model = SmallModel()
model.cuda()  # Move model to GPU

# Use smaller batch sizes to prevent OOM errors
batch_size = 64
input_tensor = torch.randn(batch_size, 1000).cuda()

# Training loop (simplified)
output = model(input_tensor)
# ... training logic ...
```
*Commentary*: This example emphasizes the need for a smaller model and batch size to prevent OOM errors on the GTX 1080 Ti. Larger models or batch sizes would almost certainly lead to errors.  Techniques like gradient accumulation can be used to simulate larger batch sizes with smaller effective batches.


**Example 2: Tesla K80 – Utilizing Multiple GPUs (Hypothetical):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.distributed as dist

# Assuming two GPUs on the Tesla K80
dist.init_process_group("nccl", world_size=2)
rank = dist.get_rank()

# Define a model (potentially larger than in Example 1)
class MediumModel(nn.Module):
    # ... model definition ...
    pass

model = MediumModel()
model = nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(model)
model.cuda()

# Training loop (simplified)
# ... data loading and distribution across GPUs ...
```
*Commentary*: This example demonstrates the use of `torch.distributed` for distributing the model and data across the two GPUs of the Tesla K80.  This approach is essential for training larger models than what a single GK210 could handle.  However, communication overhead between the GPUs must be carefully considered for optimal performance.  Efficient data partitioning and communication protocols are critical here.

**Example 3: Tesla V100 – Leveraging High Memory Capacity:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a large model, leveraging V100's high memory capacity
class LargeModel(nn.Module):
    # ... Model definition for a significantly larger model ...
    pass

model = LargeModel()
model.cuda()

# Use a larger batch size (within reasonable limits)
batch_size = 512
input_tensor = torch.randn(batch_size, 10000).cuda()

# Training loop (simplified)
output = model(input_tensor)
# ... training logic ...
```
*Commentary*: This example shows how the high memory capacity and bandwidth of the Tesla V100 allow for the training of significantly larger models and the use of larger batch sizes without encountering OOM errors.  However, even with the V100, memory optimization techniques like mixed-precision training (using fp16) are frequently beneficial for handling extremely large models.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of GPU memory management in PyTorch, I highly recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on distributed training and performance optimization.  Furthermore, exploring documentation and tutorials related to CUDA programming and the specific architectures of the Pascal, Kepler, and Volta families will prove invaluable.  A strong grasp of linear algebra and parallel computing principles is also essential for tackling complex memory allocation challenges in deep learning.  Finally, the study of profiling tools to analyze memory usage is highly recommended for performance tuning.
