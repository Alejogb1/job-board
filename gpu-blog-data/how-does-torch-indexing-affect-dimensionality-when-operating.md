PyTorch's indexing capabilities, when used with NumPy arrays, can lead to subtle but crucial changes in dimensionality depending on the indexing method employed.  The key fact to remember is that PyTorch's indexing behavior, while often intuitive, fundamentally differs from NumPy's in how it handles advanced indexing and broadcasting, especially when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays. This discrepancy stems from PyTorch’s optimized tensor operations designed for GPU acceleration, which necessitates a more rigid handling of dimensionality than NumPy’s more flexible approach. My experience in developing high-performance deep learning models has highlighted the importance of understanding these nuances to avoid unexpected behavior and performance bottlenecks.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

NumPy arrays inherently maintain their dimensionality throughout most operations.  Slicing, for example, always returns a view of the original array, preserving the original number of dimensions unless explicitly reshaped.  PyTorch, however, when used for indexing, can implicitly reshape the output depending on the indexing technique.  This is particularly evident when using advanced indexing (boolean masks or integer arrays) or combining indexing with tensor operations.

In NumPy, advanced indexing typically creates a copy, or at least a view that may require explicit reshaping to alter dimensionality. PyTorch, on the other hand, employs a more dynamic approach, adapting the dimensionality of the result based on the indices used and the broadcasting rules.  A single index might collapse a dimension, while multiple indices might select subsets, potentially altering the dimensionality in complex ways.  This implicit reshaping, while computationally efficient, requires careful consideration to ensure the resulting tensor's shape aligns with subsequent operations in your PyTorch workflow.

The difference becomes particularly pronounced when using broadcasting. NumPy's broadcasting often expands dimensions to make arrays compatible, primarily for arithmetic operations. PyTorch's tensor operations, often combined with indexing, can affect dimensionality during broadcasting in ways that are not always immediately apparent.  For instance, indexing with a scalar might lead to a dimensionality reduction, whereas broadcasting with a higher-dimensional tensor during indexing can increase the output's dimensions.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Slicing – Consistent Dimensionality**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch

# NumPy
numpy_array = np.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
numpy_slice = numpy_array[:, 1:3, 2]  #Shape remains (2,2)
print(f"NumPy slice shape: {numpy_slice.shape}")

# PyTorch
pytorch_tensor = torch.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
pytorch_slice = pytorch_tensor[:, 1:3, 2] #Shape remains (2,2)
print(f"PyTorch slice shape: {pytorch_slice.shape}")

```

Commentary: Simple slicing behaves consistently across both NumPy and PyTorch. The dimensionality remains consistent because it's a basic slicing operation. Both preserve the original number of dimensions (two in this case) as the slices select a subset of the elements.

**Example 2: Advanced Indexing – Dimensionality Change**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch

# NumPy
numpy_array = np.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
rows_to_select = np.array([0, 1])
cols_to_select = np.array([1, 2])
numpy_advanced_index = numpy_array[rows_to_select, :, cols_to_select] # Shape (2, 2)
print(f"NumPy advanced index shape: {numpy_advanced_index.shape}")

# PyTorch
pytorch_tensor = torch.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
rows_to_select = torch.tensor([0, 1])
cols_to_select = torch.tensor([1, 2])
pytorch_advanced_index = pytorch_tensor[rows_to_select, :, cols_to_select]  #Shape becomes (2, 3, 2). PyTorch does not reduce dimensionality.
print(f"PyTorch advanced index shape: {pytorch_advanced_index.shape}")

```

Commentary:  Advanced indexing using NumPy and PyTorch shows a critical difference. NumPy, when selecting indices along multiple dimensions, reduces dimensionality. PyTorch, however, might not; it depends on how the indices are constructed, potentially leading to a higher dimensionality than expected.  Notice the different shapes.


**Example 3: Boolean Indexing and Broadcasting – Implicit Reshaping**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch

# NumPy
numpy_array = np.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
bool_mask = numpy_array > 10
numpy_bool_index = numpy_array[bool_mask]  #Shape becomes (13,)
print(f"NumPy boolean index shape: {numpy_bool_index.shape}")

# PyTorch
pytorch_tensor = torch.arange(24).reshape(2, 3, 4)
bool_mask = pytorch_tensor > 10
pytorch_bool_index = pytorch_tensor[bool_mask]  #Shape becomes (13,)
pytorch_bool_index_reshaped = pytorch_bool_index.reshape(13,1)
print(f"PyTorch boolean index shape: {pytorch_bool_index.shape}")
print(f"PyTorch boolean index reshaped shape: {pytorch_bool_index_reshaped.shape}")

```

Commentary: Boolean indexing in both NumPy and PyTorch leads to a flattened array, reducing dimensionality to a 1D vector. However, PyTorch allows for explicit reshaping post-indexing to manipulate dimensionality in a more controlled manner, which is useful for subsequent operations.  NumPy's output here would require explicit `reshape()`  if a different dimensionality were needed.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation provides comprehensive details on indexing and tensor manipulation.  A thorough understanding of NumPy's array operations and broadcasting rules is also crucial.  Consult advanced linear algebra texts for a deeper understanding of tensor operations and the underlying mathematical principles.  Review materials on deep learning frameworks will provide context on how these indexing practices apply within the context of model building.  Finally, studying the source code of established PyTorch projects can provide practical insights into how experienced developers manage tensor dimensionality.
