The performance bottleneck in a slow custom PyTorch function during reverse mode (backpropagation) often stems from inefficient computation within the function's `backward` method, rather than the forward pass.  My experience debugging such issues in large-scale image processing pipelines highlights the critical role of efficient gradient computation.  Failing to leverage PyTorch's autograd engine effectively leads to significant slowdowns.

**1. Clear Explanation**

PyTorch's `autograd` system utilizes a computational graph to track operations and calculate gradients automatically.  For built-in functions, the gradients are pre-computed and highly optimized. However, when implementing a custom function, you must explicitly define its `backward` method, responsible for computing gradients with respect to its input tensors.  Inefficiencies in this `backward` method directly translate to slower backpropagation.

Several factors contribute to slow `backward` methods:

* **Inefficient Gradient Calculations:**  The most frequent culprit is employing inefficient algorithmic approaches within the `backward` method. This includes unnecessary loops, redundant computations, and failure to utilize vectorized operations. PyTorch thrives on vectorization; avoiding it drastically reduces performance.

* **Lack of Vectorization:**  Explicit loops iterating over tensor elements are computationally expensive during backpropagation.  Leveraging PyTorch's broadcasting and vectorized operations is paramount. This allows computations to be performed in parallel across the entire tensor, significantly accelerating the process.

* **Unnecessary Memory Allocations:** Frequent memory allocations within the `backward` method can lead to performance degradation due to memory management overhead.  Reusing existing tensors whenever possible minimizes this overhead.

* **Incorrect Gradient Calculation:** Errors in the mathematical derivation of gradients lead to incorrect results, but also often result in increased computational cost, as the flawed algorithm might necessitate more computations to arrive at (incorrect) gradients.

* **Suboptimal Data Structures:** Using less efficient data structures within the custom function's `backward` method, instead of leveraging PyTorch's optimized tensor operations, can significantly impact performance.

Addressing these factors is crucial for optimizing the backward pass of a custom function.  The following examples illustrate these points.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Inefficient Backward Pass**

```python
import torch

class MySlowFunction(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        ctx.save_for_backward(x)
        y = torch.zeros_like(x)
        for i in range(x.shape[0]):
            for j in range(x.shape[1]):
                y[i, j] = x[i, j] * x[i, j]  # Inefficient squaring
        return y

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        x, = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_input = torch.zeros_like(x)
        for i in range(x.shape[0]):
            for j in range(x.shape[1]):
                grad_input[i, j] = 2 * x[i, j] * grad_output[i, j] #Inefficient gradient calculation
        return grad_input

x = torch.randn(1000, 1000, requires_grad=True)
y = MySlowFunction.apply(x)
y.sum().backward()
```

This example demonstrates an inefficient `backward` method.  The nested loops for both the forward and backward passes are extremely slow for larger tensors.


**Example 2: Efficient Backward Pass using Vectorization**

```python
import torch

class MyFastFunction(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        ctx.save_for_backward(x)
        y = x * x  # Efficient squaring using vectorization
        return y

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        x, = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_input = 2 * x * grad_output # Efficient gradient calculation using vectorization
        return grad_input

x = torch.randn(1000, 1000, requires_grad=True)
y = MyFastFunction.apply(x)
y.sum().backward()
```

This improved version leverages PyTorch's vectorization capabilities.  The forward and backward passes are now significantly faster due to the elimination of explicit loops.  The gradient computation is also directly vectorized.


**Example 3:  Using `torch.einsum` for complex gradients**

```python
import torch

class MyEinsumFunction(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x, y):
        ctx.save_for_backward(x, y)
        z = torch.einsum('ij,jk->ik', x, y)
        return z

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        x, y = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_x = torch.einsum('ik,jk->ij', grad_output, y)
        grad_y = torch.einsum('ij,ik->jk', x, grad_output)
        return grad_x, grad_y

x = torch.randn(100, 50, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.randn(50, 200, requires_grad=True)
z = MyEinsumFunction.apply(x, y)
z.sum().backward()
```

This demonstrates using `torch.einsum` for concise and efficient computation of complex gradients, especially beneficial when dealing with matrix multiplications and other linear algebra operations.  `einsum` often leads to more optimized code compared to manually implementing matrix multiplications.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I recommend thoroughly reviewing the PyTorch documentation on `autograd` and custom functions.  Consult advanced materials on automatic differentiation and gradient computation. Pay close attention to PyTorch's tensor manipulation capabilities and vectorization strategies.   Understanding linear algebra concepts is essential for efficient gradient calculations, particularly when implementing complex custom functions.  Profiling your code using tools available within PyTorch (or external profilers) can pinpoint performance bottlenecks within your `backward` method.  This allows for targeted optimization efforts.
