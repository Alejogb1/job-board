Directly accessing the gradient of an activation function within a Keras model requires a nuanced understanding of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities and how Keras wraps them. It's not a matter of simply querying a layer's output; instead, we need to explicitly define a gradient tape and track the operations that contribute to that specific activation's value. Over the years, I've found that misinterpreting the flow of computations in the TensorFlow graph is the biggest hurdle developers face when first attempting this.

The core challenge lies in the fact that Keras layers, by default, do not retain intermediate activation values for direct gradient computation after a forward pass. During training, gradients are calculated and used to update the model’s parameters, and intermediate results are typically discarded. However, we can leverage TensorFlow’s `tf.GradientTape` to perform custom gradient calculations focusing on user-selected tensors and operations, outside the usual training context. The process involves executing a forward pass with the `GradientTape`, recording the operations that lead to the desired activation tensor, then calculating the gradients of a loss-like value with respect to the recorded activation. In short, instead of asking Keras to calculate the gradients for training, we're asking TensorFlow to do so, giving us more granular access.

To elaborate, let’s break down the process: First, we must instantiate a `tf.GradientTape`. Second, inside its context, we execute the model's forward pass (or the portion of the model that includes the activation we need the gradient for). The `GradientTape` then records all the differentiable operations. Crucially, to calculate the gradient relative to a certain activation, we need to define some kind of pseudo-loss related to this activation. Since our objective isn’t training, we need a placeholder value that the gradients can be calculated with respect to. Common approaches include using the sum of the activation values, or the sum of squares. Finally, we use the tape's `gradient` function to calculate the derivative of this loss concerning the activation tensor. This allows us to see the influence of changes in the activation's values on the subsequent, artificially defined loss. Let me illustrate with code examples.

**Example 1: Gradient with respect to the output of a Dense Layer**

In this scenario, I want to observe how the gradient of an activation changes based on the input. Suppose we have a simple model with a single dense layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,))
])

# Create some dummy input
inputs = tf.random.normal((1, 5))  # Single batch for simplicity

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(inputs)  # Watch the input tensor
    activations = model(inputs)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(activations)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, inputs)

print("Input Tensor: ", inputs)
print("Activation Values:", activations)
print("Gradients with respect to input: ", gradients)

```
Here, `tape.watch(inputs)` is essential. It indicates that the tape should track the input tensor, even if it’s not a trainable variable of the model. We then run a forward pass with the model, and calculate `loss`, using the sum of the activations. `tape.gradient(loss, inputs)` then gives us the gradients of `loss` with respect to the `inputs` which represents the sensitivities of the activation's output to changes in the input values. This is how the derivative at that given point is actually calculated.

**Example 2: Gradient with respect to a specific intermediate layer**

Let's consider a slightly more complex network. Instead of the final output, we’ll grab an intermediate activation from within the model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a model with a intermediate layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(units=32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(units=16, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(units=5)
])

# Dummy input
inputs = tf.random.normal((1, 10))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    # The first two layers will be recorded by default
    layer1_output = model.layers[0](inputs)
    layer2_output = model.layers[1](layer1_output)

    # Calculate pseudo-loss
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(layer2_output)

# compute gradient with respect to layer2_output
gradients_layer2 = tape.gradient(loss, layer2_output)

print("Output of layer 2:", layer2_output)
print("Gradient of pseudo-loss with respect to layer2 output:", gradients_layer2)


```
In this code, we execute the model up to a specific layer. The gradients calculated relate the artificial `loss` to the intermediate layer's activations (layer 2 in this case). Notice how we're directly accessing each layer's computation by calling them with the input rather than letting Keras go through the entire model's layers automatically.

**Example 3: Gradient using a custom activation layer**

Finally, let's consider a custom activation layer within a model:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Custom activation layer that squares the input
class CustomActivation(keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.square(inputs)

# Build the model using custom activation
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(units=16, input_shape=(5,)),
    CustomActivation(),
    keras.layers.Dense(units=5)
])

# Dummy input
inputs = tf.random.normal((1, 5))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    first_layer_output = model.layers[0](inputs)
    custom_activation_output = model.layers[1](first_layer_output)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(custom_activation_output) # Pseudo-loss on output of custom layer


gradients = tape.gradient(loss, custom_activation_output)

print("Custom Activation Output: ", custom_activation_output)
print("Gradients of loss with respect to custom layer output: ", gradients)

```

Here, the custom activation is a simple squaring operation, and I compute gradients with respect to its output. This shows how you can even debug custom activations with gradients, an important tool when debugging your own layers.

To gain a deeper understanding, I strongly recommend diving into the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.GradientTape` and automatic differentiation. Additionally, studying examples that explicitly build out models with the TensorFlow functional API will help you control the flow of operations and activations more precisely. There's a large amount of material available within the TensorFlow tutorial section. Furthermore, exploring research papers that use custom gradient calculations for training or optimization can provide valuable insight into more complex applications. Specifically, the Keras documentation on custom layers and how the forward propagation operates should be well understood, as the way I've accessed the intermediate layers is the way the library works behind the scenes. This knowledge builds a much stronger intuition for how to manipulate these objects in your code, and will prevent many issues along the way.
