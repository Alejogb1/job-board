TensorFlow's flexibility in selectively disabling portions of a neural network hinges fundamentally on understanding the computational graph and leveraging control flow operations.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition models highlighted the necessity of this technique for efficient training, model debugging, and even runtime optimization in resource-constrained environments.  The core principle revolves around conditionally executing specific parts of the graph based on runtime conditions or learned parameters.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Selective disabling doesn't involve physically removing nodes from the graph; instead, it involves controlling the flow of data through the network.  This is achieved primarily through conditional execution blocks, utilizing TensorFlow's control flow operations like `tf.cond` and `tf.case`.  These allow you to define different branches of computation that are activated based on boolean conditions.  The condition can be a simple hyperparameter, a learned gate (a neuron or group of neurons acting as a switch), or a more complex function of the network's internal state.

Another approach involves masking.  This technique modifies the network's weights or activations directly.  By setting weights to zero (or very close to zero) within a specific layer or group of neurons, you effectively disable their contribution to the forward and backward passes.  This can be implemented using TensorFlow's tensor manipulation operations, such as `tf.where` or by employing masking tensors that are element-wise multiplied with the weight or activation tensors.  The benefit of masking is its direct impact; it doesnâ€™t rely on branching, potentially leading to more efficient computations, particularly with hardware acceleration. However, it requires careful consideration of gradient propagation during backpropagation.

Finally, gradient masking offers a nuanced control, allowing you to disable the contribution of specific parts of the network during the backpropagation phase, while still maintaining the forward pass.  This is extremely useful in scenarios where you want to freeze certain layers during fine-tuning or prevent gradients from flowing through specific components for regularization purposes.  This is commonly accomplished by selectively zeroing out elements of the gradient tensor before the optimizer's update step.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Conditional Execution with `tf.cond`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def conditional_layer(input_tensor, train_branch):
  """Conditionally activates a dense layer during training."""
  dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
  return tf.cond(train_branch, lambda: dense_layer, lambda: input_tensor)

#Example Usage
input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(128,))
train_branch = tf.constant(True) #Set to False for inference
output_tensor = conditional_layer(input_tensor, train_branch)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)
```

This example uses `tf.cond` to activate a dense layer only when the `train_branch` boolean is `True`.  During training (`train_branch = True`), the dense layer is included; during inference (`train_branch = False`), the input tensor is passed directly, effectively bypassing the dense layer.  This is crucial for scenarios where a specific layer is only necessary during training (e.g., dropout layers).


**Example 2: Weight Masking:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def masked_layer(input_tensor, mask):
  """Applies a mask to the weights of a convolutional layer."""
  conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_tensor)
  masked_output = conv_layer * mask #Element-wise multiplication
  return masked_output

#Example Usage
input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
mask = tf.ones((32, 3, 3,1)) # Initially all weights are active.  Can be modified to selectively disable parts
output_tensor = masked_layer(input_tensor, mask)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)
```

Here, a mask tensor is element-wise multiplied with the output of a convolutional layer.  By setting elements of the `mask` tensor to zero, the corresponding weights are effectively disabled. This allows for fine-grained control over individual filter activations within the convolutional layer.  The mask can be learned as a parameter or manually designed.


**Example 3: Gradient Masking:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def gradient_masked_optimizer(model, learning_rate, mask):
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate)

    def train_step(images, labels):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(images)
            loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(labels, predictions)

        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        masked_gradients = [g * m for g, m in zip(gradients, mask)] #Element-wise multiplication of gradient with the mask

        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(masked_gradients, model.trainable_variables))
        return loss

    return train_step

#Example Usage (Illustrative - needs complete model and dataset)
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(...) # Your model here
mask = [tf.ones_like(v) for v in model.trainable_variables] #Initially all gradients are active

train_step = gradient_masked_optimizer(model, 0.001, mask)
loss = train_step(images, labels)
```

This example demonstrates selective gradient masking. A custom training step is defined. Gradients computed using `tf.GradientTape` are element-wise multiplied with a `mask` before the optimizer updates the model's weights.  This prevents gradients from flowing through specific parts of the network, allowing for selective freezing or regularization.  The `mask` can be designed to disable gradient updates for chosen layers or even specific weights within layers.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation offers comprehensive guides on control flow and gradient computation.  Advanced topics such as meta-learning and differentiable architectures also provide valuable insights into controlling neural network behavior.  Furthermore, several research papers explore architectural innovations that leverage conditional computations or dynamic graph construction.  Textbooks on deep learning offer a theoretical foundation for understanding the underlying mechanisms.  Examining code repositories of large-scale projects can offer practical examples of applying these techniques.
