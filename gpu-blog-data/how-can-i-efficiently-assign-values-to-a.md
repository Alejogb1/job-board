Tensor subset assignment without modifying the original tensor necessitates the creation of a new tensor.  Direct in-place modification, while seemingly efficient, risks unintended side effects due to Python's reference semantics and the mutable nature of many tensor libraries.  My experience working on large-scale scientific simulations highlighted this repeatedly, leading to numerous debugging sessions stemming from accidental in-place alterations.  Therefore, the most robust and efficient approach relies on indexing and slicing coupled with tensor creation functions specific to your chosen library.

The underlying principle hinges on employing array slicing to select the subset and then using the selected subset as input to a tensor creation function. This function generates a *copy*, ensuring the original tensor remains immutable. The specific implementation varies depending on the library—NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch—but the fundamental concept remains consistent.

**1.  Explanation of Efficient Subset Assignment**

Efficiently assigning values to a tensor subset without affecting the original tensor requires three primary steps:

a) **Subset Selection:**  Identify the desired subset using appropriate indexing and slicing mechanisms.  This step leverages the library's indexing capabilities to pinpoint the target elements.  For example, you might select a specific row, column, or a more complex multi-dimensional slice.

b) **Value Assignment:** Create a new tensor containing the values to be assigned to the subset.  The shape and data type of this tensor must be compatible with the selected subset.  Inconsistencies will lead to errors.

c) **Tensor Creation and Combination:**  Utilize the library's tensor creation function (e.g., `numpy.copy()`, `tf.constant()`, `torch.clone()`)  to generate a new tensor. This new tensor incorporates the original tensor's data, with the selected subset replaced by the newly assigned values.  This ensures that the original tensor remains unchanged.  Careful attention must be paid to broadcasting rules if the dimensions of the assigned values differ from the selected subset.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the process using NumPy, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.  These examples highlight the library-specific functions and demonstrate how the original tensor remains untouched.

**2.1 NumPy Example:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Original tensor
original_tensor = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Subset selection (selecting the second row)
subset_indices = [1, :]

# Values to assign to the subset
new_values = np.array([10, 11, 12])

# Creating a new tensor with the modified subset
new_tensor = np.copy(original_tensor)  #Creates a copy
new_tensor[subset_indices] = new_values

# Verification: original tensor remains unchanged
print("Original Tensor:\n", original_tensor)
print("New Tensor:\n", new_tensor)
```

This NumPy example showcases the use of `np.copy()` to create a complete copy of the original array before modifying the slice. This prevents any alteration of the original data.  The `subset_indices` variable efficiently targets the second row using NumPy's slicing capabilities.

**2.2 TensorFlow Example:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original tensor
original_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Subset selection (selecting elements at indices [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0])
indices = tf.constant([[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]])
values = tf.constant([10, 11, 12])

# Create a new tensor using tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update
new_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(original_tensor, indices, values)

#Verification
print("Original Tensor:\n", original_tensor.numpy())
print("New Tensor:\n", new_tensor.numpy())

```

TensorFlow’s `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` directly updates a tensor based on scattered indices. However, this function does *not* modify the original tensor; it returns a *new* tensor with the updates applied.  The `numpy()` method is used to convert the tensors to NumPy arrays for easier printing.  Note the use of `tf.constant` to ensure the indices and values are treated as TensorFlow tensors.

**2.3 PyTorch Example:**

```python
import torch

# Original tensor
original_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Subset selection (selecting the first column)
subset_indices =  torch.arange(0,3).unsqueeze(1)
new_values = torch.tensor([10, 11, 12])

# Creating a copy and assigning new values
new_tensor = original_tensor.clone()  #Creating a deep copy
new_tensor[:,0] = new_values

# Verification
print("Original Tensor:\n", original_tensor)
print("New Tensor:\n", new_tensor)
```

PyTorch uses `.clone()` to create a deep copy of the tensor. This ensures that modifications to the cloned tensor do not affect the original.  Here we leverage PyTorch's advanced indexing to replace the first column, illustrating flexibility.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of tensor manipulation, consult the official documentation for NumPy, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.  These resources offer comprehensive tutorials and detailed explanations of various functions, including those related to tensor creation, indexing, and slicing.  Exploring relevant chapters in introductory linear algebra and numerical computation textbooks would also prove valuable in comprehending the underlying mathematical principles involved in tensor operations.  Finally, examining examples in scientific computing literature focusing on your specific application domain offers practical insight into best practices and efficient techniques.  Specific attention to the memory management aspects within these libraries is crucial for larger datasets.
