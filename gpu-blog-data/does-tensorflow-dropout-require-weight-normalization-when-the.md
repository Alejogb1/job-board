Dropout, even when configured with a keep probability of 1, does not necessitate weight normalization as a directly coupled prerequisite within TensorFlow. I've encountered scenarios where mistakenly assuming this led to unnecessary complexity and computational overhead during model development. While it’s true that dropout at keep probability less than 1 introduces a form of implicit regularization, and weight normalization is a separate regularization technique targeting different facets of the training process, these are distinct operations not inherently interdependent.

The primary function of dropout is to randomly deactivate neurons (or, more precisely, connections between neurons) during the training phase. When the keep probability is set to 1, every neuron is maintained; effectively, dropout becomes a null operation. Consequently, the forward pass of the network is indistinguishable from one without any dropout applied. The weight matrices themselves are not altered during dropout. Instead, a masking operation is applied to the *activation* outputs, nullifying the impact of randomly selected units. At keep probability 1, no masking occurs.

Weight normalization, on the other hand, operates directly on the weight matrices of a layer. It seeks to decouple the magnitude of the weights from their direction. Specifically, it normalizes the weights by dividing them by their L2 norm (Euclidean norm) and multiplying them by a learned scalar gain. This technique stabilizes training by ensuring the scale of the weights does not fluctuate wildly during gradient descent. Normalizing the weights is not meant to correct for dropout and does not solve a problem introduced by setting the keep probability to one.

It is critical to distinguish that the need for weight normalization arises independently of dropout. It may be beneficial to apply weight normalization irrespective of whether dropout is used, and whether the dropout keep probability is less than or equal to 1. Weight normalization addresses issues related to internal covariate shift, that may occur due to the manner in which weight magnitudes evolve during training, which is fundamentally different from the mechanism of dropout.

Let me illustrate with code examples. First, I’ll show dropout usage with a keep probability of 1.0. This won’t require weight normalization and will simply pass the activation as is.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple layer with dropout
class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, dropout_rate=0.0):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)
        self.dropout = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(dropout_rate)

    def call(self, inputs, training=False):
        x = self.dense(inputs)
        x = self.dropout(x, training=training)
        return x

# Example usage with keep probability of 1.0 (dropout_rate=0.0)
input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10))
layer = MyLayer(units=5, dropout_rate=0.0) #keep_prob=1
output = layer(input_data, training=True)

print("Output shape after dropout:", output.shape)
```
In this first example, `dropout_rate=0.0`, which translates to a keep probability of 1. The output will be the result of the dense layer without any masking performed. Notice that no weight normalization is present in this example, and none is necessary. The shape of the output tensor, (1, 5), indicates the output of the fully connected layer, with dropout doing nothing because its rate is zero.

Next, I’ll demonstrate a scenario where we *do* employ weight normalization, even when dropout isn't active. This time, we will use TensorFlow's API. This helps demonstrate that they are distinct operations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class WeightNormDense(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(WeightNormDense, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(None, units), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True, name='kernel')
        self.g = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='ones', trainable=True, name='gain')
        self.bias = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='zeros', trainable=True, name='bias')


    def call(self, inputs):
        norm_w = self.w / tf.norm(self.w, axis=0, keepdims=True)
        norm_w = self.g * norm_w
        output = tf.matmul(inputs, norm_w) + self.bias
        return output

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense = WeightNormDense(units=units)
        self.dropout = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.0) #keep_prob=1
    
    def call(self, inputs, training=False):
        x = self.dense(inputs)
        x = self.dropout(x, training=training)
        return x


input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10))
model = MyModel(units=5)
output = model(input_data, training=True)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)

```
Here, I've implemented weight normalization in a custom layer that applies the norm to the weights and scales them with a learnable gain. The model incorporates a `WeightNormDense` layer followed by dropout. Although the dropout keep probability is 1 (no effect), weight normalization is *still* applied to the weights of the preceding dense layer. This shows the orthogonality of these operations; each does something different, despite their commonalities as regularizers. The output shape will be identical to the first example as no dropout masking takes place.

Finally, I will provide a third example where both dropout and weight normalization are combined. It showcases that these techniques, although both regularizing, are independent of each other.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class WeightNormDropoutDense(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, dropout_rate):
        super(WeightNormDropoutDense, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(None, units), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True, name='kernel')
        self.g = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='ones', trainable=True, name='gain')
        self.bias = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='zeros', trainable=True, name='bias')
        self.dropout = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(dropout_rate)

    def call(self, inputs, training=False):
         norm_w = self.w / tf.norm(self.w, axis=0, keepdims=True)
         norm_w = self.g * norm_w
         output = tf.matmul(inputs, norm_w) + self.bias
         output = self.dropout(output, training=training)
         return output

input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10))
layer = WeightNormDropoutDense(units=5, dropout_rate=0.5)
output = layer(input_data, training=True)
print("Output shape after dropout and weight normalization:", output.shape)
```

In this last example, both weight normalization, implemented in the custom layer, and dropout are active. Notice that both are applied independently, and changing one would not have direct implications on the other. In this case, a `dropout_rate` of 0.5 was chosen, which will randomly mask half the activations. This, coupled with the weight normalization, shows that, while regularizers, both are separate operations that can be used independently or in conjunction. This independence is key to understand when to employ them correctly.

Based on my experience, I recommend exploring resources such as *“Deep Learning”* by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville, for a thorough theoretical treatment of both dropout and weight normalization. The TensorFlow documentation itself provides invaluable practical guides. For more concise technical explanations, research papers on both techniques, particularly *“Weight Normalization: A Simple Reparameterization to Accelerate Training of Deep Neural Networks”* by Salimans and Kingma, provide granular detail into the subject. Studying these documents and papers will help further solidify the fact that although dropout and weight normalization are both regularizers, they are functionally independent of each other, and thus, do not require their co-application.
