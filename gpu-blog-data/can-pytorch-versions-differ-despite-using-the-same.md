Yes, PyTorch versions can indeed differ even when seemingly using the same environment, and this inconsistency stems from a nuanced interaction between environment definitions, package management, and the specific build process. I've encountered this exact scenario several times during my experience developing deep learning models, often leading to subtle incompatibilities and frustrating debugging sessions. It's not always as straightforward as simply replicating a `requirements.txt` file. The core issue arises not just from what packages *are supposed* to be installed, but how those packages are actually resolved and built on the target machine.

The most direct cause for PyTorch version discrepancies in seemingly identical environments is the varying resolution of package dependencies by package managers. While tools like `pip` and `conda` strive for deterministic installations, they aren't infallible. Different underlying operating systems, available system libraries (especially CUDA), and even subtle variations in package server states can lead to differing resolution pathways, culminating in the installation of slightly distinct PyTorch builds. These builds might share a semantic version number (e.g., 1.12.1), but have subtle internal differences impacting functionality or performance. Furthermore, the underlying binary libraries of PyTorch are particularly sensitive to hardware architecture, causing another divergence point. For instance, packages built for CUDA 11.7 will not work on a machine with CUDA 11.3.

Another significant factor is the method used to specify the PyTorch dependency. A simple version specification like `torch==1.12.1` in a requirements file doesn't always enforce an exact binary match. Package managers may choose from different distributions based on pre-compiled wheels available on the PyPI repository. These wheels are often architecture-specific, and if no precise match is found, the package manager might fall back to a source installation, which can then introduce further variation in the build due to different compiler configurations and system libraries.

Furthermore, reliance on implicit environment definitions introduces potential for drift. Using a shared base Docker image, for example, does not guarantee consistency if environment variables affecting the install path of libraries are not carefully controlled and if the image itself is not meticulously versioned. Similarly, shared conda environments, while offering better environment isolation, are still vulnerable if channel priorities are not specified precisely. If some systems are resolving dependencies from the `pytorch` channel, and others from the default `conda-forge` channel with a less specific version constraint, that will result in variations of PyTorch and its dependencies, which may result in subtle functional differences.

Now, let's examine some scenarios through code:

**Example 1: Implicit Channel Variations with `conda`**

This example highlights how different channel priorities in `conda` can lead to version divergence. We’ll assume two virtual environments are created: one with an explicit channel, another without.

```python
# Environment 1: Explicit channel
# Execute these commands in a terminal
# conda create -n env1 python=3.9 -y
# conda activate env1
# conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch -y
# python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"

# Environment 2: Default channels
# conda create -n env2 python=3.9 -y
# conda activate env2
# conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -y
# python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
```

In this instance, `env1` specifically targets the PyTorch channel. `env2` relies on conda's default channel priority, which may resolve to a slightly different PyTorch build, even when the semantic version number is the same. Running the python command inside each activated environment will likely show the same version number, but it is not a guarantee that the underlying compiled binaries are identical. This small difference can potentially lead to subtle changes in how operations are processed on GPUs or specialized hardware acceleration.

**Example 2: Differences arising from `pip` & wheel availability.**

This example explores inconsistencies arising from wheel selection by `pip`, especially regarding CUDA availability.

```python
# Setup: Assumes we have two machines, one with CUDA and one without, but they use identical requirements.txt files

# requirements.txt:
# torch==1.12.1
# torchvision==0.13.1
# torchaudio==0.12.1

# Machine 1 (CUDA enabled) - command in environment with pip
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__); print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

# Machine 2 (No CUDA) - command in environment with pip
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__); print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

On Machine 1, `pip` will likely prioritize a PyTorch wheel that includes CUDA support if available on the PyPI repository. On Machine 2, lacking CUDA, `pip` will install a CPU-only wheel. Despite having the same `requirements.txt`, the underlying PyTorch implementations differ. Running the Python command would yield the same `torch.__version__` on both machines but `torch.cuda.is_available()` would return `True` on machine one and `False` on machine two. It is the implicit hardware differences, even with the same environment specification, that results in the differences.

**Example 3:  Impact of a custom install strategy:**

Here, we’ll simulate a scenario where someone installs PyTorch manually from source, highlighting potential for unpredictable outcomes even with a seemingly fixed environment.

```python
# Environment setup (simulated):
# Assume a user downloads PyTorch source code, modifies the setup.py and installs from local source:
# cd pytorch-source-code
# python setup.py install

# This is extremely fragile and likely to vary from machine to machine.
# Next steps: activate environment
# python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__); print(torch.backends.cudnn.version())"
```

If an individual downloads PyTorch source code, manually changes some settings in `setup.py`, and then builds using `python setup.py install`, the resulting build is effectively not managed by `pip` or `conda`, and thus may be incompatible with standard environments.  The installed PyTorch version is then unique to that local build process and is likely to deviate from other machines that may be using the same environment, but with standard package management.  Even if the build process is identical (which is highly unlikely), subtle variations in compiler behavior and underlying operating system can result in a different version when `torch.backends.cudnn.version()` is checked.

To achieve more deterministic environments and minimize PyTorch version discrepancies, one must strive for maximal explicitness and control. Instead of relying on implicit behavior of `pip` or `conda`, we should follow these practices:

*   **Pin Dependencies with Hashes:** Pin specific package versions using exact version numbers and ideally use hashes in the `requirements.txt` file when using `pip`. This can drastically reduce the possibility of unintended package upgrades and ensures that the specified version is consistently resolved.
*   **Use Conda Environments:** When using `conda`, meticulously define channel priorities in your environment file and ideally specify the exact build string in addition to the version number. Relying exclusively on the `conda` channel is a good practice for `pytorch`, where possible.
*   **Docker with Multi-Stage Builds:** Leverage Docker with multi-stage builds. Define dependencies explicitly within the Dockerfile, build your dependencies in a base image, and then copy them into your final application image.
*   **Environment Files:** Use environment files (`environment.yml` for conda, `requirements.txt` for pip) that are rigorously version controlled. Avoid manual installations. Be mindful that shared environment files do not completely guarantee consistency unless build tools and operating systems are identical.
*   **Verify Installations:** After installing, always verify the PyTorch version and other essential library versions directly with a small python script.

In summary, while the objective of package management is to create reproducible environments, inherent complexities in how package managers resolve dependencies and how PyTorch is built can lead to subtle, often hard-to-detect version discrepancies, even when environments seem identical. Mitigation requires diligent pinning of dependencies, careful channel management, and a focus on deterministic build practices. I have learned this through numerous painful debugging sessions, and the small time investment in deterministic configuration is always worth the effort.

For additional information on these topics, explore the official PyTorch documentation regarding installation, which details the different installation options and the significance of CUDA. Similarly, familiarize yourself with the package management tools, `pip` and `conda`. The documentation for these tools includes guidelines for handling dependencies and creating reproducible environments. Lastly, resources that describe Docker and its best practices for creating reproducible builds can be very valuable in the long run.
