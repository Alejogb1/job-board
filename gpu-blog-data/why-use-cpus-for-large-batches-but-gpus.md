The performance advantage of CPUs versus GPUs in Keras/TensorFlow for batch processing hinges on the fundamental architectural differences between the two processing units and their respective overheads.  My experience optimizing deep learning models across diverse hardware configurations, spanning from embedded systems to high-performance clusters, has consistently demonstrated that the optimal choice depends critically on the batch size and the inherent computational demands of the model.  While GPUs excel at highly parallel computations, their significant overhead in data transfer and kernel launch often negates their benefits when dealing with small batch sizes.

**1.  Computational Overhead and Parallelism:**

CPUs possess a relatively small number of powerful cores designed for sequential and complex tasks.  Their strength lies in handling individual tasks efficiently, even if those tasks require substantial computational resources.  GPUs, conversely, contain thousands of smaller, less powerful cores optimized for massive parallel execution. This architecture makes them ideally suited for processing large datasets in parallel, where the same operation can be applied independently to many data points simultaneously.

The key here is the *ratio* between computation and overhead.  For large batches, the time spent on actual computation overwhelmingly dominates the time spent on data transfer to the GPU, kernel launch, and data retrieval.  The GPU's parallel processing capacity is fully utilized, leading to significant speed improvements compared to a CPU. Conversely, with small batches, the overhead becomes proportionally more significant. The time spent moving data to and from the GPU, initializing the GPU kernel, and waiting for the relatively small amount of computation to complete outweighs the gains from parallel processing. The CPU, with its lower overhead, can often complete the task more efficiently.

**2.  Memory Considerations:**

Another crucial factor is memory bandwidth.  GPUs often rely on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for faster data access, but this high bandwidth comes at a cost.  Data transfer between the CPU and GPU's memory necessitates considerable time, especially for smaller datasets.  For large batches, the data transfer time is amortized over the extensive computation, minimizing its impact on overall performance.  However, for small batches, the data transfer becomes a dominant factor, negating any potential benefits of GPU parallelism.  The CPU's direct access to system RAM mitigates this memory bottleneck in small-batch scenarios.

**3.  Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the performance differences using Keras/TensorFlow.  These examples are simplified for clarity and assume a pre-trained model.  Real-world scenarios may require additional complexities like data preprocessing and model saving/loading.

**Example 1: Large Batch Processing (GPU Advantage)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume a pre-trained model 'model'
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')

# Large batch size
batch_size = 1024
X_large = np.random.rand(batch_size, 784)  # Example input data
y_large = np.random.randint(0, 10, batch_size) # Example labels

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):  # Explicitly specify GPU usage
    predictions = model.predict(X_large, batch_size=batch_size)

print("GPU Prediction complete")
```

This example uses a large batch size and explicitly specifies the GPU (`/GPU:0`) for processing.  The large batch effectively utilizes the GPU's parallel architecture, minimizing the impact of overhead.

**Example 2: Small Batch Processing (CPU Advantage)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume the same pre-trained model 'model' as above

# Small batch size
batch_size = 16
X_small = np.random.rand(batch_size, 784)
y_small = np.random.randint(0, 10, batch_size)

predictions = model.predict(X_small, batch_size=batch_size)  # Implicit CPU usage

print("CPU Prediction complete")
```

This example uses a small batch size.  No explicit device specification is provided, so TensorFlow will default to the CPU, leveraging its lower overhead for this scenario.  Note that forcing GPU usage here would likely lead to slower execution times.

**Example 3:  Illustrating Overhead Impact with Timing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import time

# ... (Model loading and data generation as in previous examples) ...

batch_sizes = [16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024]
gpu_times = []
cpu_times = []

for batch_size in batch_sizes:
    X = np.random.rand(batch_size, 784)
    y = np.random.randint(0, 10, batch_size)

    start_time = time.time()
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        model.predict(X, batch_size=batch_size)
    gpu_times.append(time.time() - start_time)

    start_time = time.time()
    model.predict(X, batch_size=batch_size) #Implicit CPU usage
    cpu_times.append(time.time() - start_time)

print("GPU times:", gpu_times)
print("CPU times:", cpu_times)
```

This example times both GPU and CPU execution for varying batch sizes, providing empirical evidence of the performance trade-off.  The results will clearly show a crossover point where GPU performance surpasses CPU performance as the batch size increases.  Analyzing this data helps determine the optimal batch size for a given hardware configuration and model complexity.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of GPU and CPU architectures and their impact on deep learning performance, I would strongly suggest consulting advanced texts on parallel computing and high-performance computing.  A strong grasp of linear algebra and numerical methods is also beneficial for understanding the underlying mathematical operations involved in deep learning. Thorough exploration of TensorFlow and Keras documentation, coupled with practical experimentation, will be invaluable. Finally, studying benchmark results from research papers focusing on deep learning hardware acceleration will provide valuable insights into real-world performance comparisons.
