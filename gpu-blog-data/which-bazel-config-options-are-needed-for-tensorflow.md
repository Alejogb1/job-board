The critical aspect determining the necessary Bazel configuration for a TensorFlow build is the target TensorFlow version and the desired build type (CPU-only, GPU-enabled, etc.).  My experience optimizing builds across numerous projects, involving diverse hardware architectures and custom operators, has consistently highlighted the importance of explicitly specifying these parameters within the `WORKSPACE` and `BUILD` files.  Overlooking this leads to unpredictable build failures and, often, unexpected dependencies.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Bazel's configuration for TensorFlow hinges on the `rules_python` and, critically, the TensorFlow repository itself.  A straightforward approach involves defining the TensorFlow repository within the `WORKSPACE` file, specifying the version using a `http_archive` rule.  This archive is then referenced within `BUILD` files to incorporate TensorFlow into your project's targets. However,  simply fetching the archive isn't sufficient; one must account for build type, platform compatibility, and dependencies (like CUDA for GPU support).

The `WORKSPACE` file primarily handles the external dependencies, while the `BUILD` file dictates how these dependencies are used within specific targets.  Consequently, correct configuration requires coordinating both files. Neglecting this coordination frequently results in missing header files, linking errors, and runtime failures.   My experience troubleshooting these issues has emphasized the value of meticulous dependency management.

Furthermore, Bazel's flexibility allows for custom configurations based on the build environment.  This is particularly important for GPU support, which requires specifying the CUDA toolkit version and architecture. Failure to do so typically leads to the build attempting to utilize a non-existent CUDA library, causing a build failure. The use of Bazel's `select()` function is essential to conditionally include configurations based on environment variables or platform-specific flags, a practice I've found invaluable for streamlining builds across development machines with varying configurations.

Finally, understanding the TensorFlow build itself is key. TensorFlow comprises a substantial number of libraries and binaries.  Defining the precise components you require within your `BUILD` file is crucial for avoiding unnecessarily long build times.   Using `bazel query` effectively to analyze the build graph and identify unnecessary dependencies has saved countless hours during my work on large-scale projects.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic CPU-only TensorFlow build (WORKSPACE):**

```bazel
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "tensorflow",
    urls = ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/archive/v2.12.0.tar.gz"],
    sha256 = "YOUR_SHA256_CHECKSUM", #Replace with actual checksum
    strip_prefix = "tensorflow-v2.12.0",
)
```

**Example 1: Basic CPU-only TensorFlow build (BUILD):**

```bazel
load("@tensorflow//tensorflow:tensorflow.bzl", "tf_py_binary")

tf_py_binary(
    name = "my_tensorflow_program",
    srcs = ["my_program.py"],
    deps = [
        ":my_tensorflow_module",
        "@tensorflow//:tensorflow_py",
    ],
)

load("@rules_python//python:defs.bzl", "py_library")

py_library(
    name = "my_tensorflow_module",
    srcs = ["my_module.py"],
    deps = [
        "@tensorflow//:tensorflow_py",
    ],
)
```
**Commentary:** This example demonstrates a basic CPU-only build.  The `WORKSPACE` file downloads TensorFlow v2.12.0 (replace with your desired version and checksum!). The `BUILD` file then defines a Python binary (`my_tensorflow_program`) depending on a Python library (`my_tensorflow_module`) and the TensorFlow Python library (`@tensorflow//:tensorflow_py`).  Crucially, note the usage of `@tensorflow//:tensorflow_py`. This targets the Python components within the TensorFlow repository.

**Example 2: GPU-enabled TensorFlow build (WORKSPACE):**

```bazel
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:cuda.bzl", "cuda_toolchain")

http_archive(
    name = "tensorflow",
    urls = ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/archive/v2.12.0.tar.gz"],
    sha256 = "YOUR_SHA256_CHECKSUM", #Replace with actual checksum
    strip_prefix = "tensorflow-v2.12.0",
)

cuda_toolchain(
    name = "cuda_toolchain",
    cuda_version = "11.8", # Adjust according to your CUDA version
    cudnn_version = "8.6.0" # Adjust according to your cuDNN version
)
```

**Example 2: GPU-enabled TensorFlow build (BUILD):**

```bazel
load("@tensorflow//tensorflow:tensorflow.bzl", "tf_py_binary")

tf_py_binary(
    name = "my_gpu_program",
    srcs = ["my_gpu_program.py"],
    deps = [
        "@tensorflow//:tensorflow_py", # Ensure GPU compatible version is built.
    ],
    cuda_toolchain = "@//:cuda_toolchain", #Link to configured CUDA toolchain
)

```

**Commentary:**  This example extends the previous one to incorporate GPU support. The `WORKSPACE` file now includes a `cuda_toolchain` rule, specifying the CUDA version.  The `BUILD` file for the GPU-enabled binary explicitly links the `cuda_toolchain` and ensures that TensorFlow is built with GPU support (the choice of which specific TensorFlow library to include in the dependency is crucial for GPU functionality).  Remember that having the correct CUDA drivers and libraries installed on your system is essential for this to work.

**Example 3: Conditional Build using select() (WORKSPACE & BUILD):**

```bazel
#WORKSPACE
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "tensorflow",
    urls = ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/archive/v2.12.0.tar.gz"],
    sha256 = "YOUR_SHA256_CHECKSUM", #Replace with actual checksum
    strip_prefix = "tensorflow-v2.12.0",
)


#BUILD
load("@tensorflow//tensorflow:tensorflow.bzl", "tf_py_binary")

tf_py_binary(
    name = "my_conditional_program",
    srcs = ["my_program.py"],
    deps = select({
        ":cpu_config": ["@tensorflow//:tensorflow_py"],
        ":gpu_config": ["@tensorflow//:gpu_tensorflow_py"], #Assumed target for GPU-enabled TensorFlow
    }),
)

#... other rules to define :cpu_config and :gpu_config ...
```

**Commentary:**  This showcases the use of `select()` to conditionally choose between a CPU-only and GPU-enabled build. The exact names of the targets (`:cpu_config` and `:gpu_config`) and their definitions (not shown for brevity) would need to be adjusted according to your project structure and the way you've organised your TensorFlow dependencies for CPU and GPU builds. This approach allows for a single `BUILD` file to cater to different build configurations determined at compile time, significantly enhancing the flexibility of the build process.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Bazel documentation.  The TensorFlow build documentation, paying close attention to the sections on building from source and configuring for different platforms.  A comprehensive guide on advanced Bazel features such as `select()` and custom rules. A reference on setting up CUDA and cuDNN.


This thorough explanation, coupled with the illustrative examples and suggested resources, should provide a robust foundation for effectively configuring Bazel for TensorFlow builds, addressing potential pitfalls I frequently encountered during my development experience.  Remember the importance of version consistency and precise dependency specification; these are the cornerstones of reliable and efficient TensorFlow development using Bazel.
