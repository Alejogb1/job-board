Linear regression, by its fundamental definition, models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions). The core assumption underlying ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression, which is most commonly implemented in Python libraries, is that the errors (or residuals) between the predicted and actual values are normally distributed with a *mean of zero*. This condition simplifies the mathematical derivations and provides a basis for statistical inference. However, it does not inherently prohibit the model from being applied to datasets where the underlying process might introduce a non-zero mean in the residuals. The challenge lies not in the regression calculation itself, but in interpreting the resulting model and acknowledging the implications of this non-zero mean. In practical scenarios, where the error distribution's mean deviates from zero, linear regression can still yield useful predictions but the standard interpretation of intercept and error terms need to be adjusted.

Typically, a non-zero Gaussian mean in the residuals suggests that some systematic bias exists in the model's predictions, or there are unmodeled variables that are contributing to this shift. The predicted values will consistently overestimate or underestimate the target, depending on the sign of the mean residual. For example, consider a model attempting to predict house prices based solely on square footage. If, in reality, location plays a significant role and is not included in the model, houses in desirable locations will tend to be underestimated (resulting in a negative mean residual if locations are omitted, or positive if the price associated with location were negatively correlated with square footage), while those in less desirable areas will tend to be overestimated.

While the Gaussian distribution in the error term is assumed, the non-zero mean is an indication of the lack of fit between the model and the underlying relationships, specifically, some uncaptured structure in the data. Thus, the practical approach to address a non-zero mean in the residuals from a linear regression model is not necessarily to modify the regression algorithm itself, but rather to either improve the feature selection, introduce more pertinent variables, or transform the response variable. Adjusting the intercept value directly in the model could appear to compensate for the non-zero mean, but this approach usually only masks the issue without addressing its root cause and prevents proper interpretation of the model coefficients.

Here are three code examples, using Python's scikit-learn, illustrating how to create and evaluate linear regression models, along with the typical diagnosis for non-zero mean residuals:

**Example 1: Simple Linear Regression with Simulated Biased Data**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Generate data with a systematic bias
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.linspace(0, 10, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
y = 2 * X.flatten() + 5 + np.random.normal(2, 1, 100) # Non-zero mean (2) error

# Fit the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
y_pred = model.predict(X)

# Calculate residuals and their mean
residuals = y - y_pred
mean_residual = np.mean(residuals)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y, y_pred))

# Output results
print(f"Mean Residual: {mean_residual:.4f}")
print(f"Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse:.4f}")
print(f"Model Intercept: {model.intercept_:.4f}")
print(f"Model Coefficient: {model.coef_[0]:.4f}")


# Plot actual data, predictions, and residuals
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(X, y, label='Actual Data')
plt.plot(X, y_pred, color='red', label='Predictions')
plt.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='--') # zero line for residuals
plt.scatter(X, residuals, color='green', label='Residuals') # Show residuals, not in line with regression
plt.title('Linear Regression with Biased Data')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y / Residuals')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This example generates data with a linear relationship plus a Gaussian noise that has a mean of 2, representing the systematic bias. The resulting mean residual will be positive, even though the OLS fit minimizes the sum of squared errors. The printed output displays a non-zero mean residual. The plot visualizes the residuals clustered away from the zero line. Importantly, the model itself still fits a line to the data as best it can, minimizing the squared errors, but the interpretation is affected. The intercept, in particular, is lower than the "true" intercept if the mean of the residual is positive.

**Example 2: Addressing the Bias by Including Additional Features**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Simulate data, adding a feature to eliminate the mean bias
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.linspace(0, 10, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
bias_factor = 2* np.ones(100).reshape(-1,1)
y = 2 * X.flatten() + 5 + np.random.normal(0, 1, 100)  #zero mean noise. This would now be the underlying relationship
y_biased = y + 2 # This is how we see the data in practice
X_extended = np.concatenate((X, bias_factor), axis =1)
# Fit the linear regression model, now with the bias offset term
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_extended, y_biased)
y_pred = model.predict(X_extended)


# Calculate residuals and their mean
residuals = y_biased - y_pred
mean_residual = np.mean(residuals)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_biased, y_pred))


# Output results
print(f"Mean Residual: {mean_residual:.4f}")
print(f"Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse:.4f}")
print(f"Model Intercept: {model.intercept_:.4f}")
print(f"Model Coefficients: {model.coef_[0]:.4f} and {model.coef_[1]:.4f}")


# Plot actual data, predictions, and residuals
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(X, y_biased, label='Actual Data')
plt.plot(X, y_pred, color='red', label='Predictions')
plt.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='--') # zero line for residuals
plt.scatter(X, residuals, color='green', label='Residuals') # Show residuals, now around the line
plt.title('Linear Regression with Bias Offset')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y / Residuals')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

In this example, we explicitly model the systematic bias by adding a constant feature to the model, where the bias_factor is included in the feature matrix `X_extended`. The linear regression model can now fit the biased data with a zero-mean residual. The mean residual is now close to zero, illustrating the effect of identifying and explicitly adding sources of systematic bias to a model.  Notice that the constant bias term corresponds to the second coefficient value. The bias has now been explained by an explanatory variable.

**Example 3: Examining Residuals for Pattern Detection**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Simulate data with a non-linear relationship
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.linspace(0, 10, 100).reshape(-1, 1)
y = 2 * X.flatten() + 5 + 0.5 * (X**2).flatten()  + np.random.normal(0, 2, 100) #non-linear

# Fit a linear regression model (incorrectly)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
y_pred = model.predict(X)


# Calculate residuals and their mean
residuals = y - y_pred
mean_residual = np.mean(residuals)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y, y_pred))

# Output results
print(f"Mean Residual: {mean_residual:.4f}")
print(f"Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse:.4f}")
print(f"Model Intercept: {model.intercept_:.4f}")
print(f"Model Coefficient: {model.coef_[0]:.4f}")

# Plot actual data, predictions, and residuals
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(X, y, label='Actual Data')
plt.plot(X, y_pred, color='red', label='Predictions')
plt.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='--') # zero line for residuals
plt.scatter(X, residuals, color='green', label='Residuals') # Show residuals, which now exhibit a pattern
plt.title('Linear Regression on Non-Linear Data')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y / Residuals')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

```

In this example, I've created data with a non-linear relationship (quadratic term included). Even if there is no external bias, we will still see a non-zero mean residual from the regression since the linear model fails to capture the non-linear trend, and the residuals show a clear pattern as a function of X rather than random noise. It visually demonstrates how a non-zero mean can also be a result of model misspecification. While the mean residual is not strongly deviated from zero here, it would be if we only use the early or late values of X. A non-zero mean, or even just a pattern in the residuals, can indicate the need for polynomial features or a different regression model altogether.

In summary, a non-zero mean in the residuals of a linear regression is a diagnostic tool indicating a lack of fit or an omitted variable, rather than a flaw in the linear regression algorithm itself. Addressing this often involves refining the feature engineering, inclusion of relevant variables, or even revisiting the underlying assumption of the functional form. Direct manipulation of the intercept should be done with great care, and is more appropriate when there is a known bias term that is not included in the regression.

For additional information, I would recommend exploring texts on linear models, statistical learning, and regression analysis to enhance your understanding of this topic. Specifically, "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani, along with "Applied Regression Analysis" by Norman Draper and Harry Smith offer in depth theoretical and practical considerations. These resources delve into the assumptions of linear regression, its limitations, and the proper interpretations of model outputs, all of which are important for effective use of this fundamental machine learning technique.
