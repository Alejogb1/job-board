Database Mail in SQL Server 2017 relies on the `msdb` database and its associated system tables for configuration and execution.  Crucially, direct manipulation of these tables is discouraged; instead, the system stored procedures provide the robust and supported interface for managing and utilizing this functionality.  My experience troubleshooting mail issues across numerous enterprise deployments has highlighted the importance of understanding these procedures and their parameters.  Incorrect configuration directly within the `msdb` tables can lead to unexpected behavior and require significant remediation.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Creating a stored procedure to send email using Database Mail involves several steps. First, the Database Mail profile must be correctly configured, defining the SMTP server, account credentials, and any other necessary connection settings. This is typically done through SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) using the Database Mail Configuration Wizard or directly via system stored procedures like `sp_send_dbmail`.  Second, a stored procedure encapsulates the logic for dynamically generating the email content and triggering the mail send operation. This allows for reusability and maintainability, especially in scenarios involving complex email generation requirements or the need for dynamic recipient lists.  Finally, the stored procedure must be granted the necessary permissions to access the Database Mail configuration and execute the `sp_send_dbmail` procedure.

The structure of such a stored procedure generally involves:

*   **Input parameters:** These define the email's subject, body, recipients, and any attachments.  The use of parameters allows for flexible and repeatable email generation.
*   **Email content generation:**  This section dynamically constructs the email body, possibly incorporating data retrieved from database queries.  Error handling should be integrated at this stage to gracefully manage scenarios where data retrieval fails.
*   **`sp_send_dbmail` execution:** This is the core function.  The procedure's parameters are passed to `sp_send_dbmail` to initiate the email sending process.
*   **Error handling and logging:** Comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms are essential to track email send failures and diagnose potential issues.  This often involves logging error messages to a dedicated table or using SQL Server's extended events.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Email Notification**

This example demonstrates sending a basic email notification using a stored procedure.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SendSimpleEmailNotification (@Message VARCHAR(MAX))
AS
BEGIN
    EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
        @profile_name = 'MyDatabaseMailProfile', -- Replace with your profile name
        @recipients = 'recipient@example.com', -- Replace with recipient email address
        @subject = 'Database Notification',
        @body = @Message;
END;
GO
```

This procedure takes a message as input and sends it as the email body.  It assumes a profile named 'MyDatabaseMailProfile' is already configured.  Error handling is omitted for brevity, but in a production environment, it's crucial to add checks for `sp_send_dbmail`'s return code and handle potential failures accordingly.


**Example 2: Email with Dynamic Data**

This example demonstrates generating the email body dynamically from a database query.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SendDataEmail (@Query VARCHAR(MAX))
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @EmailBody VARCHAR(MAX);
    SET @EmailBody = (SELECT QueryResult FROM OPENROWSET('SQLNCLI', 'Server=(local);Trusted_Connection=yes;', @Query));

    IF @@ERROR <> 0
    BEGIN
        -- Handle query execution error
        RAISERROR('Error executing query', 16, 1);
        RETURN;
    END;

    EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
        @profile_name = 'MyDatabaseMailProfile',
        @recipients = 'recipient@example.com',
        @subject = 'Database Data',
        @body = @EmailBody;
END;
GO
```

This procedure executes a dynamic SQL query passed as input, retrieves the result set, and uses it to construct the email body.  Crucially, error handling is incorporated to manage potential query execution failures. `OPENROWSET` is used here;  alternatives exist, depending on data volume and security considerations, such as inserting the results into a temporary table.


**Example 3: Email with Attachment**

This example demonstrates sending an email with an attachment.


```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.SendEmailWithAttachment (@Subject VARCHAR(255), @Body VARCHAR(MAX), @AttachmentPath VARCHAR(255))
AS
BEGIN
    EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
        @profile_name = 'MyDatabaseMailProfile',
        @recipients = 'recipient@example.com',
        @subject = @Subject,
        @body = @Body,
        @query = N'SELECT 1', -- Dummy Query needed if using attachments
        @attach_files = @AttachmentPath;
END;
GO
```

This procedure allows for specifying the subject, body, and path to an attachment. Note the inclusion of a dummy query;  `sp_send_dbmail` requires either a query or a body to be specified if using attachments.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

*   SQL Server Books Online:  This is the definitive resource for all things SQL Server, including detailed documentation on `sp_send_dbmail` and Database Mail configuration.  Pay close attention to the parameters and return codes.
*   SQL Server documentation on Database Mail: This section provides guidance on setup, configuration, and troubleshooting of Database Mail.  It's critical to understand the security implications and best practices for configuring Database Mail.
*   Third-party SQL Server administration guides:  Many excellent guides provide detailed explanations and practical examples of working with Database Mail and stored procedures. These offer different perspectives and often cover edge cases not explicitly addressed in Microsoft's documentation.


Remember to replace placeholder values (profile name, email addresses, attachment paths) with your actual configuration details.  Always test stored procedures thoroughly in a non-production environment before deploying them to production systems.  Furthermore, consider implementing robust exception handling and logging to ensure that email delivery failures are appropriately addressed and documented.  Regularly review and maintain your Database Mail configuration to ensure security and reliability.
