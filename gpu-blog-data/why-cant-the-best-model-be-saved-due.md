The absence of validation accuracy during the training of a machine learning model prevents the selection and subsequent saving of the "best" model because the process lacks the essential metric for evaluating generalization performance, thereby making a comparison between models ineffective and ultimately compromising the integrity of the chosen "best" model. I've encountered this precise issue multiple times throughout my years developing and deploying machine learning systems. This isn't simply a matter of a missing log; it reflects a fundamental flaw in the training process itself.

The core issue is that training accuracy, while important, only measures how well the model has learned the patterns within the *training data*. A model could achieve perfect, or near-perfect, training accuracy by simply memorizing the training examples – a phenomenon known as overfitting. This results in a model that performs exceptionally well on the data it was trained on but exhibits poor performance when confronted with new, unseen data. Conversely, validation accuracy assesses how well the model generalizes to data it hasn't encountered during training. It is the most reliable indicator of a model's real-world performance. Without it, there is no principled way to determine which version of the model is truly superior, as the selection process defaults to relying on training performance, which is an unreliable metric for generalization.

To clarify, the training process for most supervised machine learning models involves iteratively adjusting model parameters to minimize a loss function computed on the training data. Concurrently, a separate dataset, the validation set, is passed through the model at regular intervals, or after each training epoch. The model’s performance is then evaluated using a different loss metric appropriate for the problem at hand (classification accuracy, F1 score, mean squared error, etc.) calculated on the validation data. This validation metric is what is actually used to decide which model to save as the "best." This ensures that models are selected based on their capacity for generalization and not merely on their capacity to fit the training data. If you only observe the training performance, selecting the model that scores best according to that data will almost invariably lead to choosing an overfitted model.

Let's explore some examples to illustrate this problem within a coding context using Python and a hypothetical machine learning training setup. In this example, we'll use a common classification framework. Assume we are using scikit-learn for the classifier and NumPy for the dataset.

**Example 1: Missing Validation During Training**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate synthetic data
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

# Split into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize model
model = LogisticRegression()

best_accuracy = 0
best_model = None

for epoch in range(100):
    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict on training data
    y_train_pred = model.predict(X_train)
    train_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_train, y_train_pred)
    
    # Print training accuracy - for monitoring
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Training Accuracy: {train_accuracy}")

    # This is where the problem is - there's no validation data check
    if train_accuracy > best_accuracy:
       best_accuracy = train_accuracy
       best_model = model

print(f"Best Training Accuracy: {best_accuracy}")

if best_model:
  # We've 'saved' the model, but it's based only on training performance
  print("Model saved, but validation performance is unknown.")
else:
   print("No model was saved.")
```
In this first example, I deliberately excluded the validation accuracy calculation and the conditional check using validation data. The code trains the model for 100 epochs. It then proceeds to save the model with the highest *training* accuracy observed. This is a flawed approach, as the highest training accuracy doesn't guarantee the model is generalizing well. The saved model is essentially arbitrary.

**Example 2: Correct Validation Implementation**

Now let's modify the code to include a proper validation check:
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate synthetic data
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

# Split into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize model
model = LogisticRegression()

best_val_accuracy = 0
best_model = None

for epoch in range(100):
    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict on validation data
    y_val_pred = model.predict(X_val)
    val_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, y_val_pred)

    # Print validation accuracy for monitoring
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Validation Accuracy: {val_accuracy}")

    # Check if validation accuracy is higher than previous best
    if val_accuracy > best_val_accuracy:
        best_val_accuracy = val_accuracy
        best_model = model

print(f"Best Validation Accuracy: {best_val_accuracy}")

if best_model:
  # Now the saved model is based on validation performance
  print("Model saved based on validation performance.")
else:
   print("No model was saved.")

```

In Example 2, we’ve corrected the error. The code now calculates and checks the validation accuracy at every epoch. This code now correctly compares model performance using validation data and picks the 'best' model based on its ability to generalize, rather than just fit the training data.

**Example 3: Early Stopping (A More Advanced Approach)**

In some cases, a model might overfit even when monitored with a validation dataset. Early stopping can be implemented, using the validation data to not only pick the best model, but to also terminate the training process to prevent over-training:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate synthetic data
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

# Split into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize model
model = LogisticRegression()

best_val_accuracy = 0
best_model = None
patience = 10  # Number of epochs to wait for improvement
no_improvement_count = 0

for epoch in range(100):
    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict on validation data
    y_val_pred = model.predict(X_val)
    val_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, y_val_pred)

    # Print validation accuracy for monitoring
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch+1}, Validation Accuracy: {val_accuracy}")

    # Check if validation accuracy is higher than previous best
    if val_accuracy > best_val_accuracy:
        best_val_accuracy = val_accuracy
        best_model = model
        no_improvement_count = 0 # Reset count
    else:
        no_improvement_count += 1

    # Stop early if no improvement for 'patience' epochs
    if no_improvement_count >= patience:
        print(f"Early stopping at epoch {epoch+1}, no improvement in validation accuracy.")
        break # Terminate training
print(f"Best Validation Accuracy: {best_val_accuracy}")

if best_model:
  # Now the saved model is based on validation performance
  print("Model saved based on validation performance.")
else:
  print("No model was saved.")
```
In this third example, the code implements early stopping. If the validation accuracy does not improve after a certain number of epochs (defined by the patience variable) the training loop terminates. This is another method to avoid over-training and to save a well performing model.

In summation, without validation accuracy, the choice of which model to save is effectively arbitrary. It's akin to choosing the best student based on how well they remember lecture notes instead of evaluating their ability to apply the concepts. Using the validation data is paramount and, in practice, it should almost never be left out of any model training process.

For further study, I would suggest consulting resources focusing on cross-validation techniques and model evaluation in general. Good resources also include books and online guides related to practical machine learning and deep learning frameworks. Understanding model generalization, bias-variance tradeoff and overfitting will all contribute to a better understanding of the problem described.
