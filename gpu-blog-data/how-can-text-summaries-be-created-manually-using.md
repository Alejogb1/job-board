Text summarization, specifically the manual creation of summaries using TensorFlow, rests upon the foundation of representing textual data in a numerical format suitable for machine learning operations. We aren't discussing automatic summarization here; instead, I'm referring to a process where a user, or developer, makes a decision on what information is salient, and then leverages TensorFlow’s capabilities to organize and process the text for further use, such as analysis, or building a custom database. I've used this technique frequently to develop systems which require highly specific summarizations, for instance, distilling complex legal contracts into concise, searchable annotations.

The core idea is to transform text into a tensor format that represents its semantic meaning. This typically involves a combination of preprocessing, feature engineering, and then some sort of human-guided mapping to create a condensed representation. The manual aspect is critical - we’re deciding what's important, not training an algorithm to do so autonomously. This might seem like an inefficient approach when full automation is possible, but it offers precision and control which is crucial for certain types of information.

Firstly, preprocessing is key. Raw text often contains irrelevant characters, different casing, and redundancy, all of which will pollute the final tensor representations. We start with tokenization – breaking the text down into individual words, or sometimes smaller units like sub-words. TensorFlow offers tokenization capabilities, but I typically perform a preliminary cleanse using regular expressions in Python. Lowercasing, removing punctuation, and handling contractions are all standard steps to ensure consistency. Stemming or lemmatization – reducing words to their root form – can be used to further condense the vocabulary, but this process requires careful consideration, as it can sometimes distort the intended meaning.

Following tokenization, we need to create a numerical representation of the tokens. I've found that a simple vocabulary mapping and one-hot encoding, is sufficient, and often preferable to more complex embeddings for manual summarization tasks, when the aim is to create structured labels for the summaries. The size of the vocabulary is something you might want to fine-tune depending on the corpus, but it is important to know that every word not present in the vocabulary will be treated as an unknown word, which will require specific handling. Each unique token in the vocabulary will be associated with a distinct index. Each piece of text can then be transformed into a sequence of integers, which are the indices corresponding to the tokens of the text.

At this stage, we can use TensorFlow to convert these integer sequences to one-hot vectors. Each integer index in the sequence is turned into a vector of zeros with only a single one at the position indicated by the token’s index. This produces sparse representations, where most values are zero. Alternatively, dense embedding representations, which reduce the dimensionality of the text representation, may also be used, but are less suited for manual summarization when human readable intermediate representation are required.

With this representation established, the manual summarization aspect comes into play. We analyze the text and select specific key phrases or concepts. Then, we use these identified phrases as 'labels' for creating summary vectors. This is a completely user-driven process; we’re essentially creating a controlled vocabulary of summary concepts. Once you have defined your summary labels, you can then create a manual label for each document, using its full vectorized representation, alongside the labels you have manually created, in this manner the human selected salient information and its representation is clearly separated.

Now, let's explore some examples.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import re
import numpy as np

# Example text
text = "This is a sample text, containing a few sample words. The sample words are used to show the concept."

# 1. Preprocessing
def preprocess_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)
    return text

preprocessed_text = preprocess_text(text)
print("Preprocessed Text:", preprocessed_text)

# 2. Tokenization
tokens = preprocessed_text.split()
print("Tokens:", tokens)

# 3. Vocabulary creation
vocab = sorted(list(set(tokens)))
vocab_size = len(vocab)
print("Vocabulary:", vocab)
print("Vocabulary Size:", vocab_size)

# 4. Numerical encoding
word_to_index = {word: index for index, word in enumerate(vocab)}
encoded_text = [word_to_index[word] for word in tokens]
print("Encoded Text:", encoded_text)

# 5. One-hot encoding
one_hot_encoded = tf.one_hot(encoded_text, depth=vocab_size)
print("One-Hot Encoded Shape:", one_hot_encoded.shape)
print("One-Hot Encoded (First 3):", one_hot_encoded.numpy()[:3])
```

In the first example, I showcase preprocessing, tokenization, vocabulary construction, integer encoding, and finally, one-hot encoding using TensorFlow. It is a relatively basic, and essential, implementation of the initial steps required for the kind of manual summarization technique I am describing here. We start with the cleaning and tokenization, which produces a list of cleaned tokens. Next a mapping between words and indexes is created, using a list of unique words, which allows us to then encode the text to a sequence of integers. Finally, the integer sequence is converted to a one hot encoded matrix, suitable for feeding into further tensorflow functions.

```python
# Example with summary labels
summary_labels = ["concept", "sample", "text"]

# Manual Summary Creation: Say we identify that the text is about concepts
summary_indices = [summary_labels.index(label) for label in ["concept","sample"]]

summary_vector = tf.one_hot(summary_indices, depth=len(summary_labels))

print("Summary Labels:", summary_labels)
print("Summary Vector:", summary_vector)
```

This second example shows how the 'manual' part is implemented. Based on an analysis of the example text, I decided that the relevant summary labels are "concept," "sample," and "text". From this, I manually select "concept" and "sample" as summary labels for the example text, then create an one-hot vector representation of the labels. This vector now captures the most salient aspects of the text, from my perspective, and it can be associated with the one-hot encoding of the text to build a training set for a supervised learning method. Note, that for many types of use case you could include multiple summary vectors associated to the same text, which allows the system to be more flexible and versatile.

```python
# Example Using dense embedding
embedding_dim = 5
embedding_layer = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
embedded_text = embedding_layer(encoded_text)
print("Embedded Text Shape:", embedded_text.shape)
print("Embedded Text (First 3):", embedded_text.numpy()[:3])

# Apply mean pooling
pooled_embedding = tf.reduce_mean(embedded_text, axis=0)
print("Pooled Embedding Shape:", pooled_embedding.shape)
print("Pooled Embedding:", pooled_embedding)
```

The third example demonstrates how to use embeddings instead of one-hot encoding. This may be useful if a more compact representation of the text is required. The words are embedded into a dense representation and then a mean pooling is applied to create a vector representation of the whole text. A similar methodology could also be employed with the manual summary labels if a more compact representation was desired. It is important to note that for manual summarization tasks I typically use one-hot encoding or a combination of one hot encoding and manual summary labels, as they are easier to interpret and debug, even if the overall dimensionality of the representation is larger, especially when it's crucial to maintain human readability and the direct link between the text and its summary.

In practical applications, these vectors can be used for various tasks. One frequent use-case for me was to build a search system for a dataset of documents, and the system would retrieve documents that matched the labels associated to the search query, using cosine similarity. This technique allowed for the creation of a human-curated index of document categories that was well suited for the retrieval of documents that matched complex search queries.

To enhance your understanding and skills, I would highly recommend studying the following areas in more detail. First, explore the TensorFlow documentation on the `tf.keras.layers.TextVectorization`, for a robust tool for preprocessing text data. Furthermore, focus on understanding `tf.one_hot` to create representations of tokens and labels. Familiarize yourself with the concepts of tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization through Python’s `NLTK` library, as they form the backbone of text preprocessing. Finally, consider exploring different dense embedding techniques to make sure you select the best representation for your use case. These are core aspects required to go beyond the scope of simple examples to create real world applications. The core idea is to establish a robust process that is human-readable and interpretable, where each step can be debugged by a developer familiar with the content and its interpretation. By carefully managing the vocabulary, numerical representations, and by defining manual summary labels, a high-degree of precision can be achieved.
