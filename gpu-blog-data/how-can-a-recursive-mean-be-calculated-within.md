The crux of calculating a recursive mean within a Keras custom loss function lies in efficiently leveraging TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities while avoiding explicit loop constructs, which can hinder performance.  My experience optimizing loss functions for large-scale image segmentation models highlighted this challenge.  Directly implementing a recursive mean calculation within a gradient tape context frequently led to instability and slow training times. The key is to leverage TensorFlow's vectorized operations to achieve the same result with significantly improved efficiency.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A recursive mean, in the context of a Keras custom loss function, implies computing a mean across a tensor where each element's contribution depends on previously computed means. This contrasts with a simple average, where each element contributes equally.  We are not dealing with a straightforward average of predictions against ground truth. Instead, we might be working with a scenario where the error at each point is weighted or influenced by errors at neighboring points.  This might be relevant in situations like time series prediction or image segmentation where spatial coherence is crucial. Direct recursion is computationally expensive and can break automatic differentiation. The solution involves transforming the recursive relationship into a vectorized or matrix-based operation compatible with TensorFlow’s automatic differentiation.

The standard recursive mean formula is:

`mean_i = ( (i-1) * mean_(i-1) + x_i ) / i`

where `mean_i` is the mean up to element `i`, `mean_(i-1)` is the mean up to element `i-1`, and `x_i` is the `i`-th element.  Directly translating this into a TensorFlow operation within a `tf.GradientTape` context is problematic due to the dependence on previous iteration's results. Instead, we can leverage cumulative sums to achieve the same effect efficiently.

The cumulative sum `cumsum(x)` gives us the sum of all elements up to each point.  Dividing the cumulative sum by the index `[1, 2, ..., n]` gives us the recursive mean at each point.  This vectorized operation is differentiable within TensorFlow's computational graph, enabling proper backpropagation during training.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Recursive Mean Calculation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def recursive_mean_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  """Calculates the recursive mean of the element-wise difference between y_true and y_pred."""
  diff = y_true - y_pred
  cumsum = tf.cumsum(diff, axis=0)
  indices = tf.range(1, tf.shape(y_true)[0] + 1, dtype=tf.float32)
  recursive_mean = cumsum / indices
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(recursive_mean)) #Example using absolute difference as metric

#Example Usage
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[0.8], [1.5], [3.5], [3.8]])
loss = recursive_mean_loss(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Recursive Mean Loss: {loss}")
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward calculation. The `tf.cumsum` function computes the cumulative sum along the specified axis (here, axis=0).  The `tf.range` function generates the index vector for division. This approach effectively avoids explicit recursion, maintaining differentiability within the TensorFlow graph.  The final loss is the mean of the absolute values of the recursive means – you could replace this with other suitable loss functions like mean squared error.


**Example 2: Weighted Recursive Mean:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_recursive_mean_loss(y_true, y_pred, weights):
  """Calculates a weighted recursive mean of the element-wise difference."""
  diff = (y_true - y_pred) * weights  #Element-wise multiplication with weights
  cumsum = tf.cumsum(diff, axis=0)
  indices = tf.cumsum(weights, axis=0) #Weights now influence denominator
  recursive_mean = tf.where(indices > 0, cumsum / indices, 0.0) #Avoid division by zero
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(recursive_mean))


# Example Usage
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[0.8], [1.5], [3.5], [3.8]])
weights = tf.constant([[0.5], [1.0], [1.5], [1.0]])
loss = weighted_recursive_mean_loss(y_true, y_pred, weights)
print(f"Weighted Recursive Mean Loss: {loss}")
```

This example extends the previous one by incorporating weights. The error at each point is multiplied by a corresponding weight before accumulating the cumulative sum.  The denominator also incorporates these weights, ensuring a weighted average at each step.  The `tf.where` condition handles cases where the cumulative weight might be zero, preventing division-by-zero errors. This is critical for robustness.


**Example 3: Recursive Mean across multiple dimensions:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def multidim_recursive_mean_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    """Calculates recursive mean across multiple dimensions."""
    diff = y_true - y_pred
    cumsum = tf.cumsum(diff, axis=1)  # Cumsum across the second dimension (assuming batch size is first)
    indices = tf.cast(tf.range(1, tf.shape(y_true)[1] + 1), tf.float32) #indices for this dimension
    indices = tf.reshape(indices, [1, -1]) #reshape to enable broadcasting
    recursive_mean = cumsum / indices
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(recursive_mean))


# Example usage (assuming a batch of 2 samples with 4 features each)
y_true = tf.constant([[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]], [[5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[[0.8, 1.5, 3.5, 3.8]], [[4.5, 5.5, 7.5, 7.8]]])
loss = multidim_recursive_mean_loss(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Multi-Dimensional Recursive Mean Loss: {loss}")

```

This example showcases the adaptability of the cumulative sum approach to multi-dimensional tensors. By specifying the `axis` in `tf.cumsum`, we control the direction of the cumulative sum.  The code assumes a common scenario where the first dimension represents the batch size, and the recursive mean needs to be computed along another dimension.  Broadcasting is used to ensure correct dimensions for division.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation and its integration with custom loss functions, I suggest reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation and exploring tutorials on custom training loops.  Furthermore, delving into linear algebra resources will help consolidate the understanding of vectorized operations and their application to efficiently solve recursive problems.  Finally, studying numerical methods textbooks can provide valuable insights into the stability and optimization of iterative numerical computations.
