The crucial point regarding symbolic tensor/graph execution errors in TensorFlow model subclasses lies in the decoupling of graph construction and execution.  Unlike eager execution, where operations are performed immediately, the symbolic approach builds a computation graph first, then executes it.  This separation introduces a unique class of errors often masked until runtime, particularly when dealing with custom model subclasses. In my experience debugging large-scale TensorFlow models within a research setting, these errors frequently manifested as cryptic `InvalidArgumentError` or `NotFoundError` exceptions, stemming from inconsistencies between the defined graph structure and the data fed during execution.

My initial approach to tackling such issues was a meticulous review of the `__call__` method within my custom model subclasses. This is where the core logic for tensor manipulation and layer application resides.  Errors here often arise from mismatched tensor shapes, incorrect data types, or improper handling of control flow within the graph.  I found that aggressively employing static shape checking during the graph construction phase significantly reduced the frequency of these runtime surprises.

Let's examine three specific scenarios illustrating common sources of such errors:

**Example 1: Mismatched Tensor Shapes in a Custom Layer**

Consider a custom layer designed for spatial feature extraction.  Incorrectly handling input shape variations during the graph construction can lead to runtime failures.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SpatialExtractor(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, kernel_size, **kwargs):
        super(SpatialExtractor, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.kernel_size = kernel_size
        self.conv = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=kernel_size)

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Error prone area: Assumes a fixed input shape.  
        # Should handle variations dynamically using tf.shape
        if inputs.shape != (None, 256, 256, 3):
            raise ValueError("Input shape mismatch") # less helpful than shape checks within TensorFlow.
        x = self.conv(inputs)
        return x

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    SpatialExtractor(kernel_size=(3,3), name="extractor"),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Example of problematic execution:
input_shape = (1, 512, 512, 3) # different from the hardcoded value!
inputs = tf.random.normal(input_shape)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    try:
        output = sess.run(model(inputs))
    except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
        print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")
```

The problem here lies in the rigid shape check within the `call` method.  A more robust solution involves using TensorFlow's shape manipulation functions to adapt to varying input shapes.  Replacing the error-prone `if` statement with dynamic shape handling via `tf.shape` or `tf.TensorShape` is crucial.


**Example 2: Type Errors in Custom Loss Functions**

Custom loss functions frequently cause symbolic execution errors if they don't explicitly handle potential type mismatches.


```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    # Error prone area:  Assumes both are floats.  No check for type.
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10),
])
model.compile(loss=custom_loss, optimizer='adam')

# Problematic data:
y_true = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.int32)  # Integer type!
y_pred = tf.random.normal((3,))

model.fit(tf.random.normal((3, 10)), y_true, epochs=1) # error during graph construction/execution.

```

The lack of type checking in the `custom_loss` function can lead to unexpected errors if the input tensors `y_true` and `y_pred` have inconsistent data types.  Explicit type casting using `tf.cast` within the loss function would prevent such issues.


**Example 3: Control Flow Issues within the Model Subclass**

Improper use of TensorFlow's control flow operations (e.g., `tf.cond`, `tf.while_loop`) within the model's `call` method can lead to subtle errors during graph construction if not carefully managed.


```python
import tensorflow as tf

class ConditionalLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        # Error prone area:  Incorrect handling of tensor shapes inside tf.cond.
        return tf.cond(tf.greater(tf.reduce_mean(inputs), 0.5),
                       lambda: inputs * 2,
                       lambda: inputs / 2)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([ConditionalLayer()])

# Execution will likely lead to errors.
inputs = tf.random.normal((1, 10)) # if one branch outputs different shape than other.
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    try:
        output = sess.run(model(inputs))
    except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
        print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")
```

The conditional layer may produce tensors of differing shapes depending on the condition.  The graph construction process needs to handle these shape variations consistently.  Carefully defining the output shape of `tf.cond` to accommodate both branches prevents this type of failure.  Consider using `tf.where` instead, where the conditions are checked before the operation is performed.  This minimizes shape inconsistencies within the conditional branches.

**Resource Recommendations:**

Thorough understanding of TensorFlow's graph execution mechanism is paramount.  Consult the official TensorFlow documentation regarding graph construction and execution.  Pay close attention to the sections detailing shape inference and data type handling.  Familiarize yourself with debugging tools provided by TensorFlow to aid in identifying the source of errors during graph construction or execution. Finally,  mastering the use of `tf.debugging` tools within the execution context greatly aids in isolating these issues.  Systematic testing with various input shapes and data types, combined with careful code review of your custom layer implementations, is a robust prevention strategy.
