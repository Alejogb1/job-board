The core issue of a size mismatch error in PyTorch during training, where a prediction has a size of [2, 73] and the target has a size of [2, 33], stems directly from an incompatibility between the shape of the output tensor generated by your model and the shape of the tensor expected by your loss function. In essence, PyTorch's loss functions are designed to operate on tensors with precisely defined dimensions, and a mismatch in these dimensions during backpropagation will inevitably lead to this error.

From my past experience, having worked on numerous sequence-to-sequence tasks involving text generation and machine translation, I frequently encountered this exact problem. It often boils down to a misunderstanding of how the output of your model's forward pass corresponds to the shape requirements of your loss function, and specifically how the target or ground truth data is prepared. This error doesn't necessarily point to a flaw in the model architecture itself, but rather to an inconsistency between the data preparation and model output. The dimensions ‘2’ and ‘73’ in the predicted tensor represent a batch size of 2, with each sample within that batch having 73 features, elements, or categories. Similarly, the dimensions ‘2’ and ‘33’ in the target tensor also represent a batch size of 2, but each sample here contains 33 elements. The discrepancy in the second dimension, 73 versus 33, is the critical point of conflict.

Fundamentally, loss functions require the predicted and target tensors to have compatible shapes, meaning their dimensions need to align in the context of the problem being addressed. For instance, if your task involves classification into 33 classes, and your model outputs 73 distinct values per sample, this will likely not directly align with a conventional multi-class cross-entropy loss that expects probabilities for each class (or at least log-probabilities). There can be several causes for this disparity, ranging from incorrect final layer architecture in the model, incorrect data preprocessing, or a misunderstanding of the specific dimensions required for the chosen loss function, especially in tasks like sequence modelling where outputs can have a variable length based on context. The core of the issue is, at the point the loss is calculated, the tensors must have matching shapes, or shapes compatible for broadcasting (which is not in play here as the differences are in the key dimension being compared.)

To illustrate, consider three scenarios where these size mismatches commonly occur in text-related sequence-to-sequence modeling. The first scenario involves a classification task.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Scenario 1: Classification Model with Incorrect Output Size
class ClassificationModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(ClassificationModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size) #Incorrect Output Size

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

input_size = 100
hidden_size = 50
num_classes = 33 # Target size is 33 classes
incorrect_output_size = 73 # model produces 73 outputs.

model = ClassificationModel(input_size, hidden_size, incorrect_output_size) #output layer size wrong.
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Simulate input data
batch_size = 2
input_data = torch.randn(batch_size, input_size)
target_data = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (batch_size,))

# Forward Pass
predicted_data = model(input_data)

# Loss Calculation resulting in size mismatch
try:
  loss = criterion(predicted_data, target_data) # Error will occur here due to size mismatch
  print(loss) # This won't print, due to the error.
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during Loss Calculation: {e}")
```
In this code, I designed a model to perform a classification task. The target_data is encoded as class integers, and is of shape (2,), while the model returns 73 scores per class (i.e., shape (2, 73)). `CrossEntropyLoss` expects the prediction and target to have compatible sizes, typically either `(batch_size, num_classes)` with the target as `(batch_size)` for class IDs, or the output as `(batch_size, num_classes)` and the target as `(batch_size, num_classes)` for one hot encoded labels. Therefore, when calculating the loss, a mismatch error occurs because the model's final fully connected layer is producing an output of 73 dimensions rather than the expected number of classes (33). This is a common error when developing the model or during model integration.

The next scenario illustrates a related situation in the context of sequence prediction.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Scenario 2: Sequence Prediction with Incorrect Output Size
class SequenceModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, vocab_size):
        super(SequenceModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(hidden_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, vocab_size) # Incorrect Output Size

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.embedding(x)
        _, (h_n, _) = self.lstm(x)
        x = self.fc(h_n[-1])  # Using the final hidden state, we project to vocab_size dimension.
        return x

input_vocab_size = 1000
hidden_size = 128
target_vocab_size = 33  # Target has 33 vocabulary size.
incorrect_output_size = 73 # model produces 73 outputs.
sequence_length = 20
batch_size = 2

model = SequenceModel(input_vocab_size, hidden_size, incorrect_output_size)

# Simulate input and target sequences
input_seq = torch.randint(0, input_vocab_size, (batch_size, sequence_length))
target_seq = torch.randint(0, target_vocab_size, (batch_size, sequence_length))

# Model outputs.
predicted_seq = model(input_seq)

# Loss Calculation with mismatch
try:
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    loss = criterion(predicted_seq, target_seq) # Error here due to size mismatch.
    print(loss) # This won't print.
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during Loss Calculation: {e}")
```
This second code shows how similar problems occur in a sequence generation context. The model is outputting a 73-dimensional vector per sample, intended to be the logits (raw values, non-probabilities) for a vocabulary of size 73, while the `target_seq` has an encoding of tokens with a vocabulary size of 33. The `CrossEntropyLoss`, although more versatile than the previous scenario (handling both single label and sequence labels), still requires that the model outputs the predicted distribution of the *actual* vocabulary size. Again the model’s output layer does not match the size of the target labels. The error occurs when we attempt to calculate the cross entropy loss, as PyTorch can’t compare scores from 73 classes with target tokens of only 33 classes.

Finally, a third scenario demonstrates how the error might manifest in a regression context with an incorrect final model layer.
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Scenario 3: Regression Model with Incorrect Output Size
class RegressionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(RegressionModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size) #Incorrect Output Size

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

input_size = 100
hidden_size = 50
num_outputs = 33 # Expected Target Size
incorrect_output_size = 73 # Model produces 73 outputs.

model = RegressionModel(input_size, hidden_size, incorrect_output_size)

batch_size = 2
input_data = torch.randn(batch_size, input_size)
target_data = torch.randn(batch_size, num_outputs)

predicted_data = model(input_data)

try:
  criterion = nn.MSELoss()
  loss = criterion(predicted_data, target_data) # Size mismatch here.
  print(loss)
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error during Loss Calculation: {e}")
```

In this third scenario, the model is performing regression, and the `target_data` has the shape [2, 33]. The model, however, produces a tensor of shape [2, 73], resulting in another mismatch. The `MSELoss` function requires the input and target to have the same shape. The model is simply producing the wrong number of values for each sample.

To address this, you must modify either the model's final layer to match the expected output size, or transform the target data to align with the model's output size. The latter might involve padding or reshaping operations depending on the application context.  Additionally, you should examine if your data processing steps or dataloading pipeline may be altering the expected tensor shapes. A further common case is the need to include a softmax layer in a classification problem, which can change the size of the output depending on where it is placed.

For deeper understanding, the "Deep Learning with PyTorch" book offers a comprehensive look at building and training neural networks. The official PyTorch documentation is the most reliable resource for precise explanations of API functions and how PyTorch handles tensor operations. Finally, publications and courses by Andrew Ng on deep learning are a foundational resource for more theoretical insights into the nuances of training and understanding the mathematics underpinning these models.
