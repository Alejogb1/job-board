TensorFlow's R interface, while less extensively documented than its Python counterpart, provides robust tools for feature normalization.  My experience working on large-scale genomic prediction models highlighted the critical need for consistent and efficient normalization, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional datasets.  Inconsistent feature scaling can lead to biased model training and impaired generalization, issues I encountered firsthand before implementing the strategies outlined below.  Proper normalization ensures features contribute equally to the model's learning process, improving performance and interpretability.

**1.  Clear Explanation of Feature Normalization in TensorFlow with R**

Normalization, in the context of machine learning, refers to the process of scaling numerical features to a specific range or distribution. This prevents features with larger magnitudes from dominating the model's learning process, which can occur when features have vastly different scales. TensorFlow's R interface offers several methods for normalization, primarily through the use of layers within a `keras` model or via preprocessing functions.  The most common approaches are min-max scaling and z-score standardization.

Min-max scaling, also known as normalization, transforms features to a range between 0 and 1. This is particularly useful when the feature's distribution is not assumed to be Gaussian. The formula is:

`x' = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))`

where `x'` is the normalized value, `x` is the original value, `min(x)` is the minimum value of the feature, and `max(x)` is the maximum value.

Z-score standardization transforms features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This assumes a Gaussian distribution and is robust to outliers. The formula is:

`x' = (x - mean(x)) / std(x)`

where `x'` is the standardized value, `x` is the original value, `mean(x)` is the mean of the feature, and `std(x)` is the standard deviation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Min-Max Scaling using a Keras Layer**

```R
library(tensorflow)

# Sample data
data <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100, ncol = 10)

# Create a sequential model
model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 64, activation = "relu", input_shape = c(10)) %>%
  layer_batch_normalization() %>% #Apply Batch Normalization for improved training stability
  layer_dense(units = 1)

# Compile the model (example for regression)
model %>% compile(
  loss = "mse",
  optimizer = "adam"
)

#Creating a normalization layer.  Note the input_shape is crucial.
normalization_layer <- layer_lambda(function(x) (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)), input_shape = c(10))

#Adding it to a new sequential model:
normalized_model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  normalization_layer %>%
  layer_dense(units = 64, activation = "relu") %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1)

# Compile the normalized model
normalized_model %>% compile(
  loss = "mse",
  optimizer = "adam"
)

#Fit the model to your data. Replace your_data with the appropriate data frame.
normalized_model %>% fit(x=data, y=your_data$target, epochs = 10)

```

This example demonstrates how to incorporate min-max scaling within the model architecture itself using a custom lambda layer.  This approach is particularly beneficial when deploying the model, as normalization becomes an integrated part of the prediction pipeline.  The `layer_batch_normalization()` layer, added prior to the dense layer for training stability, is crucial especially during training with activations like ReLU, where normalization prevents gradient issues and speeds up convergence. The critical point is defining the `input_shape` argument in the lambda layer to match the dimensionality of the input data.  Failure to do so will result in shape mismatch errors.


**Example 2: Z-Score Standardization using TensorFlow Operations**

```R
library(tensorflow)

# Sample data
data <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100, ncol = 10)

# Calculate mean and standard deviation
means <- tf$math$reduce_mean(data, axis = 0)
stds <- tf$math$reduce_std(data, axis = 0)

#Standardize the data.  Ensure that stds does not contain any zeros; handle this appropriately for production code.
standardized_data <- (data - means) / stds

#Further model building steps, using standardized_data as input.
#Example:
model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 64, activation = "relu", input_shape = c(10)) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1)

model %>% compile(loss = 'mse', optimizer = 'adam')

model %>% fit(standardized_data, your_data$target, epochs=10)
```

This code directly utilizes TensorFlow operations to perform z-score standardization before feeding the data to the Keras model. This approach offers greater control and can be easily adapted to different normalization needs.  Critically, handling potential division by zero errors (when a standard deviation is zero) needs to be addressed using conditional statements or robust statistical techniques; I omitted this for brevity but strongly recommend including it in production environments.


**Example 3: Feature-wise Normalization using Preprocessing Functions**

```R
library(tensorflow)

# Sample data
data <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100, ncol = 10)

# Normalize each feature separately using a loop
for (i in 1:ncol(data)) {
  min_val <- min(data[, i])
  max_val <- max(data[, i])
  data[, i] <- (data[, i] - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
}

#Use the normalized data in your model.
model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 64, activation = "relu", input_shape = c(10)) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 1)

model %>% compile(loss = 'mse', optimizer = 'adam')

model %>% fit(data, your_data$target, epochs=10)

```

This example uses a loop to apply min-max scaling independently to each feature. While less elegant than the previous methods, this approach provides maximum flexibility, enabling different normalization techniques for individual features if needed.  This is particularly useful when dealing with heterogeneous data where features have differing scales and distributions.  Remember to handle the case of `max_val == min_val` to avoid division by zero errors.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

The TensorFlow R documentation, the official Keras documentation, and a comprehensive textbook on machine learning with R are excellent resources for further understanding and practical implementation.   Exploring advanced normalization techniques like robust scaling (using median and median absolute deviation) and methods dealing with skewed data will further enhance your feature engineering capabilities.  Furthermore, understanding the interplay between normalization and regularization techniques is crucial for optimal model performance.
