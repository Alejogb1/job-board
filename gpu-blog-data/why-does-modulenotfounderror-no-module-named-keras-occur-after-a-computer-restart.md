The `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keras'` occurring after a system restart, despite Keras having previously worked, typically indicates a disconnect between the Python environment where Keras is installed and the environment being used during subsequent execution. This issue is fundamentally about environmental variables, Python virtual environments, and the way the operating system resolves executable paths.

Specifically, the Python interpreter, when encountering an import statement (like `import keras`), searches specific directories for the required module. These directories are defined by the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable and the standard library locations inherent to the Python installation. If Keras is installed within a specific virtual environment or via a user-level installation mechanism, this location is not automatically registered or permanently remembered by the core operating system path configuration across sessions. Consequently, a restart clears this transient environmental context, leading to the interpreter being unable to find the Keras module when the script is re-run.

Here is a breakdown of the common contributing factors and solutions, informed by my experience debugging similar scenarios across different platforms:

**1. Virtual Environment Isolation:**

The primary benefit of a virtual environment is to isolate project dependencies. Tools like `venv` or `conda` create a self-contained directory structure that encapsulates the specific Python interpreter and packages for a project. Consider the following scenario: I initially installed Keras within a `my_project_env` environment activated via the command `source my_project_env/bin/activate`. Keras worked flawlessly. However, after a restart and without activating the environment, I try to run my Keras script and receive the `ModuleNotFoundError`. The Python interpreter is now using the base system Python installation, where Keras is not present. The solution is always to activate the correct virtual environment before executing Python scripts that rely on packages installed within that isolated environment.

**2. User-Specific Installation:**

Packages installed with the `--user` flag via `pip install --user keras` are installed at a user-specific location in the operating system's file structure (typically within the user's home directory under `~/.local/lib/python3.x/site-packages`). This is usually added to the system-wide `PYTHONPATH` at the time of the install, but might not be persistent across reboots under specific operating system configurations. Especially if the path configurations for user-level installations are transient, a restart can cause the Python interpreter to lose the location of those user-installed packages.  A common symptom is the error reappearing after a period of success. The solution is to manually check the `PYTHONPATH` after each restart to ensure the user-specific location for Python modules remains on the path. Often this is resolved by adding this location permanently to system environment configuration files for the specific OS.

**3. Python Interpreter Path Issues:**

Sometimes the active interpreter differs from what you might expect. If a particular Python distribution (such as Anaconda) uses a custom installation structure, the interpreter might be calling a different Python executable after a reboot than the one used when Keras was originally installed.  For example, if the PATH variable was modified within a terminal session to point to a specific Python executable and was not made permanent, this path might not persist after a restart, resulting in the default system Python interpreter being used. Therefore, it is critical to verify the active interpreter using `import sys; print(sys.executable)` both before and after a system reboot. This can pinpoint the Python interpreter causing the module loading issue. The fix might involve adjusting how paths are configured in your shell configuration files or the operating system environment settings to ensure the desired interpreter is being used every time.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Virtual Environment Activation**

```python
# This example simulates the activation of a virtual environment and a successful Keras import.

# Assume the virtual environment 'my_env' exists
# First, ensure 'my_env' is activated (This is a shell command):
# source my_env/bin/activate  (Linux/macOS) or my_env\Scripts\activate (Windows)

import sys
import keras  # This should succeed after activation

print(f"Python executable: {sys.executable}")
print("Keras imported successfully.")

# Then deactivate the virtual environment (shell command):
# deactivate
```

**Commentary:** This demonstrates the crucial step of virtual environment activation. The import succeeds *only* when the environment is activated, which modifies the interpreter’s path and loadable modules. If you were to execute the `import keras` lines without the environment being active, you would see the `ModuleNotFoundError`.

**Example 2: User-Level Package Location Verification**

```python
# This example verifies that the user-installed package location is on the PYTHONPATH.
import sys
import os

# Assume Keras was installed using pip install --user keras
# Check if user site-packages location is in sys.path
user_site_packages = os.path.expanduser("~/.local/lib/python3.x/site-packages") # Replace 3.x with Python version
if user_site_packages in sys.path:
    print(f"User site-packages located at: {user_site_packages} is in the python path.")
else:
    print(f"User site-packages located at: {user_site_packages} is NOT in the python path.")
    # Add site-packages to PYTHONPATH if missing (can be done in the shell):
    # export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:{user_site_packages}" or modify environment settings

try:
    import keras
    print("Keras imported successfully after path check")

except ModuleNotFoundError:
     print("Keras still could not be found.")

print(f"Python executable: {sys.executable}")

```

**Commentary:** This code snippet checks if the user-level site-packages directory is on the Python path using `sys.path`. It further attempts an import to verify Keras’s accessibility after potentially adding the missing location. This highlights the potential issue of user-level installs not having their paths correctly set.

**Example 3: Interpreter Path Diagnostic**

```python
# This code snippet prints the active Python interpreter executable's path.
import sys

print(f"The currently active Python interpreter is: {sys.executable}")

# After a restart, you should check if this path is the same as when keras worked.
# You could further diagnose if this executable matches the python executable
# that was used when keras was installed by comparing hashes or version numbers.
```

**Commentary:** This example emphasizes a crucial debugging step: pinpointing the specific Python interpreter responsible for executing the script. Comparing this path across sessions, and potentially to the one originally used to install Keras, is key to revealing path-related conflicts.

**Resource Recommendations:**

1.  **Python’s Official Documentation:** Refer to the official Python documentation for a thorough understanding of modules, packages, and how Python searches for libraries. This document is pivotal for troubleshooting module import issues.
2.  **Operating System Documentation:** Consulting the OS-specific documentation for path environment variables and shell configurations will shed light on how these paths are managed and persisted across system reboots. Understand the files where your OS stores path configurations.
3. **Virtual Environment Tool Documentation:** Whether it’s `venv` or `conda`, consult the documentation of the tool being used to manage virtual environments. This provides a detailed explanation of activation and deactivation workflows and dependency isolation.

In summary, the "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keras'" after a restart arises from the fact that the paths to where Keras is installed are lost during the restart, often due to reliance on temporary environmental changes, issues with user-level installation pathways, or incorrect Python interpreter invocation. Systematically addressing these issues, through virtual environment management, persistent environment configuration, and diligent path verification, is key to preventing this problem. By investigating these components, I have consistently resolved this error across a range of different setups.
