The absence of a container named "localhost" stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how containerization and networking interact. Specifically, `localhost` isn't a container identifier; it’s a hostname traditionally representing the loopback address, typically 127.0.0.1 in IPv4 or ::1 in IPv6. This address allows a machine to communicate with itself, and its role predates container technology significantly.

Containers, in contrast, are isolated processes, often leveraging operating system-level virtualization. They exist within the context of a container runtime like Docker or containerd, which manages their lifecycle and networking. These runtimes assign unique identifiers to containers, distinct from system hostnames. When you try to interact with a container by its hostname, the runtime uses its internal network configurations and DNS resolution to manage the connection, not by the actual hostname of a particular container.

To elaborate further, consider that in the world of containers, ‘localhost’ within a container specifically addresses the loopback interface *within that container*, not the host machine or other containers. Each container effectively has its own internal `localhost`. This encapsulation is a core principle of containerization, preventing processes within one container from easily interfering with another.

The reason why `docker run --name localhost` will fail is because the identifier "localhost" is not valid as a container name, as the name must adhere to particular rules. If a container named localhost were to exist and attempt to bind to ports using localhost, it would clash with the system’s networking configurations. This conflict highlights the necessary distinction between container identifiers and system hostnames.

Let’s explore this with practical examples. Imagine I am working with a small web application structured in Docker containers. In this scenario, I'll be using Docker, and I have the command-line experience to use it proficiently.

**Example 1: Basic Container Communication**

Suppose I have two containers, one running an API server named `api-server` and another running a front-end application named `web-app`. In this case, I need both to communicate, but they need not be localhost. Instead, I use custom networks.

```bash
# Start the api-server container
docker run -d --name api-server -p 8080:8080 api-server-image

# Start the web-app container, linking it to the api-server
docker run -d --name web-app --link api-server:api-server -p 3000:3000 web-app-image
```

Here, `api-server` is running and listening on port 8080 within its own network namespace. The `web-app` container, configured with `--link api-server:api-server`, can make requests to the api server on port 8080 using `api-server` as the hostname. In the case that the api-server and web-app are on the same custom network, this link can be replaced with the name of the other container. In this example, I'm showing the link for clarity. It's crucial to note that `api-server` here is not `localhost`. It is an alias provided by Docker's container linking. The `web-app` container does *not* connect to the host machine or the host machine’s `localhost`.

**Example 2: Internal Container `localhost`**

Consider a container that exposes a service on port 8080. Within the container itself, that service might be accessed via `localhost:8080`. Let's illustrate this using a simple application.

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for a simple server
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY server.py .
CMD ["python", "server.py"]
```

```python
# server.py (Python server code)
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello from internal localhost!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080) # Bind to all interfaces within container
```

Here the server is set to listen on 0.0.0.0, allowing incoming requests from anywhere on the container network. If I build and run this image:

```bash
docker build -t my-server .
docker run -p 8081:8080 my-server
```

Then, from outside the container, accessing `localhost:8081` (on the host machine) would route to port 8080 inside the container because of the `-p` port mapping. But, if you exec into the container, accessing `localhost:8080` *from within the container* will return the response from the application, demonstrating that `localhost` here references the container's internal networking space. Importantly, accessing `localhost:8080` from outside the container itself would *not* access the application directly. It requires the port mapping from the `docker run` command to expose the container's internal service to the host.

**Example 3: Container Networks**

The more sophisticated approach to interconnect containers and isolate them is using container networks. This allows for DNS resolution among containers without linking. Here’s an adjusted approach of the same setup with a bridge network.

```bash
# Create a custom network
docker network create my-network

# Run the api-server on the custom network
docker run -d --name api-server --network my-network api-server-image

# Run the web-app on the custom network
docker run -d --name web-app --network my-network -p 3000:3000 web-app-image
```

Now, both containers are on the same isolated network, ‘my-network’. If the `web-app` is configured to communicate to a specific hostname within the network, it could resolve ‘api-server’ within the network to find its network address. No links are needed, and each container has its separate networking space. The outside world does not see the internal networking.

In this example, the `api-server` container is not accessed by `localhost` or the port that it exposes, except for through the container's internal networking; it is accessed via its container name within the network (in this case 'api-server'). The internal use of `localhost` within a container remains isolated to the container.

In summary, `localhost` does not exist as a container name, nor does it resolve to an individual container. `localhost` primarily represents the loopback interface within either the host or, importantly, within the individual containers themselves. Proper networking and naming conventions within the containerization environment are essential for establishing communication between different containers.

For further information on this topic, consult documentation on Docker networking and container networking basics. The official Docker documentation is an invaluable resource. Additionally, online tutorials and books on containerization concepts will provide more depth. Further reading on overlay networks and DNS within Docker will further broaden your understanding of these technologies. Specifically, look into topics such as Docker’s bridge network, custom networks, and DNS resolution within container environments. A deeper knowledge of these areas will provide a better view on this common issue.
