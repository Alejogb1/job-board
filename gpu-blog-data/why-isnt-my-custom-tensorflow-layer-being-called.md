The most common reason a custom TensorFlow layer isn't called during model execution stems from incorrect integration within the model's architecture, frequently manifested as a disconnect between the layer's expected input shape and the actual output shape of the preceding layer.  I've encountered this numerous times during my work on large-scale image recognition projects, often tracing the issue to subtle discrepancies in data type or dimension mismatches.  This response will elaborate on this core issue and present practical solutions.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's eager execution and graph execution modes both necessitate adherence to specific input/output tensor specifications for custom layers.  A custom layer, inheriting from `tf.keras.layers.Layer`, defines its forward pass through the `call` method. This method accepts input tensors and should return the transformed tensors.  The problem arises when the dimensions or data types of the input tensor don't match the layer's internal computations or expectations.  Furthermore, incorrect handling of batch size within the `call` method can also lead to unexpected behavior.  This frequently manifests as the `call` method never being invoked, seemingly bypassing the custom layer entirely, when in reality the layer is simply incompatible with the preceding layer's output.

Another critical aspect is ensuring correct layer instantiation within the model's architecture.  If the custom layer is not properly added to the model's `layers` attribute (either directly or indirectly through sequential or functional APIs), it will not be included in the computational graph.  This results in the layer seemingly not being called, despite being correctly defined.  Finally, improper handling of the `build` method, responsible for creating the layer's weights and biases, can also cause silent failures, especially when dealing with dynamic input shapes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Input Shape Handling**

This example demonstrates a common error where the custom layer's `call` method doesn't explicitly handle the batch dimension, leading to shape mismatches:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        super(MyLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        # INCORRECT: Assumes a single sample as input.  Missing batch dimension handling.
        x = tf.reshape(inputs, [-1, 10]) #incorrect assumption about input shape
        return self.dense(x)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)), # Example input shape
    MyLayer()
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# This will likely fail due to shape mismatch. The error will only surface during model training or prediction
# because the layer's call method will not correctly process the input data including the batch dimension
```

**Corrected Version:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        super(MyLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        # CORRECT: Preserves the batch dimension.
        return self.dense(inputs)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    MyLayer()
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# This version correctly handles the batch dimension and should execute without shape mismatch errors.
```

**Example 2: Missing `build` Method Implementation**

This demonstrates a scenario where a missing or incorrectly implemented `build` method prevents weight initialization, leading to the `call` method not being executed effectively.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Attempting to use weights before they are created in build method
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    MyLayer(units=5)
])
# The model will not be able to execute properly and might throw errors during the training process.

```

**Corrected Version:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      trainable=True)
        super().build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    MyLayer(units=5)
])

# The model now correctly initializes weights, and the call method executes as expected.
```


**Example 3:  Incorrect Layer Placement in Functional API**

This example shows how incorrectly adding a custom layer to a functional model can prevent its execution.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)


input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,))
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5)(input_layer)
# INCORRECT: MyLayer is not connected to the graph
my_layer = MyLayer() # Instance created but not connected to the graph


output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)

#The model will not include MyLayer in the execution graph.

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
```


**Corrected Version:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)


input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,))
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5)(input_layer)
# CORRECT: MyLayer is now integrated into the model's graph
x = MyLayer()(x) # Correctly integrated into the flow
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

# Now MyLayer is part of the computational graph and will be called during model execution.
```

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on custom layers and the Keras API, are invaluable.  A strong understanding of linear algebra and tensor manipulations is essential.  Explore resources covering the intricacies of tensor shapes and broadcasting.  Finally, mastering TensorFlow's debugging tools, including the eager execution mode for easier debugging, is crucial for effective troubleshooting.  Thoroughly examine error messages, as they often pinpoint the source of the problem within the custom layer's execution context.
