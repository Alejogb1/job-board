Network combination via conditional logic hinges on the fundamental principle of routing decisions based on data attributes.  My experience with large-scale network integration projects across various telecommunications infrastructures has consistently highlighted the crucial role of policy-based routing in achieving this.  Simply put, you don't merely merge networks; you intelligently direct traffic based on predefined conditions, ensuring optimal performance and security.  This necessitates a clear understanding of network protocols, routing algorithms, and, of course, the conditional logic itself.


The core of the solution lies in implementing conditional logic within the routing infrastructure of the networks you intend to combine. This could involve several approaches depending on the existing network topology and the desired level of control.  The simplest approach is employing packet filtering at the network edge, while more sophisticated solutions involve manipulating routing tables dynamically based on criteria extracted from the data packets themselves.


**1. Explanation:**

The process typically involves identifying relevant packet attributes (source IP, destination IP, port numbers, protocol type, etc.) as criteria for conditional routing decisions.  These criteria are then used to formulate a set of rules within the network's routing infrastructure. This could be achieved using firewalls, routers equipped with advanced Quality of Service (QoS) features, or even software-defined networking (SDN) controllers.  The rules dictate which network path a packet will take based on whether it matches the specified criteria.


For instance, consider combining two enterprise networks: Network A (internal, 192.168.1.0/24) and Network B (guest, 10.0.0.0/24).  You might want all traffic originating from Network A destined for the internet to traverse a specific gateway offering enhanced security features, while Network B traffic uses a different gateway with less stringent security measures.  This requires rules defining the source network and destination network as conditions, directing traffic accordingly.


Similarly, you can employ conditional logic to prioritize certain traffic types.  Voice over IP (VoIP) traffic, for example, often requires lower latency than general data transfer.  Conditional routing can prioritize VoIP packets by assigning them higher quality of service marks, ensuring they are preferentially handled by network devices. This prioritization is based on the protocol type (UDP for VoIP) as the condition for preferential treatment.



**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples showcase conditional routing logic using different approaches.  Note that the exact syntax and functionality depend heavily on the specific devices and technologies employed.


**Example 1:  Firewall Rules (iptables)**

This example demonstrates setting up iptables rules on a Linux-based firewall to route traffic based on source IP address.


```bash
# Allow all traffic from Network A (192.168.1.0/24) to the internet (0.0.0.0/0) via gateway 192.168.1.1
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.1.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

# Allow all traffic from Network B (10.0.0.0/24) to the internet (0.0.0.0/0) via gateway 10.0.0.1
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE

# Drop all traffic from Network A destined for Network B
iptables -A FORWARD -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 10.0.0.0/24 -j DROP

#Drop all traffic from Network B destined for Network A
iptables -A FORWARD -s 10.0.0.0/24 -d 192.168.1.0/24 -j DROP

#Save the rules
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

This script uses iptables to define network address translation (NAT) for each network and prevents direct communication between them.  `eth0` and `eth1` represent the interfaces connected to Network A and Network B respectively.  This demonstrates a simple conditional routing based on source IP address.  More complex conditions can be added using additional `iptables` commands.


**Example 2:  Cisco IOS configuration**

This example utilizes Cisco IOS commands to implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) and route traffic based on port numbers.


```cisco
! Define an ACL to allow only HTTP traffic (port 80) from Network A
access-list 100 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 host 172.16.0.1 eq 80

! Define an ACL to allow all traffic from Network B
access-list 101 permit ip 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255 any

! Apply the ACLs to an interface
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip access-group 100 in
 ip access-group 101 in

! Route traffic based on the ACLs
route-map RM-HTTP permit 10
match ip address 100
set ip next-hop 192.168.1.1

route-map RM-ALL permit 20
match ip address 101
set ip next-hop 10.0.0.1

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 GigabitEthernet0/0
```


This configuration allows only HTTP traffic from Network A to pass through while allowing all traffic from Network B.  It leverages Access Control Lists (ACLs) to filter traffic and route-maps to steer the filtered traffic to designated next hops.  This illustrates conditional routing based on both source network and port number.


**Example 3: SDN Controller (OpenFlow)**

In a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environment, the conditional logic is implemented within the controller.  This example illustrates a simplified representation using a hypothetical SDN controller API.


```python
# Assume a controller API with methods to add flow entries
# add_flow(datapath, match, actions)

# Match for traffic from Network A to the internet
match_a = {'in_port': 1, 'eth_src': '192.168.1.0/24', 'ipv4_dst': '0.0.0.0/0'}
actions_a = {'output': 2}  # Output port connected to gateway for Network A

# Match for traffic from Network B to the internet
match_b = {'in_port': 3, 'eth_src': '10.0.0.0/24', 'ipv4_dst': '0.0.0.0/0'}
actions_b = {'output': 4}  # Output port connected to gateway for Network B

# Add flow entries to the controller
add_flow(datapath_id, match_a, actions_a)
add_flow(datapath_id, match_b, actions_b)
```

This Python snippet demonstrates how an SDN controller might programmatically add flow entries to switches based on source IP address.  This approach offers greater flexibility and centralized control over the network routing.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, consult advanced networking textbooks focusing on routing protocols (BGP, OSPF), network security (firewall design, ACLs), and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) principles.  Explore vendor-specific documentation for your network equipment, paying close attention to configuration guides for firewall rules, QoS settings, and routing protocols.  Study case studies on large-scale network integration projects to learn best practices and potential pitfalls.  Furthermore, consider pursuing professional certifications in networking and security.
