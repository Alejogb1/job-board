TensorFlow's capacity for sequence prediction rests fundamentally on its ability to model temporal dependencies within data.  My experience working on large-scale time series forecasting projects for a financial institution highlighted the critical role of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants, particularly LSTMs and GRUs, in effectively capturing these dependencies.  This capability allows for accurate predictions of future values in a sequence, given a history of prior values.  The choice of specific architecture and hyperparameter tuning are key factors in achieving optimal performance.

**1.  A Clear Explanation of Sequence Prediction with TensorFlow:**

Sequence prediction tasks involve forecasting future elements in a sequence based on observed past elements.  These sequences can represent various data types, such as time series (stock prices, sensor readings), text (next word prediction), or even audio signals.  TensorFlow's strength lies in its ability to leverage deep learning models, specifically RNNs and their advanced versions, to learn complex patterns and long-range dependencies within these sequences.

Standard feedforward neural networks are not suitable for sequence prediction because they lack the mechanism to maintain information about past inputs.  RNNs, on the other hand, possess a hidden state that is updated at each time step, allowing them to retain information from previous steps. This hidden state acts as a form of memory, enabling the network to learn temporal relationships.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are particularly effective variants of RNNs designed to address the vanishing gradient problem, which often hinders the ability of standard RNNs to learn long-range dependencies.  LSTMs employ sophisticated gating mechanisms to regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell state, enabling them to remember information over extended periods.  GRUs achieve similar results with a simpler architecture, offering a balance between performance and computational efficiency.

The prediction process involves feeding the input sequence to the RNN, one time step at a time.  At each step, the RNN updates its hidden state and produces an output.  For sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks, the final output represents the predicted future sequence.  This prediction can be achieved through various architectures, including many-to-one, many-to-many, and encoder-decoder structures.  The optimal architecture depends largely on the specific problem's nature.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate sequence prediction using LSTMs and GRUs in TensorFlow/Keras.  These examples are simplified for clarity but illustrate the core concepts.

**Example 1: Many-to-One Prediction (Time Series Forecasting)**

This example predicts a single future value based on a sequence of past values.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Generate sample data (replace with your actual data)
timesteps = 10
features = 1
data = np.random.rand(100, timesteps, features)
labels = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Train the model
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=10)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(np.random.rand(1, timesteps, features))
print(predictions)
```

This code defines a simple LSTM model with one LSTM layer and a dense output layer.  The input shape `(timesteps, features)` specifies the length of the input sequence and the number of features at each time step. The model is trained using mean squared error (MSE) loss and the Adam optimizer.  The `predict` method is used to generate predictions for new input sequences.  Note that the data generation is placeholder and needs to be replaced with actual data.

**Example 2: Many-to-Many Prediction (Text Generation)**

This example predicts a sequence of characters based on a preceding sequence.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_sequence_length),
    tf.keras.layers.GRU(64, return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')

# Generate sample data (replace with your actual data)
vocab_size = 100
embedding_dim = 32
max_sequence_length = 20
data = np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(100, max_sequence_length))
labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(np.random.randint(0, vocab_size, size=(100, max_sequence_length)), num_classes=vocab_size)

# Train the model
model.fit(data, labels, epochs=10)

# Make predictions (requires a different approach for sequence generation)
# ... (Code to generate text sequence omitted for brevity)
```

This example uses an embedding layer to convert text into numerical representations.  The GRU layer processes the sequence, and the dense layer produces predictions for each character.  The `return_sequences=True` argument ensures the GRU returns an output for each time step.  `to_categorical` converts labels into one-hot encoding.  Text generation requires a separate process involving iterative prediction and sampling from the probability distribution, which is omitted for brevity.  Data generation is again placeholder.

**Example 3: Encoder-Decoder Architecture (Machine Translation)**

This example uses an encoder-decoder model for sequence-to-sequence prediction, suitable for tasks such as machine translation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Encoder
encoder = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_state=True)
])

# Decoder
decoder = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True, return_state=True),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')
])

# Define the complete model (simplified)
# ... (Code for defining the complete encoder-decoder model omitted for brevity)

# Compile the model
# ...

# Train the model
# ...

# Make predictions (requires a specialized inference procedure)
# ... (Code for inference omitted for brevity)
```

This illustrates a basic encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder processes the input sequence and its final state is passed to the decoder. The decoder generates the output sequence step-by-step, using its previous output and the encoder's state.  Implementation details such as defining the entire model and the inference process are omitted for brevity. Data handling would again require separate, problem-specific code.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, and the official TensorFlow documentation provide comprehensive information on RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and their applications in sequence prediction.  Further research into time series analysis and natural language processing is beneficial for specific applications.  Understanding the mathematical underpinnings of RNNs and backpropagation through time is crucial for advanced work.
