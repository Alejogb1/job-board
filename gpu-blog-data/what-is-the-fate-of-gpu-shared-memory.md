The crucial understanding regarding GPU shared memory behavior between kernel block executions is its complete reset.  Unlike global memory, which persists throughout the kernel's lifetime, shared memory is allocated and initialized per block.  This means that data written to shared memory by one block is not accessible to subsequent blocks.  This characteristic is fundamental to optimizing GPU algorithms and understanding potential performance bottlenecks.  My experience working on large-scale molecular dynamics simulations using CUDA has highlighted this repeatedly; inefficient management of shared memory often leads to significant performance degradation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Shared memory, a fast on-chip memory accessible to threads within a single warp (and thus, a block), operates under a specific lifecycle tied to the execution of each block.  The CUDA programming model explicitly defines this behavior.  When a kernel is launched, the GPU allocates the necessary shared memory for each block independently.  Threads within a block can concurrently read and write to this memory, leading to significant performance gains compared to global memory access. However, this allocation is ephemeral.  Upon the completion of a block's execution, the associated shared memory is deallocated and its contents are lost.  This is not a matter of data corruption or unintended overwriting; it's an inherent design choice.  The next block launched will receive its own, independent allocation of shared memory, initialized to a default value (usually zero). This reset is vital for the correct execution of parallel algorithms. If shared memory persisted between blocks, data races and unpredictable results would be inevitable. The architecture ensures a clean slate for each block, promoting deterministic behavior and simplifying programming.

This mechanism has significant consequences for algorithm design.  Data intended to be shared between blocks must be explicitly communicated through global memory.  While slower than shared memory, global memory offers the persistence needed for inter-block communication. This often necessitates careful consideration of memory access patterns and data organization to balance the speed benefits of shared memory within a block with the necessity of global memory for inter-block communication. The choice to employ shared memory should be informed by a thorough analysis of memory access patterns and the need for data sharing between threads within a block.

**2. Code Examples:**

Let's illustrate this behavior with three CUDA code examples, focusing on how data persists (or doesn't) across block executions:

**Example 1: Demonstrating Shared Memory Reset**

```c++
__global__ void sharedMemoryReset(int *global_data, int size) {
  __shared__ int shared_data[256];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

  if (i < size) {
    shared_data[threadIdx.x] = i; // Write to shared memory
    //Some computations using shared_data...
    if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
      printf("Block %d: shared_data[0] = %d\n", blockIdx.x, shared_data[0]);
    }
  }
  __syncthreads(); //Ensure all threads in the block have written

}

int main() {
  int size = 512;
  int *global_data;
  cudaMalloc((void**)&global_data, size * sizeof(int));
  //Launch the kernel twice
  sharedMemoryReset<<<2, 256>>>(global_data, size);
  sharedMemoryReset<<<2, 256>>>(global_data, size);
  cudaFree(global_data);
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, observe that the `shared_data` array is re-initialized to the default value (likely zero) before each block's execution.  The output will show different values for `shared_data[0]` in each block, demonstrating that the shared memory is reset.

**Example 2: Inter-block Communication via Global Memory**

```c++
__global__ void interBlockCommunication(int *global_data, int size) {
  __shared__ int shared_data[256];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

  if (i < size) {
    if (blockIdx.x == 0) {
      shared_data[threadIdx.x] = i;
      global_data[threadIdx.x] = shared_data[threadIdx.x]; //Copy to global memory
    } else {
      shared_data[threadIdx.x] = global_data[threadIdx.x]; //Read from global memory
    }

  }
  __syncthreads();
}
```

Here, data is explicitly transferred from shared memory to global memory to enable communication between blocks. The second block reads from the global memory, highlighting the necessary mechanism for inter-block information exchange.

**Example 3: Illustrating Inefficient Shared Memory Usage**

```c++
__global__ void inefficientSharedMemory(int *global_data, int size) {
  __shared__ int shared_data[256];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

  if (i < size) {
    shared_data[threadIdx.x] = i; // Write to shared memory
  }

  //Long computation using shared_data...

  if(blockIdx.x == 1 && threadIdx.x ==0){
      // Attempting to access data from previous block.  This will NOT work.
      printf("Incorrect attempt to access data from previous block: %d\n",shared_data[0]);
  }
  __syncthreads();

}
```

This example attempts to access data from a previous block execution, showcasing a common programming error. The comment explicitly points out that this will not provide the expected results because the shared memory is reset between blocks.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA C Programming Guide is essential for a deep understanding of shared memory management and CUDA programming in general.  Furthermore, a solid grasp of parallel computing concepts and algorithms, such as data parallelism, is necessary to effectively utilize shared memory.  Finally, careful examination of profiling tools provided by the CUDA toolkit aids in identifying shared memory-related performance bottlenecks. These resources, used in conjunction with practical experience, offer a robust foundation for mastering this aspect of GPU programming.  Understanding the limitations of shared memory is as crucial as understanding its capabilities.
