Combining multiple PyTorch models, each trained on distinct partitions of a dataset, presents a unique challenge. The core difficulty stems from the potential for each model to learn representations biased towards its specific training subset. Direct averaging of model weights, a common ensembling technique, is often ineffective in this scenario due to the variations in the underlying data distributions each model has encountered. Successfully merging these models requires a strategy that accounts for these data-induced biases and facilitates a cohesive overall prediction. My experience developing distributed machine learning systems for medical imaging has shown me that a careful approach to both model fusion and input normalization is critical for good results.

The key is to view this problem not just as model averaging, but as a type of multi-expert system where each model contributes its specialized knowledge. I've found that a straightforward approach is to concatenate the output vectors from each model before passing them into a final “fusion” layer. This approach is particularly effective when the models have been trained to achieve complementary objectives on the dataset partitions. The crucial element is that the fusion layer can learn to weight each model's output dynamically, based on the input data. This contrasts with static averaging, where each model’s contribution is fixed. By using a trainable fusion mechanism, we provide flexibility for the final prediction stage to adapt to the varying strengths and weaknesses of the component models. This approach also implicitly addresses some of the biases from separate training, as each model can be seen as providing a perspective and the fusion layer can learn which perspective to weigh most heavily.

Here’s how this implementation typically looks in PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class PartitionedModelEnsemble(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, models, input_size, output_size, num_partitions):
        super(PartitionedModelEnsemble, self).__init__()
        self.models = nn.ModuleList(models)  # Store models as a module list
        self.num_partitions = num_partitions
        # Assume each model has the same output size
        self.feature_size = list(models[0].modules())[-1].out_features if isinstance(list(models[0].modules())[-1], nn.Linear) else list(models[0].modules())[-1].out_channels

        # Define the fusion layer (single linear layer here, but could be more complex)
        self.fusion_layer = nn.Linear(self.feature_size * num_partitions, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        outputs = []
        for model in self.models:
            outputs.append(model(x))  # Extract features from each model
        concatenated_features = torch.cat(outputs, dim=1) # Concatenate feature vectors
        final_output = self.fusion_layer(concatenated_features) # Send to the fusion layer
        return final_output

# Example usage:
# Generate dummy models and inputs
input_size = 20
output_size = 10
num_partitions = 3

models = [nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(input_size, 50), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(50, output_size) ) for _ in range(num_partitions)]
ensemble_model = PartitionedModelEnsemble(models, input_size, output_size, num_partitions)
input_data = torch.randn(1, input_size)  # Simulate batch size 1
output = ensemble_model(input_data)
print(output.shape)
```

This first example is a basic implementation, using a linear layer for fusion, which I have found to provide a solid starting point. The models themselves are very basic here.  It showcases a straightforward approach to combining model outputs. The important aspects are: the `nn.ModuleList` which correctly stores our pretrained models, the iterative processing of data through each model, and the feature concatenation. The `torch.cat` function joins the output tensors of each model together along the channel dimension (dim=1), effectively creating a longer vector. This joint vector is then processed by the trainable `fusion_layer` to produce final output. This initial example provides a basis for further extensions, such as adding non-linearities to the fusion layer or incorporating attention mechanisms.

Now, let's consider adding a more sophisticated fusion mechanism using an attention-based approach. This can potentially improve the model's ability to learn context-sensitive combinations of the outputs:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class AttentionFusionEnsemble(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, models, input_size, output_size, num_partitions):
        super(AttentionFusionEnsemble, self).__init__()
        self.models = nn.ModuleList(models)
        self.num_partitions = num_partitions
        self.feature_size = list(models[0].modules())[-1].out_features if isinstance(list(models[0].modules())[-1], nn.Linear) else list(models[0].modules())[-1].out_channels

        # Attention layer
        self.attention_weights = nn.Linear(self.feature_size, 1) # Generate attention scores

        # Fusion layer
        self.fusion_layer = nn.Linear(self.feature_size, output_size)


    def forward(self, x):
        outputs = []
        for model in self.models:
             outputs.append(model(x))

        # Convert to a single tensor for attention
        stacked_outputs = torch.stack(outputs, dim=1) # shape [batch, num_models, feature_size]
        attention_scores = self.attention_weights(stacked_outputs) # Apply attention weights layer shape [batch, num_models, 1]
        attention_weights = F.softmax(attention_scores, dim=1) # Normalize attention weights to sum to 1

        # Apply attention weights
        weighted_outputs = stacked_outputs * attention_weights
        #weighted_outputs.shape = [batch, num_models, feature_size]

        # Sum weighted outputs across models
        fused_features = torch.sum(weighted_outputs, dim=1) #shape [batch, feature_size]
        # Send through fusion layer
        final_output = self.fusion_layer(fused_features)
        return final_output

# Example usage:
# Generate dummy models and inputs
input_size = 20
output_size = 10
num_partitions = 3

models = [nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(input_size, 50), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(50, 15)) for _ in range(num_partitions)]
attention_ensemble_model = AttentionFusionEnsemble(models, input_size, output_size, num_partitions)
input_data = torch.randn(1, input_size)
output = attention_ensemble_model(input_data)
print(output.shape)
```
In this second code example, I have incorporated a trainable attention mechanism which allows the model to focus on the most relevant outputs from each submodel. The attention weights are learned dynamically based on the input data and applied to each feature vector before being fused with simple summation. This mechanism allows the ensemble to adapt to different input characteristics, potentially resulting in superior performance. This provides greater capacity in the fusion to learn which components are important.

Finally, let’s introduce a variant which incorporates an averaging component. The average output of the models can provide a good baseline from which a weighted prediction can be produced.
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F


class AveragingAttentionEnsemble(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, models, input_size, output_size, num_partitions):
        super(AveragingAttentionEnsemble, self).__init__()
        self.models = nn.ModuleList(models)
        self.num_partitions = num_partitions
        self.feature_size = list(models[0].modules())[-1].out_features if isinstance(list(models[0].modules())[-1], nn.Linear) else list(models[0].modules())[-1].out_channels
        # Attention layer
        self.attention_weights = nn.Linear(self.feature_size, 1)

        # Fusion layer
        self.fusion_layer = nn.Linear(self.feature_size * 2, output_size) # 2 * feature size to account for average


    def forward(self, x):
         outputs = []
         for model in self.models:
            outputs.append(model(x))

         stacked_outputs = torch.stack(outputs, dim=1)  # Shape [batch, num_models, feature_size]
         average_output = torch.mean(stacked_outputs, dim=1) # average across the models. Shape [batch, feature_size]


         attention_scores = self.attention_weights(stacked_outputs) # Apply attention weights layer shape [batch, num_models, 1]
         attention_weights = F.softmax(attention_scores, dim=1) # Normalize attention weights to sum to 1

        # Apply attention weights
         weighted_outputs = stacked_outputs * attention_weights  # Shape [batch, num_models, feature_size]
         fused_features = torch.sum(weighted_outputs, dim=1)  # shape [batch, feature_size]

         concatenated_features = torch.cat((fused_features, average_output), dim = 1) # shape [batch, 2 * feature_size]
        # Send through fusion layer
         final_output = self.fusion_layer(concatenated_features)
         return final_output


# Example usage:
# Generate dummy models and inputs
input_size = 20
output_size = 10
num_partitions = 3

models = [nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(input_size, 50), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(50, 15)) for _ in range(num_partitions)]
ensemble_model = AveragingAttentionEnsemble(models, input_size, output_size, num_partitions)
input_data = torch.randn(1, input_size)
output = ensemble_model(input_data)
print(output.shape)
```

This final approach combines the attention mechanism and the averaged outputs. This provides a more robust fusion by incorporating both a static prior (the mean output) and a dynamic weighting mechanism (attention). The final linear layer then has a good basis to operate on. In the real world, I have found this approach can improve results due to the additional stability provided.

When considering resources, I would recommend exploring literature on multi-expert systems, ensemble methods, and attention mechanisms in deep learning. Specifically, study the application of these principles in the context of federated or distributed learning, which often involves training models on segregated datasets. Also examine papers discussing methods for handling heterogeneity in models that might arise from distinct training distributions.
