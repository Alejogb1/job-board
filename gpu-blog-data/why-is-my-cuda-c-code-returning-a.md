The most frequent cause of a zeroed output array Z in CUDA C code stems from improper memory management, specifically concerning the handling of device memory allocation and data transfer between host and device.  Over the years, I've debugged countless instances of this, and while the symptoms are often the same, the root causes vary.  Let's examine the potential sources and demonstrate corrective actions.

**1.  Insufficient Device Memory Allocation:**

The most common oversight is allocating insufficient memory on the device. If the kernel attempts to write beyond the allocated space, behavior is undefined, often manifesting as a zeroed or partially zeroed array.  This is exacerbated when dealing with dynamically sized arrays where the calculation of required memory is incorrect.  Failure to check for CUDA errors after memory allocation exacerbates the problem, masking the root cause.

**Code Example 1: Incorrect Allocation and Error Handling:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int N = 1024 * 1024; // 1 million elements
    float *h_A, *d_A, *h_Z, *d_Z;

    // Incorrect allocation - only allocating space for half the elements
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, sizeof(float) * N / 2);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_Z, sizeof(float) * N);

    h_A = (float*)malloc(sizeof(float) * N);
    h_Z = (float*)malloc(sizeof(float) * N);

    // ... (kernel launch, assuming it tries to write N elements to d_Z) ...

    cudaFree(d_A);
    cudaFree(d_Z);
    free(h_A);
    free(h_Z);

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates a critical error.  `d_A` is allocated with only half the required memory. Although the error might not immediately surface, subsequent operations might overwrite unrelated memory, or potentially leading to segmentation faults. The kernel, oblivious to this limitation, attempts to write beyond the allocated space for `d_A`, leading to undefined behaviour and potentially affecting `d_Z`.  Even if `d_A` allocation was correct, an insufficient allocation for `d_Z` will produce the observed zeroed array.  Crucially, no error checking is performed after `cudaMalloc`.  Adding error checks is paramount.

**Corrected Code Example 1:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int N = 1024 * 1024;
    float *h_A, *d_A, *h_Z, *d_Z;

    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, sizeof(float) * N);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_Z, sizeof(float) * N);

    cudaError_t cudaStatus;
    if ((cudaStatus = cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, sizeof(float) * N)) != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "cudaMalloc failed for d_A: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(cudaStatus));
        return 1;
    }
    if ((cudaStatus = cudaMalloc((void**)&d_Z, sizeof(float) * N)) != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "cudaMalloc failed for d_Z: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(cudaStatus));
        return 1;
    }

    h_A = (float*)malloc(sizeof(float) * N);
    h_Z = (float*)malloc(sizeof(float) * N);

    // ... (kernel launch) ...

    cudaFree(d_A);
    cudaFree(d_Z);
    free(h_A);
    free(h_Z);

    return 0;
}
```

This revised code explicitly checks the return value of `cudaMalloc` and reports errors, making debugging significantly easier.


**2.  Data Transfer Issues:**

Even with correct allocation, transferring data between host and device incorrectly can lead to a zeroed array.  `cudaMemcpy` requires careful specification of source, destination, size, and direction.  Forgetting to copy data from the host to the device before kernel execution is a frequent mistake.


**Code Example 2: Missing Data Transfer:**

```c++
// ... (allocation as in corrected example 1) ...

// Missing cudaMemcpy to transfer h_A to d_A

kernel<<<blocks, threads>>>(d_A, d_Z, N);  // Kernel launch

// ... (rest of the code) ...
```

The kernel operates on `d_A` and `d_Z`, but `d_A` contains garbage since no data was copied from `h_A`.  The kernel might still run without errors, but its results will be unpredictable.  Similarly, forgetting to copy the results back from `d_Z` to `h_Z` will leave `h_Z` unchanged.


**Corrected Code Example 2:**

```c++
// ... (allocation as in corrected example 1) ...

cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A, sizeof(float) * N, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

cudaError_t cudaStatus = cudaGetLastError();
if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaMemcpy (HostToDevice) failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(cudaStatus));
    return 1;
}


kernel<<<blocks, threads>>>(d_A, d_Z, N);

cudaMemcpy(h_Z, d_Z, sizeof(float) * N, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

if ((cudaStatus = cudaGetLastError()) != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaMemcpy (DeviceToHost) failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(cudaStatus));
    return 1;
}

// ... (rest of the code) ...
```

This version includes explicit `cudaMemcpy` calls for data transfer, ensuring the kernel operates on correctly initialized data and the results are copied back to the host.  Crucially, error checking is incorporated for both `cudaMemcpy` calls.


**3.  Kernel Errors:**

Incorrect kernel code is another major source of issues.  A kernel that doesn't modify the output array, or a kernel with memory access errors (out-of-bounds access, race conditions), will produce unexpected results.


**Code Example 3:  Incorrect Kernel Logic:**

```c++
__global__ void myKernel(const float *A, float *Z, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        // Incorrect logic â€“ Z[i] remains unchanged
        // Z[i] = A[i] * 2.0f;  //Correct line
    }
}
```

This kernel contains a (commented-out) correct operation, but currently, it doesn't modify `Z`.  Therefore, `Z` will remain zeroed after kernel execution.


**Corrected Code Example 3:**

```c++
__global__ void myKernel(const float *A, float *Z, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        Z[i] = A[i] * 2.0f;
    }
}
```

This corrected kernel now properly multiplies each element of `A` by 2.0f and stores the result in `Z`.

Thoroughly examining the error codes returned by CUDA functions is also crucial for effective debugging.  Furthermore, using a CUDA profiler can significantly aid in identifying performance bottlenecks and unexpected behavior.  Mastering these will significantly enhance your ability to debug CUDA programs effectively.
