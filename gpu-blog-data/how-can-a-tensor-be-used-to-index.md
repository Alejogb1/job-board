In TensorFlow, a tensor can effectively index another tensor using techniques that leverage TensorFlow's core capabilities for vectorized operations. This is not done with simple Python-style indexing; rather, TensorFlow uses indexing tensors to create sophisticated data selection and manipulation workflows. Having spent considerable time developing large-scale models with TensorFlow, I’ve encountered numerous scenarios where proper tensor indexing is critical for efficient computation and performance.

The core concept is that the indexing tensor contains the indices, along the dimensions of the target tensor, that we wish to extract. When indexing, TensorFlow does not select a single element by index, as a typical Python list might. Instead, it selects *multiple* elements simultaneously, forming a new tensor of selected values. This allows for highly efficient, parallel operations, a key advantage of TensorFlow’s computational graph framework. The shape of the indexing tensor directly influences the shape and arrangement of the selected values in the output tensor.

There are several key considerations to understand this process:

*   **Scalar vs. Multi-Dimensional Indexing:** If the indexing tensor is a scalar (a 0-dimensional tensor), it represents a single index across a specific axis of the target tensor, provided the dimensions are aligned. If the indexing tensor is multi-dimensional, the indices within it map to corresponding axes of the target tensor.
*   **Advanced Indexing:** TensorFlow allows advanced indexing, which goes beyond contiguous ranges or single elements. This includes cases where the indices are arbitrary and not sequential.
*   **`tf.gather` and `tf.gather_nd`:** These are the primary TensorFlow operations used to implement the described indexing behavior. `tf.gather` typically selects values along a single dimension of a target tensor, while `tf.gather_nd` is designed for selecting values from multiple dimensions.
*   **Broadcasting Rules:** The shapes of the indexing tensor and the target tensor need to be compatible for selection. In some cases, broadcasting rules may apply implicitly to align the dimensions, provided that the non-selected dimensions have matching or 1-sized dimensions.
*   **Axis Selection:** When using `tf.gather`, the user must explicitly specify which axis they are selecting from. The shape of the index tensor and output changes based on the axis selected.

Let's illustrate with some practical examples:

**Example 1: Simple Indexing along a Single Axis**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Target tensor
target_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Indexing tensor, select indices 0 and 2 along axis 0
index_tensor = tf.constant([0, 2])

# Using tf.gather to select along axis 0
result_tensor = tf.gather(target_tensor, index_tensor, axis=0)

print("Target Tensor:\n", target_tensor.numpy())
print("Index Tensor:\n", index_tensor.numpy())
print("Result Tensor:\n", result_tensor.numpy())

# Output:
# Target Tensor:
#  [[1 2 3]
#  [4 5 6]
#  [7 8 9]]
# Index Tensor:
#  [0 2]
# Result Tensor:
#  [[1 2 3]
#  [7 8 9]]
```

In this example, `tf.gather` selects rows 0 and 2 from the target tensor along `axis=0`, the first dimension. The resulting tensor contains the corresponding rows. The shape of the index tensor, which was `(2,)`, dictates that two rows are extracted.

**Example 2: Indexing with a Multi-Dimensional Index Tensor (Using `tf.gather_nd`)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Target Tensor
target_tensor = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]) #Shape (2,2,2)

# Multi-dimensional indexing tensor.
index_tensor = tf.constant([[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]])

# Using tf.gather_nd for complex indexing
result_tensor = tf.gather_nd(target_tensor, index_tensor)

print("Target Tensor:\n", target_tensor.numpy())
print("Index Tensor:\n", index_tensor.numpy())
print("Result Tensor:\n", result_tensor.numpy())

# Output:
# Target Tensor:
#  [[[1 2]
#  [3 4]]
#
# [[5 6]
#  [7 8]]]
# Index Tensor:
#  [[0 0 0]
#  [1 1 1]
#  [0 1 0]]
# Result Tensor:
#  [1 8 3]
```

Here, `tf.gather_nd` is employed to select elements at specific locations defined by the multi-dimensional `index_tensor`. Each row of the `index_tensor` specifies a coordinate in `target_tensor`. For instance, `[0,0,0]` retrieves element at `target_tensor[0,0,0]` which has a value of 1. The `[1,1,1]` index selects `target_tensor[1,1,1]` , which has a value of 8. Finally, `[0,1,0]` selects `target_tensor[0,1,0]` with a value of 3. The output tensor has a shape matching the number of index combinations within the `index_tensor`, which was (3,), in this case.

**Example 3: Advanced Indexing with a Higher Rank Index Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Target tensor with shape (3, 4, 5)
target_tensor = tf.reshape(tf.range(60), (3, 4, 5))

# Complex, high rank index tensor. The leading dimension (2) controls how many sets of index selections are made. 
index_tensor = tf.constant([[[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3]], [[2, 3, 0], [0, 0, 4]]]) # Shape (2,2,3)
#Note that each triplet inside of index tensor can select one element from the target tensor

# Applying tf.gather_nd for advanced selections
result_tensor = tf.gather_nd(target_tensor, index_tensor)


print("Target Tensor:\n", target_tensor.numpy())
print("Index Tensor:\n", index_tensor.numpy())
print("Result Tensor:\n", result_tensor.numpy())


# Output:
#Target Tensor:
#  [[[ 0  1  2  3  4]
#  [ 5  6  7  8  9]
#  [10 11 12 13 14]
#  [15 16 17 18 19]]
#
# [[20 21 22 23 24]
#  [25 26 27 28 29]
#  [30 31 32 33 34]
#  [35 36 37 38 39]]
#
# [[40 41 42 43 44]
#  [45 46 47 48 49]
#  [50 51 52 53 54]
#  [55 56 57 58 59]]]
#Index Tensor:
#  [[[0 1 2]
#  [1 2 3]]
#
# [[2 3 0]
#  [0 0 4]]]
#Result Tensor:
#  [[ 7 28]
#  [50  4]]
```

In this advanced scenario, the `index_tensor` now has a shape of `(2, 2, 3)`. The `tf.gather_nd` operation uses the triplets in `index_tensor` to index `target_tensor`. For instance, `[0,1,2]` in the index tensor selects the element at `target_tensor[0, 1, 2]`, which has a value of `7`,  while `[1,2,3]` selects the element at `target_tensor[1,2,3]`, which has a value of 28. Likewise, for second group of triplets in `index_tensor`. Finally, the `result_tensor` takes a shape of `(2,2)` which matches the shape of the first two axes of `index_tensor`.

These examples demonstrate different methods of using tensors to index other tensors. The shape of the index tensor and the use of `tf.gather` or `tf.gather_nd` determine the structure of the resulting output. Through using `tf.gather` and `tf.gather_nd`, highly flexible data selection patterns can be implemented efficiently within a TensorFlow computation graph.

For further exploration, I highly recommend consulting TensorFlow’s official API documentation for `tf.gather` and `tf.gather_nd`. The online TensorFlow tutorials also include comprehensive guides on various aspects of tensor manipulation, particularly those relating to advanced indexing. Moreover, the TensorFlow book, particularly the chapters dealing with tensor operations and data manipulation, provide in depth explanations and practical insights.
