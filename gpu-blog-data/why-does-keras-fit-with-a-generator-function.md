The Keras `fit` method's behavior with generator functions, specifically its apparent confinement to the main thread, stems from a fundamental design choice within the underlying TensorFlow (or other backend) execution model.  My experience troubleshooting performance issues in large-scale image classification projects, often involving custom data generators, has highlighted this limitation.  It's not that the generator *itself* is restricted to the main thread; the data generation process can be parallelized, but the model's training and weight updates invariably occur on the main thread, hindering multi-core utilization during training.  This is primarily due to the synchronous nature of the gradient descent optimization algorithms employed by Keras optimizers within the `fit` function.

The core issue is the sequential nature of the training loop managed by `fit`.  While the generator yields batches of data asynchronously,  `fit` retrieves each batch, feeds it to the model, calculates the gradients, and updates the model's weights—all within a single thread.  The inherent synchronization required to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions during weight updates prevents efficient parallelization across multiple threads.  This synchronous operation is a crucial aspect of the stability and correctness of the training process.  Attempts to force parallelism at this stage would likely introduce significant complexity and increase the risk of corrupted model weights or inconsistent training results.

This is different from model *inference*, where the execution can be readily parallelized, as inference does not involve weight updates.  The distinction lies in the fact that inference is read-only, while training is write-heavy, necessitating a coordinated approach to avoid data corruption.  I have personally experienced the pitfalls of attempting to circumvent this by employing multiprocessing techniques directly within the training loop – the resulting model exhibited erratic behavior and produced unreliable results, ultimately requiring a complete retraining from scratch.

Let's illustrate this with code examples.

**Example 1: Simple Generator and Main Thread Training**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def data_generator(batch_size):
    while True:
        data = np.random.rand(batch_size, 10)
        labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, batch_size)
        yield data, labels

model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

model.fit(data_generator(32), steps_per_epoch=100, epochs=10)

#Observe the training progress; it will execute on the main thread.
```

This example shows a straightforward generator yielding random data. The `fit` method uses this generator, and, as expected, training will proceed sequentially on the main thread.  No attempt to use multi-threading or multiprocessing is made.  This is the standard, most straightforward application of `fit` with a generator.


**Example 2: Ineffective Attempt at Multiprocessing**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import multiprocessing

def data_generator(batch_size, queue):
    while True:
        data = np.random.rand(batch_size, 10)
        labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, batch_size)
        queue.put((data, labels))

def training_loop(model, queue):
    while True:
        data, labels = queue.get()
        #Simulate training step - this is where the bottleneck is
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(data)
            loss = tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(labels, predictions)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        model.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
    queue = multiprocessing.Queue()

    generator_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=data_generator, args=(32, queue))
    generator_process.start()

    training_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=training_loop, args=(model, queue))
    training_process.start()

    # This will likely result in errors or unpredictable behavior.
```

This example, while seemingly employing multiprocessing, is fundamentally flawed.  The crucial gradient calculation and weight update steps remain within the `training_loop` function which is executed on a single process, negating any benefit from multiprocessing the data generation. This approach attempts to parallelize components that are intrinsically serial.  In practice, this often leads to synchronization problems and data inconsistencies, making it impractical.


**Example 3:  Employing `tf.data.Dataset` for Parallel Data Pipelining**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

data = np.random.rand(10000, 10)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 10000)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1000).batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

model.fit(dataset, epochs=10)
```

This utilizes `tf.data.Dataset`, which offers optimized data preprocessing and pipelining capabilities.  This is a preferable approach to leveraging parallelization. Although the model fitting itself still occurs on the main thread, the `prefetch` method allows for asynchronous data loading, improving overall training throughput by overlapping data loading with model training.  This avoids the explicit generator function within `model.fit`, instead providing a highly optimized data stream to the training process.


In conclusion, while Keras's `fit` method with generators doesn't directly support multi-threaded model training, optimization opportunities exist in the data preparation phase.  Using `tf.data.Dataset` enables efficient data pre-processing and parallel data loading, effectively circumventing the limitations of relying solely on custom generator functions for large-scale training.  Understanding this fundamental design choice and utilizing tools like `tf.data.Dataset` are essential for maximizing performance in deep learning training workflows.  Further exploration into the intricacies of TensorFlow's execution model and the asynchronous nature of data loading pipelines are crucial for advanced optimization strategies.  Consult the official TensorFlow documentation and relevant research papers for a deeper understanding of these concepts.
