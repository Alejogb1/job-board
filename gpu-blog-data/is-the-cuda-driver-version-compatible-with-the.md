The critical factor determining CUDA driver and runtime compatibility lies not in a simple version-to-version match, but rather in the driver's support for the runtime's capabilities.  My experience debugging numerous high-performance computing applications across various NVIDIA hardware generations has consistently shown that while a matching version number is ideal, backward compatibility plays a crucial role, albeit with limitations.  A newer driver will generally support older runtimes, but the reverse is not guaranteed.

This compatibility is fundamentally driven by the driver's responsibility for managing low-level hardware access and resource allocation, while the runtime provides the higher-level programming interface for CUDA applications.  The runtime relies on the driver to translate its requests into instructions the GPU can execute. If the driver lacks the necessary functionality to handle a specific runtime function, the application will fail.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

The CUDA driver manages the GPU hardware directly, handling tasks such as memory allocation, kernel launch, and error handling. The CUDA runtime is an abstraction layer built upon the driver, providing a higher-level API for developers to interact with the GPU.  Crucially, the runtime relies on the driver’s underlying support for features it exposes.  Therefore, a minimal requirement is that the driver must support all functionalities used by the runtime.

Consider a simplified analogy: Imagine the driver as the operating system of the GPU, while the runtime is a specific application.  You can run an older application (runtime) on a newer OS (driver) – provided that the OS includes all the system calls the application needs.  Running a new application on an old OS, however, will likely lead to failure.

In practice, NVIDIA releases driver updates frequently, incorporating bug fixes, performance improvements, and support for new hardware features. These updates often introduce compatibility with newer runtime versions.  Conversely, a newer runtime version might introduce features or functionalities not available in older drivers, resulting in errors or crashes.  The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation explicitly addresses this, though version-specific compatibility matrices are essential for precise guidance.

The critical point of failure often involves CUDA capabilities—features like certain compute capabilities, texture filtering modes, or memory management techniques introduced in newer driver versions.  If a runtime attempts to utilize a capability unsupported by the driver, the application will likely encounter errors, ranging from subtle performance degradation to outright crashes.  Furthermore, silently failing operations might yield incorrect results, making debugging significantly more complex.


2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples demonstrate potential scenarios illustrating runtime-driver compatibility issues.  Error handling is intentionally simplified for clarity.  Real-world applications demand more robust error checks.

**Example 1: Successful execution (compatible versions):**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        printf("No CUDA devices found.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    int device;
    cudaGetDevice(&device); //Obtaining the default device, checking for compatibility here is implicit by the CUDA API call success

    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device);
    printf("Device Name: %s\n", prop.name);

    //Further CUDA operations here; successful execution indicates compatibility.
    // Note:  Implied compatibility check through successful calls to CUDA runtime API.
    return 0;
}
```

This example leverages the CUDA runtime API.  Successful execution implies compatibility between the driver and runtime versions at a basic level, as the necessary driver functionality is available for the runtime to execute fundamental tasks.   However, this doesn't fully guarantee compatibility for advanced features.

**Example 2: Failure due to incompatible runtime and driver (hypothetical):**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data) {
    //Uses a new feature introduced in CUDA 12 runtime, unsupported by the older driver.
    // Simulates a feature only available in newer versions.
    atomicAdd(&data[0], 128); // Hypothetically using a new atomic operation
}

int main() {
    int *h_data, *d_data;
    int size = 1;
    h_data = (int*)malloc(size * sizeof(int));
    h_data[0] = 0;

    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, size * sizeof(int));
    cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    myKernel<<<1,1>>>(d_data);

    cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    printf("Result: %d\n", h_data[0]);

    free(h_data);
    cudaFree(d_data);
    return 0;
}
```

This example, in a simplified form, illustrates a scenario where the kernel utilizes a capability not present in the driver.  In a real-world situation, this would manifest as a runtime error (likely a CUDA error code) indicating driver incompatibility.  The specific error code is crucial in diagnosing this issue.

**Example 3:  Partial compatibility (older runtime, newer driver):**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void simpleAdd(int *a, int *b, int *c) {
    int i = threadIdx.x;
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation and data transfer similar to example 2) ...

  simpleAdd<<<1, 1>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c); //Basic kernel, likely to work across versions
  // ... (Data transfer back to host and cleanup) ...

  return 0;
}
```

This shows a basic kernel that is likely to be compatible across a broader range of driver and runtime versions because it employs simple, fundamental CUDA capabilities.  However,  even here, a driver lacking support for the specific GPU architecture could lead to failures.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation, specifically the sections detailing driver and runtime compatibility, are invaluable.  Consult the release notes for each CUDA toolkit version; they usually detail compatibility information.  NVIDIA's official forums provide a platform to find solutions to specific compatibility issues based on shared experiences.  Finally, leveraging NVIDIA's profiler tools and debuggers helps in identifying the root causes of issues stemming from driver/runtime incompatibility.
