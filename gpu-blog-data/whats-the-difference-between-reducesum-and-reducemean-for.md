The core distinction between `reduce_sum` and `reduce_mean` when applied within the context of Total Variation (TV) loss in TensorFlow lies in how the aggregate magnitude of pixel differences is measured, influencing the scale of the resulting loss. My experience implementing custom image denoising and super-resolution networks has underscored this difference and its impact on training dynamics. Specifically, `reduce_sum` calculates the sum of all pixel difference magnitudes, while `reduce_mean` calculates their average. This seemingly minor change has a significant effect on loss magnitude, requiring careful consideration of learning rate scaling.

Let's first clarify the total variation loss itself. TV loss, often used as a regularization term in image processing tasks, aims to minimize the amount of variation in pixel values across an image. This typically translates into smoothing out noise and promoting a piecewise smooth solution. It's calculated by summing the absolute differences between adjacent pixels, both horizontally and vertically. More precisely, given an image *I*, with height *H* and width *W*, the TV loss can be expressed as:

TV(I) =  Σ<sub>i=0</sub><sup>H-1</sup> Σ<sub>j=0</sub><sup>W-2</sup> |I<sub>i,j+1</sub> - I<sub>i,j</sub>|  +  Σ<sub>i=0</sub><sup>H-2</sup> Σ<sub>j=0</sub><sup>W-1</sup> |I<sub>i+1,j</sub> - I<sub>i,j</sub>|

Now, when we implement this in TensorFlow, the `reduce_sum` and `reduce_mean` operations are used to collapse the resulting tensor of pixel differences into a single scalar loss value. Using `reduce_sum`, we obtain a TV loss that is the sum of all these absolute differences. Consequently, the loss value becomes highly dependent on the size of the input image. For larger images, the sum of differences is larger, directly resulting in a larger loss value, even if the actual "smoothness" of the image is comparable to a smaller image. Conversely, using `reduce_mean`, we obtain the *average* pixel difference. The magnitude of this average is less sensitive to image size because it normalizes by the total number of pixel comparisons being made, which is (H-1)*W for horizontal differences and H*(W-1) for vertical.

This difference is critical during optimization. If using `reduce_sum`, I've noticed that the overall loss magnitude can quickly become very large, especially with larger image batch sizes, thus potentially requiring much smaller learning rates to prevent instability. If using `reduce_mean`, the loss is relatively normalized, exhibiting a scale more consistent with pixel magnitudes, which I've found allows for a broader range of stable learning rates and is less sensitive to image size.

Here are three code examples illustrating the difference in practice. Note that these are simplified examples and lack the sophistication needed for robust applications, but they highlight the key aspects:

**Example 1: `reduce_sum` implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def tv_loss_sum(image):
    horizontal_diff = tf.abs(image[:, :, 1:] - image[:, :, :-1])
    vertical_diff = tf.abs(image[:, 1:, :] - image[:, :-1, :])

    return tf.reduce_sum(horizontal_diff) + tf.reduce_sum(vertical_diff)

# Example usage:
image_batch = tf.random.normal((2, 64, 64, 3))  # Batch of 2 64x64 images
loss_sum_val = tv_loss_sum(image_batch)
print(f"TV Loss (reduce_sum): {loss_sum_val.numpy()}")
```

In this first example, I use `reduce_sum` to aggregate the absolute differences in both horizontal and vertical directions. The resulting `loss_sum_val` will reflect the *total sum* of these differences across all images in the batch and all color channels. If the image dimensions increase, this value will grow proportionally.

**Example 2: `reduce_mean` implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def tv_loss_mean(image):
    horizontal_diff = tf.abs(image[:, :, 1:] - image[:, :, :-1])
    vertical_diff = tf.abs(image[:, 1:, :] - image[:, :-1, :])

    return tf.reduce_mean(horizontal_diff) + tf.reduce_mean(vertical_diff)


# Example usage:
image_batch = tf.random.normal((2, 64, 64, 3))  # Batch of 2 64x64 images
loss_mean_val = tv_loss_mean(image_batch)
print(f"TV Loss (reduce_mean): {loss_mean_val.numpy()}")
```

Here, `reduce_mean` replaces `reduce_sum`. Consequently, `loss_mean_val` now represents the *average* absolute difference, not the total. As a consequence, it is much smaller in magnitude and less susceptible to the dimensions and batch size increases. The units of this loss become more interpretable in the sense of average pixel change, instead of aggregate sums.

**Example 3: Batch-wise `reduce_sum` and `reduce_mean` comparison**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def tv_loss_batch(image, use_mean=False):
  horizontal_diff = tf.abs(image[:, :, 1:] - image[:, :, :-1])
  vertical_diff = tf.abs(image[:, 1:, :] - image[:, :-1, :])

  batch_size = tf.cast(tf.shape(image)[0], tf.float32)

  if use_mean:
     return (tf.reduce_sum(horizontal_diff) / batch_size) + (tf.reduce_sum(vertical_diff) / batch_size)
  else:
     return tf.reduce_sum(horizontal_diff) + tf.reduce_sum(vertical_diff)

# Example usage:
batch_size = 5
image_batch_small = tf.random.normal((batch_size, 32, 32, 3))
image_batch_large = tf.random.normal((batch_size, 128, 128, 3))


loss_sum_small = tv_loss_batch(image_batch_small)
loss_mean_small = tv_loss_batch(image_batch_small, use_mean=True)

loss_sum_large = tv_loss_batch(image_batch_large)
loss_mean_large = tv_loss_batch(image_batch_large, use_mean=True)


print(f"Sum Small Image Loss: {loss_sum_small.numpy()}")
print(f"Mean Small Image Loss: {loss_mean_small.numpy()}")

print(f"Sum Large Image Loss: {loss_sum_large.numpy()}")
print(f"Mean Large Image Loss: {loss_mean_large.numpy()}")

```

This third example directly compares both the effect of size increase and the `reduce_sum` vs `reduce_mean` (or batch mean here). As the prints output, we can clearly observe that the sum loss increases dramatically when input image dimensions increase, while the mean version (achieved by dividing the sum by the batch size here), is more stable against input image size. This is often the behavior that I find preferable during training.

In conclusion, the choice between `reduce_sum` and `reduce_mean` in the context of TV loss comes down to how I want the regularization to scale with respect to input size and batch size. `reduce_sum` results in a total error which will rapidly become large and require tuning of learning rate against batch and input size. The `reduce_mean`, more specifically, when divided by batch size, provides an average metric that's less affected by these factors and often requires less tuning for different image sizes.

For further understanding of loss functions and TensorFlow best practices, I would suggest exploring literature and tutorials focusing on deep learning optimization, TensorFlow image processing capabilities, and the mathematical theory behind regularization techniques. Furthermore, reviewing case studies and open-source repositories that employ total variation loss can provide invaluable hands-on insight into the practical application of these concepts. Specifically, pay attention to how regularization terms are weighted, since that has a significant interaction with the scale of the loss.
