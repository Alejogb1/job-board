The core reason for the discrepancy in tensor shapes observed during TensorFlow 2 model `fit` and `call` method invocations stems from the distinct operational phases each represents within the training process. The `fit` method, predominantly used during training, inherently accommodates batching; whereas, the `call` method, used for forward propagation, typically operates on single data instances or batches during inference. This difference is not arbitrary; it's fundamentally designed to improve training efficiency.

During training, the `fit` method processes data in mini-batches. This batching enables parallel computation, leading to significant performance gains compared to processing each sample individually. The input tensor to the model within the `fit` method, therefore, has an extra dimension—the batch size—prepended to the input shape required by the model's forward pass. For example, if a model expects input data with a shape of (height, width, channels), the `fit` method will receive an input tensor with shape (batch_size, height, width, channels). TensorFlow’s backend handles the batch processing and manages computations across the batch. This means that all layers, loss calculations and back propagation operations also handle data with the batch dimension.

On the other hand, the `call` method, intended to compute the output of the model given an input, does not intrinsically process data in batches during inference, unless explicitly specified by the user. Therefore, when a model is used directly (outside `fit`) or during prediction or evaluation (`predict` or `evaluate` methods) the `call` method is invoked directly, and the tensor shapes presented to this method match those declared as the model’s expected input format. Using the same example, the `call` method would typically accept a tensor with the shape of (height, width, channels). However, a developer can provide batched inputs during prediction/evaluation and thus `call` will receive batched inputs, as long as the batch dimension has been explicitly accepted by the layer.

It's crucial to understand that the model's layers within the `call` method must be designed to be agnostic to the batch dimension. TensorFlow layers are indeed designed to automatically broadcast across the batch dimension that is present during training or inference. This inherent broadcasting mechanism eliminates the need to rewrite model code to accommodate batching and allows the same model architecture to be used for both training and inference. Layers such as Dense, Conv2D, and pooling layers all include built-in batch-handling capabilities.

To illustrate, consider a simple custom model. In the examples below, I'll show the model's behavior under both training (`fit`) and inference (`call`) conditions.

**Example 1: A Simple Dense Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleDenseModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(SimpleDenseModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)


# Example usage
model = SimpleDenseModel(units=10)

# Dummy data
input_shape = (5,)  # Example single instance
batch_size = 32
train_data = tf.random.normal((batch_size, *input_shape)) # Create Batched Train data
single_instance = tf.random.normal(input_shape)

# 1. During training with fit
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(train_data, tf.random.normal((batch_size, 10)), epochs=1, verbose=0) # dummy label

print(f"Shape in fit input: {train_data.shape}")
print(f"Output shape of the first layer during training: {model(train_data).shape}")

# 2. During inference, with a single instance input to the call method
output = model(single_instance)
print(f"Shape in call (single instance): {single_instance.shape}")
print(f"Output shape of the first layer during inference: {output.shape}")

# 3. During inference with a batch input to the call method
batched_inference_data = tf.random.normal((3, *input_shape))
output = model(batched_inference_data)
print(f"Shape in call (batched): {batched_inference_data.shape}")
print(f"Output shape of the first layer during inference: {output.shape}")
```

In this example, during `fit`, the input has a shape of `(32, 5)` representing a batch of 32 samples each with shape (5,). During inference with the single instance, the input shape is `(5,)`. When we provide a batch of three inputs during inference, the `call` method accepts it and outputs the shape `(3, 10)`. Notice that the `Dense` layer operates on both single-instance and batch inputs, the key difference being that the `fit` method always assumes an input that has a batch dimension.

**Example 2: A Convolutional Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleConvModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleConvModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')
        self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.conv(inputs)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        return self.dense(x)

# Example Usage
model = SimpleConvModel()
input_shape = (28, 28, 3) # Example image
batch_size = 32
train_data = tf.random.normal((batch_size, *input_shape)) # Batched train data
single_instance = tf.random.normal(input_shape)

# 1. During training with fit
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(train_data, tf.random.normal((batch_size, 10)), epochs=1, verbose = 0) # dummy labels

print(f"Shape in fit input: {train_data.shape}")
print(f"Output shape of the conv layer during training: {model.layers[0](train_data).shape}")


# 2. During inference
output = model(single_instance)
print(f"Shape in call (single instance): {single_instance.shape}")
print(f"Output shape of the conv layer during inference: {model.layers[0](single_instance).shape}")

# 3. During inference with batch input
batched_inference_data = tf.random.normal((3, *input_shape))
output = model(batched_inference_data)
print(f"Shape in call (batched): {batched_inference_data.shape}")
print(f"Output shape of the conv layer during inference: {model.layers[0](batched_inference_data).shape}")
```

Here, the `fit` method receives a tensor of shape `(32, 28, 28, 3)`, while `call` during single-instance inference operates on a shape `(28, 28, 3)`. The convolution layer is also agnostic to batch dimensions. When provided with a batch during inference, the `call` method will process the entire batch as well and the shapes will be broadcasted accordingly.

**Example 3: A Model with Input Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleInputModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, input_shape):
        super(SimpleInputModel, self).__init__()
        self.input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape)
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

    def call(self, inputs):
      return self.dense(inputs)

# Example usage
input_shape = (5,)  # Example single instance
model = SimpleInputModel(input_shape)
batch_size = 32
train_data = tf.random.normal((batch_size, *input_shape)) # Batched Train data
single_instance = tf.random.normal(input_shape)


# 1. During training with fit
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(train_data, tf.random.normal((batch_size, 10)), epochs=1, verbose=0) # dummy labels

print(f"Shape in fit input: {train_data.shape}")
print(f"Output shape of the dense layer during training: {model(train_data).shape}")

# 2. During inference, with a single instance input to the call method
output = model(single_instance)
print(f"Shape in call (single instance): {single_instance.shape}")
print(f"Output shape of the dense layer during inference: {output.shape}")

# 3. During inference with a batch input to the call method
batched_inference_data = tf.random.normal((3, *input_shape))
output = model(batched_inference_data)
print(f"Shape in call (batched): {batched_inference_data.shape}")
print(f"Output shape of the dense layer during inference: {output.shape}")
```

This example demonstrates that even if you instantiate an `Input` layer, the shapes passed into the `fit` and `call` methods will remain distinct. The `Input` layer acts primarily as a placeholder that the model uses to trace its internal computations during the construction phase. Note that the `Input` layer is only used as a reference and is not directly used during inference. The layers that come after it (`Dense` in this example) will still receive the batch dimension when used during training through the `fit` method.

In summary, the shape difference between `fit` and `call` is due to the inherent batching during training (in `fit`) for performance and the typical single-instance (or batched if needed) processing during inference through the `call` method. TensorFlow's layer implementations handle batch dimensions implicitly by broadcasting the input tensors, thus creating consistent usage for single instance or batched input data.

For a deeper understanding, I recommend examining the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the guides on training and custom layers. Furthermore, studying examples of model implementations within the TensorFlow ecosystem and exploring the source code for popular layers such as Dense, Conv2D and similar modules can help gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind shape handling and broadcasting.
