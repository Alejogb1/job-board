The core challenge in migrating from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x isn't simply upgrading the version number; it's adapting to a fundamentally altered programming paradigm.  TensorFlow 1.x relied heavily on static computational graphs defined explicitly using `tf.Session` and `tf.placeholder`, whereas TensorFlow 2.x embraces eager execution, where operations are evaluated immediately.  This shift necessitates a reconsideration of how models are built, trained, and deployed.  My experience porting several large-scale production models from TensorFlow 1.3 to 2.x highlighted the importance of a methodical approach, focusing on iterative changes and rigorous testing at each stage.

**1. Understanding the Fundamental Shift: From Static Graphs to Eager Execution**

TensorFlow 1.x's static graph approach involved constructing the entire computational graph before execution. This demanded meticulous planning and often resulted in complex code, particularly for intricate models.  TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution simplifies this significantly. Operations are executed immediately, allowing for more interactive debugging and simpler code structure. This change affects how placeholders, sessions, and graph construction are handled.  Placeholders are replaced by tensors populated directly with data; sessions are no longer explicitly managed; and graph construction becomes implicit.

**2.  Key Migration Strategies and Code Examples**

The transition requires addressing several key aspects:  handling of placeholders and feed dictionaries, the shift from `tf.Session` to eager execution, and the conversion of `tf.contrib` modules.  Let's illustrate this with examples.

**Example 1:  Replacing Placeholders and Sessions with Eager Execution**

In TensorFlow 1.3, a simple linear regression might look like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1.x
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1])
W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))
y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b
y_ = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1])
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y - y_))
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01)
train = optimizer.minimize(loss)

init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(init)

for i in range(1000):
    xs = [[i],]
    ys = [[i*2 +1],]
    feed = {x: xs, y_: ys}
    _, loss_val = sess.run([train, loss], feed_dict=feed)
    print(i, loss_val)

sess.close()
```

The equivalent in TensorFlow 2.x eliminates the need for placeholders and sessions:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 2.x
x = tf.Variable([[0.0]])
W = tf.Variable([[0.0]])
b = tf.Variable([[0.0]])

def model(x):
  return tf.matmul(x,W) + b

def loss_fn(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

for i in range(1000):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = loss_fn([[i*2 + 1]], y_pred)
  grads = tape.gradient(loss, [W,b])
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads,[W,b]))
  print(i, loss.numpy())
  x.assign([[i+1]])
```

This demonstrates the simplification achieved by using eager execution.  Variables are initialized directly, and the training loop manages updates without explicit session management.


**Example 2: Converting tf.contrib Modules**

Many functionalities previously found in `tf.contrib` have been integrated into core TensorFlow 2.x or replaced with superior alternatives. For instance, `tf.contrib.layers` functionality is largely subsumed by `tf.keras.layers`. During my work, I encountered numerous instances where direct replacement wasn't sufficient and involved restructuring model components.  Consider a hypothetical example using `tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected`:

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x using tf.contrib.layers
import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 784])
fc1 = tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected(x, 128, activation_fn=tf.nn.relu)

# TensorFlow 2.x equivalent
import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(784,))
fc1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
```

The `tf.keras.layers` approach provides a cleaner, more object-oriented interface.


**Example 3:  Handling Custom Layers and Functions**

Migrating custom layers or functions requires careful consideration.  In TensorFlow 1.x, custom operations might have relied heavily on `tf.Session.run()`.  In TensorFlow 2.x, these operations need to be compatible with eager execution, often requiring adjustments to how data is passed and returned.  For instance, a custom layer in TensorFlow 1.3 might involve explicit graph construction within the layer's definition.  Rewriting this in TensorFlow 2.x demands ensuring that the layer works correctly within the eager execution environment.


**3.  Resource Recommendations**

For a thorough understanding, consult the official TensorFlow migration guide.  Supplement this with detailed tutorials on eager execution and the Keras API.  Explore the TensorFlow 2.x API documentation extensively. Mastering the Keras functional API will be highly beneficial for building and managing complex models efficiently.  Thorough testing using unit tests and integration tests is also critical during and after migration to ensure the ported models retain their accuracy and functionality.  Finally, studying examples of real-world migrations, potentially from open-source projects that underwent similar transitions, can provide invaluable insights and practical strategies.
