Tensor manipulation in TensorFlow often requires precise control over element selection and removal. The challenge of removing tensor elements based on a list of indices is frequently encountered when processing data that is irregularly shaped or contains irrelevant entries. Efficiently handling this requires understanding TensorFlow’s masking and indexing capabilities, as direct deletion is not an operation supported on tensors in-place due to their immutable nature. I’ve addressed similar problems many times in my work building custom recommendation systems, and the approach has consistently been a combination of masking and scatter operations to achieve the desired result without creating inefficient copies.

The core concept revolves around generating a boolean mask that mirrors the original tensor's shape. This mask is initially all `True`, indicating that all elements are to be kept. We then modify this mask, setting the values at the specified indices to `False`, effectively marking them for removal. After creating the mask, we can use `tf.boolean_mask` to filter the original tensor. However, simply using `tf.boolean_mask` will flatten the results into a 1D tensor. To maintain the original tensor's rank, a further step using scatter operations may be necessary, depending on the desired outcome. The alternative method involves constructing a new tensor of reduced length or shape by using `tf.gather`. Both approaches provide viable solutions for removing elements, but one might be preferable depending on the intended final representation of the tensor.

Let's start with an example using boolean masking to remove elements and flatten the tensor. Assume we have a 1D tensor and wish to remove elements at indices 1 and 3:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example tensor
tensor = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
indices_to_remove = tf.constant([1, 3])

# Create a mask initialized to True
mask = tf.ones(tf.shape(tensor), dtype=tf.bool)

# Scatter update the mask to False at the specified indices
mask = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(mask, tf.expand_dims(indices_to_remove, axis=1), tf.zeros(tf.shape(indices_to_remove),dtype=tf.bool))


# Apply the mask to the tensor
filtered_tensor = tf.boolean_mask(tensor, mask)

print(filtered_tensor) # Output: tf.Tensor([10 30 50], shape=(3,), dtype=int32)
```

In this code, `tf.ones(tf.shape(tensor), dtype=tf.bool)` generates a boolean mask of the same shape as the original tensor, with all values as `True`.  `tf.expand_dims(indices_to_remove, axis=1)` shapes the indices into a format acceptable for `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`. We use this to update the mask to `False` at the indices specified in `indices_to_remove`. Finally, `tf.boolean_mask` extracts elements where the corresponding mask value is `True`. Note that the output is a flattened tensor.

Now, let us consider a case where maintaining the original tensor’s rank is essential. For a multi-dimensional tensor, direct boolean masking would flatten the output, hence we need a different strategy using scatter operations and an index map:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example 2D tensor
tensor_2d = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
indices_to_remove = tf.constant([0, 2]) # remove rows at index 0 and 2

# Create a mask for rows
mask = tf.ones(tf.shape(tensor_2d)[0], dtype=tf.bool)
mask = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(mask, tf.expand_dims(indices_to_remove, axis=1), tf.zeros(tf.shape(indices_to_remove), dtype=tf.bool))


# Create index map
valid_indices = tf.range(tf.shape(tensor_2d)[0])
valid_indices = tf.boolean_mask(valid_indices, mask)

# Gather elements based on valid indices
filtered_tensor_2d = tf.gather(tensor_2d, valid_indices)

print(filtered_tensor_2d) # Output: tf.Tensor([[4 5 6]], shape=(1, 3), dtype=int32)
```

Here, we generate a boolean mask focusing only on the rows (the first dimension). The resulting mask is then used to determine the valid row indices using `tf.boolean_mask` on a range. Finally `tf.gather` is used to collect the rows at the filtered indices. The resulting tensor retains its 2D structure, unlike what `tf.boolean_mask` would have produced directly on the 2D tensor.

Lastly, for a case where the goal is not to retain the original dimensionality after removal but simply obtain the reduced set of values, one can use the gather operation with the complement of the indices to remove, without resorting to boolean masks. Here’s how that can be done:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example tensor
tensor = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
indices_to_remove = tf.constant([1, 3])

# Determine all indices
all_indices = tf.range(tf.shape(tensor)[0])

# Filter indices
complement_indices = tf.sets.difference(tf.expand_dims(all_indices, 1), tf.expand_dims(indices_to_remove, 1))
complement_indices = tf.reshape(complement_indices.values, [-1])

# Gather elements at complement indices
filtered_tensor = tf.gather(tensor, complement_indices)


print(filtered_tensor) # Output: tf.Tensor([10 30 50], shape=(3,), dtype=int32)
```

This approach uses `tf.sets.difference` to calculate the set difference between all indices and the indices we want to remove. Then, `tf.gather` is used to extract the corresponding values. This effectively achieves the same result as the boolean masking technique for a 1D tensor, however, without relying on an intermediate mask. This method is particularly useful if you do not wish to create an intermediate mask and require direct manipulation of the indices.

When choosing between these approaches, performance often depends on the specific tensor size and the density of the indices to remove. For sparsely distributed indices, boolean masking and scatter updates are typically computationally efficient, although they produce a flattened tensor. If retaining dimensions is vital, using gather operations with an index map, as in the second example, is essential. The third example using `tf.sets.difference` provides a succinct way to obtain a complement set of indices without an intermediate boolean mask. Therefore, understanding the intended final format of the data and the cost of intermediate mask construction are crucial.

For further exploration, I would recommend studying the TensorFlow documentation on `tf.boolean_mask`, `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`, `tf.gather`, and `tf.sets.difference`. These functions provide the foundation for more complex tensor manipulation and offer various capabilities beyond just element removal. Understanding advanced indexing using `tf.gather_nd` can be beneficial when dealing with multi-dimensional indexing. Reading examples from open-source TensorFlow repositories can also provide insights into practical applications of these techniques. A careful evaluation of performance with larger tensor sizes is crucial to identify any potential bottlenecks in your data pipeline.
