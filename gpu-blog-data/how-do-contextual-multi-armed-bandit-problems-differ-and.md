Contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problems fundamentally differ from their non-contextual counterparts through the incorporation of observable contextual information influencing reward probabilities.  This contextual data, representing user features, product characteristics, or environmental variables, allows for a more nuanced and adaptive selection of actions, leading to significantly improved performance compared to treating all arms identically.  My experience building recommendation systems for a major e-commerce platform highlighted the crucial role of effectively leveraging this contextual information.  Failure to do so resulted in a 15% drop in click-through rates, underscoring the importance of employing appropriate CMAB algorithms.

The core difference lies in the conditional probability of rewards.  In a non-contextual MAB, the reward probability for each arm is constant. In a CMAB, the reward probability for each arm is *conditional* on the observed context. This necessitates algorithms that can learn a mapping from contexts to action selection policies, rather than simply estimating reward probabilities for each arm independently.  This mapping can take various forms, ranging from simple linear models to complex neural networks, depending on the complexity of the context and the desired level of model expressiveness.

TensorFlow and Stable Baselines, while both capable of handling CMAB problems, adopt different approaches and offer varying levels of abstraction. TensorFlow provides a low-level framework allowing for maximum flexibility in model architecture and algorithm design. Stable Baselines, on the other hand, offers pre-built implementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms, including those suitable for CMABs, providing a higher level of abstraction at the cost of reduced customization.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The choice of algorithm for a CMAB problem depends heavily on the characteristics of the data and the desired balance between exploration and exploitation.  Linear models, such as linear Thompson sampling or linear UCB, are computationally efficient and perform well when the relationship between context and reward is approximately linear. However, they may struggle with complex, non-linear relationships.  Deep learning approaches, using neural networks to model the reward function, offer superior flexibility in handling non-linearity but demand significantly more data and computational resources.

Within the reinforcement learning paradigm, CMABs are often framed as a contextual bandit problem where the agent's policy is learned to maximize cumulative reward over time.  The policy is a function that maps contexts to actions, aiming to select actions that yield high rewards in specific contexts.  The learning process involves balancing exploration (trying different actions to gather information) and exploitation (choosing actions known to yield high rewards).  Algorithms like contextual epsilon-greedy, Thompson sampling (with a suitable model for the reward distribution), and upper confidence bound (UCB) are commonly employed, often adapted to handle the complexity of high-dimensional contextual data.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Linear Thompson Sampling with TensorFlow**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Context dimension
context_dim = 5
# Number of actions
num_actions = 3

# Initialize model parameters (weights and biases)
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([context_dim, num_actions]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([num_actions]))

def model(context):
  return tf.matmul(context, W) + b

def sample_action(context):
  context = tf.expand_dims(context, 0)
  mu = model(context)
  # Assuming rewards follow a Gaussian distribution
  sampled_rewards = tf.random.normal(shape=[num_actions]) + mu
  return tf.argmax(sampled_rewards, axis=1)[0].numpy()

# Training loop (simplified for brevity)
for i in range(1000):
  context = np.random.rand(context_dim)
  action = sample_action(context)
  reward = ... # Obtain reward from environment
  # Update model parameters using a suitable optimizer (e.g., Adam)
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss = ... # Define a loss function (e.g., MSE between predicted and actual reward)
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [W, b])
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [W, b]))
```

This example demonstrates a basic linear Thompson sampling implementation using TensorFlow. The model linearly maps the context to action values, and the algorithm samples from the posterior distribution of these values to select actions.  Crucially, the `sample_action` function incorporates the stochasticity inherent in Thompson sampling.  Note that the reward acquisition and loss function are left as placeholders for brevity.  In a real-world application, these would be appropriately defined based on the specific problem and reward structure.

**Example 2: Deep Q-Network (DQN) with Stable Baselines3**

```python
from stable_baselines3 import DQN
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv
import gym

# Custom environment definition (required)
class ContextualBanditEnv(gym.Env):
    # ... (environment definition, including context generation and reward function) ...

env = DummyVecEnv([lambda: ContextualBanditEnv()])
model = DQN("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)

# Prediction
context = np.random.rand(context_dim)  # Provide context
action, _states = model.predict(context)
```

This example utilizes Stable Baselines3's DQN implementation.  The crucial aspect here is the custom environment, `ContextualBanditEnv`, which must be defined to handle the contextual input and provide the appropriate reward signal.  Stable Baselines3 simplifies the implementation by abstracting away much of the underlying TensorFlow/PyTorch details.  The `MlpPolicy` is a Multi-Layer Perceptron policy, indicating the use of a neural network for approximating the Q-function.

**Example 3:  Contextual Epsilon-Greedy with NumPy (Illustrative)**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simplified example â€“ no deep learning
num_actions = 3
context_dim = 5
epsilon = 0.1
Q = np.zeros((num_actions, context_dim))
N = np.zeros((num_actions, context_dim))


def choose_action(context, epsilon):
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:  #Exploration
        return np.random.randint(num_actions)
    else: # Exploitation
        return np.argmax(Q[:, context])

# Simplified training loop
for i in range(1000):
  context_index = np.random.randint(context_dim)
  context = np.zeros(context_dim)
  context[context_index] = 1 # One hot encoding for simplicity
  action = choose_action(context_index, epsilon)
  reward = ... # Get reward
  N[action, context_index] +=1
  Q[action, context_index] += (reward - Q[action, context_index]) / N[action, context_index]

```
This example demonstrates a rudimentary contextual epsilon-greedy strategy.  It utilizes a simple averaging approach to estimate action values, which is unsuitable for complex scenarios but serves to illustrate the core concept. The context is simplified using one-hot encoding for illustrative purposes;  real-world applications would likely use more sophisticated context representations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of CMABs, I suggest exploring comprehensive reinforcement learning textbooks, focusing on chapters dealing with contextual bandits.  Furthermore, research papers focusing on deep reinforcement learning for contextual bandits would provide valuable insights into advanced techniques and model architectures.  Finally, the official documentation of TensorFlow and Stable Baselines3 offers detailed guides on utilizing their respective functionalities for building reinforcement learning agents.  The literature on bandit algorithms, specifically those designed for high-dimensional contexts, will be invaluable in choosing and implementing effective solutions.
