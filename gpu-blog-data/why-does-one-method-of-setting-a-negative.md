The core issue stems from PyTorch's internal handling of optimizer parameters and the interaction between learning rate scheduling and the underlying gradient update mechanism.  Specifically, directly assigning a negative value to the `lr` attribute of an optimizer object does not correctly propagate the change to the internal state used for weight updates.  This is because the `lr` attribute is primarily for accessing and setting the learning rate *parameter*, not directly controlling the step size during the update calculation. My experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous deep learning projects involving complex architectures and custom optimizers solidified this understanding.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch optimizers don't simply multiply the gradient by the learning rate during weight updates.  The process is more nuanced, often involving momentum, weight decay, and other hyperparameters.  These components are managed internally within the optimizer class, and while the `lr` attribute reflects the base learning rate, it's not the sole determinant of the final update step. The optimizer typically computes the update based on an internal state, derived from past gradients and learning rate. Directly changing the `lr` attribute after optimizer initialization might not update this internal state, leading to unexpected behavior â€“ in the case of negative learning rates, it results in incorrect updates, potentially leading to divergence or instability rather than the intended reverse-gradient update.  Conversely, utilizing scheduler mechanisms explicitly designed for learning rate adjustments (such as `StepLR`, `CosineAnnealingLR`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`, etc.) correctly manipulates this internal state, ensuring that negative learning rates are handled appropriately in conjunction with other optimizer components.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Direct `lr` modification (fails)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Incorrect method: directly setting a negative learning rate
optimizer.lr = -0.01  # This doesn't correctly update the optimizer's internal state

# Subsequent training steps will likely produce erratic results.
for i in range(100):
    # ... your training loop ...
    optimizer.step()
```

*Commentary:* This approach fails because it only changes the value associated with the `lr` attribute, which is not directly used in the `step()` method's update calculation.  The internal state remains unchanged, and the negative sign is effectively ignored during gradient updates.  The weights might not update in the anticipated direction, or the training process could become unstable.


**Example 2: Using a learning rate scheduler (succeeds)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import LambdaLR

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Correct method: using a scheduler to control the learning rate, including negative values
def lr_lambda(epoch):
    if epoch < 50:
        return 1.0
    else:
        return -1.0  # Negative learning rate after 50 epochs

scheduler = LambdaLR(optimizer, lr_lambda)

for epoch in range(100):
    for i in range(100):
        # ... your training loop ...
        optimizer.step()
    scheduler.step()
```

*Commentary:* This exemplifies the correct approach.  The `LambdaLR` scheduler allows for complete control over the learning rate at each epoch. By defining a lambda function that returns a negative value after a certain number of epochs, the scheduler correctly updates the optimizer's internal state, ensuring that the weight updates reflect the negative learning rate. This strategy leverages the scheduler's internal mechanism for properly incorporating the learning rate into the weight update calculations.


**Example 3: Custom Optimizer with Explicit Negative Learning Rate Handling (succeeds)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyOptimizer(torch.optim.Optimizer):
    def __init__(self, params, lr):
        defaults = dict(lr=lr)
        super(MyOptimizer, self).__init__(params, defaults)

    def step(self, closure=None):
        loss = None
        if closure is not None:
            loss = closure()

        for group in self.param_groups:
            for p in group['params']:
                if p.grad is None:
                    continue
                d_p = p.grad.data
                if group['lr'] < 0:
                  d_p = -d_p # Explicitly reverse the gradient.
                p.data.add_(d_p, alpha=group['lr'])

        return loss


model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
optimizer = MyOptimizer(model.parameters(), lr=-0.01)

for i in range(100):
    # ... your training loop ...
    optimizer.step()
```

*Commentary:*  Creating a custom optimizer provides direct control over the update rule. Here, we explicitly check the learning rate's sign. If negative, the gradient is reversed before the update step.  This guarantees that the negative learning rate correctly modifies the weights in the opposite direction of the gradient, achieving the intended effect.  This approach requires a deeper understanding of PyTorch's optimizer internals but offers the most control and flexibility.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation;  a comprehensive textbook on deep learning; a research paper on optimization algorithms in deep learning;  the source code of PyTorch itself (for advanced users);  a book focused on gradient-based optimization methods.  Studying these resources will provide a deeper comprehension of the underlying mechanisms involved.  Careful examination of the source code for various PyTorch optimizers will illuminate the internal workings and how the learning rate parameter interacts with other components.  Understanding the mathematical foundations of gradient descent and its variants will be crucial for grasping the subtleties involved in learning rate adjustments, particularly the implications of negative values.
