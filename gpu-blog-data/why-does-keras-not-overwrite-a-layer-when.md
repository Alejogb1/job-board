The immutability of Keras layers, specifically within the context of a `Sequential` model or when using the functional API, stems from the underlying graph structure employed for model definition and execution.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects highlighted this characteristic repeatedly.  Keras layers are not merely objects; they are nodes within a computational graph, representing specific transformations on input tensors.  Reassignment doesn't alter the graph's established connections; instead, it creates a new, independent layer object.  This behavior, while perhaps initially counterintuitive, is crucial for maintaining the integrity and traceability of the model's architecture.


**1. Explanation:**

Keras models, at their core, represent directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).  Each layer acts as a node in this graph, with edges defining the data flow.  When you construct a `Sequential` model, you're essentially adding nodes to this graph sequentially.  Similarly, the functional API allows for more complex graph structures, defining connections between layers explicitly.  The act of reassignment –  `model.layers[0] = new_layer` – does not modify the existing graph structure.  Instead, it simply creates a new layer object and updates the Python variable `model.layers[0]` to point to this new object. The original layer, which is still embedded within the model's internal graph representation, remains untouched. Attempting to overwrite a layer in-place would necessitate manipulating the model's underlying graph structure directly, which is not a feature explicitly exposed within the Keras API for good reason. The consequences of such direct manipulation could be unpredictable, leading to inconsistencies and potential crashes. Keras’s approach prioritizes stability and maintainability.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Sequential Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Attempting to overwrite a layer
original_layer = model.layers[0]
new_layer = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,))
model.layers[0] = new_layer

# Verify that the original layer is still present in the model's summary
model.summary()

#Observe that the original layer still exists, but isn't part of the forward pass
# The model summary will reflect the new layer, but the forward pass will use the original layer. 
# To actually incorporate the change, you need to reconstruct the model.

#Correct way to modify the model
new_model = keras.Sequential([new_layer, model.layers[1]])
new_model.summary()
```

**Commentary:**  This example showcases the crucial point:  the reassignment only updates the Python reference. The underlying graph of the original `model` remains unchanged.  To effectively change the model architecture, the model must be reconstructed, as shown with `new_model`.  This approach maintains the integrity of the model's internal representation.


**Example 2: Functional API**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_layer)
output_layer = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

# Attempting to replace a layer within the model
original_layer = model.layers[1]  # Accessing the Dense(64) layer.
new_layer = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')

#Re-assignment doesn't change the model structure. The graph remains unchanged.
model.layers[1] = new_layer
model.summary()

# Correct way to modify the model architecture using the functional API
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = new_layer(input_layer)
output_layer = model.layers[-1](x) #Reuse the original output layer
modified_model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
modified_model.summary()
```

**Commentary:**  Similar to the `Sequential` model, the functional API's graph representation remains unaffected by layer reassignment. The correct way to modify the model is to reconstruct the model graph by defining the connections anew, using the desired layers. Direct manipulation of the `model.layers` attribute simply updates a reference, it doesn't modify the computation graph.


**Example 3:  Illustrating Layer Sharing (Advanced)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

shared_layer = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')

input_a = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x_a = shared_layer(input_a)
output_a = keras.layers.Dense(5)(x_a)

input_b = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x_b = shared_layer(input_b)
output_b = keras.layers.Dense(5)(x_b)

model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=[output_a, output_b])
model.summary()

#Attempting to modify shared_layer will affect both branches.
new_shared_layer = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
shared_layer = new_shared_layer #Reassignment only affects the variable not the model itself.

model.summary() #The model remains unchanged.

#To effectively change the model the model must be rebuilt using the new_shared_layer.
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates that even when layers are shared across different branches of a model (as is common in multi-input or multi-output architectures), reassigning the layer variable does not alter the model's established connections.  The model maintains its original structure, reflecting the original shared layer. To implement the desired change, one would need to redefine the model using the new layer.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of the Keras functional API and model building, I would recommend consulting the official Keras documentation.  Exploring TensorFlow's documentation on computational graphs would also provide valuable context.  Finally, studying examples of complex model architectures in research papers will help solidify this understanding through practical application.  These resources provide comprehensive explanations of the underlying principles involved, ensuring a strong conceptual foundation.
