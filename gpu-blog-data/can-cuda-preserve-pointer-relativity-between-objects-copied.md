CUDA's memory management doesn't inherently preserve pointer relativity between host and device memory.  This is a critical distinction often overlooked, leading to significant debugging challenges.  My experience working on high-performance computing simulations for fluid dynamics highlighted this repeatedly.  Understanding the underlying memory architecture and employing appropriate data transfer and management strategies is paramount.

**1. Explanation:**

Pointer relativity refers to the relationship between memory addresses of different objects.  If object A's address is X and object B's address is X + N, the relative offset between A and B is N.  On the CPU, this relationship is preserved through pointer arithmetic.  However, CUDA's memory model is distinct.  When data is transferred to the GPU using `cudaMemcpy`, it's copied to a separate memory space. While the data itself is copied identically, the device addresses will generally differ from the host addresses. Consequently, pointer offsets calculated on the host are invalid on the device.  This is because the GPU kernel operates within its own address space, independent of the host's memory layout.  The addresses assigned by the CUDA runtime are non-deterministic; they depend on factors such as available memory and allocation strategy.  Therefore, any pointer arithmetic relying on relative offsets calculated on the host will produce incorrect results on the device.

This doesn't mean pointer arithmetic is unusable on the GPU; however, it necessitates careful consideration.  Pointer arithmetic should only be performed on pointers that point to data residing in the GPU's memory. Furthermore, these pointers should be derived and manipulated solely within the kernel's execution context. Any attempt to use host-derived pointer offsets within a kernel will almost certainly fail.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Handling of Pointer Relativity**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

struct MyStruct {
  int a;
  int b;
};

int main() {
  MyStruct hostStruct1;
  hostStruct1.a = 10;
  hostStruct1.b = 20;

  MyStruct hostStruct2;
  hostStruct2.a = 30;
  hostStruct2.b = 40;

  MyStruct *d_struct1, *d_struct2;
  cudaMalloc(&d_struct1, sizeof(MyStruct));
  cudaMalloc(&d_struct2, sizeof(MyStruct));

  cudaMemcpy(d_struct1, &hostStruct1, sizeof(MyStruct), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_struct2, &hostStruct2, sizeof(MyStruct), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  //INCORRECT:  Trying to use host-derived offset
  int hostOffset = (char*)&hostStruct2 - (char*)&hostStruct1;
  int* d_incorrectPointer = (int*)((char*)d_struct1 + hostOffset); //ERROR PRONE

  //Further kernel operations using d_incorrectPointer will likely be incorrect

  cudaFree(d_struct1);
  cudaFree(d_struct2);
  return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates the crucial error.  The `hostOffset` is calculated on the host and used to derive the device pointer `d_incorrectPointer`. This is fundamentally flawed because the relative offset is not maintained on the device memory.  This will likely lead to memory access violations or incorrect data access.

**Example 2: Correct Handling Using Array Indexing**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void kernel(int* data, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    data[i] *= 2;
  }
}

int main() {
  int hostData[10] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
  int *d_data;
  cudaMalloc(&d_data, 10 * sizeof(int));
  cudaMemcpy(d_data, hostData, 10 * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (10 + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, 10);

  cudaMemcpy(hostData, d_data, 10 * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
  cudaFree(d_data);
  return 0;
}
```

This example correctly processes data on the GPU.  Instead of relying on pointer relativity, it uses array indexing.  The kernel operates directly on the device array, `d_data`, eliminating the need for host-derived pointer offsets. This is the recommended approach for manipulating data structures on the device.

**Example 3: Correct Handling with Structures and Device-Side Allocation**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

struct MyStruct {
  int a;
  int b;
};

__global__ void kernel(MyStruct* data, int size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
        data[i].a *= 2;
        data[i].b += 10;
    }
}

int main() {
    int numStructs = 5;
    MyStruct* h_data = new MyStruct[numStructs];
    for (int i = 0; i < numStructs; ++i) {
        h_data[i].a = i * 2;
        h_data[i].b = i * 3;
    }
    MyStruct* d_data;
    cudaMalloc(&d_data, numStructs * sizeof(MyStruct));
    cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, numStructs * sizeof(MyStruct), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    delete[] h_data;

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (numStructs + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, numStructs);

    MyStruct* h_result = new MyStruct[numStructs];
    cudaMemcpy(h_result, d_data, numStructs * sizeof(MyStruct), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    cudaFree(d_data);

    for (int i = 0; i < numStructs; ++i) {
        std::cout << h_result[i].a << " " << h_result[i].b << std::endl;
    }
    delete[] h_result;

    return 0;
}

```

This example showcases correct manipulation of structures on the device.  Structures are allocated directly on the device using `cudaMalloc`.  All operations on the structures are performed within the kernel using device pointers, avoiding any reliance on host-side pointer relativity.  This approach is crucial for maintaining data integrity and correctness when working with complex data structures on the GPU.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA Programming Guide, the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide, and a comprehensive text on parallel programming with CUDA are invaluable resources.  Familiarizing oneself with the CUDA memory model is critical for writing robust and efficient CUDA code. Thoroughly understanding memory allocation, data transfer mechanisms, and kernel execution is necessary to avoid common pitfalls associated with pointer manipulation on the GPU.  Focusing on using array indexing and device-side allocation whenever possible will significantly improve the reliability of the code.  Debugging tools like the NVIDIA Nsight system are instrumental in identifying and resolving memory-related errors.
