Accessing `y_pred` and `y_true` within a custom TensorFlow loss function requires understanding the function signature and the underlying TensorFlow graph execution.  In my experience developing and deploying large-scale machine learning models, I've encountered numerous scenarios where direct access to these tensors was crucial for implementing specialized loss functions.  Crucially, the manner of access depends on the framework version and the specific context (e.g., eager execution versus graph mode).

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A custom loss function in TensorFlow is a callable object that takes predicted values (`y_pred`) and true values (`y_true`) as input tensors.  These tensors are fed into the function by the TensorFlow training loop during the backpropagation process.  Therefore, the function must be defined in a way that correctly receives these arguments.  The simplest approach involves explicitly naming the input parameters within the function definition.  The critical aspect to remember is that these inputs are TensorFlow tensors, not NumPy arrays.  Direct manipulation often necessitates the use of TensorFlow operations to avoid breaking the computational graph and hindering automatic differentiation.

When working with custom loss functions, especially those requiring element-wise comparisons or manipulations of `y_pred` and `y_true`, ensuring compatibility with TensorFlow's automatic differentiation is paramount. Incorrect usage might lead to `None` gradients or even runtime errors.  This is where familiarity with TensorFlow's gradient tape mechanism becomes vital. However, in many cases, simply using TensorFlow operations on the input tensors suffices.  The framework handles the gradient calculation automatically, provided the operations are differentiable.

Further, the availability of `y_pred` and `y_true` within the custom function implicitly depends on the model's output and the data provided during the training process.  Mismatches between the model's output shape and the expected shape of `y_true` will inevitably lead to errors.  Therefore, careful attention to data preprocessing and model architecture is equally important.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Mean Squared Error (MSE) Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_mse(y_true, y_pred):
  """Custom MSE loss function."""
  squared_difference = tf.square(y_true - y_pred)
  return tf.reduce_mean(squared_difference)

#Example usage:
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(loss=custom_mse, optimizer='adam')
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward implementation of MSE. The function explicitly takes `y_true` and `y_pred` as input, computes the squared difference using TensorFlow's `tf.square`, and calculates the mean using `tf.reduce_mean`.  This approach is efficient and directly leverages TensorFlow's optimized operations.

**Example 2:  Handling Multi-Class Classification with Weighted Loss**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, weights):
  """Custom weighted categorical crossentropy."""
  #Ensure weights is a tensor
  weights = tf.convert_to_tensor(weights)
  cce = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
  loss = cce(y_true, y_pred)
  weighted_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss * weights)
  return weighted_loss

#Example Usage:
weights = [0.2, 0.8] # Example class weights
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')])
model.compile(loss=lambda y_true, y_pred: weighted_categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, weights), optimizer='adam')

```

Here, we demonstrate a weighted categorical cross-entropy loss. This example highlights the flexibility of custom loss functions by incorporating pre-defined weights to adjust the contribution of different classes to the overall loss.  The weights tensor is explicitly passed as an argument.  Note the use of `tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()` for conciseness and leveraging pre-built functions.

**Example 3:  Loss Function with Element-wise Operations and Masking**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def masked_mae(y_true, y_pred, mask):
  """Custom Masked Mean Absolute Error (MAE)."""
  mask = tf.cast(mask, dtype=tf.float32) #Ensure the mask is a float tensor
  absolute_error = tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)
  masked_error = absolute_error * mask
  return tf.reduce_mean(masked_error)

#Example Usage:
mask = tf.constant([[1.,1.,0],[1.,0.,1.]]) #Example mask
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(loss=lambda y_true, y_pred: masked_mae(y_true, y_pred, mask), optimizer='adam')
```

This example demonstrates a more complex scenario where a mask is used to ignore specific elements during loss computation.  This is commonly encountered in sequence prediction tasks where padding tokens need to be excluded from the loss calculation.  The mask is applied element-wise to the absolute error before calculating the mean.  Note the explicit casting to `tf.float32` to ensure compatibility with the multiplication operation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guidance on custom loss functions and automatic differentiation.  Thorough examination of the TensorFlow API reference is beneficial for understanding the available operations and their usage within the context of custom loss functions.  Furthermore, exploring examples in the TensorFlow tutorials and model repositories provides valuable practical insights into diverse implementations.  Finally,  referencing relevant research papers on specialized loss functions can offer theoretical underpinnings and potential novel approaches.  Careful study of these resources enhances understanding and facilitates the development of sophisticated loss functions tailored to specific application needs.
