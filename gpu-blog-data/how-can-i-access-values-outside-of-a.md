Accessing variables outside of a multistart objective function in MATLAB requires careful consideration of scoping and variable visibility. Within the context of `fmincon` or similar optimization solvers utilizing a multistart algorithm, the objective function, which is typically defined as an anonymous function or a nested function, operates within a limited scope. Consequently, direct access to variables defined in the calling workspace is not straightforward. My experience developing optimization algorithms for robotic control simulations has highlighted the importance of managing these scopes effectively.

The fundamental challenge arises because the optimization solver invokes the objective function repeatedly, potentially in parallel when using the `MultiStart` class, each time in a context separate from the primary script or function's workspace. Therefore, any variables defined outside the function’s immediate scope are not automatically accessible. There are several common approaches to address this limitation, each with their advantages and disadvantages.

The primary method involves leveraging closures and nested functions. If the objective function is defined within another function, often referred to as the “parent” function, it forms a closure over the variables defined in the parent's scope. This closure allows the objective function to access and, if explicitly designed, modify those variables. Importantly, modifications within the nested function to variables from the parent scope are only maintained if they are explicitly passed out of the objective function, as modifications within the optimization are local to the optimization process unless you explicitly modify shared variables. This approach encapsulates the objective function and associated data nicely within a single context, enhancing code readability and organization.

Another technique involves using global variables, though their use is generally discouraged due to potential conflicts and difficulties in debugging. Declaring a variable as global using the `global` keyword makes it visible in all workspaces; however, relying on global variables for complex applications can lead to unpredictable behavior. The third strategy, particularly valuable when dealing with multiple objective functions or complex data structures, consists of using the `options` structure passed into the optimization solver to transport data. This structure is readily passed to the objective function, which can unpack the needed information.

Here are three illustrative code examples demonstrating different methods of accessing variables outside of an optimization objective function:

**Example 1: Using Closures with Nested Functions**

```matlab
function [solution, fval] = solve_optimization_closure()
  % Parent Function
  initial_param_value = 5;
  other_data = [1 2 3];

  function objective_function(x)
    % Nested Objective Function
    y = x.^2 + initial_param_value + sum(other_data);
    % No direct modification of parent scope variables here
  end

  options = optimoptions('fminunc','Display','iter');
  [solution,fval] = fminunc(@objective_function, 2, options);
end
```
In this example, the `objective_function` is a nested function defined within `solve_optimization_closure`. It forms a closure over `initial_param_value` and `other_data`, allowing it to access those variables directly. Note that modifications to `initial_param_value` within `objective_function` would *not* affect the value in the parent function's workspace; they would only affect it within the scope of the `fminunc` execution and the current iteration of the objective function. This shows how read access of parent scope variables is possible through closures.

**Example 2: Using Global Variables (Demonstrated but not recommended for complex projects)**

```matlab
function solve_optimization_global()
  % Parent Function
  global shared_parameter;
  shared_parameter = 10;

  function objective_function_global(x)
      global shared_parameter;
      y = x.^2 + shared_parameter;
  end

  options = optimoptions('fminunc','Display','iter');
  [solution,fval] = fminunc(@objective_function_global, 2, options);
  disp(['Value of shared_parameter after fminunc: ',num2str(shared_parameter)])
end

```

Here, both the parent and objective function declare `shared_parameter` as global, enabling access within both scopes. The key issue with this approach is demonstrated when examining the final value of `shared_parameter` outside the `fminunc` call. The solver may modify this value internally during the optimization, potentially leading to unexpected state if other parts of the code rely on the initial value. This example showcases the accessibility of globals, however its demonstrated vulnerability to unpredictable changes renders it less useful than other approaches, particularly for complex codebases.

**Example 3: Passing Data via the Options Structure**

```matlab
function [solution, fval] = solve_optimization_options()
    % Parent Function
    data_vector = [1 5 2 8];
    my_extra_data.some_scalar = 2;
    my_extra_data.data = data_vector;
    
    options = optimoptions('fminunc', 'Display', 'iter', 'my_data_struct', my_extra_data);
    
    
    objective_fun = @(x) obj_func_with_options(x,options);
    [solution, fval] = fminunc(objective_fun, 2, options);
end

function y = obj_func_with_options(x,options)
    % Objective function that accesses extra data through the options structure
    my_data = options.my_data_struct;
    y = x.^2 + sum(my_data.data) + my_data.some_scalar;

end
```

In this example, we create a custom structure called `my_extra_data`. We put this structure into the `options` variable which is then passed to the `fminunc` solver. Inside the `obj_func_with_options` function, this structure is accessed through the `options` argument, providing a way to pass additional parameters and data to the objective function. This approach offers a more controlled and flexible way of accessing parameters as they can be explicitly named, nested as desired, and modified without directly affecting variables in the parent scope (other than modifying members of a passed structure), promoting code clarity and reducing the risk of unintended side effects.

For further study and reference, several MATLAB resources can enhance your understanding. The Optimization Toolbox documentation provides a comprehensive overview of `fmincon`, `fminunc`, and other optimization functions, including options specifications. The MathWorks website provides examples and articles on writing efficient objective functions, emphasizing the importance of vectorization and the proper use of function handles. Furthermore, I found the documentation on MATLAB's function handles and closures to be essential for understanding these scoping issues. Experimenting with variations of these examples is also extremely valuable.

In summary, accessing values outside a multistart objective function requires careful consideration of variable scope. Closures via nested functions, while often the best first choice for simple cases, are best when access is read-only. Global variables, though directly accessible, should be avoided in complex scenarios due to their potential for conflict. Passing data through the `options` structure offers the most flexible and reliable approach for complex cases that involve many external parameters or data sets. Through practice, and by referring to MATLAB’s own documentation, these strategies can be employed to build robust and efficient optimization workflows.
