The efficacy of transferring device pointers to arrays into CUDA device memory hinges on understanding the distinction between host-side pointers and device-side pointers.  A common misconception involves attempting direct memory copies using host-side pointers, which are inaccessible to the GPU.  My experience debugging numerous CUDA applications, especially those involving complex data structures and inter-kernel communication, has underscored the crucial role of `cudaMemcpy` with appropriate parameters and the judicious use of `cudaMalloc`.  Failure to adhere to these principles often results in segmentation faults or incorrect computations.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Copying device pointers to arrays into device memory necessitates a two-step process:  first, allocating device memory using `cudaMalloc`, and second, transferring the data from the source device pointer to the newly allocated device memory using `cudaMemcpy`.  Crucially, the source data must already reside in device memory.  Attempting to copy a host pointer directly to device memory will fail.  The key here is that we're not transferring data *from* the host; the data is already on the device. We are simply creating a new copy of the data on the device.

This contrasts sharply with transferring data *from* the host to the device, where `cudaMallocHost` might be involved for pinned memory, or a direct `cudaMemcpy` from host memory to device memory is sufficient if the host memory is appropriately aligned and accessible.

The source device pointer represents the starting address of the array within the device's memory space.  `cudaMemcpy` requires this address along with the size of the data to be copied, the destination device address (obtained from `cudaMalloc`), and the copy kind (which in this case is `cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice`).

Error handling is paramount in this process.  Always check the return value of CUDA functions for errors.  Ignoring error checks can lead to insidious bugs that are difficult to diagnose.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Copying a simple array**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int *dev_ptr_src, *dev_ptr_dst;
    int size = 1024;
    int *host_array = new int[size];

    // Initialize host array (for demonstration purposes)
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        host_array[i] = i;
    }

    // Allocate device memory for the source array.  This is crucial if the source wasn't already allocated in device memory.
    cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_ptr_src, size * sizeof(int));
    cudaMemcpy(dev_ptr_src, host_array, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Allocate device memory for the destination array.
    cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_ptr_dst, size * sizeof(int));

    // Copy from device memory to device memory.
    cudaError_t err = cudaMemcpy(dev_ptr_dst, dev_ptr_src, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error copying memory: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    // ... further CUDA operations using dev_ptr_dst ...

    cudaFree(dev_ptr_src);
    cudaFree(dev_ptr_dst);
    delete[] host_array;
    return 0;
}
```

This example first copies data from the host to the device to obtain `dev_ptr_src`.  The core functionality lies in the `cudaMemcpy(dev_ptr_dst, dev_ptr_src, ..., cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice)` call, demonstrating the copying of data already in device memory.  Remember to always free allocated device memory using `cudaFree`.

**Example 2: Copying a 2D array**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int rows = 100;
    int cols = 200;
    int *dev_ptr_src, *dev_ptr_dst;

    // Allocate device memory for the source and destination 2D arrays.
    cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_ptr_src, rows * cols * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_ptr_dst, rows * cols * sizeof(int));

    // ... Initialize dev_ptr_src (e.g., through another kernel) ...

    // Copy the 2D array from device to device
    cudaError_t err = cudaMemcpy(dev_ptr_dst, dev_ptr_src, rows * cols * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error copying memory: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    // ... further CUDA operations ...

    cudaFree(dev_ptr_src);
    cudaFree(dev_ptr_dst);
    return 0;
}
```

This example highlights the adaptability of `cudaMemcpy` to multi-dimensional arrays. The crucial aspect remains the utilization of `cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice`.  The assumption here is that `dev_ptr_src` was populated by a previous kernel or operation.

**Example 3:  Copying a struct array**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

struct MyStruct {
    int a;
    float b;
};

int main() {
    int size = 1000;
    MyStruct *dev_ptr_src, *dev_ptr_dst;

    cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_ptr_src, size * sizeof(MyStruct));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&dev_ptr_dst, size * sizeof(MyStruct));

    // ... Initialize dev_ptr_src ...

    cudaError_t err = cudaMemcpy(dev_ptr_dst, dev_ptr_src, size * sizeof(MyStruct), cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error copying memory: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    // ... further operations ...

    cudaFree(dev_ptr_src);
    cudaFree(dev_ptr_dst);
    return 0;
}
```

This demonstrates that `cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice` gracefully handles complex data structures.  The size calculation reflects the size of the struct, ensuring correct data transfer.  Again, proper initialization of `dev_ptr_src` before the copy is assumed.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

The CUDA C Programming Guide, the CUDA Best Practices Guide, and the CUDA Toolkit documentation provide comprehensive information on memory management and data transfer within the CUDA framework.  Consulting these resources is essential for robust CUDA development.  Furthermore, understanding the intricacies of memory coalescing and its impact on performance optimization should be a focus for efficient CUDA programming.  Thorough testing with various array sizes and data types is crucial in verifying the correctness and performance of the implemented solutions.
