`tf.tape.gradient()` returning `None` for a numerical function often stems from a disconnect between how TensorFlow graphs are constructed and how numerical operations are handled.  My experience debugging similar issues across large-scale machine learning projects highlights the critical role of automatic differentiation and the limitations it imposes on certain numerical computations.  The core problem frequently lies in the absence of a differentiable path connecting the input variables to the output of your numerical function within the TensorFlow computational graph.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's `tf.GradientTape` utilizes automatic differentiation, specifically reverse-mode automatic differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation), to calculate gradients. This process requires that the computation forming the function be expressible as a composition of differentiable operations understood by TensorFlow.  Many numerical methods, while perfectly valid in a standard numerical context, lack this property. They might involve operations like branching based on numerical conditions (e.g., `if x > 0: ...`), non-differentiable functions (e.g., `numpy.floor`), or external library calls that TensorFlow cannot track.  When `tf.GradientTape` encounters such an operation, it cannot propagate gradients back through it, resulting in a `None` gradient.

Crucially, the problem is not about the function's mathematical differentiability in the traditional calculus sense; rather, it is about the *computational differentiability* within the confines of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation framework.  A function may be perfectly smooth and possess a well-defined gradient everywhere, yet still return `None` from `tf.tape.gradient()` if its internal implementation uses operations incompatible with automatic differentiation.  The `tf.GradientTape`'s ability to track gradients hinges entirely on the symbolic representation of the operations; if TensorFlow cannot represent an operation symbolically, it cannot compute the gradient for it.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Non-differentiable function (numpy.floor)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

x = tf.Variable(3.7)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = np.floor(x)

grad = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(grad)  # Output: None
```

In this example, `np.floor()` is a NumPy function that performs floor rounding.  TensorFlow does not "see" inside the `np.floor()` call; it treats it as a black box. Since it lacks the derivative information for `np.floor()`, the gradient calculation fails, yielding `None`.  To solve this, you would need to replace `np.floor()` with a differentiable TensorFlow equivalent (potentially involving approximation).

**Example 2: Control flow with non-differentiable condition**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    if x > 1:
        y = x**2
    else:
        y = x

grad = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(grad)  # Output: None (or potentially incorrect gradient)
```

Here, the conditional statement introduces a non-differentiable branch.  The gradient calculation is contingent on the branch taken; if the condition changes based on minute variations of `x`, the gradient becomes undefined within the automatic differentiation context. TensorFlow struggles to ascertain the gradient across such discontinuous points.  Approaches like using smooth approximations (e.g., sigmoid function to approximate a step function) might mitigate the issue, albeit at the cost of accuracy.  Another option would be to reformulate the logic to eliminate the conditional branch.


**Example 3:  External library call**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import some_external_library as sel

x = tf.Variable([1.0, 2.0])
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = sel.some_complex_computation(x)  # Assume this function isn't TF-compatible.

grad = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(grad)  # Output: None
```

External library calls, especially those not designed for TensorFlow integration, commonly present problems.  The `tf.GradientTape` lacks visibility into the internal operations of `sel.some_complex_computation()`.  The solution depends heavily on the external library's capabilities.  Ideally, you would find a TensorFlow-compatible equivalent function or use a custom gradient function, explicitly defining the gradient for TensorFlow.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides extensive details on `tf.GradientTape` and automatic differentiation.  Consult the documentation on custom gradients for handling cases where automatic differentiation is insufficient.  Exploring resources on numerical methods and their relation to automatic differentiation can further enhance understanding.  Finally, understanding the mathematical background of gradient descent and backpropagation is crucial for successfully debugging these issues.  Thorough familiarity with the intricacies of TensorFlow graphs and how they are constructed is another necessary component.  This knowledge will help you identify points of non-differentiability within your computational flows.
