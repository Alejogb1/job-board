The successful co-installation of CUDA 10.1 and TensorFlow 2.4 on Ubuntu 18.04 with an RTX 2070 Super hinges on precise driver and library version compatibility.  My experience troubleshooting similar configurations across various projects has highlighted the critical nature of meticulously following the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit installation guidelines, especially regarding driver version alignment.  Failure to do so frequently results in runtime errors or outright installation failures, irrespective of the TensorFlow version.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves several sequential steps, each requiring careful attention to detail.  First, verifying the existing NVIDIA driver is crucial.  CUDA 10.1 has specific driver compatibility requirements; installing an incompatible driver will lead to immediate problems. Next, the CUDA toolkit itself must be installed, followed by cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library), which is a prerequisite for optimal TensorFlow GPU performance. Finally, installing TensorFlow 2.4 with the appropriate CUDA support requires specifying the CUDA path during the installation process.  Incorrectly configuring these steps leads to TensorFlow defaulting to CPU computation, negating the benefits of the RTX 2070 Super.

**Driver Verification and Installation:**

Before proceeding, determining the currently installed NVIDIA driver is paramount.  This can be achieved using the command `nvidia-smi`.  If no NVIDIA driver is detected, or an incompatible version is present, the correct driver must be installed.  NVIDIA provides drivers specifically tailored for various Ubuntu versions and GPU models. Downloading the correct driver from the NVIDIA website and installing it via the provided `.run` file is the recommended approach. Remember to reboot your system after installing the driver to ensure it takes effect. The NVIDIA website provides detailed instructions for this process; consulting their documentation is essential.  For an RTX 2070 Super, a driver version compatible with CUDA 10.1 should be selected.  Note that using the `apt` package manager might install an older version than required.

**CUDA Toolkit Installation:**

Once the correct driver is installed and verified, the CUDA 10.1 toolkit can be installed. This usually involves downloading the appropriate `.run` file from the NVIDIA website, making it executable (`chmod +x cuda_10.1_linux.run`), and running it with the desired installation options.  I've often found that accepting the default installation location is convenient, simplifying later configurations.  During the installation, carefully review the licensing agreements and choose installation options appropriate for your system.  Specifically, ensure that the CUDA libraries are installed in the standard location, usually `/usr/local/cuda`.  Failure to do so can complicate subsequent TensorFlow configuration. Post-installation, verify the CUDA installation using the `nvcc --version` command.

**cuDNN Installation:**

cuDNN is a critical component for accelerating deep learning operations within CUDA.  Download the appropriate cuDNN library version for CUDA 10.1 from the NVIDIA website (requires registration).  This library typically comes as a compressed archive.  Extract the contents to the CUDA installation directory.  For example, if CUDA is installed in `/usr/local/cuda`, you would typically extract the cuDNN files into `/usr/local/cuda`.   You then need to set the environment variables to point to the location of cuDNN.  The necessary environment variables typically include `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `CUDA_PATH`, and `CUDNN_PATH`.  These must be added to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file, depending on your shell.

**TensorFlow 2.4 Installation:**

With CUDA and cuDNN correctly installed, the final step is installing TensorFlow 2.4 with GPU support.  Using `pip` is the standard approach. The crucial aspect is specifying the CUDA version.  Failure to do so will result in a CPU-only installation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Verifying NVIDIA Driver:**

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

This command displays information about your NVIDIA driver and GPU.  Check the driver version to confirm compatibility with CUDA 10.1.  A missing output indicates a lack of an NVIDIA driver.

**Example 2: Setting CUDA Environment Variables (in ~/.bashrc):**

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export CUDA_HOME="/usr/local/cuda"
export CUDNN_HOME="/usr/local/cuda/include" # Adjust this according to the cuDNN installation path.
```

Adding these lines to your `.bashrc` file (and sourcing it using `source ~/.bashrc`) sets the necessary environment variables.  The `CUDNN_HOME` path might need adjustment based on your cuDNN extraction location.  Incorrect paths will prevent TensorFlow from using the GPU.


**Example 3: TensorFlow Installation with CUDA Support:**

```bash
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==2.4.0
```

This command installs TensorFlow 2.4 with GPU support.  The `tensorflow-gpu` package specifically targets GPU installations.  If this command is successful without errors, and the subsequent GPU check (see below) yields positive results, the installation is likely successful.  You can verify that TensorFlow is utilizing the GPU by running the following code in a Python environment:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```

This code snippet will print the number of available GPUs.  A value greater than 0 indicates that TensorFlow has detected and is ready to utilize the GPU.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation.
The NVIDIA cuDNN documentation.
The TensorFlow documentation.
The official Ubuntu 18.04 documentation.

Throughout my career, meticulously following these resources, combined with careful attention to version compatibility, has proven consistently effective in resolving CUDA and TensorFlow installation issues.  Always verify the correct driver version, CUDA version, and cuDNN version alignment to minimize conflicts.  Precisely following the installation instructions provided by NVIDIA and Google is highly recommended.  These steps, applied in the correct order, are the cornerstone of a successful GPU-accelerated TensorFlow environment.
