Email functionality in Spring MVC applications often hinges on correct configuration of the underlying mail server interaction.  My experience troubleshooting this issue over the past decade, particularly within enterprise-level deployments, points to a frequent oversight: inadequate handling of exceptions and insufficient logging during the mail sending process.  The seemingly simple act of sending an email actually involves several layers of potential failure points, from incorrect server credentials to network connectivity problems and even misconfigured mail message structures.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

The typical Spring MVC approach to sending emails leverages the `javax.mail` API or a higher-level abstraction like Spring's `JavaMailSender` interface.  This interface decouples your application logic from the specific mail server implementation.  However, relying solely on this abstraction without proper exception handling and logging can lead to silent failures.  The application might appear to function normally, yet emails remain undelivered, leaving you scratching your head.  The root cause could lie anywhere in the chain:

* **Incorrect Server Configuration:**  The most common issue stems from misconfigured properties.  This includes incorrect SMTP host, port, username, and password.  Furthermore, certain SMTP servers require specific security settings (SSL/TLS) or authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0).  Failing to correctly specify these parameters results in connection failures.

* **Network Connectivity Issues:** A firewall or network configuration might block outgoing connections on the SMTP port (typically 25, 465, or 587).  Furthermore, transient network problems can disrupt the communication mid-process, leading to unpredictable results.

* **Mail Message Formatting Errors:**  Improperly formatted email messages, such as missing headers or invalid encoding, will cause the mail server to reject the message.  This often manifests as a silent failure on the application side without clear error messages.

* **Insufficient Exception Handling:**  The `JavaMailSender` might throw exceptions related to connection failures, authentication problems, or message formatting issues.  Without explicit `try-catch` blocks to handle these exceptions, the application will likely continue execution without alerting you to the email sending failure.

* **Lack of Logging:**  Comprehensive logging is crucial for diagnosing mail sending problems.  Without detailed logs, pinpointing the exact failure point is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.  Logging should include timestamps, exception details, and the email message content (sanitized, of course, for sensitive information).


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate different approaches to sending emails in Spring MVC, focusing on robust exception handling and logging.  I have personally found these patterns to be highly reliable in production environments.

**Example 1: Basic Email Sending with Exception Handling**

```java
@Service
public class EmailService {

    @Autowired
    private JavaMailSender emailSender;

    public void sendEmail(String to, String subject, String body) {
        try {
            SimpleMailMessage message = new SimpleMailMessage();
            message.setTo(to);
            message.setSubject(subject);
            message.setText(body);
            emailSender.send(message);
            log.info("Email sent successfully to: {}", to); // Assuming a logger named 'log' is configured
        } catch (MailException ex) {
            log.error("Failed to send email to {}. Error: {}", to, ex.getMessage(), ex);
            // Consider alternative strategies like queuing the email for retry or alerting system administrators
        }
    }
}
```

This example showcases a fundamental approach. The `try-catch` block effectively handles `MailException` and logs both success and failure scenarios, enabling easier troubleshooting.  The use of a logger (here represented by `log`) is crucial for monitoring email sending activity.  This pattern avoids the pitfall of silent failures.


**Example 2:  Email Sending with Detailed Logging and Attachment Support**

```java
@Service
public class EmailService {

    @Autowired
    private JavaMailSender emailSender;

    public void sendEmailWithAttachment(String to, String subject, String body, String attachmentPath) {
        try {
            MimeMessage message = emailSender.createMimeMessage();
            MimeMessageHelper helper = new MimeMessageHelper(message, true); // true indicates multipart support for attachments
            helper.setTo(to);
            helper.setSubject(subject);
            helper.setText(body, true); // true enables HTML content
            helper.addAttachment("attachment.txt", new File(attachmentPath));
            emailSender.send(message);
            log.info("Email with attachment sent successfully to: {}", to);
        } catch (MessagingException | IOException ex) {
            log.error("Failed to send email with attachment to {}. Error: {}", to, ex.getMessage(), ex);
        }
    }
}
```

This example expands upon the previous one by adding support for email attachments and HTML content.  The `MimeMessageHelper` simplifies the creation of complex emails, but it is essential to handle the potential `MessagingException` and `IOException` that can arise during attachment processing.


**Example 3:  Asynchronous Email Sending using Spring's `@Async` annotation**

```java
@Service
public class EmailService {

    @Autowired
    private JavaMailSender emailSender;

    @Async
    public void sendEmailAsync(String to, String subject, String body) {
        try {
            SimpleMailMessage message = new SimpleMailMessage();
            message.setTo(to);
            message.setSubject(subject);
            message.setText(body);
            emailSender.send(message);
            log.info("Email sent asynchronously to: {}", to);
        } catch (MailException ex) {
            log.error("Failed to send email asynchronously to {}. Error: {}", to, ex.getMessage(), ex);
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates the use of Spring's `@Async` annotation to send emails asynchronously, preventing blocking of the main application thread.  This is particularly important for applications with high email volume.  The core principles of exception handling and logging remain the same.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For in-depth understanding of the `javax.mail` API, I recommend consulting the official Java documentation.  Additionally, explore Spring's documentation on the `JavaMailSender` interface and related classes.  Thorough investigation of your specific mail server's configuration and troubleshooting guides will also be invaluable.  Finally, a solid grasp of Java exception handling and logging best practices is crucial for effectively diagnosing and resolving email sending problems.  Remember to consult your chosen logging framework's documentation for configuration and usage details.  Paying attention to the specific exception messages thrown by the `JavaMailSender` implementation will often provide a crucial clue as to the problem's root cause.
