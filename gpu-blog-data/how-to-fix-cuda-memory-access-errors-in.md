CUDA memory access errors in PyTorch manifest most frequently as `CUDA out of memory` errors, though the underlying cause can be more subtle than simple memory exhaustion.  My experience troubleshooting these issues across several large-scale deep learning projects has highlighted the crucial role of tensor management and asynchronous operations in preventing these errors.  Failing to account for these often results in seemingly random failures, particularly within complex training loops involving multiple GPUs or data loaders.

**1. Understanding the Root Causes:**

The `CUDA out of memory` error isn't always indicative of insufficient GPU memory. PyTorch's automatic memory management, while convenient, can mask inefficient tensor handling.  Several factors contribute to these errors:

* **Unreleased Tensors:**  PyTorch doesn't automatically reclaim GPU memory until the Python objects referencing the tensors are garbage collected.  If tensors are created within loops without explicit deletion using `del` or assigned to variables which persist longer than necessary, memory usage steadily increases, eventually exceeding available resources. This is particularly problematic with large intermediate tensors.

* **Asynchronous Operations:** PyTorch operations, especially those involving data loading and model execution, can be asynchronous.  If subsequent operations attempt to access or modify tensors before prior asynchronous computations complete, unexpected behavior, including memory errors, can arise.  Synchronization is vital for ensuring data consistency and preventing race conditions.

* **Pinned Memory:** The use of pinned memory (`torch.cuda.pin_memory=True`) in data loaders is often recommended to accelerate data transfer to the GPU.  However, overuse or improper management of pinned memory can lead to fragmentation, hindering efficient memory allocation and potentially contributing to out-of-memory situations.

* **GPU Fragmentation:**  Repeated allocation and deallocation of tensors of varying sizes can lead to GPU memory fragmentation. This situation can result in sufficient total free memory existing, yet no contiguous block large enough to accommodate a new tensor.  Manual memory management can alleviate this.


**2.  Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate problematic code patterns and their corrected versions.

**Example 1: Unreleased Intermediate Tensors:**

**Problematic Code:**

```python
import torch

for i in range(1000):
    x = torch.randn(1024, 1024, device='cuda')
    y = torch.matmul(x, x)  # Large intermediate tensor
    z = torch.relu(y)
    # ... further operations using z ...
```

In this loop, `y` is a large intermediate tensor.  If the operations using `z` are computationally intensive,  `y` will consume GPU memory, and its memory might not be freed until the loop completes, exacerbating memory pressure.

**Corrected Code:**

```python
import torch

for i in range(1000):
    x = torch.randn(1024, 1024, device='cuda')
    with torch.no_grad():
      y = torch.matmul(x, x)
      z = torch.relu(y)
      del y # Explicitly release y
    # ... further operations using z ...
    del x
    del z
```

Here, `del y` and `del z` explicitly release the memory occupied by these tensors after they are no longer needed, preventing memory accumulation.


**Example 2:  Asynchronous Data Loading:**

**Problematic Code:**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

dataset = TensorDataset(torch.randn(10000, 100), torch.randn(10000, 1))
data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1000, pin_memory=True)

for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(data_loader):
    data, target = data.cuda(non_blocking=True), target.cuda(non_blocking=True)
    # ... model processing ...
```

Using `non_blocking=True` in `cuda()` allows asynchronous data transfer, but if subsequent operations happen before the data transfer completes, errors can occur.

**Corrected Code:**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

dataset = TensorDataset(torch.randn(10000, 100), torch.randn(10000, 1))
data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1000, pin_memory=True)

for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(data_loader):
    data, target = data.cuda(), target.cuda() # Synchronous transfer
    # ... model processing ...
```

Synchronous data transfer ensures that the data is available on the GPU before processing begins, preventing race conditions.  Consider using smaller batch sizes if synchronous transfer significantly slows down training.


**Example 3:  Improper `torch.empty` Usage:**

**Problematic Code:**

```python
import torch

tensor_list = []
for i in range(100):
    tensor_list.append(torch.empty(1000, 1000, device='cuda'))
    # ... operations on tensor_list[i] ...
```

This code continually allocates new tensors without releasing them. Even if operations on `tensor_list[i]` release memory, the list itself continues to grow in size, consuming memory.

**Corrected Code:**

```python
import torch

for i in range(100):
    with torch.no_grad():
      tensor = torch.empty(1000, 1000, device='cuda')
      # ... operations on tensor ...
      del tensor # Immediately release memory
```

This version immediately releases the memory after operations are complete. Using `torch.no_grad()` is appropriate if gradients aren't needed for this part of the code.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I strongly recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation on CUDA tensors and memory management.  Furthermore, a deep understanding of CUDA programming concepts, particularly memory allocation and synchronization primitives, is invaluable.  Familiarity with memory profiling tools specific to CUDA is also beneficial for diagnosing complex memory issues.  Finally, careful review and understanding of your code's memory usage patterns is paramount; rigorous testing with varying data sizes and complex operations is key to identifying potential bottlenecks.
