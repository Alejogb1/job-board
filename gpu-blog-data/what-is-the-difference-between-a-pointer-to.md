The core distinction between a pointer-to-a-pointer and a pointer-to-a-value, when both are cast to `void*`, lies in the level of indirection and the resulting memory address they represent.  A `void*` obscures the type, but the underlying memory architecture remains unchanged.  This fact became crucial during my work on a high-performance memory allocator for embedded systems, where careful manipulation of pointer types was essential for optimization.  Misunderstanding this subtle difference could lead to segmentation faults or unexpected behavior.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A pointer-to-a-value (`T*`, where `T` is any data type) holds the memory address of a variable of type `T`.  Dereferencing this pointer (`*ptr`) yields the value stored at that address.  Conversely, a pointer-to-a-pointer (`T**`) stores the memory address of another pointer, which, in turn, points to a variable of type `T`.  Double dereferencing (`**ptrptr`) is necessary to access the ultimate value.

Casting either to `void*` removes type information.  The compiler no longer knows what type of data the pointer addresses.  However, the fundamental difference in pointer levels persists: `void*` derived from `T*` represents a direct memory address; `void*` derived from `T**` represents a memory address containing *another* memory address.  Attempting to dereference a `void*` directly is undefined behavior unless explicitly cast back to the original pointer type; this is where the dangers of unchecked casts become evident. My experience with C++ in resource-constrained environments highlighted the importance of understanding this subtle but critical difference.  A single misplaced cast could lead to crashes, especially in systems with limited error handling capabilities.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Pointer to a Value**

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int value = 10;
    int* ptr = &value;  // Pointer to an integer
    void* voidPtr = static_cast<void*>(ptr); // Cast to void*

    // Correct dereferencing after casting back to the original type
    std::cout << "Value: " << *static_cast<int*>(voidPtr) << std::endl; //Output: 10

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a simple pointer-to-value.  Casting to `void*` loses type information, but the crucial step is the safe cast back to `int*` before dereferencing.  Failing to perform this type-safe cast would result in compiler warnings (at best) or runtime errors in stricter compilation environments.


**Example 2: Pointer to a Pointer**

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int value = 10;
    int* ptr = &value;
    int** ptrptr = &ptr; // Pointer to a pointer to an integer
    void* voidPtrPtr = static_cast<void*>(ptrptr); //Cast to void*

    // Correct double dereferencing after casting back to the original type
    std::cout << "Value: " << **static_cast<int**>(voidPtrPtr) << std::endl; //Output: 10
    return 0;
}
```

This example showcases a pointer-to-a-pointer.  The double dereference is essential to reach the original integer value.  Similar to Example 1, the crucial aspect here is the correct cast back to `int**` before any dereference operations.  Directly dereferencing `voidPtrPtr` without the cast would lead to undefined behaviour.  My experience with debugging memory corruption issues emphasized the necessity of meticulous type management, particularly when dealing with multiple levels of indirection.


**Example 3: Illustrating the Difference with `sizeof`**

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int value = 10;
    int* ptr = &value;
    int** ptrptr = &ptr;

    std::cout << "Size of int: " << sizeof(int) << std::endl;          // Typically 4 bytes
    std::cout << "Size of int*: " << sizeof(ptr) << std::endl;        // Typically 8 bytes (64-bit system)
    std::cout << "Size of int**: " << sizeof(ptrptr) << std::endl;    // Typically 8 bytes (64-bit system)
    std::cout << "Size of void*: " << sizeof(static_cast<void*>(ptr)) << std::endl; // Typically 8 bytes
    std::cout << "Size of void*: " << sizeof(static_cast<void*>(ptrptr)) << std::endl; // Typically 8 bytes

    return 0;
}
```

This example, while not directly involving dereferencing, highlights the size difference.  Even though both `ptr` and `ptrptr` cast to `void*` have the same size, they fundamentally represent different memory locations. `ptr` holds the address of an integer; `ptrptr` holds the address of a pointer to an integer.  Understanding this size difference (which may vary depending on the system architecture) is crucial for memory allocation and manipulation. During my work on the aforementioned memory allocator, this understanding helped optimize memory usage and prevent fragmentation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie, "Effective C++" by Scott Meyers, and "More Effective C++" by Scott Meyers are invaluable resources. These books provide in-depth explanations of pointers, memory management, and the intricacies of C and C++.  Studying these resources will greatly enhance understanding of low-level programming concepts and address subtle issues that might arise from working directly with memory addresses and pointers.  Furthermore, a good understanding of assembly language can provide significant insight into how pointers are actually handled at the machine level.  A strong grasp of assembly helps in understanding the impact of casting and dereferencing at a more fundamental level.
