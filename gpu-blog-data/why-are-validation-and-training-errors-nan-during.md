Autoencoder training, particularly when encountering NaN values in both validation and training errors, typically signals a significant problem with numerical stability rather than a failure to learn representational features. In my experience, these NaNs arise when the computations within the network result in floating-point arithmetic inconsistencies, most often due to exploding gradients or division by zero within the loss function. These issues are not necessarily indicative of a flawed architecture, but rather poor hyperparameter choices, or unsuitable loss function implementations.

The primary cause stems from how autoencoders minimize the reconstruction error. The process typically involves backpropagation of the error derivative through the encoder, latent space, and decoder. If the derivatives of activation functions, weights, or intermediate calculations become too large during backward passes, the update applied to the network's weights can push them outside the representable numerical range, ultimately resulting in NaN. This gradient explosion can be further exacerbated when the loss function involves division, creating potential singularities if the denominator approaches zero. Similarly, if weights or intermediate values within the network become arbitrarily large, numerical instabilities can arise, which can propagate, resulting in an error value of Not-a-Number.

For instance, consider a case where you are using a squared-error loss in the original unscaled version, and your network's output is very far from the target input. The squared error, which is the result of (output - target)^2 could have a massive error with gradient values that push the weights in one backward step to a very large value and the next backward step it can go to a very small value, which can easily result in a NaN value due to precision limitations in how floating numbers are handled by the CPU or GPU.

To address this, careful selection of activation functions, regularization techniques, learning rate, and loss functions is needed. Regularization can mitigate the large weight issue described previously. Activation functions with bounded outputs and derivatives (e.g., sigmoid, tanh) are less prone to gradient explosion compared to unbounded functions (e.g., ReLU, without careful handling). Further, limiting weight magnitudes via weight decay or clipping helps prevent them from becoming large in the first place. Finally, a suitable learning rate can also prevent large weight updates that can lead to exploding gradients, because this controls how much each weight is updated per back propagation step. It is also important to ensure the loss function and gradient computations are robust to zero values, because division by zero will certainly result in NaN.

Below are some examples in Python with PyTorch showing how NaNs can arise and some mitigation techniques:

**Example 1: Unstable Loss Function**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleAutoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleAutoencoder, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.decoder = nn.Linear(5, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.encoder(x)
        x = self.decoder(x)
        return x

model = SimpleAutoencoder()
criterion = nn.MSELoss() #Mean squared error
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
inputs = torch.rand(100, 10)
targets = inputs # Autoencoders learn to reconstruct input.

for epoch in range(50):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
    if torch.isnan(loss):
       print("NaN detected. Training stopped.")
       break
```

In this example, the mean squared error loss, while standard, can result in very large loss values in the early stages of training when the output and targets are substantially different, potentially resulting in NaNs. The `inputs` here are random, so the model parameters also start at random, and the reconstructed output initially would be very far from the target. To mitigate this, the inputs and outputs should be scaled to a reasonable range to avoid large loss values from propagating in the backward pass, as shown in the next example.

**Example 2: Data Scaling and Regularization**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleAutoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleAutoencoder, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.decoder = nn.Linear(5, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.tanh(self.encoder(x))  # tanh activation
        x = self.decoder(x)
        return x

model = SimpleAutoencoder()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, weight_decay=1e-5) # Reduced learning rate, weight decay for regularization
inputs = torch.rand(100, 10) * 0.1 #Scaled input
targets = inputs

for epoch in range(50):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
    if torch.isnan(loss):
       print("NaN detected. Training stopped.")
       break
```

This example incorporates several fixes: the input data is scaled to the range 0-0.1, and we use the `tanh` activation function for the encoding, which has outputs bounded by -1 and 1. Additionally, L2 regularization with a `weight_decay` parameter was applied within the optimizer. These changes help keep the gradients bounded and reduce the chance of exploding values in the backward pass, leading to more stable training. The learning rate is also reduced to further control the step size in each backward pass.

**Example 3: Robust Loss Function with Epsilon**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SimpleAutoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleAutoencoder, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.decoder = nn.Linear(5, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.tanh(self.encoder(x))
        x = self.decoder(x)
        return x

model = SimpleAutoencoder()

def robust_loss(output, target, epsilon=1e-7):
    squared_error = (output - target)**2
    return torch.mean(squared_error / (squared_error + epsilon))

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, weight_decay=1e-5)
inputs = torch.rand(100, 10) * 0.1
targets = inputs

for epoch in range(50):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = robust_loss(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
    if torch.isnan(loss):
       print("NaN detected. Training stopped.")
       break
```

This final example employs a custom loss function designed to handle division by zero issues. By adding a small constant `epsilon` to the denominator of the squared error, a potential divide-by-zero error will not occur even if the error is exactly zero. This technique maintains a more numerically stable training process, since it can't directly cause a NaN value via division by zero when an error of zero occurs.

For additional learning, I recommend delving into advanced topics such as gradient clipping, batch normalization, and exploring various optimization algorithms. Resources covering numerical stability in deep learning, practical techniques in neural network training, and the importance of careful hyperparameter tuning will prove invaluable. Further, reviewing theoretical texts on numerical analysis can provide a foundational understanding of the underlying computational limitations and how to mitigate them. Also, look into resources that cover common loss functions and their derivatives, as this knowledge helps in the analysis and debugging of training issues.
