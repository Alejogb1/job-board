The core challenge in animating a rotatable fluffy ball in THREE.js lies not in the rotation itself, which is straightforward, but in efficiently rendering the "fluffy" appearance.  Directly modeling a high-poly sphere with individual strands of fluff would be computationally expensive, leading to performance issues, especially in complex scenes. My experience working on a particle-based fur rendering system for a virtual pet project taught me the efficacy of leveraging shaders and particle systems for this effect.  This approach significantly improves performance compared to purely geometric methods.

**1.  Explanation:  A Shader-Based Approach**

My preferred method for creating the illusion of fluffiness involves a combination of a sphere geometry and a custom fragment shader.  The sphere acts as the base shape, while the shader modifies its appearance to simulate fluffy fibers.  This approach avoids the need for millions of individual polygons. The shader manipulates the surface normal of the sphere, introducing subtle variations that mimic the irregular texture of fur or fluff.  By adjusting shader parameters, we can control the length and density of the "fluff," achieving a range of visual styles.  The rotation is then applied to the sphere geometry itself, easily achieved via THREE.js's built-in rotation methods.


**2. Code Examples**

The following code examples demonstrate different aspects of this implementation.  They are not intended to be directly copy-pasted without adjustments to your specific project structure, but rather to illustrate the key concepts and techniques. Assume necessary THREE.js imports and scene setup are already in place.

**Example 1: Basic Fluffy Sphere**

```javascript
// Geometry
const geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry( 1, 32, 32 );

// Material with custom fragment shader
const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial( {
    uniforms: {
        fluffLength: { value: 0.2 }, // Adjust for fluff length
        fluffDensity: { value: 1.5 }, // Adjust for fluff density
    },
    vertexShader: `
        varying vec3 vNormal;
        void main() {
            vNormal = normalize(normalMatrix * normal);
            gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
        }
    `,
    fragmentShader: `
        varying vec3 vNormal;
        uniform float fluffLength;
        uniform float fluffDensity;

        void main() {
            vec3 perturbedNormal = vNormal + normalize(vec3(0.1 * sin(vNormal.x * fluffDensity), 0.1 * cos(vNormal.y * fluffDensity), 0.0 )) * fluffLength;
            vec3 lightDir = normalize(vec3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0));
            float diffuse = max(dot(perturbedNormal, lightDir), 0.0);
            gl_FragColor = vec4(diffuse, diffuse, diffuse, 1.0);
        }
    `
} );

// Mesh
const fluffyBall = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
scene.add( fluffyBall );


// Animation Loop (example using requestAnimationFrame)
function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame( animate );
    fluffyBall.rotation.y += 0.01; // Rotate the ball
    renderer.render( scene, camera );
}
animate();
```

This example defines a simple shader that perturbs the surface normal based on `fluffLength` and `fluffDensity` parameters.  The perturbed normal is then used to calculate a diffuse lighting effect, giving the sphere a slightly irregular appearance.


**Example 2:  Adding Color Variation**

```javascript
// ... (geometry and uniforms as in Example 1) ...

// Modified fragment shader
const fragmentShader = `
    varying vec3 vNormal;
    uniform float fluffLength;
    uniform float fluffDensity;

    void main() {
        vec3 perturbedNormal = vNormal + normalize(vec3(0.1 * sin(vNormal.x * fluffDensity), 0.1 * cos(vNormal.y * fluffDensity), 0.0 )) * fluffLength;
        vec3 lightDir = normalize(vec3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0));
        float diffuse = max(dot(perturbedNormal, lightDir), 0.0);
        // Add color variation based on normal
        vec3 color = vec3(diffuse + 0.2 * vNormal.x, diffuse + 0.2 * vNormal.y, diffuse + 0.2 * vNormal.z);
        gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
    }
`;

// ... (rest of the code as in Example 1) ...
```

This improved version introduces color variation based on the surface normal, further enhancing the fluffy impression.  Experimentation with different color blending techniques can yield richer results.


**Example 3: Incorporating a Texture**

```javascript
// Load a texture (replace 'fluffyTexture.png' with your texture)
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const fluffTexture = textureLoader.load( 'fluffyTexture.png' );

// Material with texture and custom fragment shader
const material = new THREE.ShaderMaterial( {
    uniforms: {
        fluffLength: { value: 0.2 },
        fluffDensity: { value: 1.5 },
        fluffTexture: { value: fluffTexture }
    },
    vertexShader: `
        varying vec3 vNormal;
        varying vec2 vUv;
        void main() {
            vNormal = normalize(normalMatrix * normal);
            vUv = uv;
            gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
        }
    `,
    fragmentShader: `
        varying vec3 vNormal;
        varying vec2 vUv;
        uniform float fluffLength;
        uniform float fluffDensity;
        uniform sampler2D fluffTexture;

        void main() {
            vec3 perturbedNormal = vNormal + normalize(vec3(0.1 * sin(vNormal.x * fluffDensity), 0.1 * cos(vNormal.y * fluffDensity), 0.0 )) * fluffLength;
            vec3 lightDir = normalize(vec3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0));
            float diffuse = max(dot(perturbedNormal, lightDir), 0.0);
            vec4 textureColor = texture2D( fluffTexture, vUv );
            gl_FragColor = vec4(diffuse * textureColor.rgb, 1.0);
        }
    `
} );

// ... (rest of the code as in Example 1) ...
```

This final example integrates a texture to add even more detail and realism.  The texture can be a simple noise pattern or a more complex image designed to simulate fluffy fibers.  The shader then modulates the final color based on both the perturbed normal and the texture.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further learning and improvement, I would recommend studying advanced shader techniques in GLSL, particularly those related to surface manipulation and noise generation. Explore resources on particle systems for more complex fluff simulations.  Consult the THREE.js documentation thoroughly, focusing on materials, shaders, and animation techniques.  Mastering these concepts will allow you to create increasingly intricate and performant fluffy ball animations.  Understanding the limitations of your hardware and optimizing your code accordingly is crucial for large-scale projects.
