Profiling a signal handler with gprof revealing unexpectedly high CPU consumption often points to a design flaw within the handler itself, rather than inherent inefficiency in the signal handling mechanism.  My experience debugging similar issues across various embedded systems and high-performance computing environments consistently revealed this underlying problem.  The key is understanding that a signal handler executes *synchronously*, interrupting the normal flow of the application, and any operation performed within it directly impacts the overall CPU utilization.

**1. Understanding Signal Handler Execution and Context:**

Signal handlers are invoked asynchronously by the operating system in response to specific events (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGALRM). Crucially, the context in which the handler executes is not guaranteed to be the same as the interrupted process. The handler might be run on a different stack, possess limited access to application-specific data structures, and potentially lack synchronization mechanisms necessary for concurrent access to shared resources. This creates a fertile ground for performance issues if not handled carefully.  I've personally observed instances where improper locking within a signal handler led to deadlocks, significantly increasing CPU usage due to constant context switching and thread contention.  Furthermore, the handler's execution is not preemptible in the same way a regular thread is.  Once it begins, it completes its execution, potentially holding resources longer than intended.

The gprof output highlighting significant CPU time within the handler is likely a direct consequence of one or more of these factors:  Excessive computation within the handler, blocking operations, inefficient memory management, or improper synchronization strategies.

**2. Code Examples Illustrating Common Pitfalls:**

Let's illustrate this with three code examples, each showcasing a potential culprit for high CPU consumption within a signal handler, accompanied by detailed explanations of the problems and their solutions.  The following examples are simplified for illustrative purposes but mirror issues I've encountered in real-world applications.

**Example 1: Excessive Computation:**

```c++
#include <signal.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<long long> largeVector;

void signalHandler(int signal) {
  // Problematic:  Intensive computation within the signal handler
  long long sum = 0;
  for (long long i = 0; i < largeVector.size(); ++i) {
    sum += largeVector[i];
  }
  std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  largeVector.resize(10000000); // Large vector to trigger high CPU usage
  for (long long i = 0; i < largeVector.size(); ++i) {
    largeVector[i] = i;
  }

  signal(SIGINT, signalHandler);
  while (true); // Keep the program running
  return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates the problem of performing extensive computation within the signal handler.  Summing a large vector directly within the handler blocks the main thread's execution and consumes significant CPU cycles.  The solution is to defer the intensive computation to a background thread, signaled by a flag or message queue set within the handler, thus preventing the handler itself from being CPU-intensive.


**Example 2: Blocking Operations:**

```c++
#include <signal.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fstream>

void signalHandler(int signal) {
  // Problematic: Blocking I/O operation
  std::ofstream outputFile("signal_log.txt", std::ios::app);
  outputFile << "Signal received!\n";
  outputFile.close();
}

int main() {
  signal(SIGINT, signalHandler);
  while (true) {
    sleep(1); // Keep the program running
  }
  return 0;
}

```

Here, a blocking file I/O operation is performed inside the signal handler. Writing to a file, especially a slow storage device, can hold up the entire process.  The solution is asynchronous I/O: use non-blocking operations or a dedicated thread to handle the I/O, leaving the signal handler to merely signal the I/O thread and then return quickly.


**Example 3:  Lack of Synchronization (Race Condition):**

```c++
#include <signal.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

std::mutex dataMutex;
int sharedCounter = 0;

void signalHandler(int signal) {
  // Problematic:  Lack of synchronization leads to race conditions
  sharedCounter++;
}

void incrementCounter() {
  while (true) {
    sharedCounter++;
    // Simulate other operations
  }
}

int main() {
  std::thread counterThread(incrementCounter);
  signal(SIGINT, signalHandler);
  while (true);
  counterThread.join();
  return 0;
}
```

This example illustrates the dangers of accessing shared resources without proper synchronization within the signal handler. The signal handler and the `incrementCounter` function concurrently modify `sharedCounter`, leading to a race condition.  The solution is to protect shared resources using appropriate synchronization primitives, like mutexes or atomic operations.  The mutex should be locked both inside the signal handler and the `incrementCounter` function, guaranteeing atomicity of updates to `sharedCounter`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For detailed understanding of signal handling intricacies, I recommend consulting the relevant sections of your operating system's documentation (e.g., `man signal`, `man sigaction`).  Furthermore, a comprehensive text on operating system concepts, including process management and concurrency control, would be invaluable.  Finally, specialized literature on high-performance computing or real-time systems can offer insights into mitigating the impact of signal handling on performance.  Careful study of these resources will be key in diagnosing and resolving similar CPU consumption issues.
