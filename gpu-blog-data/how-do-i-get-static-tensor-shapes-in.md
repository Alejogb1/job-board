TensorFlow's dynamic nature, while offering flexibility, often necessitates knowing the shape of tensors beforehand for optimization and efficient memory allocation.  My experience optimizing large-scale deep learning models consistently highlighted the crucial role of statically defined tensor shapes.  Failure to do so frequently resulted in performance bottlenecks and increased computational overhead, especially in graph-based execution modes.  Achieving static tensor shapes primarily relies on leveraging TensorFlow's shape inference capabilities and employing best practices during tensor creation and manipulation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Static tensor shapes, in the context of TensorFlow, refer to tensors whose dimensions are known and fixed *before* the execution of the computational graph.  This contrasts with dynamic shapes, where the dimensions are determined only during runtime.  Static shapes are advantageous because they enable TensorFlow's optimizer to perform more efficient graph optimizations, such as constant folding and loop unrolling.  They also allow for more effective memory allocation, reducing the risk of memory fragmentation and out-of-memory errors.

Several strategies facilitate obtaining static tensor shapes. The most straightforward approach is to specify the shape explicitly during tensor creation.  This can be achieved using various TensorFlow functions, including `tf.constant`, `tf.zeros`, `tf.ones`, `tf.fill`, and `tf.random.normal`.  These functions accept `shape` arguments, allowing you to define the desired dimensions.

Another effective technique involves utilizing shape inference capabilities intrinsic to TensorFlow operations. Many operations infer the output shape based on the input shapes.  This automatic shape inference works seamlessly provided the input tensor shapes are static.  However, if conditional operations or control flow are involved, shape inference might be hampered, leading to dynamic shapes.  In such scenarios, the `tf.ensure_shape` operation proves valuable in asserting a specific shape, ensuring staticality.  It's crucial to understand that improperly using `tf.ensure_shape` might mask runtime errors, so careful consideration of your model's logic is essential.  Finally, using placeholders with explicitly defined shapes during graph construction also contributes significantly to ensuring static tensor shapes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Explicit Shape Definition**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a tensor with a static shape of (2, 3)
static_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], shape=(2, 3), dtype=tf.int32)

# Verify the shape
print(static_tensor.shape)  # Output: TensorShape([2, 3])
print(static_tensor.shape.as_list()) #Output: [2,3]

#Attempting to reshape to an incompatible shape will result in an error.
try:
    reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(static_tensor,(1,6))
    print(reshaped_tensor)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during reshape:{e}")

```

This example demonstrates the most straightforward method: explicitly defining the shape using the `shape` argument within `tf.constant`. The `shape` argument enforces static shape information.  Any subsequent operation attempting to modify the shape beyond the defined dimensions will raise an error.  This proactive approach avoids runtime surprises.

**Example 2: Shape Inference and `tf.ensure_shape`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Tensor with a dynamically inferred shape
dynamic_tensor = tf.random.normal((2,3))
print(f"Initial Shape {dynamic_tensor.shape}")

#Using tf.ensure_shape to assert shape.
static_tensor = tf.ensure_shape(dynamic_tensor,(2,3))
print(f"Shape after ensure_shape: {static_tensor.shape}")

# Reshape to a compatible shape; shape is still static
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(static_tensor, (3, 2))
print(f"Shape after reshape: {reshaped_tensor.shape}")

#Attempting to reshape to an incompatible shape will result in an error.
try:
    incompatible_reshape = tf.reshape(static_tensor,(1,7))
    print(incompatible_reshape)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during reshape:{e}")
```

This example showcases the utility of `tf.ensure_shape`. While `dynamic_tensor` initially possesses a dynamic shape (inferred from `tf.random.normal`), `tf.ensure_shape` explicitly asserts the shape.  However, it is imperative that the shape assertion accurately reflects the actual tensor shape, otherwise the program might exhibit unexpected behavior.  The example also illustrates how a correctly asserted static shape propagates through subsequent operations, ensuring the overall shape remains static.

**Example 3: Placeholders with Defined Shapes**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a placeholder with a static shape
placeholder_tensor = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10])

# Define a simple operation using the placeholder
output_tensor = placeholder_tensor * 2

#The shape of output_tensor will be known only after feeding data with a specific batch size
#Run with a batch size of 5.
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    input_data = [[1.0] * 10] * 5
    result = sess.run(output_tensor, feed_dict={placeholder_tensor: input_data})
    print(f"Output Tensor Shape : {result.shape}")

```

This code illustrates how to define placeholders with predefined shapes.  Even though `None` is used for the batch dimension, the second dimension is explicitly set to 10, providing static information to the graph.  This allows for partial static shape information which is useful when dealing with variable-sized input batches.  The `None` signifies that the batch size can vary at runtime; however, the other dimensions remain fixed.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on tensor manipulation and graph optimization, are invaluable.  Examining TensorFlow's source code (especially the shape inference logic) provides a deeper understanding.  Books focusing on advanced TensorFlow techniques and performance optimization can be highly beneficial.  Finally, exploring research papers on efficient tensor operations and graph compilation will provide further insights.
