TensorFlow’s "ValueError: Variable d_w1/Adam/... does not exist" typically surfaces during the training or loading of models using optimizers like Adam when the variable being accessed for optimization, in this case related to the weights 'd_w1', has not been created within the TensorFlow graph and scope the optimizer is operating within. This is not a problem with Adam itself, but rather an indication of a mismatch between how the model’s trainable variables are defined and how the optimizer is attempting to update them. Over the course of several deep learning projects, I have found this error arises from a handful of key situations, primarily related to variable initialization, scoping, and issues related to model rebuilding or loading. The error message itself points to the specific variable that cannot be found – in this case, ‘d_w1’ within the Adam optimizer’s scope, which generally means this variable is associated with a weight or bias used during the model's forward or backward pass, and should have been initialized during the creation or loading of the model graph.

The most frequent scenario that generates this error involves improper variable initialization within a custom model class or function, particularly when implementing complex models from scratch or experimenting with advanced techniques involving multiple custom layers or gradients. For example, consider a scenario where you have a model that includes a custom dense layer whose weights are defined but not actually initialized as TensorFlow Variables prior to the optimization step. If the optimizer is called in a scope that refers to this variable, but the variable has not been initialized under the correct scope and within the TF graph, this error will arise. Another facet of initialization issues includes inconsistent use of `tf.Variable` compared to other methods of defining weights. If you accidentally assign weights or biases as regular tensors and not TensorFlow Variables that can be modified via backpropagation and optimization, you’ll also encounter this error. The optimizer needs to know how to access and update these values, and a simple tensor cannot be updated using gradients, nor is it a member of the trainable variables list within the TF Graph.

Another source of this error involves TensorFlow scoping issues. TensorFlow allows naming and organizing operations and variables within scopes, which is especially useful when constructing large models with many components that might have overlapping variable naming conventions. During training, if the optimizer is defined outside of the scope where the variables are actually created or referenced and updated through gradients, TensorFlow will be unable to locate the corresponding variables required to perform weight updates and throw the ‘does not exist’ error. This is particularly common when utilizing higher level abstractions like function decorators for model components, or reusing model sub-components without accounting for variable scope. The problem becomes especially evident when utilizing ‘tf.function’ decorator. Because TF compiles a graph for this function, variables within the uncompiled section of the script are not linked with it until the first instantiation/execution.

The final key scenario, and one I’ve spent a fair amount of time debugging, is related to model loading and/or model rebuilding after defining or changing parameters. When you save a model, TensorFlow stores a checkpoint that includes the graph structure, as well as the weights of trainable variables. When loading this model back in, the saved variables must precisely match what the optimizer expects. If the definition of the model has changed – for instance, if you have renamed layers or introduced new layers since the model was last saved – or if you have not appropriately used names or scopes to save them, you will face the dreaded "ValueError: Variable ... does not exist". Similarly, partially loading weights or mixing weights from different saved files can also lead to these issues since the variables being accessed may not exist in a specific graph being accessed.

To clarify these concepts, let's consider some code examples. First, an example that showcases a lack of explicit variable initialization.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        # Notice: weights are not explicitly initialized as tf.Variable

    def build(self, input_shape):
        w_init = tf.random_normal_initializer()
        self.w = w_init(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units), dtype=tf.float32)
        self.b = tf.zeros(shape=(self.units,), dtype=tf.float32)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    MyCustomLayer(units=5),
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    x = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10))
    y = model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(y)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))  # This will cause the error
```
In the first example above, `MyCustomLayer`'s `w` and `b` attributes, while tensors, aren't tf.Variables. As a result, when the `optimizer` tries to update the gradients, the `apply_gradients` function cannot find these to be trainable weights, which results in the error we're discussing. `build` function, while setting up the correct structure for trainable variables, doesn't allow Tensorflow to recognize these as true variables unless assigned by tf.Variable. The fix for this is to initialize the weights and biases as `tf.Variable` objects using tf.Variable initializer within the `build` method.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        w_init = tf.random_normal_initializer()
        self.w = tf.Variable(initial_value=w_init(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units), dtype=tf.float32), trainable = True)
        self.b = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.zeros(shape=(self.units,), dtype=tf.float32), trainable = True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b


model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    MyCustomLayer(units=5),
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    x = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10))
    y = model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(y)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables)) # This works now
```
By changing the initialization in the above code to use `tf.Variable`, it allows the Tensorflow graph to keep track of these variables in order to perform backpropagation and updates through the `apply_gradients` method call. In this corrected version of `MyCustomLayer`, `w` and `b` are explicitly made TensorFlow Variables, allowing the optimizer to successfully locate and update them during the training process.

Finally, consider an example demonstrating how the loading can lead to mismatch if the model is redefined/modified before loading.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Original model definition
class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', name = 'dense1')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, name = 'dense2')
    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)

model = SimpleModel()
x = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 20))
y = model(x)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_hat = model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(y_hat)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
model.save_weights('my_model_weights')

# Modified model definition - layers are modified here
class ModifiedSimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ModifiedSimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', name = 'dense_1') #Layer named differently
        self.dense_2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, name = 'dense_2')
    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense_1(inputs)
        return self.dense_2(x)

model_loaded = ModifiedSimpleModel()
model_loaded(x)
model_loaded.load_weights('my_model_weights') #This will cause the error when model is used for training
```

In the above example, we define `SimpleModel`, train it, and save the weights. After that, we define `ModifiedSimpleModel` where layer `dense1` was renamed to `dense_1`. When we load the saved weights into `ModifiedSimpleModel`, TensorFlow throws the "ValueError: Variable ... does not exist" since the weight tensor associated with `dense1` isn't available under `dense_1`, which was what `ModifiedSimpleModel` tries to access during the load operation. In this case, the structure of the model is such that it is no longer compatible with the saved checkpoint, resulting in a key error when loading the weight.  This is particularly common when using checkpoint saving using a model trained on an older version or different definition of the model.

To summarize, when this error arises, it’s crucial to scrutinize the variable initialization process, pay close attention to TensorFlow scoping during variable creation, and make sure that if you are loading from a checkpoint, the model definition is consistent, and there are no mismatches in the layer naming. To assist in managing these issues, I recommend studying TensorFlow's official documentation on variable creation, training loops using `tf.GradientTape`, and model saving and loading mechanisms. Textbooks focusing on practical deep learning with TensorFlow and exploring the framework’s advanced features like custom training loops and model subclassing can also be beneficial. Furthermore, online resources that provide advanced TensorFlow usage guides often cover the nuances of variable management and model saving. Careful coding practices, and meticulous attention to detail in your model's structure are key. Through a combination of these resources and meticulous attention to model structure, this error can be avoided.
