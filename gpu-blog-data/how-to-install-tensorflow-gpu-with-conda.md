The successful installation of TensorFlow-GPU using Conda, especially when aiming for consistent behavior across different environments, hinges on careful management of CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorFlow version compatibility. The primary issue stems from TensorFlow's direct dependence on specific versions of these NVIDIA libraries, often leading to import errors or runtime issues if these dependencies are mismatched or not correctly configured within the Conda environment. I've encountered this firsthand while developing several deep learning models for image segmentation, and these experiences have solidified a best-practice approach.

The installation process essentially involves three interconnected steps: creating a dedicated Conda environment, installing the correct NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit, and then installing the matching TensorFlow-GPU package. Isolating the TensorFlow installation within its own Conda environment is crucial; it allows for complete control over the installed library versions, preventing conflicts with other project requirements on the same system. Failing to do so often leads to a 'DLL load failed' error or similar issues where libraries from the base environment conflict with what TensorFlow expects.

The first step, therefore, involves setting up a new environment using the `conda create` command. This command is followed by a name for the environment and a specification for the Python version you intend to use, such as `python=3.10`. For example:

```bash
conda create -n tf-gpu python=3.10
conda activate tf-gpu
```
Here, `tf-gpu` is the chosen name of the Conda environment; this should be reflective of the environment's purpose. Immediately activating the environment, as I do following the environment creation, is best practice for keeping the terminal session focused on the new environment.

The second critical step is ensuring compatible versions of CUDA and cuDNN. The official TensorFlow documentation provides a compatibility matrix detailing which versions of CUDA toolkit and cuDNN are compatible with specific TensorFlow versions. Matching these versions accurately is non-negotiable for a successful installation. I've spent hours troubleshooting issues which, upon investigation, were invariably traced back to a CUDA/cuDNN mismatch. In practical terms, this requires downloading and installing the correct CUDA toolkit from the NVIDIA website, specifically the development toolkit, and then similarly downloading and installing the corresponding cuDNN library. These files are often available as zipped archive files and require careful placement within system library directories, or more ideally, their inclusion in the Conda environment. One method for this is to create a directory within the conda environment called `include` and `lib64`, for include and libraries, respectively, and then extract the files from the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN zip archives into the corresponding directories.

For example, assuming you have extracted both the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN archives into directories within the root project, you would need to copy/move the header files from the CUDA toolkit into the `<conda_env_path>/include`, and the libraries (specifically the *.so* files) to the `<conda_env_path>/lib64`. This may require root access on some systems. Then, ensure that both these paths are registered with the operating system by using the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable and update the environment variables with this path. This step looks like the following command on linux operating systems:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<conda_env_path>/lib64
```
This process is highly dependent on both operating system and CUDA/cuDNN versions. Referencing the detailed NVIDIA installation documentation is necessary for an accurate setup here.

The third step is installing the required TensorFlow-GPU version. It is imperative that the version of TensorFlow installed aligns precisely with the previously installed CUDA and cuDNN versions. The appropriate TensorFlow version can be installed using `pip` while the Conda environment is activated:
```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.10.*
```
This example installs TensorFlow-GPU version 2.10.x, where x can be any micro version within 2.10. This ensures that any bugs or patches are caught. This command forces the use of pip and is preferred over conda for tensorflow installations. It allows the use of older versions as needed for maximum compatibility. In my experience, using `pip` for the actual TensorFlow install proves to be much less prone to version conflicts than relying on Conda. Following the install of tensorflow, it is necessary to install a compatible nvidia toolkit by using the pip command again:
```bash
pip install nvidia-cudnn-cu12
```
This ensures that the necessary CUDNN components are installed and available to tensorflow.

The following snippet highlights a situation with using python to double check library paths and other version requirements:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
print("GPU devices:", tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))

cuda_lib_path = os.environ.get('LD_LIBRARY_PATH')

if cuda_lib_path:
   print("CUDA library path:", cuda_lib_path)
else:
   print("CUDA library path not found.")

print("CUDA version:", tf.sysconfig.get_build_info()['cuda_version'])
print("CuDNN version:", tf.sysconfig.get_build_info()['cudnn_version'])
```
This snippet outputs the TensorFlow version, lists the detected GPU devices, checks for the CUDA library path, and then prints the CUDA and cuDNN versions TensorFlow was built against. Successfully running this and getting a valid output for all elements is necessary to verify a successful installation, however, errors may arise if a mismatch is still present.

Finally, ensure the installation is fully functional by running a simple TensorFlow program which utilizes the GPU, such as training a very basic neural network model. For instance:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Generate some random input data
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=0)
print("GPU execution successfully completed.")
```
Running this code will quickly perform some training steps using the GPU, demonstrating that tensorflow is using the system GPU. An error will arise if tensorflow was unable to connect to the GPU. If no such error arises, and the correct version information is provided, a proper installation was successfully completed.

For further understanding, I strongly recommend consulting NVIDIA's official documentation for CUDA toolkit and cuDNN installation procedures, as these tend to be the most up to date sources. Additionally, the TensorFlow documentation contains compatibility matrices and version-specific installation notes. Finally, exploring online tutorials and examples which go through this step-by-step installation process is a very helpful way to ensure a proper installation.

This detailed approach, based on my real experience, allows for a consistent and stable TensorFlow-GPU environment. It requires meticulous attention to detail regarding version compatibility and correct path management. This methodical process has consistently proven to be reliable in setting up new environments.
