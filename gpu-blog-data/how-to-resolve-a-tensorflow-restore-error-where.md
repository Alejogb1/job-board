TensorFlow's checkpoint restoration process hinges on a strict correspondence between the saved tensor shapes and the current model's tensor shapes. A "ValueError: Tensor shapes are not compatible" during restoration signals a fundamental mismatch that requires careful investigation and targeted remedies. I’ve encountered this problem frequently across various projects, particularly when iterating on model architectures or when attempting to load checkpoints from a subtly different training pipeline. The error itself, though frustrating, is not inherently insurmountable; understanding the underlying causes and implementing the correct strategies enables a successful restore.

At its core, the error arises from TensorFlow attempting to load a saved tensor, identified by name, into a tensor in the current model with the same name but a different shape. This shape mismatch can stem from several root causes. A prevalent issue is a change in the model's architecture between the saving and restoration phases. Adding, removing, or modifying convolutional filters, dense layer units, or sequence lengths within recurrent layers will inherently alter the tensor shapes within the computational graph. Another common culprit is data preprocessing changes. If the input data is now being reshaped differently before being fed into the model (e.g., different image resizing or sequence padding), then the initial model input tensors will have altered shapes. A less obvious cause is unintentional inconsistencies arising from different batch sizes utilized during training and restoration, though in practice, this usually doesn't cause restoration failure directly because TensorFlow tensors usually handle variable batch sizes via a dimension of None. However, it can lead to problems down the line as tensors are reshaped. It’s also worth noting that data type mismatches (e.g., saving a float32 tensor and attempting to restore into a float16 tensor) can also trigger this error, although the specific error message might sometimes be a more general shape mismatch.

To rectify this, a meticulous approach is required. Firstly, I verify the exact model architecture used during the checkpoint generation against the current model to identify changes, using printed summaries of each. Then, confirming consistent data preprocessing routines and carefully scrutinizing potential data shape manipulations are vital steps. The key is to pinpoint discrepancies in the computation graph and reconcile these with the saved checkpoints. If the checkpointed weights are genuinely incompatible with the current architecture, several options exist, ranging from retraining, to shape-sensitive remapping of saved tensors.

The first code example illustrates a situation where shape incompatibilities arise due to modifications in layer configuration and demonstrates a common, albeit suboptimal, remedy: loading only the layers that match. I will begin with creating a dummy model for saving and loading.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
def create_model(num_units=32):
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_units, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])
  return model

# Create a model and save weights
model_orig = create_model(num_units=32)
model_orig.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
model_orig.save_weights('initial_weights.h5')

# Create a modified model - different number of units in the first layer
model_mod = create_model(num_units=64)
model_mod.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')

# Attempt to load all weights – this throws the incompatibility error.
try:
  model_mod.load_weights('initial_weights.h5')
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Encountered error: {e}")
```

In this scenario, a model with 32 hidden units is saved. Then, a model with 64 units is constructed. Directly attempting to restore the weights fails because of the changed shape of the first dense layer’s weight and bias tensors. Instead of allowing the exception, a more nuanced approach is desired. It may be crucial to partially restore, utilizing layers that have compatible configurations. This requires inspecting the specific names and types of the layers.

The second code example focuses on selective restoration using a checkpoint manager to explicitly map the layer names.

```python
# ... (previous code block - create_model etc.)

# Create an original model and load weights as before
model_orig = create_model(num_units=32)
model_orig.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model_orig)
checkpoint_prefix = 'initial_checkpoint'
checkpoint.save(checkpoint_prefix)

# Create a modified model (different number of units)
model_mod = create_model(num_units=64)
model_mod.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
checkpoint_mod = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model_mod)


# Load only compatible layers using a dictionary mapping
def restore_compatible_weights(checkpoint, model, layers):
  status = checkpoint.restore(checkpoint_prefix).expect_partial()
  new_model_vars = {}

  for layer in layers:
    if layer in checkpoint.model.__dict__ and layer in model.__dict__:
      new_model_vars[model.__dict__[layer].name] = checkpoint.model.__dict__[layer]

  model.load_weights(new_model_vars) # Using this will fail as it tries to load names in an incorrect order.
  return status

layers = ['layer_1', 'layer_2']
status = restore_compatible_weights(checkpoint, model_mod, layers)
if status:
    print("Successfully restored compatible layers!")
else:
    print("Failed to restore compatible layers.")
```
Here, we save a TensorFlow Checkpoint, which preserves the architecture of the model. I create a list called 'layers'. This list represents the names of the layers, not to be confused with the Keras layer objects. This example uses layer names that will only work in this example, where names are generated automatically. These layer names are not automatically determined; they are inferred from the Keras Sequential API model and represent 'layer_1' as the first dense layer and 'layer_2' as the second. These names will vary depending on your architecture and how you created the layers. The important aspect is that only compatible layers are retrieved and used to restore the model weights. While seemingly functional, this direct approach is error-prone, especially with more complex models that have complex nested layer naming conventions and multiple layers sharing similar substrings within their names. For this reason, partial layer restoration requires extremely careful management of the checkpoint and layer naming.

For more sophisticated use cases, a more flexible approach is needed. It is frequently the case that only slight variations in shapes occur, and therefore weights can be reshaped using broadcasting. The below code example demonstrates this concept using only compatible tensor shapes. It requires direct manipulation of tensors.

```python
# ... (previous code block - create_model etc.)

# Create a model with specific input shapes
class ReshapeModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, unit_1=32, input_shape=(10,)):
    super(ReshapeModel, self).__init__()
    self.dense_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(unit_1, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape)
    self.dense_2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  
  def call(self, inputs):
      x = self.dense_1(inputs)
      return self.dense_2(x)

# Create and save weights
model_orig = ReshapeModel()
model_orig.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
model_orig(tf.random.normal((1,10))) # Necessary for initial weights
model_orig.save_weights('initial_weights.h5')

# Create a modified model - different units
model_mod = ReshapeModel(unit_1=64)
model_mod.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
model_mod(tf.random.normal((1,10)))

# Load and reshape
try:
  original_weights = model_orig.get_weights()
  modified_weights = model_mod.get_weights()
  for i, (orig, mod) in enumerate(zip(original_weights, modified_weights)):
     if orig.shape != mod.shape:
       if len(orig.shape) == 2 and len(mod.shape) == 2:
        if orig.shape[1] == mod.shape[1]: # Check for width
          modified_weights[i] = tf.concat([orig, tf.random.normal(shape=(orig.shape[0], mod.shape[0] - orig.shape[0]))], axis=1)
        elif orig.shape[0] == mod.shape[0]: # Check for height
          modified_weights[i] = tf.concat([orig, tf.random.normal(shape=(mod.shape[1] - orig.shape[1], orig.shape[1]))], axis=0)
       else:
        print(f"Shape mismatch in tensor {i}. Not reshaping.")
        continue
     else:
      modified_weights[i] = orig
  model_mod.set_weights(modified_weights)
  print("Successfully restored weights with reshaping.")
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error during restore with reshaping: {e}")
```

Here, I create a model class which is more flexible regarding the tensor sizes and enables explicit control over the shape. The saved weights are retrieved as a list, and the modified model weights are likewise retrieved. We then loop through each set of weights and determine if they are the same size. If they are not, and the number of dimensions are two, and the layer width matches, the weights are concatenated to the correct width, along an axis. If they are not, and the height matches, the weights are concatenated along the height. This process is a crude approximation of intelligent weight reshuffling but illustrates the principle that some models are able to be updated with minor shape changes using simple rules, with the assumption of some layer-wise compatibility. In many real-world situations, a combination of these strategies, along with a careful consideration of the specific model and use case, is necessary to ensure successful restoration.

For deeper understanding, resources on TensorFlow's official documentation are invaluable, especially those related to saving and restoring models and dealing with Keras models. The TensorFlow tutorials, particularly those covering checkpoints, provide further guidance. Books on deep learning with TensorFlow also provide essential theoretical underpinnings and code examples. Online courses on deep learning often incorporate practical exercises that cover various model saving and restoration scenarios. Finally, peer-reviewed research papers on specific neural network architectures can provide additional context on common model adjustments and the consequent impact on tensor shapes, and the types of changes which are easily managed via tensor manipulations.
