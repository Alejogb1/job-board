Accessing the underlying value of a TensorFlow variable requires careful consideration of its lifecycle and the computational graph context. A TensorFlow variable is not a direct Python numeric or array entity; instead, it's a node within the TensorFlow computational graph that holds a mutable tensor. Direct access, in the way one might expect with a standard Python variable, is not how TensorFlow is designed to operate.

The primary method for retrieving a variable's current value is through the `numpy()` method on the variable object, but this action is only valid when the variable's value has been explicitly computed within a TensorFlow session or its more modern equivalent, eager execution mode. In graph execution mode, which predates eager execution, the value of a variable is only determined when running a TensorFlow operation, often as part of a larger computational process. Calling `numpy()` directly on a variable in graph mode before the computation has been performed will not yield its numerical value. Instead, it will result in an exception, signaling that the computation has not yet been executed.

My experience developing custom training pipelines for image classification models has given me a deep understanding of this distinction. I recall initially trying to debug an issue where a loss value was not updating as expected. The problem traced back to a misunderstanding of the graph execution process and when exactly the variable containing the loss held a calculable value. This involved carefully inspecting when a variable was initialized, and when its value was actually computed by the loss function. The mistake was trying to access the numeric value before TensorFlow had actually executed the loss calculation operation, resulting in trying to retrieve a non-existent value.

With the advent of eager execution in TensorFlow 2.x, interacting with variable values becomes more intuitive. Eager execution operates like standard Python code. Operations are executed immediately, and variable values are updated immediately. `numpy()` can be readily called to view the current value. This made debugging substantially more straightforward during my work on an anomaly detection system for network traffic, where real-time insights into variable changes were crucial.

However, even in eager execution, awareness of when the variable value is actually updated remains important. Operations that affect the variable are themselves also executed eagerly. If a variable update is enclosed in a function, the updates occur only when that function is called. The variable value will not magically update by simply defining the update operation, just like in regular imperative programming.

Below are three code examples demonstrating various scenarios along with detailed commentary:

**Example 1: Retrieving a variable's value in eager execution mode**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True) # Ensure eager execution

# Create a TensorFlow variable with an initial value
my_var = tf.Variable(initial_value=10.0, dtype=tf.float32)

# Print the current value
print(f"Initial Value: {my_var.numpy()}")

# Define a computation that modifies the variable value
my_var.assign_add(5.0)

# Print the updated value
print(f"Updated Value: {my_var.numpy()}")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the typical workflow in eager execution. The `run_functions_eagerly(True)` setting is included for clarity, although it’s the default in TensorFlow 2.x and beyond. We create a `tf.Variable` with an initial value. The key is that, with eager execution enabled, we can call `numpy()` on `my_var` immediately after initialization to retrieve its initial numerical value. Later, after we perform the `assign_add` operation, we can access its updated value using `numpy()` again. Notice that we do not need to perform any specific 'running' operations here, as TensorFlow executes the operations immediately. This mode of usage facilitates an intuitive and iterative approach to working with TensorFlow variables.

**Example 2: Retrieving a variable's value in a function with `tf.function` decorator**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a TensorFlow variable with an initial value
my_var = tf.Variable(initial_value=2.0, dtype=tf.float32)

@tf.function
def update_variable(var):
    var.assign_add(1.0)
    return var

# Print the initial value
print(f"Initial value: {my_var.numpy()}")

# Call the function to update the value
updated_var = update_variable(my_var)

# Print the updated value
print(f"Updated value: {updated_var.numpy()}")
```

*Commentary:* In this example, we introduce the `tf.function` decorator. This converts the `update_variable` function into a graph representation. The key point to note here is that although eager execution is enabled by default, the function `update_variable` is compiled by TensorFlow and optimized as a graph computation during the first call. The `numpy()` call following the `updated_var` call still produces the expected value, demonstrating that `tf.function` operates seamlessly when using variables. However, it’s important to remember that the computation now exists within a compiled function. If you were to call `update_variable` inside a loop, for example, there would be compilation only on the first loop instance.

**Example 3: Demonstrating value access in a basic model with a custom gradient**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a variable with an initial value
weights = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.random.normal(shape=(1,1)), dtype=tf.float32)

@tf.function
def loss_function(weights):
    return tf.reduce_sum(weights * weights) # Simple sum of squares loss

@tf.function
def custom_gradient_step(weights, learning_rate=0.1):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        loss = loss_function(weights)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, weights)
    weights.assign_sub(learning_rate*grads)
    return weights

# Initialize and print the weights value
print(f"Initial weights: {weights.numpy()}")
for i in range(5):
    updated_weights = custom_gradient_step(weights)
    print(f"Weights after step {i+1}: {updated_weights.numpy()}")
```

*Commentary:* This final example illustrates a scenario involving gradient descent. We define a loss function using a variable which represents weights in a model. We then define a function that takes a gradient step based on the calculated loss gradient using `tf.GradientTape`. Crucially, within the training loop, we call `numpy()` on `updated_weights` after each step to observe the weights being updated as gradient descent proceeds. This highlights that even within an optimization routine, accessing the value of a variable requires invoking `numpy()` on the variable itself after the computation has been executed, regardless of whether eager execution or graph execution is used.

For further study of TensorFlow variables and execution, I would recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation concerning variables and eager execution. Look for tutorials focused on implementing custom training loops using `tf.GradientTape` and functions with `tf.function` as these will provide practical insights on when values of variables are updated and accessible. Additionally, delving into the source code of common TensorFlow modules and models will illuminate how these techniques are used in practical machine learning applications.
