The core reason Python functions become inaccessible after import from a different folder lies in Python’s module import mechanism and its interaction with the system’s file path configurations. Essentially, the Python interpreter needs to know *where* to look for the module (Python file) you're trying to import. If the directory containing your target module isn't on Python’s import search path, a `ModuleNotFoundError` will be raised, or if it is found but the intended functions weren't exported, then a `AttributeError` will appear. I've dealt with this extensively in past projects, particularly when structuring larger applications with modules in various subdirectories.

The Python interpreter, upon encountering an `import` statement, searches a predetermined list of directories to locate the requested module. This search path is dynamically configured and can be examined using `sys.path`. This list, initialized at startup, is influenced by factors including the current working directory, installation directories for Python packages, and environment variables. If your module is in a directory not included within this list, Python simply can't "find" it, making its functions and other attributes effectively inaccessible during the import process.

The critical element here is understanding that placing a `.py` file in a folder *does not automatically make it an importable module*. You must either add the module's directory to `sys.path` or structure your application as a package by including an `__init__.py` file in the module's directory, which explicitly tells Python that the directory should be treated as a package. Moreover, even when the package or module is found, specific functions must be properly defined and not intended for only local scope within the imported module.

Let’s explore this with code examples. Suppose we have the following file structure:

```
project/
    main.py
    modules/
        my_module.py
```

First, let's define the content of `my_module.py`:

```python
# modules/my_module.py

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def _internal_function(x):
    return x * 2

class UtilityClass():
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    
    def get_value(self):
        return self.value
```

Here, we define a simple `greet` function, an internal function `_internal_function` (with leading underscore by convention), and `UtilityClass`. Now consider `main.py`:

**Example 1: Failed Import**

```python
# main.py
import sys
print(f"Initial sys.path: {sys.path}")

import my_module
print(my_module.greet("World"))
```

Running this code directly from the project root (`python main.py`) will produce a `ModuleNotFoundError` because the `modules` directory isn't part of the standard `sys.path`. The output will begin by listing `sys.path`, and then the interpreter will crash before ever trying to call `greet` from `my_module`. This clearly illustrates the core problem: Python is unable to locate `my_module.py`.

**Example 2: Adding to `sys.path`**

To resolve this, we can dynamically add the `modules` directory to `sys.path` before importing. The modified `main.py` is below.

```python
# main.py
import sys
import os

print(f"Initial sys.path: {sys.path}")

# Get the absolute path of the 'modules' directory
modules_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "modules")
# Add this directory to sys.path
sys.path.append(modules_dir)

print(f"Modified sys.path: {sys.path}")

import my_module

print(my_module.greet("World"))

try:
    print(my_module._internal_function(5))
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

my_instance = my_module.UtilityClass(10)
print(my_instance.get_value())
```

In this version, I've added a line to get the absolute path of 'modules' and then append this to `sys.path`. Now, `import my_module` will succeed. Subsequently, calling `my_module.greet` returns as expected. Additionally, I tried to use `_internal_function` (which was defined with a leading underscore, making it conventionally internal), which causes a failure.  I also successfully imported and used `UtilityClass`.  This example underscores that modules must be explicitly placed on the import path *and* have the desired exported members defined (i.e., not intended as only local members of the module). It also illustrates the convention of using leading underscores to mark items as internal to the module.  The `try...except` block is essential for robust error handling when making use of external packages.

**Example 3: Using Packages (with `__init__.py`)**

A more structured approach to handling modules is by transforming the `modules` directory into a package. This is achieved by creating an empty `__init__.py` file within the `modules` folder:

```
project/
    main.py
    modules/
        __init__.py
        my_module.py
```

Now, we can import directly using the package path `modules.my_module`.  The modified `main.py` is below.
```python
# main.py
import sys
print(f"Initial sys.path: {sys.path}")

import modules.my_module as mm #or "from modules import my_module"
# If doing "from modules import *", then __all__ will control which items are imported.

print(mm.greet("World"))

try:
    print(mm._internal_function(5))
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

my_instance = mm.UtilityClass(10)
print(my_instance.get_value())
```
This approach simplifies the import process and keeps related modules grouped logically, without the need to directly manipulate `sys.path`. Importantly, `__init__.py` does not have to be empty; it can contain code to perform initialization of the package, if needed. Again, the internal member `_internal_function` is inaccessible through normal means, and `UtilityClass` is readily accessible.

In summary, accessibility of Python functions from different folders is not a magical, automatic occurrence but a direct consequence of Python’s module import mechanism and path configuration. Understanding and managing `sys.path`, or using packages with `__init__.py`, are fundamental practices for effectively building multi-file projects.

To further your understanding, I recommend reading documentation regarding module imports, package structures, and the `sys` module. Experiment with different file structures and import methods to solidify these concepts. Further exploration of PYTHONPATH environment variable, and using tools like `python -m <package>.<module>` will be useful as well.  Additionally, delve into the concept of namespace packages, which offer advanced control over module locations. A careful examination of `__all__` within a module's `__init__.py` file, and of using `__name__` can give more control over modules. While these ideas may seem slightly complex, a grasp of the foundations described above will be key.  Finally, learning how to create and distribute your Python packages will round out your understanding of Python module and package management.
