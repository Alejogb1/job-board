CUDA kernels, specifically those exhibiting multi-threaded execution, can indeed suffer performance degradation from write operations, even when seemingly inconsequential to the ultimate computational result. This inefficiency stems from the fundamental architecture of GPU memory and the mechanisms governing inter-thread communication and synchronization. I've observed this in practice numerous times while optimizing high-throughput numerical simulations and image processing pipelines.

The core issue lies in the fact that writes, regardless of whether they ultimately affect the final output, still consume memory bandwidth and trigger internal coherency mechanisms. These mechanisms ensure that different threads have a consistent view of the memory space, especially when multiple threads access the same locations. Even a write to a variable that will be overwritten later in the same kernel invocation can force unnecessary stalls and memory traffic. When a thread performs a write, the GPU's memory controller must coordinate this operation. If other threads are also accessing nearby locations, the system might need to serialize those memory accesses. Additionally, if multiple threads write to the same location, even if the final write overwrites all preceding values, the GPU hardware might not be intelligent enough to optimize away the prior operations without relying on explicit synchronization. This leads to a cascade of performance hits, including increased latency, decreased effective bandwidth, and wasted resources.

Furthermore, the impact of these superfluous writes can be exacerbated by the type of memory being targeted. Writes to global memory, which is generally accessed through the DRAM interface, have the highest cost in terms of latency and bandwidth. Shared memory, located within each streaming multiprocessor (SM), is much faster but has a limited capacity, potentially leading to resource contention if many threads within a block are performing unnecessary writes. Constant memory and texture memory are optimized for specific access patterns and would not generally be the targets of such writes.

To illustrate these performance penalties and mitigation strategies, let's explore some code examples.

**Example 1: A Suboptimal Kernel with Unnecessary Writes**

Consider a simple reduction operation, where we wish to sum all elements of an array. Below is a CUDA kernel attempting this reduction where the reduction value for each block is stored in a global array even if it will be updated later. This will not actually calculate the sum, it simply illustrates the problem of unnecessary writing.

```cpp
__global__ void suboptimal_reduction(float* input, float* output, int size) {
    int global_idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if(global_idx >= size) return;
    __shared__ float shared_data[256];

    int local_idx = threadIdx.x;
    shared_data[local_idx] = input[global_idx];
    __syncthreads();

    for(int stride = blockDim.x/2; stride > 0; stride/=2){
        if(local_idx < stride){
             shared_data[local_idx] += shared_data[local_idx + stride];
            
           //Unnecessary global write, will be overwritten later
             output[blockIdx.x] = shared_data[local_idx];
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }

    //This is where output is finally properly written
   if(local_idx == 0)
      output[blockIdx.x] = shared_data[0];
}
```
Here, the line `output[blockIdx.x] = shared_data[local_idx];` within the reduction loop is an unnecessary write. Only the final result of the reduction in each block should be written to the output array, done by thread 0 at the very end of the kernel execution. In this example, multiple threads will potentially write to the same location within the output array while the result is still being computed. These intermediate writes cause unnecessary memory traffic. Even if the compiler could detect that the output write will always be overwritten, it must still ensure memory coherency for such writes in general cases, therefore incurring performance penalties.

**Example 2: An Optimized Kernel with Minimal Writes**

Let's modify the previous kernel to avoid the unnecessary writes and demonstrate how much of a performance boost it provides.

```cpp
__global__ void optimized_reduction(float* input, float* output, int size) {
   int global_idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if(global_idx >= size) return;

    __shared__ float shared_data[256];
    int local_idx = threadIdx.x;
    shared_data[local_idx] = input[global_idx];
    __syncthreads();


    for(int stride = blockDim.x/2; stride > 0; stride/=2){
         if(local_idx < stride){
           shared_data[local_idx] += shared_data[local_idx+stride];
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }

   //Only write once, after final reduction of thread block is complete
   if(local_idx == 0){
     output[blockIdx.x] = shared_data[0];
   }
}
```

In this optimized version, the line responsible for writing to `output` is only executed once per block, by thread 0. The intermediate writes from the previous version are removed. This reduces the number of writes, decreasing the memory bandwidth required and improving performance. The removal of these intermediary writes avoids the potential for stalls related to the memory system's coherency mechanisms. This seemingly minor change can have a significant positive impact, especially for large datasets. This will not only improve throughput but also decrease energy consumption which is also relevant for many modern applications.

**Example 3: Demonstrating the Impact of Conditionals**

Consider a situation where writes are gated by conditionals. Even if the conditional often evaluates to false, the presence of the conditional can introduce performance penalties due to branching and memory access patterns. Below we will look at how writing to a memory location due to a conditional impacts performance.

```cpp
__global__ void conditional_write_kernel(float* input, float* output, int size) {
    int global_idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (global_idx >= size) return;

    float temp = input[global_idx] * 2.0f;
    // Conditional write.
    if (temp > 10.0f) {
        output[global_idx] = temp;
    }
    else{
        output[global_idx] = 0;
    }
}

```
In the kernel above, even if the condition `temp > 10.0f` is infrequently true (in the case of most of the input data being a value less than 5), the conditional branch has introduced an impact. Additionally, because the write to the `output` array is only triggered by this conditional, not all threads will perform a write, creating different memory access patterns which again, affect memory throughput negatively and thus performance.

While conditional logic is often necessary in many algorithms, the pattern demonstrated here, where the conditionally triggered write operation can be optimized in a separate kernel, to improve overall performance. This can be done by filtering the input array and running the calculation and write operation on only the elements that pass the filter. This reduces the number of operations performed by the kernel and creates a more consistent access pattern for memory, thus resulting in faster performance.

In summary, the inefficiency of unnecessary writes in CUDA multi-threaded kernels is a complex issue linked to memory architecture and coherency requirements. While compiler optimizations can sometimes mitigate the issue, it is often the responsibility of the programmer to avoid such situations. Removing or minimizing write operations will yield better performance by reducing the amount of memory traffic and reducing the workload on memory controller and cache coherency subsystems. Performance gains can be achieved by optimizing the algorithmic approach to minimize the necessity of these writes or to re-arrange calculations so that writes are batched or performed only when they are necessary. The conditional write example also demonstrates the importance of access patterns in memory accesses and how an alternative implementation with consistent access patterns can yield higher performance.

For those seeking deeper understanding of these concepts, I would recommend exploring the CUDA programming guide from NVIDIA, which details the nuances of memory management and synchronization primitives. Further resources would be literature from the scientific computing domain, that often tackles these performance issues due to the compute intensive nature of those programs. Finally, benchmarks and profilers, like NVIDIA Nsight, are extremely valuable when optimizing real world applications. These tools can accurately measure memory throughput and allow the identification of memory access and bottlenecks with real-world implementations, aiding in informed optimization.
