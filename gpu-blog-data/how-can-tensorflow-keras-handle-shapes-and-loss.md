Multi-label classification, where an input can be associated with multiple categories simultaneously, presents unique challenges to traditional single-label classification setups in deep learning.  I’ve personally grappled with these intricacies over numerous projects, and a deep understanding of how TensorFlow’s Keras API handles shapes and custom loss functions is crucial for successful implementation. In multi-label classification, the output is represented as a binary vector where each position corresponds to a class. A value of '1' indicates the presence of that class, while '0' indicates its absence.

The primary difference in model output shapes arises from the shift from single-label one-hot encoding to a multi-label binary encoding. For a single-label classification problem with, say, 5 classes, the output would often be a single vector of length 5 where only one element is '1'. Conversely, for multi-label with the same 5 classes, the output becomes a vector of length 5, where *any* number of elements can be '1', representing the combination of classes associated with the input. This difference dictates the choice of activation functions and loss functions. Instead of a `softmax` function which outputs a probability distribution over mutually exclusive categories, we transition to a `sigmoid` function. This sigmoid function is applied independently to each output neuron, producing a probability for each class. Each of these probabilities operates independently of others, allowing for concurrent presence of multiple class labels. The loss functions must also be tailored to reflect this. Instead of cross-entropy, which assumes only one correct class, binary cross-entropy is typically used on a per-class basis, summing or averaging across all labels to yield an aggregate loss.

Consider a simple use-case. Let’s say we're building a tagging system for images, and each image can have multiple tags like "dog," "cat," "house," "tree," or "sky." Here is a basic Keras model showcasing this setup:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

num_classes = 5  # "dog", "cat", "house", "tree", "sky"

model = models.Sequential([
  layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
  layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
  layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  layers.Flatten(),
  layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='sigmoid') #Sigmoid for multi-label
])


model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy', #Binary cross-entropy loss
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#Dummy Data for testing purposes
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand(100,64,64,3)
y_train = np.random.randint(0,2,size=(100,num_classes))
x_test = np.random.rand(20,64,64,3)
y_test = np.random.randint(0,2,size=(20,num_classes))

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_test,y_test))

```

In this first example, the final `Dense` layer uses a `sigmoid` activation for each of the 5 output neurons which represent the probabilities of each of the five potential labels. The compilation step explicitly sets the loss function to `'binary_crossentropy'`, which is correct because it treats each class as an independent binary classification problem, aligning with our definition of multi-label classification. The input shape is set to (64,64,3) representing an image. Dummy data using numpy random methods is created to showcase fitting and evaluation of the model. This method, I've found, is often necessary to rapidly iterate while experimenting with architecture choices.

However, sometimes you'll need to weigh certain labels more than others, for example, if some are more crucial for your application or more infrequent in the training dataset. In this scenario, implementing a weighted binary cross-entropy loss is helpful. Here’s how it can be achieved:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

num_classes = 5  # "dog", "cat", "house", "tree", "sky"

def weighted_binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, weights):
    y_true = K.cast(y_true, y_pred.dtype)
    loss = K.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
    weighted_loss = loss * weights
    return K.mean(weighted_loss)

def weighted_loss_wrapper(weights):
    def loss_function(y_true,y_pred):
        return weighted_binary_crossentropy(y_true,y_pred,weights)
    return loss_function

model = models.Sequential([
  layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
  layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
  layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  layers.Flatten(),
  layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='sigmoid') #Sigmoid for multi-label
])


class_weights= tf.constant([1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 1.5])
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=weighted_loss_wrapper(class_weights), #Weighted loss
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#Dummy Data for testing purposes
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand(100,64,64,3)
y_train = np.random.randint(0,2,size=(100,num_classes))
x_test = np.random.rand(20,64,64,3)
y_test = np.random.randint(0,2,size=(20,num_classes))

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_test,y_test))
```

In this second example, I've wrapped the raw binary cross-entropy calculation inside a new function `weighted_binary_crossentropy`. This function takes in `y_true`, `y_pred` and an additional `weights` parameter. The weights are then multiplied on a per-label basis allowing for the loss to be more heavily impacted by certain labels. The `weighted_loss_wrapper` is used to pass the class weights as a hyperparameter for our custom loss function. The core idea behind this is to give more weight to the under-represented class, effectively balancing the model’s learning. Class weights were defined as a tensor using `tf.constant`. This setup allows for customized weighting schemes that can be critical in real-world, often unbalanced, datasets. I've often encountered scenarios where this kind of weighting strategy was the difference between a usable model and a poorly performing one.

Additionally, handling non-binary labels can present different challenges. In some cases, labels might not be strictly binary but can be ordinal or continuous within a range. For instance, one could envision a scenario where instead of just the presence or absence of a label, you could have a confidence score associated with a label. In that case, different loss functions might be used. Let's assume that the input labels represent a confidence score between 0 and 1 rather than a binary present/absent.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

num_classes = 5  # "dog", "cat", "house", "tree", "sky"

model = models.Sequential([
  layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
  layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
  layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  layers.Flatten(),
  layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='sigmoid') # Sigmoid for output probabilities
])


model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='mse', # Mean squared error for regression
              metrics=['MeanAbsoluteError'])

#Dummy Data for testing purposes
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand(100,64,64,3)
y_train = np.random.rand(100,num_classes)
x_test = np.random.rand(20,64,64,3)
y_test = np.random.rand(20,num_classes)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_test,y_test))
```

Here, the model architecture is kept consistent, but the loss function is changed to Mean Squared Error (`mse`), and the output labels are real values between 0 and 1 instead of binary values. Furthermore, metrics have been updated to `MeanAbsoluteError` to match the regression setup. The change is simple but fundamental. This represents a switch to a regression setup, with the model now trained to predict the confidence scores associated with each class. While this was previously discussed as a confidence score, it could also model a different use case where there might be a partial presence of a tag, such as the color intensity of sky.

In summary, tackling multi-label classification with Keras requires a clear understanding of the shift from single-label output shapes and loss functions. Sigmoid activation enables independent probability prediction for each class, and binary cross-entropy treats each class as its own binary prediction problem. Custom losses, such as weighted binary cross-entropy, can improve performance on imbalanced datasets. Finally, by changing the loss and labels, other types of tasks, such as regression for confidence, can be achieved with minimal alterations to model architecture.

To further deepen one's knowledge, I recommend studying the TensorFlow official documentation for their losses and metrics.  Additionally, consulting machine learning texts that discuss advanced loss function techniques would provide strong theoretical underpinnings. Lastly, exploring research papers focused on multi-label classification architectures and methodologies can offer valuable insights into more sophisticated approaches.
