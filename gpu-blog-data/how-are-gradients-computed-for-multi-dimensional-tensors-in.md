The core mechanism for gradient computation in PyTorch for multi-dimensional tensors relies on the automatic differentiation capabilities of its computational graph.  This isn't a simple element-wise operation; rather, it leverages backpropagation, a recursive algorithm that efficiently calculates gradients through the chain rule. My experience working on large-scale neural networks, specifically within the context of natural language processing, has highlighted the importance of understanding this underlying process.  Misunderstandings here frequently lead to incorrect implementations and significant performance bottlenecks.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's autograd system dynamically builds a computational graph as operations are performed on tensors.  Tensors possessing the attribute `.requires_grad=True` are tracked within this graph.  Each operation creates a node representing the computation, linking the input tensors to the output tensor. When `.backward()` is called on a tensor (typically the loss function's output), the gradients are computed using backpropagation.

Backpropagation efficiently calculates gradients by applying the chain rule iteratively.  Consider a simple chain:  `z = f(y), y = g(x)`.  The gradient of `z` with respect to `x` (∂z/∂x) is computed as (∂z/∂y) * (∂y/∂x).  In PyTorch, the partial derivatives (∂z/∂y and ∂y/∂x) are automatically computed for each node in the computational graph. This process is extended to arbitrarily complex networks, handling multi-dimensional tensors by applying the chain rule element-wise across each dimension.

For multi-dimensional tensors, the gradients are themselves tensors of the same shape. Each element in the gradient tensor represents the partial derivative of the output tensor (typically the loss) with respect to the corresponding element in the input tensor.  This allows for efficient gradient updates during the training process using optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent.  Crucially, the computational graph is not explicitly stored; it is built and discarded dynamically, optimizing memory usage.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Scalar Operation with a Multi-Dimensional Tensor**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, 4, requires_grad=True)  # Multi-dimensional input tensor
y = x.sum()  # Scalar operation
y.backward()  # Compute gradients

print(x.grad)  # Gradient is a tensor of the same shape as x, filled with ones
```

Commentary:  This example shows a reduction operation (sum) on a 3x4 tensor.  The `backward()` function computes the gradient of `y` (the sum) with respect to `x`.  Since `y` is the sum of all elements in `x`, the gradient of `y` with respect to each element in `x` is 1.  The resulting `x.grad` is therefore a 3x4 tensor filled with ones.

**Example 2:  Matrix Multiplication and Gradient Calculation**

```python
import torch

A = torch.randn(2, 3, requires_grad=True)
B = torch.randn(3, 4, requires_grad=True)
C = torch.mm(A, B)  # Matrix multiplication
loss = C.sum()
loss.backward()

print(A.grad)  # Gradient of the loss with respect to A
print(B.grad)  # Gradient of the loss with respect to B
```

Commentary: Here, matrix multiplication is performed. The gradients `A.grad` and `B.grad` will be non-trivial tensors reflecting the contribution of each element in `A` and `B` to the final loss.  The precise values depend on the randomly initialized tensors `A` and `B`.  Note that the backpropagation algorithm efficiently computes these gradients without explicitly calculating the Jacobian matrix.

**Example 3:  Chain Rule Illustrated with Multiple Operations**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
y = x**2  # Element-wise squaring
z = y.sum() # Summation
w = torch.sin(z) # Sine function
w.backward()

print(x.grad) # Gradient of w with respect to x (chain rule applied)
```

Commentary:  This example demonstrates the application of the chain rule across multiple operations.  The gradient `x.grad` is computed by applying the chain rule: ∂w/∂x = (∂w/∂z) * (∂z/∂y) * (∂y/∂x).  PyTorch automatically handles this calculation, simplifying the process of computing gradients for complex expressions involving multi-dimensional tensors.  Note that the gradient calculation flows backwards through the computational graph, accumulating gradients along the way.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend carefully reviewing the PyTorch documentation specifically focusing on the `autograd` package.  Thoroughly working through the tutorials on automatic differentiation provided by PyTorch is also essential.  Finally, a solid understanding of the underlying mathematical principles of calculus (particularly the chain rule for multivariable functions) is crucial for a deep comprehension of the process.  These resources, coupled with practical experimentation, will provide a comprehensive understanding of gradient computation in PyTorch.
