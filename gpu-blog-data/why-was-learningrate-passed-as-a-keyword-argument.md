The practice of passing `learning_rate` as a keyword argument to an optimizer within an R script stems from the flexibility and configurability offered by modern machine learning frameworks. Specifically, my experience working with TensorFlow and Keras in R has demonstrated that many optimizers are implemented as classes inheriting from a base optimizer, where hyperparameter adjustments, including the learning rate, are handled at the instantiation stage. Unlike statically defined function parameters, keyword arguments provide a more structured and extensible means of modifying optimizer behavior.

The core reason is parameter decoupling and dynamic configuration. In a typical machine learning training loop, the optimizer's task is to adjust the model's weights based on the calculated gradients and a predefined learning rate. If `learning_rate` were a statically defined argument within the optimizer function itself (think a function with `optimizer(weights, gradients, learning_rate)`), altering it during training would either be impossible or require creating a new optimizer instance. However, by defining the learning rate and other hyperparameters as arguments to the *optimizerâ€™s constructor* via keyword arguments (`optimizer(learning_rate = 0.01)`), we gain the ability to initialize the optimizer with specific configurations and potentially modify them outside the core optimization logic.

This is particularly beneficial when employing techniques like learning rate scheduling. Instead of having to rebuild the optimizer object entirely whenever the learning rate changes, the scheduler simply retrieves the current learning rate and potentially alters it, passing the new value along to the optimizer. The optimizer itself does not have to handle the complexity of scheduling; it simply operates using the current learning rate it receives as a constructor argument. This separation of concerns allows for a cleaner codebase and easier management of hyperparameters during training.

Furthermore, passing hyperparameters like learning rate via keyword arguments makes the API of the optimizer more consistent and extensible. It allows the framework to add new optimization parameters with less disruption to existing code. If each optimizer had its own rigid, positional parameter list, adding a new hyperparameter would require modifying the core signature of that specific function, which could lead to compatibility issues. The keyword argument approach allows for the incorporation of new hyperparameters without necessitating positional changes. This promotes maintainability and adaptability of the machine learning library itself.

To illustrate, consider these examples within the context of TensorFlow and Keras used from R:

**Example 1: Basic Optimizer Instantiation**

```R
library(keras)

model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 32, activation = 'relu', input_shape = c(10)) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')

# Using the 'optimizer_adam' function and passing learning_rate as a keyword
optimizer <- optimizer_adam(learning_rate = 0.001)

model %>% compile(
  optimizer = optimizer,
  loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',
  metrics = c('accuracy')
)
```

Here, the `optimizer_adam()` function from Keras is used to create an Adam optimizer object. The `learning_rate` is not a regular argument, but a named parameter in the form of `learning_rate = 0.001`. This demonstrates the instantiation of the optimizer with a specified learning rate. Notice that we are *creating* the optimizer, not calling a function that directly performs optimization. The actual optimization is performed later, within the training procedure of the model, and it relies on this optimizer object which is initialized with this value. If `learning_rate` was not a keyword argument, it would be more difficult to specify this value during optimizer creation and this specific call would be an error if it was not provided.

**Example 2: Custom Learning Rate Schedule**

```R
library(keras)

# Define a custom learning rate schedule function
lr_schedule <- function(epoch) {
  if (epoch < 10) {
    return(0.001)
  } else if (epoch < 20) {
    return(0.0005)
  } else {
    return(0.0001)
  }
}

# Create an Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate
optimizer <- optimizer_adam(learning_rate = lr_schedule(0))

# Define a custom callback to update the optimizer's learning rate
update_lr_callback <- callback_lambda(
    on_epoch_begin = function(epoch, logs) {
        k_set_value(optimizer$learning_rate, lr_schedule(epoch))
    }
)

model %>% fit(
    x_train,
    y_train,
    epochs = 30,
    batch_size = 32,
    callbacks = list(update_lr_callback)
)
```

In this example, we have a custom function to modify the learning rate over time. The crucial aspect here is that `optimizer_adam` is *initialized* with a starting `learning_rate`. The `update_lr_callback` accesses and modifies the optimizer's internal `learning_rate` using `k_set_value` at the start of each epoch. This is achievable because the learning rate is stored within the optimizer object, made configurable via the keyword argument during its creation and accessible as a property during its use. Without the keyword argument convention, we would have to replace the optimizer entirely, which would be significantly less efficient. Note that the direct modification within the callback works because the optimizer object is a mutable object that allows setting of properties like learning rate directly at runtime.

**Example 3: Using Different Optimizers with Varying Learning Rates**

```R
library(keras)

# Adam optimizer
adam_opt <- optimizer_adam(learning_rate = 0.001)
# SGD optimizer with different learning rate
sgd_opt <- optimizer_sgd(learning_rate = 0.01)

# Function to create model (for different optimizers)
create_model <- function(optimizer) {
    model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
        layer_dense(units = 32, activation = 'relu', input_shape = c(10)) %>%
        layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')
     model %>% compile(
       optimizer = optimizer,
       loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',
       metrics = c('accuracy')
    )
}

model_adam <- create_model(adam_opt)
model_sgd <- create_model(sgd_opt)

# Train both models (simplified for demonstration)
model_adam %>% fit(x_train, y_train, epochs = 10, batch_size = 32)
model_sgd %>% fit(x_train, y_train, epochs = 10, batch_size = 32)
```

This demonstrates a scenario where you might compare the performance of different optimizers. Each optimizer has its own `learning_rate` set during its instantiation, and this is achieved via keyword arguments. This makes it clear which learning rate is being applied to which optimizer. Having the flexibility to set it during initialization using keyword arguments is fundamental for this type of comparison and control over the training process. If `learning_rate` was a positional argument of an optimizer *function* and not of the optimizer object creation, this code would be much more complex and error-prone.

In summary, passing the `learning_rate` as a keyword argument to the optimizer allows for flexible and decoupled hyperparameter management, enabling dynamic learning rate schedules and consistent API design. The keyword argument facilitates a cleaner, more extensible, and adaptable architecture, where optimization algorithms are defined as classes that accept their parameters through this structured mechanism, promoting maintainability and reducing code complexity. For further details on optimizer implementation and usage, I would recommend consulting the official documentation for TensorFlow and Keras, along with advanced machine learning texts which go deeper into the theoretical aspects of optimization. Also, specific guides related to training neural networks using R often provide comprehensive insights.
