The inability of a PyTorch Tensor to relocate to the GPU is often rooted in subtle mismatches between the Tensor's existing location, the intended GPU device, and the state of the PyTorch execution environment, specifically its interaction with CUDA. A Tensor implicitly maintains information about the device on which it resides (CPU or a specific GPU). Direct movement requires consistent type support, memory availability, and explicit handling of CUDA availability.

Firstly, I've frequently observed that a primary cause is attempting to move a Tensor to a CUDA device when CUDA is not properly initialized or when a GPU is not available. PyTorch relies heavily on the CUDA library for GPU operations. If this library is not detected, or the required GPU drivers are not installed, no GPU-related operations, including memory transfers, will succeed. The `torch.cuda.is_available()` check can identify this, and any GPU utilization should be conditioned on the outcome of this function.

Secondly, the Tensor's datatype plays a crucial role. Certain datatypes are not directly supported on GPUs, or require specific CUDA kernel implementations. If a Tensor is created with a datatype not supported by the GPU (such as a `torch.double` tensor on some older GPUs), the move operation will either result in an exception or a silent failure, with the Tensor remaining on the CPU. Converting the Tensor to a supported datatype like `torch.float32` (`torch.float`) before attempting the move is essential.

Thirdly, even if CUDA is available and the Tensor datatype is compatible, you might encounter issues related to CUDA memory management. The GPU's memory is finite, and while PyTorch offers automatic memory management, attempting to transfer Tensors exceeding the available memory can result in an out-of-memory error or, in some cases, the Tensor will simply stay on the CPU. Therefore, verifying GPU memory usage before allocation or moving large Tensors is good practice.

Letâ€™s consider some code illustrations. In this first example, I'm going to demonstrate the most common error, failing to check `cuda.is_available()`.

```python
import torch

# Incorrect: Moving to CUDA without checking if available
my_tensor = torch.rand(5, 5)
try:
    my_tensor = my_tensor.cuda()
    print("Tensor moved to GPU.")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
    print("Tensor remains on CPU.")
print(f"Tensor device: {my_tensor.device}")

# Correct: Conditionally move to CUDA if available
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    my_tensor_2 = torch.rand(5,5)
    my_tensor_2 = my_tensor_2.cuda()
    print(f"Second Tensor device: {my_tensor_2.device}")
else:
    print("CUDA not available, second tensor remains on CPU.")

```

The first attempt will often throw a `RuntimeError` if CUDA is not set up or no GPU is detected. The `RuntimeError` typically indicates that CUDA is not available and thus `cuda()` is an invalid operation. The second block correctly addresses this by checking the availability of CUDA using `torch.cuda.is_available()` before attempting the operation, preventing unexpected failures. The `my_tensor.device` call will explicitly confirm on which device it is currently allocated.

In this next code example, I will demonstrate datatype issues. As previously noted, some datatypes may not be directly compatible with the GPU and require explicit type conversion.

```python
import torch

# Incorrect: Using an unsupported datatype on the GPU
my_double_tensor = torch.rand(5, 5, dtype=torch.double)
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    try:
        my_double_tensor = my_double_tensor.cuda()
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
        print("Tensor remains on CPU.")

    # Correct: Explicitly converting to a GPU-supported datatype
    my_float_tensor = my_double_tensor.float()
    my_float_tensor = my_float_tensor.cuda()
    print(f"Tensor datatype: {my_float_tensor.dtype}, Tensor device: {my_float_tensor.device}")
else:
    print("CUDA not available.")
```

This shows that while a `torch.double` tensor might work on the CPU, you might encounter issues on the GPU, especially with older or some specific GPU architectures. We first try to move `my_double_tensor` to the GPU. If that fails with a `RuntimeError`, we convert the tensor to a `float` type, which is generally more compatible with GPUs. The successful move of `my_float_tensor` and printout of the datatype and device demonstrates the solution.

Finally, this third example will focus on GPU memory. Even with available CUDA and supported datatypes, inadequate memory can prevent the allocation or relocation of tensors.

```python
import torch

if torch.cuda.is_available():
  try:
      # Attempt to create a very large tensor (may exceed memory)
      large_tensor = torch.rand(10000, 10000, 100, device='cuda')
      print("Large tensor successfully moved to GPU")
      print(f"Tensor device: {large_tensor.device}")
  except RuntimeError as e:
      print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
      print("Large Tensor cannot be allocated to the GPU, potential out-of-memory error.")
      # Create a smaller tensor on GPU as a fallback
      small_tensor = torch.rand(100, 100, device='cuda')
      print(f"Fallback small tensor device: {small_tensor.device}")
else:
  print("CUDA not available.")

#Demonstrating memory release
del small_tensor
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

The initial attempt creates a very large tensor and attempts to directly place it on the GPU, but that may cause a `RuntimeError`. The most common root cause would be that the requested tensor would cause the GPU to run out of memory. Therefore, we add a fallback to create a much smaller tensor on the GPU instead. It demonstrates the need to be mindful of available GPU memory and the usage of the `device=` parameter, as well as to proactively account for such issues. Finally we show how you would properly release memory held by tensors and perform garbage collection if memory becomes an issue.

To further investigate or address these kinds of issues, several resources can be helpful. PyTorch's official documentation provides detailed explanations on tensor creation, manipulation, and device management. It is essential to consult this documentation to understand tensor properties, available datatypes, and memory management strategies. Similarly, NVIDIA's CUDA documentation details CUDA API, supported datatypes, and architectural considerations related to CUDA devices. While the focus here is on PyTorch, understanding the underlying CUDA framework is necessary for optimizing GPU performance. Online communities such as the PyTorch forum often contain user-reported issues similar to this one, offering valuable insights. Finally, profiling tools that come with PyTorch (or are externally available) can assist in identifying bottlenecks and memory usage patterns for more advanced debugging needs. Using a combination of the official documentation, community feedback, and careful code review can resolve these issues effectively.
