TensorFlow's flexibility in handling varied image dimensions stems from its computational graph paradigm and the adaptability of its core operations, rather than a reliance on fixed image shapes. The critical insight is that while input tensors during training often involve batches of uniformly sized images, the model's architecture, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is built to accommodate spatial transformations, specifically convolutions and pooling, that function irrespective of absolute pixel dimensions. This allows a trained model to process images of varying sizes during inference, a capability often referred to as *spatial invariance*, although with certain limitations and considerations.

The crux of the matter is understanding how CNNs work. A typical CNN layer consists of convolutional filters applied to input features, producing feature maps. These filters operate with a fixed receptive field, scanning the input regardless of its size. Subsequent pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions but do not impose strict constraints on the input's absolute dimensions as long as they meet the minimum stride requirements. Thus, if a model’s architecture is primarily composed of convolutional and pooling layers, the input shape only needs to have sufficient dimensions to be processed. Fully connected layers, however, present a challenge, as they expect a flattened vector of a fixed size. This fixed-size requirement is primarily relevant during the final stages of the model.

Therefore, during training, it's common to resize input images to a uniform shape. This ensures consistent batch processing by padding and scaling. Data augmentation often introduces different scales, but these are consistently resized before entering the model for training. This uniform input shape enables efficient batch computation using optimized matrix operations. However, during inference, the absence of batch constraints and the flexible nature of convolutions mean the model can ingest images of varying sizes, provided they are greater than the model's receptive field at any given layer. This property allows the model to adapt to the natural diversity of image dimensions found in real-world scenarios.

The primary issue that needs attention is the compatibility of image resolutions with the model's architecture, particularly concerning the final dense layers after convolutional feature extraction. If the input image leads to an output of the convolutional feature maps of a differing dimensions than what the dense layer expects, the model can break or output nonsensical data. Here, it’s critical to ensure that the dimensions of the flattened feature maps are consistent across varied image inputs. This can often be achieved through a global average pooling layer that reduces spatial dimensions to a single vector of features that does not depend on input size, making it compatible with the dense layers. Alternatively, a fixed size fully connected layer can be added that will serve as the final layer of the model regardless of input size. This is especially useful when handling images of different aspect ratios.

Let me illustrate this with three examples.

**Example 1: Training with Resized Images, Inference with Varied Sizes (Classification)**

In this scenario, I would train a model on a dataset of images resized to 224x224. During inference, the model handles images of any size and generates the correct classifications.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Build a simple CNN
def build_cnn(input_shape):
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(), # Use Global Average Pooling
        layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Number of classes is 10
    ])
    return model

# During training:
input_shape = (224, 224, 3) # Fixed input shape
model = build_cnn(input_shape)
#Compile the model (details omitted for brevity)
#Load a dataset of images resized to 224x224
#Train the model

# During inference:
image = tf.io.read_file('inference_image.jpg') # Example with an image of size 400x300
image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image, channels=3)
image = tf.expand_dims(tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, dtype=tf.float32), axis=0)  # Convert to float32, Add batch dim
predictions = model.predict(image)
print(predictions)
```

In this example, *GlobalAveragePooling2D* collapses the feature maps, removing dependence on their original size. This ensures the following Dense layer always receives an input of the same shape, enabling it to function independently of the spatial size of the original input image.

**Example 2: Object Detection with Varied Image Sizes**

Object detection models often encounter varied input image sizes. Here, resizing could be detrimental, as the absolute pixel coordinates are important for bounding box locations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Custom Object Detection Model (simplified)
def build_object_detector(input_shape):
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.Conv2D(256, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same'), #Keep spatial dimentions
        layers.Conv2D(num_boxes * 4 , (1, 1), activation='sigmoid') #Output bounding box locations
    ])
    return model

# Assume num_boxes represents the number of bounding boxes per grid cell
num_boxes = 4
input_shape = (None, None, 3)
model = build_object_detector(input_shape)


# During training, augment data with resized image,
# and then train bounding box detection model

#During inference:
image = tf.io.read_file('object_detection_image.jpg')
image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image, channels=3)
image = tf.expand_dims(tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, dtype=tf.float32), axis=0)
bounding_boxes = model.predict(image)
print(bounding_boxes)
```

This code is a simplified representation of an object detection model where the convolutional layers do not downsample the spatial dimensions and output a feature map of the same size as the original input image. The output of the network is the bounding box locations where num_boxes * 4 is the dimension where 4 represents x,y,width and height of a bounding box. Since the model produces the outputs at pixel positions, it can work with images of different sizes.

**Example 3: Using Dynamic Batch Sizes During Inference**

While often overlooked, the ability to process images individually or in arbitrary batch sizes during inference is a direct consequence of TensorFlow’s graph-based architecture. A typical example might be a scenario where processing speed might be less critical, and an application wants to process variable number of images based on the availability of data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# A very simple model for demonstration
def simple_model(input_shape):
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
        layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Example with binary output
    ])
    return model

input_shape = (None, None, 3) # Dynamic input shape for batching
model = simple_model(input_shape)
#Load pre trained weights

# Inference loop:
images_paths = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg','image4.jpg', 'image5.jpg'] # A dynamic list of images

for image_path in images_paths:
    image = tf.io.read_file(image_path)
    image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image, channels=3)
    image = tf.expand_dims(tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, dtype=tf.float32), axis=0)  # Add batch dimension here
    prediction = model.predict(image) #The prediction process remains identical regardless of the image size
    print(f'Prediction for {image_path}: {prediction}')
```

In this case, individual images are loaded and their dimensions can be variable. During training, models are trained with fixed batch sizes. However, the graph structure does not require a fixed batch size during the inference, allowing processing of a single image at a time or a varying number of images at each loop. This is possible since the tensor shape is dynamically inferred, not statically defined during model creation.

To further understand these nuances, I suggest exploring resources on Convolutional Neural Network architectures, particularly those covering receptive field and pooling concepts. Studying the TensorFlow API documentation for layers such as *Conv2D*, *MaxPooling2D*, and *GlobalAveragePooling2D* is paramount. Focus on materials that explain the dynamic nature of tensor shapes within the TensorFlow graph. Experimenting with custom datasets containing varied image dimensions to observe the model’s behavior is also crucial for solidifying understanding. Delving into object detection algorithms like YOLO or SSD can reveal how varied image sizes are tackled within practical implementations. Finally, investigating the concept of padding in convolutional layers as well as the impact of stride can give additional insight.
