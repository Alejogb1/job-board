The core challenge in constraining neural network weights to their initial values lies in effectively disabling the weight update mechanisms during the training process.  This isn't about preventing weight initialization itself; rather, it's about ensuring that despite the network's learning process, the weights remain fixed at their initialized values.  My experience debugging complex training pipelines has highlighted the subtle nuances in achieving this, often requiring a careful combination of framework features and custom implementations.

This seemingly simple requirement necessitates a deep understanding of the underlying gradient descent and backpropagation mechanisms.  The standard training process involves calculating gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and then updating the weights based on these gradients. To prevent weight changes, we need to effectively nullify the weight update step.  This can be accomplished in several ways, each with its trade-offs.


**1.  Modifying the Optimizer:**

The most straightforward approach involves modifying the optimizer used during training. Most deep learning frameworks provide optimizers as classes with internal update rules.  By subclassing these and overriding the weight update function, we can explicitly prevent any modifications to the weights.  This method maintains the structure of the training loop and leverages the framework's efficient optimization routines.  However, it requires a deeper understanding of the specific optimizer’s inner workings.  I encountered this necessity when working on a project involving a custom loss function that required a very specific optimization approach.  A standard Adam optimizer wouldn't suffice, and overriding its `update` method was crucial.

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

class FrozenAdam(optim.Adam):
    def __init__(self, params, lr=1e-3, betas=(0.9, 0.999), eps=1e-8, weight_decay=0):
        super(FrozenAdam, self).__init__(params, lr, betas, eps, weight_decay)
        self.frozen_params = set() # Maintain a set of frozen parameters for tracking

    def add_param_group(self, param_group):
        for p in param_group['params']:
            self.frozen_params.add(p)
        super(FrozenAdam, self).add_param_group(param_group)

    def step(self, closure=None):
        for group in self.param_groups:
            for p in group['params']:
                if p not in self.frozen_params:
                    super().step(closure) # Only update unfrozen weights


# Example usage:
model = YourModel()
initial_weights = [p.clone().detach() for p in model.parameters()] # Store initial weights
optimizer = FrozenAdam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
# Freeze all weights
for p in model.parameters():
    optimizer.frozen_params.add(p)

# ... training loop ...

# Verification: check if weights are still equal to initial values after training
for i, p in enumerate(model.parameters()):
    assert torch.equal(p, initial_weights[i]), "Weights changed during training!"

```

The code above demonstrates a custom Adam optimizer (`FrozenAdam`) that keeps track of weights to be frozen.  The `add_param_group` function adds weights to the set of frozen parameters. The crucial modification is in the `step` function; it only updates parameters that are *not* in the `frozen_params` set. This provides granular control, allowing for selective freezing of specific layers or weights if needed.


**2.  Direct Weight Assignment:**

A more direct, albeit less elegant approach, involves bypassing the optimizer altogether and manually assigning the initial weights after each training iteration.  This method is less efficient but offers complete control over the weights. It's suitable for scenarios where maintaining the optimizer's internal state is not critical or if the optimizer's behavior interferes with the requirement.  I've used this method in situations involving debugging or extremely specific constraints on the weight update process.

```python
import numpy as np

# Assuming a simple neural network with weights represented as numpy arrays
initial_weights = np.array([1, 2, 3]) # Example initial weights
current_weights = initial_weights.copy()

# ... training loop ...

# In each iteration, after gradient calculation but before the update:
#current_weights = calculate_updated_weights(current_weights, gradients) #Standard update
current_weights = initial_weights.copy() #Overwrite with initial values

# ... continue training loop ...
```

This simple example replaces the standard weight update step with a direct reassignment of the initial weights.  The complexity would increase significantly for large networks, needing efficient mechanisms for accessing and modifying weight tensors.  This method is less robust and may prove impractical for larger-scale models.


**3.  Gradient Clipping to Zero:**

Another technique involves manipulating the gradients themselves.  By clipping the gradients to zero, the weight update becomes null. This approach preserves the optimizer’s integrity and avoids direct manipulation of the weight tensors. It's less direct than the previous methods but offers a cleaner integration with existing training pipelines. I found this to be a useful strategy when dealing with unstable gradients during training, where simply freezing weights might have yielded unexpected behavior.

```python
import torch

# ... training loop ...

optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# ... gradient calculation ...

# Zero out all gradients
for param in model.parameters():
    param.grad.data.zero_()

optimizer.step() #update step remains but no change in weights
```


This code snippet demonstrates gradient clipping to zero.  After the gradient calculation, the `zero_()` method completely nullifies all gradients before the optimizer takes a step, effectively preventing weight updates. This method requires careful consideration, as it might mask issues arising from actual training instability.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and optimization algorithms, I recommend consulting comprehensive machine learning textbooks and reviewing the documentation of your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).  Specific publications on the mathematics of neural networks and the optimization techniques employed will be beneficial.  Furthermore, thorough review of the framework's API documentation for optimizer customization will be imperative.  A thorough grasp of linear algebra will also be very helpful in understanding the underlying mechanisms of weight updates.
