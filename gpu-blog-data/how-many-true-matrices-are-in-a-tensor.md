A tensor, in the context of computer science and numerical computation, doesn't intrinsically contain "true matrices" as a direct, countable entity. Instead, a tensor is a multi-dimensional array, and the concept of a "matrix" within it is dependent on how we interpret and access specific slices of that array. My years developing numerical solvers for partial differential equations have repeatedly brought me face-to-face with this distinction, clarifying the need to carefully define the intended matrix extractions.

The question implies a desire to understand how to identify and extract two-dimensional substructures from a tensor of higher dimensionality. This involves manipulating the tensor's indices to isolate specific planes, which can then be treated as matrices. The quantity of such matrices is directly tied to the tensor's shape and the specific dimensions we collapse.

Let’s consider a concrete example. Take a 3D tensor, frequently visualized as a cuboid. Its shape, represented as (x, y, z), indicates the number of elements along each of these three axes. If we want to form a matrix, we must effectively “slice” along one of these axes. For instance, selecting a specific ‘z’ index yields a 2D slice of size (x, y), effectively a matrix. Similarly, we can fix a ‘y’ or an ‘x’ index, respectively producing matrices of size (x, z) and (y, z). The total count of unique matrices extractable by fixing *one* dimension in a tensor of shape (x, y, z) is then, by definition, the sum of x, y, and z. However, it's crucial to recognize that *each* of these extracted matrices are different, and it depends on which fixed index we use. The question, therefore, becomes one of how many 2D arrays *of a specific shape* can be extracted via slicing through *each* of a 3D tensor's axes.

Consider a tensor with shape (3, 4, 2). I've encountered this many times while working on image processing algorithms where the dimensions represent height, width and color channels. Here, '3' could correspond to height, '4' to width, and '2' to, say, red and blue pixel values. Extractable matrices, as defined above, arise through fixing any one of these axes.

Specifically:
* By fixing one of the '3' height indices, we obtain a (4, 2) matrix. We can perform this operation 3 times, one for each "plane" of the tensor.
* By fixing one of the '4' width indices, we obtain a (3, 2) matrix. We can perform this operation 4 times.
* By fixing one of the '2' color channel indices, we obtain a (3, 4) matrix. We can perform this operation 2 times.

The total count of matrices is then 3 + 4 + 2 = 9 *distinct* matrices. Although there are 9 unique slices, only 3 of them are *unique* in shape. It’s critical to emphasize that these matrices aren't inherent properties of the tensor itself; they are constructs arising from how we interpret the multidimensional data and subsequently perform slicing operations.

Now, let's move onto code examples. I will use Python with NumPy as it is the standard library for numerical work I use.

**Example 1: Extracting matrices from a 3D tensor.**

```python
import numpy as np

tensor_3d = np.arange(24).reshape(3, 4, 2) # Shape: (3, 4, 2)

# Extracting matrices by fixing the first dimension (height)
matrices_axis0 = [tensor_3d[i, :, :] for i in range(tensor_3d.shape[0])]

print("Matrices extracted by fixing first dimension (shape 4x2):\n")
for mat in matrices_axis0:
  print(mat)
  print("Shape:", mat.shape, "\n")


# Extracting matrices by fixing the second dimension (width)
matrices_axis1 = [tensor_3d[:, i, :] for i in range(tensor_3d.shape[1])]

print("Matrices extracted by fixing second dimension (shape 3x2):\n")
for mat in matrices_axis1:
    print(mat)
    print("Shape:", mat.shape, "\n")

# Extracting matrices by fixing the third dimension (color channel)
matrices_axis2 = [tensor_3d[:, :, i] for i in range(tensor_3d.shape[2])]

print("Matrices extracted by fixing third dimension (shape 3x4):\n")
for mat in matrices_axis2:
    print(mat)
    print("Shape:", mat.shape, "\n")
```

This example demonstrates the method for extracting various matrices, using list comprehension for clarity. Each loop generates slices that are effectively matrix views. We see that the shapes vary depending on the fixed dimension, but the total number of slices remains equal to the sum of all the axes size - in this case 3 + 4 + 2 = 9. Each of the slices is a different *matrix*, as each was achieved through the fixing of a *different* index.

**Example 2: Counting matrices with a generalized function.**

```python
import numpy as np

def count_matrices(tensor):
  """Counts the number of matrix slices from a tensor."""
  num_matrices = sum(tensor.shape)
  return num_matrices

tensor_3d = np.arange(24).reshape(3, 4, 2)
tensor_4d = np.arange(120).reshape(2, 3, 4, 5)

count_3d = count_matrices(tensor_3d)
count_4d = count_matrices(tensor_4d)

print(f"Number of matrices in the 3D tensor: {count_3d}") # Output: 9
print(f"Number of matrices in the 4D tensor: {count_4d}") # Output: 14
```

This function `count_matrices` provides a generalized method to ascertain the number of extractable 2D slices by summing the sizes of the axes. The results show the total number of slices, each representing a distinct matrix from the perspective of the code, regardless of any shape replication. I have found this code very useful while implementing automatic tensor dimension handling in code.

**Example 3: Matrix extraction with varying indices.**

```python
import numpy as np

tensor_3d = np.arange(24).reshape(3, 4, 2)

# Example: Accessing a specific matrix slice by fixing specific index
matrix_slice_0 = tensor_3d[0, :, :] # Matrix by fixing first dimension index to 0
matrix_slice_1 = tensor_3d[:, 1, :] # Matrix by fixing second dimension index to 1
matrix_slice_2 = tensor_3d[:, :, 0] # Matrix by fixing third dimension index to 0

print("Matrix extracted by fixing first dimension index 0:\n", matrix_slice_0, "\n Shape:", matrix_slice_0.shape)
print("Matrix extracted by fixing second dimension index 1:\n", matrix_slice_1, "\n Shape:", matrix_slice_1.shape)
print("Matrix extracted by fixing third dimension index 0:\n", matrix_slice_2, "\n Shape:", matrix_slice_2.shape)


```

This snippet displays matrix extraction using specific indices. This is important for targeted extraction of matrix views for further processing. It demonstrates how choosing different indices for fixing the dimension results in a different matrix, reinforcing the notion that "matrices" are views dependent on slicing strategy.

For further exploration, I would recommend focusing on resources related to multidimensional array manipulation. Understanding concepts such as tensor slicing, striding, and views as provided in scientific computing documentation are invaluable. Furthermore, exploring computational linear algebra will shed light on how these matrices are actually used in real-world applications. Specific texts or educational websites focused on advanced programming with scientific libraries would provide a strong foundation. These resources collectively enable a user to transition from simple tensor manipulation to the complex algorithms encountered in scientific and engineering disciplines.
