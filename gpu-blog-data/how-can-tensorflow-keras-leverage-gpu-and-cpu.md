TensorFlow's ability to utilize both GPU and CPU resources hinges fundamentally on the underlying hardware availability and the configuration of the TensorFlow execution environment.  My experience optimizing deep learning models across diverse hardware setups underscores the crucial role of proper configuration in achieving optimal performance.  Ignoring this often leads to significant performance bottlenecks, rendering even the most sophisticated models sluggish.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow, through its Keras API, offers a high-level abstraction that simplifies the process of distributing computation across available hardware.  However, the level of GPU utilization isn't automatic. It requires conscious configuration decisions at several stages.  Firstly, TensorFlow needs to be built with CUDA support if you intend to utilize NVIDIA GPUs.  This involves installing the CUDA toolkit, cuDNN library, and ensuring compatibility between these components and your TensorFlow version.  If not explicitly configured, TensorFlow will default to using the CPU, regardless of GPU presence.

Secondly, the placement of operations within the computational graph directly impacts hardware allocation.  While Keras provides an intuitive API for defining models, the underlying execution mechanism relies on TensorFlow's graph execution or eager execution modes.  In graph mode, the complete computation graph is constructed and then optimized before execution, allowing TensorFlow to effectively schedule operations across available devices. Eager execution, on the other hand, executes operations immediately, which can limit optimization opportunities for GPU utilization.  Moreover,  the `tf.device` context manager allows for fine-grained control over where specific operations are executed, enabling the programmer to strategically place computationally intensive parts on the GPU and less intensive tasks on the CPU.

Thirdly, the size of the model and dataset significantly influences the efficiency of GPU utilization.  For smaller models or datasets, the overhead associated with transferring data between the CPU and GPU might outweigh the computational benefits of GPU acceleration.  In such cases, a CPU-only execution might be more efficient.  Conversely, large models and datasets benefit immensely from GPU acceleration, given the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs.  Memory management is also paramount; exceeding the GPU's memory capacity will result in data being swapped to the system's RAM, leading to performance degradation.

Finally, efficient data pre-processing and batching strategies play a crucial role. Efficiently loading and pre-processing data, coupled with appropriate batch sizes, minimize CPU-bound operations and optimize data transfer to the GPU.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic GPU Usage with `tf.config.list_physical_devices`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check for available GPUs
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
        logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
        print(e)
else:
  print("No GPUs detected. Proceeding with CPU only.")

# Define and train your model here.  TensorFlow will automatically utilize the GPU if available and configured as above.
```

This code snippet demonstrates the essential first step: verifying GPU availability.  The `tf.config.list_physical_devices` function checks for available GPUs.  The crucial `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` line dynamically allocates GPU memory as needed, preventing memory exhaustion issues common with large models.  Failure to set memory growth appropriately can lead to out-of-memory errors even when sufficient GPU memory exists.

**Example 2: Explicit Device Placement with `tf.device`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):  # Specify GPU 0; change if needed.
    # Place the computationally expensive layers on the GPU
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

with tf.device('/CPU:0'):  # Place pre-processing on the CPU if beneficial
    # Pre-processing steps here, like data normalization or augmentation.
    # Avoid large memory transfers between CPU and GPU.
    x_train_preprocessed = ... # your preprocessing code
    y_train_preprocessed = ... # your preprocessing code

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    model.fit(x_train_preprocessed, y_train_preprocessed, epochs=10)

```

This example illustrates how to explicitly place parts of your model on a specific device.  By using the `tf.device` context manager, you can direct specific operations to either the GPU or CPU, providing finer control over hardware resource allocation.  This is particularly helpful when specific parts of the model are more computationally intensive than others or when pre-processing steps are primarily CPU-bound.  Choosing the appropriate placement significantly affects overall training speed.

**Example 3:  Handling Multiple GPUs with `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This shows a higher-level approach to utilizing multiple GPUs.  The `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` automatically replicates the model across available GPUs, distributing the training workload.  This is highly beneficial for training very large models which might not fit into the memory of a single GPU.  However, it's important to note that data synchronization overhead introduces a performance trade-off.  The efficiency of this approach depends on the model's size, dataset size, and the communication speed between GPUs.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on GPU support and distributed training, are invaluable resources.  Additionally, exploring publications and presentations on deep learning model optimization and hardware acceleration techniques will provide advanced insights.  Finally, understanding the fundamentals of CUDA programming and parallel computing is beneficial for more advanced optimization strategies.  Familiarizing oneself with  performance profiling tools specific to TensorFlow is also recommended for identifying and resolving bottlenecks efficiently.
