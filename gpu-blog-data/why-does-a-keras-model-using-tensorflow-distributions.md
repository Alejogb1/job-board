The core issue stems from the interaction between TensorFlow Distributions' probability density functions (PDFs) and the implicit vectorization Keras performs during batch processing.  While TensorFlow Distributions readily handles single-sample calculations, its PDF methods don't inherently support the efficient broadcasting required for multi-sample calculations in a batched context unless explicitly structured.  This incompatibility manifests as an error when batch size exceeds one, specifically because the shape mismatch between the predicted distribution parameters and the expected target data prevents proper element-wise loss computation.  I've encountered this myself numerous times while developing Bayesian neural networks using Keras and TensorFlow Probability (TFP), particularly when dealing with complex likelihood functions.


My experience with this problem began during a project involving probabilistic forecasting of financial time series.  Initially, I modeled the prediction as a Gaussian distribution using `tfp.distributions.Normal`, defining the mean and standard deviation as outputs of a Keras neural network.  My loss function directly employed the negative log-likelihood (NLL) computed using the `log_prob` method of the `tfp.distributions.Normal` instance.  This worked flawlessly with a batch size of 1.  However, scaling up to larger batches led to a shape mismatch error, halting the training process.


The root cause was the implicit expectation of broadcasting within the Keras framework.  Keras automatically feeds batches of data to the model, expecting the loss function to operate element-wise across the batch dimension.  The `log_prob` method of `tfp.distributions.Normal`, when called with a batch of targets, needs its `loc` (mean) and `scale` (standard deviation) parameters to have the same batch dimensions as the target data.  My initial implementation outputted only single values for `loc` and `scale`, resulting in a shape mismatch during broadcasting for batches larger than 1.


The solution lies in ensuring that the model's output layer is appropriately structured to produce batch-wise parameters for the chosen distribution. This requires a careful understanding of TensorFlow's broadcasting rules and explicit reshaping where needed.


**Example 1: Correctly shaped output for Gaussian likelihood**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(2) # Output: [mean, log_stddev] for Gaussian
])

# Define custom loss function
def gaussian_nll(y_true, y_pred):
    mean = y_pred[:, 0]
    log_stddev = y_pred[:, 1]
    dist = tfp.distributions.Normal(loc=mean, scale=tf.exp(log_stddev)) #Important: Use tf.exp to ensure positive scale
    return -tf.reduce_mean(dist.log_prob(y_true))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=gaussian_nll)

# Train the model (with batch_size > 1)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates a crucial modification.  The final layer now outputs two values: the mean and the log of the standard deviation. Using the log of the standard deviation avoids numerical issues (ensuring a positive standard deviation).  The `gaussian_nll` function correctly extracts these values, creating a `tfp.distributions.Normal` instance for each data point in the batch, ensuring that `log_prob` performs a proper element-wise calculation.  The `tf.reduce_mean` then aggregates the negative log-likelihood across the batch.


**Example 2: Handling Multivariate Gaussian Distributions**

Dealing with multivariate Gaussian distributions introduces further complexity.  The output layer must now produce both the mean vector and the covariance matrix (or its Cholesky decomposition for computational efficiency).

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define model for multivariate gaussian
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(2*2) # Output: [mean_1, mean_2, cov_11, cov_12, cov_21, cov_22]
])

#Custom Loss for multivariate gaussian
def multivariate_gaussian_nll(y_true, y_pred):
  mean = y_pred[:, :2]
  covariance = tf.reshape(y_pred[:, 2:], (tf.shape(y_pred)[0], 2, 2))
  dist = tfp.distributions.MultivariateNormalFullCovariance(loc=mean, covariance_matrix=covariance)
  return -tf.reduce_mean(dist.log_prob(y_true))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=multivariate_gaussian_nll)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10)
```

Note that we are outputting a flattened representation of the covariance matrix, then reshaping it within the custom loss function.  Error handling (e.g., ensuring a positive-definite covariance matrix) might require additional steps in a production environment.


**Example 3:  Utilizing `tfp.layers` for simplified distribution modeling**

TensorFlow Probability offers specialized layers to simplify this process.  `tfp.layers.DistributionLambda` provides a more concise way to define the output distribution.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define model using tfp.layers.DistributionLambda
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tfp.layers.DistributionLambda(
        lambda t: tfp.distributions.Normal(loc=t[..., :1], scale=tf.exp(t[..., 1:]))
    )
])

# Custom loss using log_prob on the distribution layer
def distribution_nll(y_true, y_pred):
    return -tf.reduce_mean(y_pred.log_prob(y_true))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=distribution_nll)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10)
```


This example leverages `tfp.layers.DistributionLambda` to directly create a `tfp.distributions.Normal` object from the model's output. The lambda function defines how the output tensor is transformed into the distribution parameters.  This simplifies the code while ensuring correct batch handling.


For further understanding, I highly recommend studying the official TensorFlow Probability documentation, focusing on the `tfp.distributions` module and the various layer options within `tfp.layers`.  A thorough understanding of TensorFlow's broadcasting semantics and the use of `tf.reshape` and other tensor manipulation functions is also critical.  Finally, exploring examples of Bayesian neural networks implemented with Keras and TFP will provide valuable practical insights.
