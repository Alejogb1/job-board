Outgoing email modification, while not a standard feature readily exposed by most email clients or servers, can be achieved through programmatic interception and manipulation. Specifically, altering the email data requires an understanding of the email message structure, primarily MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), and the ability to interact with the message stream before it is handed off to the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server. My experience implementing a custom spam filtering proxy, which required precisely this functionality, informs the following explanation.

The fundamental challenge arises from the fact that most email clients generate the complete MIME-formatted message and then simply pass it to the SMTP server for delivery. Consequently, direct manipulation of this data from within the client itself is usually not possible without extensive and often invasive modifications to the client software. Instead, a more practical approach involves acting as a "man-in-the-middle" by intercepting the message stream. This interception typically occurs through custom-built proxies or specialized email transport agents. Once intercepted, the raw MIME message can be parsed, modified, and then re-transmitted to the destination server.

The MIME message structure is composed of a header section and a body section, separated by a blank line. The header contains various fields defining the message, such as ‘From’, ‘To’, ‘Subject’, and ‘MIME-Version’. The body can be plain text or consist of multiple parts (multipart/mixed, multipart/alternative, etc.), each potentially containing text, images, or other attachments. Each part within a multipart message has its own header defining its content type. Modifying outgoing data involves parsing this structure, identifying the specific elements to change, and then re-assembling the modified message in a valid MIME format.

A robust solution should account for various scenarios: modification of the 'From' address (often limited by server policies), changing the subject, modifying the body content (including plain text and HTML sections in multipart messages), or even adding/removing attachments. Additionally, care must be taken to ensure proper encoding (e.g., Base64 for attachments) is preserved and that modified header fields maintain correct syntax. In all cases, the resulting message must be a valid and deliverable MIME message.

Here are several examples of such modifications, using Python, a language readily suited for this task, accompanied by commentary:

**Example 1: Modifying the Subject Line**

```python
import email
from email.header import decode_header, make_header

def modify_subject(raw_email, new_subject):
    msg = email.message_from_bytes(raw_email)
    msg['Subject'] = make_header(decode_header(new_subject))
    return msg.as_bytes()

# Example usage:
raw_email = b"""From: sender@example.com
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: Original Subject Line
MIME-Version: 1.0

This is the original email body."""
modified_email = modify_subject(raw_email, "Modified Subject Line")
print(modified_email.decode())
```

This first example shows how to use the `email` module in Python to parse the raw message, modify the 'Subject' header, and then serialize the modified message back to bytes for transmission. The `decode_header` and `make_header` functions ensure that subject strings with non-ASCII characters are handled correctly by encoding them to RFC 2047 standards. Direct assignment to the `Subject` field allows modification, while the `as_bytes` method converts the modified message back to a byte stream. This example also demonstrates a minimal email format for clarity.

**Example 2: Modifying the HTML Body in a Multipart Message**

```python
import email
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def modify_html_body(raw_email, new_html_body):
    msg = email.message_from_bytes(raw_email)
    if msg.is_multipart():
        for part in msg.walk():
            if part.get_content_type() == 'text/html':
                part.set_payload(new_html_body)
                break
    else:
        # If not multipart, it's most likely text/plain; consider adding html
        new_msg = MIMEMultipart('alternative')
        new_msg['From'] = msg['From']
        new_msg['To'] = msg['To']
        new_msg['Subject'] = msg['Subject']
        new_msg.attach(MIMEText(msg.get_payload(), 'plain'))
        new_msg.attach(MIMEText(new_html_body, 'html'))
        msg = new_msg
    return msg.as_bytes()

# Example usage:
raw_email = b"""From: sender@example.com
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: HTML Email
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary="boundary123"

--boundary123
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"

This is the plaintext version.

--boundary123
Content-Type: text/html; charset="utf-8"

<html><body><h1>Original HTML</h1></body></html>
--boundary123--
"""

modified_email = modify_html_body(raw_email, "<html><body><h1>Modified HTML</h1></body></html>")
print(modified_email.decode())
```

This example delves into the complexity of multipart messages, specifically those containing both plaintext and HTML versions of the email body. It parses the message using `email.message_from_bytes`, then iterates through its parts. Upon locating the HTML content, the payload is replaced. An additional logic is implemented to convert a plain text email to alternative multipart email, adding the HTML body part. The modified message is then returned as a byte stream. This demonstrates handling common MIME email structures and making specific content changes.

**Example 3: Adding an Attachment**

```python
import email
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.application import MIMEApplication
import os

def add_attachment(raw_email, file_path):
    msg = email.message_from_bytes(raw_email)
    if not msg.is_multipart():
        new_msg = MIMEMultipart()
        for header in msg.keys():
            new_msg[header] = msg[header]
        new_msg.attach(MIMEText(msg.get_payload(), 'plain'))
        msg = new_msg
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        file_data = f.read()
        file_name = os.path.basename(file_path)
        part = MIMEApplication(file_data, Name=file_name)
        part['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment; filename="{file_name}"'
        msg.attach(part)
    return msg.as_bytes()

#Example usage
raw_email = b"""From: sender@example.com
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: Email without Attachment
MIME-Version: 1.0

This is the original text email."""
with open("attachment.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is the file content.")

modified_email = add_attachment(raw_email, "attachment.txt")
print(modified_email.decode())
os.remove("attachment.txt")
```

The third example showcases adding an attachment to an email. The code reads a specified file, creates a MIMEApplication part with appropriate headers (including the ‘Content-Disposition’ to denote it as an attachment), and adds it to the email message. The code handles both multipart and non-multipart emails ensuring a consistent structure is preserved. This example demonstrates manipulation beyond text content to binary content.

In practice, such modifications would be implemented in an email proxy that sits between the client and the SMTP server. This would require capturing the outgoing SMTP session, decoding the email message, applying the modification logic above, and then re-transmitting the modified message to the designated SMTP server. The implementation of the proxy or transport agent layer is beyond the scope of these examples but is critical for real-world application.

For further study, I would recommend exploring RFC 5322 and RFC 2045 through RFC 2049 for a detailed understanding of the internet message format and MIME standards. Texts on networking and email system administration are valuable for learning about the infrastructure necessary to implement an email interception and modification system. Moreover, exploring examples from open source projects dealing with email parsing and manipulation is beneficial. Finally, examining the source code of libraries like Python's `email` module, which serves as a core component in these examples, provides deeper insights into implementation details.
