TensorFlow 1.x function creation hinges on the `tf.Graph` object and its associated mechanisms for defining operations and managing execution.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines highlighted the importance of structuring these functions carefully for both maintainability and performance.  Ignoring best practices often led to unwieldy graphs and difficult debugging sessions.  A core principle is to encapsulate operations logically, mirroring the modularity inherent in the problem being solved.  This is best achieved by leveraging the `tf.Session` to manage execution within the defined graph context.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow 1.x does not inherently support Python function definitions in the same manner as TensorFlow 2.x. Instead, one defines a computation graph using TensorFlow operations, then executes this graph using a session.  To create a "function," we construct a subgraph within the main graph, defining input and output tensors. This subgraph can then be called repeatedly with different inputs, much like a function.  We utilize `tf.placeholder` to define input nodes and `tf.identity` or other operations to define output nodes.  Crucially, the graph itself is static; the session executes it.

To enhance reusability and avoid redundant graph definition, the process can be encapsulated within a higher-level Python function. This function would create the TensorFlow graph internally and manage the session. This approach allows for cleaner code and easier parameterization of the computation.  Error handling, particularly regarding shape mismatches and type errors, is paramount, necessitating explicit checks prior to session execution.  Memory management, especially in dealing with large tensors, is also a critical aspect to consider.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Addition Function:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def tf_add(a, b):
    with tf.Graph().as_default() as g:
        a_tensor = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=None, name="a")
        b_tensor = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=None, name="b")
        result = tf.add(a_tensor, b_tensor, name="sum")
        sess = tf.Session(graph=g)
        try:
            return sess.run(result, feed_dict={a_tensor: a, b_tensor: b})
        except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
            print("Error during execution:", e)
            return None
        finally:
            sess.close()


# Usage
a = 5.0
b = 10.0
sum_result = tf_add(a,b)
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")

a = [1.0, 2.0]
b = [3.0, 4.0]
sum_result = tf_add(a, b)
print(f"Sum of arrays: {sum_result}")

a = 5.0
b = "ten" #This will cause an error, demonstrating error handling
sum_result = tf_add(a,b)
print(f"Sum with error: {sum_result}")

```

This example showcases a simple addition function.  Note the use of `tf.placeholder` to define inputs, `tf.add` for the operation, and the `tf.Session` to run the computation.  The `try-except-finally` block is critical for resource management and handling potential `InvalidArgumentError` exceptions stemming from type mismatches or shape inconsistencies in the input data. The final example demonstrates the error handling mechanism.


**Example 2: Matrix Multiplication Function:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def tf_matmul(matrix_a, matrix_b):
    with tf.Graph().as_default() as g:
        a_tensor = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, None], name="matrix_a")
        b_tensor = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, None], name="matrix_b")
        result = tf.matmul(a_tensor, b_tensor, name="product")
        sess = tf.Session(graph=g)
        try:
            return sess.run(result, feed_dict={a_tensor: matrix_a, b_tensor: matrix_b})
        except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
            print("Shape mismatch or other error:", e)
            return None
        finally:
            sess.close()

# Usage
matrix_a = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
matrix_b = np.array([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

product = tf_matmul(matrix_a, matrix_b)
print(f"Matrix product:\n{product}")

matrix_c = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5,6]])
matrix_d = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]) #Shape mismatch
product = tf_matmul(matrix_c, matrix_d)
print(f"Matrix product with shape mismatch:\n{product}")
```

This example demonstrates matrix multiplication, highlighting the handling of potentially mismatched matrix shapes. The `shape` parameter in `tf.placeholder` is set to `[None, None]`, allowing for matrices of varying dimensions (within the constraints of matrix multiplication rules). The error handling remains crucial to catch shape-related exceptions at runtime.


**Example 3:  Function with Variable:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def tf_variable_op(input_tensor, weight_shape):
    with tf.Graph().as_default() as g:
        input_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None], name="input")
        weights = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal(weight_shape), name="weights")
        result = tf.matmul(tf.reshape(input_placeholder, [-1,1]), weights)
        init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()
        with tf.Session(graph=g) as sess:
            sess.run(init_op)
            try:
                return sess.run(result, feed_dict={input_placeholder: input_tensor})
            except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
                print("Error during execution:", e)
                return None

#Usage
input_data = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
weight_shape = [1,3]
output = tf_variable_op(input_data, weight_shape)
print(f"Output with variable: {output}")
```

This example incorporates a `tf.Variable`, demonstrating how to manage trainable parameters within a TensorFlow 1.x function.  The `tf.global_variables_initializer()` is crucial for initializing the variable before execution.  Note that this function will only work once because after it's executed, the variable is initialized in the graph, and subsequent calls will encounter an error unless the variable is reset.  More sophisticated solutions would involve managing the variable outside the function scope.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 1.x documentation, specifically the sections on `tf.Graph`, `tf.Session`, `tf.placeholder`, and `tf.Variable`,  is invaluable.  A comprehensive book on TensorFlow, focusing on the 1.x API, would provide in-depth explanations of graph construction and execution.  Finally, exploring code examples from other developers who worked extensively with TensorFlow 1.x, available on various platforms, is also beneficial for best practices and tackling challenging scenarios.  Pay particular attention to resource management and error handling to avoid common pitfalls.
