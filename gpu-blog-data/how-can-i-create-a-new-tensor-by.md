Tensor manipulation, particularly advanced indexing using index lists, is a cornerstone of efficient deep learning model development.  My experience optimizing large-scale natural language processing models has highlighted the critical role of efficient slicing operations.  Improper indexing can lead to significant performance bottlenecks, especially when dealing with high-dimensional tensors.  The key to effectively creating new tensors from slices using index lists lies in understanding the interplay between NumPy's advanced indexing capabilities and the specific needs of your application.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Creating a new tensor from an existing one using an index list involves selecting specific elements based on their indices.  The index list specifies the row, column, and potentially higher-dimensional indices for the desired elements.  Crucially, the shape of the resulting tensor is determined directly by the shape of the index list.  When dealing with multi-dimensional tensors, the index list itself can be a list of lists, tuples, or NumPy arrays, each corresponding to a dimension.  The crucial element here is that advanced indexing creates a *copy* of the selected data, ensuring that modifications to the new tensor do not affect the original. This behavior differs from basic slicing, which often returns a view, sharing underlying memory with the original tensor.

This method offers significant flexibility compared to basic slicing, allowing for arbitrary element selection, including non-contiguous elements.  However, it's computationally more expensive than basic slicing because it involves explicit element copying. This cost is usually a worthwhile trade-off for the flexibility gained.  Careful consideration should be given to the size of the index list and the resulting tensor's dimensions to avoid memory issues, particularly with extremely large tensors.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple 2D Tensor Slicing**

```python
import numpy as np

# Original tensor
tensor = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                  [4, 5, 6],
                  [7, 8, 9]])

# Index list for rows and columns
row_indices = [0, 2]
col_indices = [1, 2]

# Create the new tensor using advanced indexing
new_tensor = tensor[row_indices, col_indices]

# Output: new_tensor = array([2, 9])
print(new_tensor)

#Illustrating copy behaviour:
new_tensor[0] = 99
print(tensor) # Original tensor remains unchanged.

```

This example demonstrates the basic usage. We select elements (2 and 9) using separate lists for rows and columns. The resulting `new_tensor` is a one-dimensional array containing the selected values.  Importantly, note that modifying `new_tensor` does not alter the original `tensor`.

**Example 2:  Multi-dimensional Tensor Slicing with a List of Lists**

```python
import numpy as np

# 3D tensor
tensor3d = np.arange(27).reshape((3, 3, 3))

# Index list: list of lists
indices = [[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 1]]

# Create new tensor
new_tensor3d = tensor3d[indices]

# Output: new_tensor3d = array([ 1, 10, 26])
print(new_tensor3d)

```
This illustrates slicing a 3D tensor. The `indices` list contains three inner lists, each specifying the index along a particular dimension. The resultant tensor is one-dimensional. The choice of list of lists, instead of, for example, three separate index lists, is crucial for proper multidimensional index specification.

**Example 3:  Boolean Indexing for Conditional Slicing**

```python
import numpy as np

# Original tensor
tensor = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                  [4, 5, 6],
                  [7, 8, 9]])

# Boolean mask to select elements greater than 4
mask = tensor > 4

# Create new tensor using boolean indexing
new_tensor = tensor[mask]

# Output: new_tensor = array([5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
print(new_tensor)

```

While not strictly using a list of indices, Boolean indexing presents a powerful method for selective slicing.  This example uses a boolean mask to select all elements greater than 4.  The output is a flattened array containing all the elements meeting the condition. Boolean indexing is highly efficient for filtering based on element values.  Note the resultant tensor is 1D, regardless of the input shape.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of NumPy's array manipulation capabilities, I strongly recommend thoroughly studying the official NumPy documentation.   Mastering NumPy's broadcasting rules is essential for efficient tensor operations.  The documentation provides detailed explanations and examples covering advanced indexing, array manipulation, and linear algebra functions.  Finally, a good grasp of linear algebra fundamentals is fundamental to comprehending and optimizing tensor operations.  Understanding matrix multiplication, vector spaces, and eigenvectors is crucial for efficient tensor manipulation.
