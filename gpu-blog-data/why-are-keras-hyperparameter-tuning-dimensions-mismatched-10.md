A mismatch in hyperparameter tuning dimensions when using Keras, specifically observing a difference between expected (e.g., 10) and actual (e.g., 20) dimensions, typically stems from the interaction between your search space definition and the internal mechanisms of the chosen hyperparameter tuning library, most often `keras-tuner`. This discrepancy isn't directly a Keras issue but a matter of configuration within the broader hyperparameter optimization framework. I've encountered this firsthand while optimizing a sequence model for time series forecasting; a seemingly simple 10-element search space on learning rates, batch sizes, and number of layers yielded a 20-dimensional space during the tuner's initialization. This unexpected expansion warrants careful examination.

The core problem lies in how discrete choices or multi-option hyperparameters are handled by libraries like Keras Tuner. When you define a hyperparameter as a choice from a set of options, the tuner doesn't treat it as a single dimension. Instead, it often internally represents each option as a separate, independent dimension, which is encoded during the tuning process. This is because the search algorithm, often Bayesian Optimization or Random Search, requires a numerical representation of the search space for effective exploration. Thus, a seemingly singular hyperparameter, say `number_of_units` chosen from the set [32, 64, 128] will be represented by three separate dimensions. For a single search trial, only one will be active which means only one is being 'tuned', but at initialization, the tuning space sees all dimensions.

Let’s consider the following concrete example. Assume you're optimizing a dense neural network. You specify a search space using the following types of hyperparameters:

1.  **`learning_rate`**: A single float value sampled from a continuous space. (One dimension)
2.  **`batch_size`**: A choice from a discrete set, say [32, 64, 128, 256]. (Four dimensions)
3.  **`num_layers`**: A choice from a discrete set, say [2, 3, 4]. (Three dimensions)
4.  **`dropout_rate`**: A float sampled within a continuous range, but only if a certain condition is satisfied. (One or Zero dimension(s))
5.  **`activation`**: A choice of activation functions among ['relu', 'tanh', 'sigmoid']. (Three dimensions)

Based on our explanation, the tuner will not see this as a five-dimensional space. Rather, the total search space dimension will be the sum of dimensions contributed by each of these hyperparameters.  The `learning_rate` and `dropout_rate` each contribute one dimension, `batch_size` contributes four, `num_layers` contributes three, and `activation` contributes three. This gives us a total of 12 dimensions if `dropout_rate` is activated. This highlights the problem: your initial understanding based on the *number of hyperparameters* doesn't equal the dimensionality *of the search space* as understood by the tuner. If `dropout_rate` wasn't activated in any branch of the model definition, then we get 11 dimensions.

Here are three code examples that illustrate the issue and how to interpret it.

**Code Example 1: Basic Dimensionality Mismatch**

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf

def build_model(hp):
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)))
    
    num_layers = hp.Choice('num_layers', [2, 3, 4])
    for i in range(num_layers):
        model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int(f'units_{i}', min_value=32, max_value=256, step=32), activation='relu'))

    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

tuner = kt.RandomSearch(
    build_model,
    objective='val_accuracy',
    max_trials=10,
    directory='my_dir',
    project_name='my_project'
)

tuner.search(x=tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 28, 28)), y=tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 10)), validation_data=(tf.random.normal(shape=(50, 28, 28)), tf.random.normal(shape=(50, 10))), batch_size=32)

print(f"Search Space Dimensions: {len(tuner.oracle.space)}")
```

**Commentary:**

In this example, we have three hyperparameters: `num_layers`, which is a choice among 2, 3, or 4, and `units_i` which is an integer between 32 and 256, with a step size of 32. Note how we use an f-string to vary the name of `units` each iteration. Since `units` is instantiated inside the for loop, it's not a single hyperparameter but a set of independent hyperparameters depending on the choice of `num_layers`. Thus, `num_layers` contributes three dimensions. The number of `units` hyperparameters will vary depending on what `num_layers` is set to. If `num_layers` is equal to 2, there will be two `units` hyperparameters and so each `units_i` contributes its own dimension and there are 7 possible values. if `num_layers` is equal to 3, there will be three `units` hyperparameters. If `num_layers` is equal to 4, there will be four. The overall dimension of the search space in this example is therefore 3 + (2*7) + (3*7) + (4*7), which is equal to 66 but is not directly exposed through `len(tuner.oracle.space)` because `KerasTuner` handles this internally. For an easier time, we can use `hp.Int`, if we define a single `hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=256, step=32)` outside of the loop it will be interpreted as one hyperparameter which will then be used as `units`.

**Code Example 2: Conditional Hyperparameter with `hp.Conditional`**

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf

def build_model(hp):
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)))
    
    use_dropout = hp.Boolean('use_dropout')
    
    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=128, step=32), activation='relu'))
    
    if use_dropout:
        dropout_rate = hp.Float('dropout_rate', min_value=0.1, max_value=0.5, step=0.1)
        model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dropout(rate=dropout_rate))
    
    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

tuner = kt.RandomSearch(
    build_model,
    objective='val_accuracy',
    max_trials=10,
    directory='my_dir2',
    project_name='my_project2'
)

tuner.search(x=tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 28, 28)), y=tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 10)), validation_data=(tf.random.normal(shape=(50, 28, 28)), tf.random.normal(shape=(50, 10))), batch_size=32)
print(f"Search Space Dimensions: {len(tuner.oracle.space)}")
```
**Commentary:**

Here, we introduce a conditional hyperparameter `use_dropout`, which is a `Boolean` type. If `use_dropout` is True, then a `dropout_rate` hyperparameter is added to the model. Even though `dropout_rate` is only active when the condition is true, it still adds a dimension to the tuner’s search space, bringing the total dimensionality to three: `use_dropout`, `units`, and `dropout_rate`. Keras Tuner reserves space for this parameter to ensure proper exploration of the space during optimization.

**Code Example 3: Explicit Choice with `hp.Choice`**

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf

def build_model(hp):
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)))
    
    activation = hp.Choice('activation', ['relu', 'tanh', 'sigmoid'])
    
    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=128, step=32), activation=activation))
    
    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

tuner = kt.RandomSearch(
    build_model,
    objective='val_accuracy',
    max_trials=10,
    directory='my_dir3',
    project_name='my_project3'
)

tuner.search(x=tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 28, 28)), y=tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 10)), validation_data=(tf.random.normal(shape=(50, 28, 28)), tf.random.normal(shape=(50, 10))), batch_size=32)
print(f"Search Space Dimensions: {len(tuner.oracle.space)}")
```

**Commentary:**

In this final example, we use a `hp.Choice` hyperparameter to select the activation function.  `hp.Choice` creates independent dimensions, representing each option within the available options. So, the `activation` hyperparameter adds three dimensions to the search space (one for 'relu', one for 'tanh', and one for 'sigmoid'), in addition to the one from `units`, for a total of four dimensions.

To conclude, the discrepancy in dimensionality arises from the tuner's internal representation of discrete hyperparameters as individual dimensions, even when intuitively they feel like a single parameter with options. This is necessary for the optimization algorithm to function effectively. To understand the true dimensionality of the search space, one must sum the dimensions contributed by each hyperparameter, including the expansion of each choice-based hyperparameter into its respective options. This helps avoid any confusion and allows for a better understanding of the true complexity of the tuning space. I would recommend consulting the Keras Tuner documentation on the specific types of hyperparameters supported and how they impact search space dimensionality. I also advise exploring books on Bayesian Optimization techniques, as those are often used under the hood of hyperparameter tuning libraries and will help you understand the reason behind this discrepancy. Finally, inspecting the tuner object directly during the early stages of a tuning run helps in gaining an accurate understanding of how the search space is being constructed.
