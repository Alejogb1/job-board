TensorFlow model construction using the sequential API, often referred to as "method 1", presents unique challenges for intermediate variable inspection, differing considerably from models built with a more explicitly defined structure, like the functional API. This stems primarily from the abstracted nature of the `tf.keras.Sequential` container. Direct access to and probing of tensor values during the forward pass, a common debugging technique, is not inherently supported within the sequential model's encapsulated execution.

When building sequential models, layers are added as a list, creating a linear stack. Each layer’s output tensor is implicitly passed as the input to the subsequent layer. While this paradigm offers simplicity and speed of development, it obscures the explicit connections and makes inspecting intermediate results cumbersome. Standard Python debugging tools (like `print()` statements or breakpoints) positioned within the model's construction phase will not provide insights into the actual *computed* values of tensors. Instead, they will show the *definition* of the TensorFlow operations; the actual numeric computations occur during model execution, which happens later during training or inference.

The primary strategy for debugging intermediate variables within a sequential model involves extracting intermediate layer outputs via a custom model. This new model, built alongside the original, shares the same layer definitions and weights but returns both the final output and the intermediary tensor values. I’ve employed this approach extensively in my previous deep learning projects, particularly when pinpointing vanishing gradient problems or investigating unexpected model behaviors.

To achieve this, one needs to create a new `tf.keras.Model` instance, explicitly defining its inputs and outputs. The output list of this inspection model should include both the final output of the original sequential model and also the desired intermediate tensors. This approach does not modify the original sequential model; rather, it enables controlled observation during forward propagation.

Below, I present three code examples demonstrating this debugging strategy. Each example builds upon the prior, increasing the complexity and illustrating different scenarios.

**Example 1: Extracting a single intermediate tensor**

In this example, I’ll create a simple sequential model with two dense layers and inspect the output of the first dense layer. This is a fundamental illustration of the technique.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original Sequential Model
original_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax')
])

# Input layer definition for the inspection model
input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(5,))

# Get the output of the first layer from the original model
intermediate_output_1 = original_model.layers[0](input_tensor)

# Get the final output of the second layer
final_output = original_model.layers[1](intermediate_output_1)

# Build the inspection model
inspection_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=[intermediate_output_1, final_output])

# Create a dummy input tensor for demonstration
dummy_input = tf.random.normal((1, 5))

# Get predictions and intermediate layer activation values
intermediate_activation, final_prediction = inspection_model(dummy_input)

# Print shapes for confirmation
print("Intermediate activation shape:", intermediate_activation.shape)
print("Final output shape:", final_prediction.shape)
```

This code snippet defines the `original_model` and then extracts the output of the first dense layer using the `input_tensor` as the input into the first layer. By providing `intermediate_output_1` and `final_output` to the `tf.keras.Model` constructor, the resulting `inspection_model` now returns two outputs whenever it's called. We then generate a dummy input and execute the inspection model to retrieve the intermediate activations and the final prediction, verifying their dimensions.

**Example 2: Extracting multiple intermediate tensors**

Building upon the prior example, this example shows how to extract multiple intermediate tensors. This is often required for deeper neural networks, where multiple layers' outputs might be of interest.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original Sequential Model
original_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(15, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax')
])

# Input layer definition
input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(5,))

# Extract intermediate layer outputs
intermediate_output_1 = original_model.layers[0](input_tensor)
intermediate_output_2 = original_model.layers[1](intermediate_output_1)

# Get the final output of the third layer
final_output = original_model.layers[2](intermediate_output_2)

# Inspection model with intermediate tensors
inspection_model = tf.keras.Model(
    inputs=input_tensor,
    outputs=[intermediate_output_1, intermediate_output_2, final_output]
)

# Create a dummy input for testing
dummy_input = tf.random.normal((1, 5))

# Get prediction and intermediate values
intermediate_activation_1, intermediate_activation_2, final_prediction = inspection_model(dummy_input)

# Print shapes
print("Intermediate activation 1 shape:", intermediate_activation_1.shape)
print("Intermediate activation 2 shape:", intermediate_activation_2.shape)
print("Final output shape:", final_prediction.shape)

```

Here, an additional dense layer is introduced to the `original_model`. The `inspection_model` now includes the outputs from both the first and second dense layers, demonstrating how to simultaneously extract multiple intermediate tensors using the same principles as before. This is crucial when examining information flow and potential bottlenecks.

**Example 3: Extracting named layers by layer index**

For larger, more complex models, directly indexing layers based on their integer position can become error-prone, especially during rapid model development and iterations. Utilizing names to reference layers provides greater clarity and robustness.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original Sequential Model with layer names
original_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,), name='dense_1'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(15, activation='relu', name='dense_2'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax', name='dense_3')
])

# Input Layer
input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(5,))

# Extract Intermediate Layer Outputs by name
intermediate_output_1 = original_model.get_layer('dense_1')(input_tensor)
intermediate_output_2 = original_model.get_layer('dense_2')(intermediate_output_1)

# Extract final output
final_output = original_model.get_layer('dense_3')(intermediate_output_2)

# Inspection Model with named layers
inspection_model = tf.keras.Model(
    inputs=input_tensor,
    outputs=[intermediate_output_1, intermediate_output_2, final_output]
)

# Dummy Input Data
dummy_input = tf.random.normal((1, 5))

# Get predicted values
intermediate_activation_1, intermediate_activation_2, final_prediction = inspection_model(dummy_input)

# Print shapes for validation
print("Intermediate activation 1 shape:", intermediate_activation_1.shape)
print("Intermediate activation 2 shape:", intermediate_activation_2.shape)
print("Final output shape:", final_prediction.shape)
```

In this variant, each layer in the `original_model` is assigned a distinct name. The `get_layer()` method is then used within the `inspection_model` to retrieve the desired layer outputs. This approach makes the code more maintainable and less prone to errors caused by accidental layer reordering in the model definition.

Debugging intermediate results, especially in TensorFlow models, often requires creativity and an understanding of the framework's underlying execution model. Relying solely on breakpoints will yield little progress. The presented approach, leveraging the `tf.keras.Model` to create a diagnostic "mirror" model is robust and adaptable.

For further exploration of TensorFlow debugging and profiling techniques, I would recommend consulting these resources: the official TensorFlow guide to debugging (specifically look for documentation sections on tracing execution), the TensorFlow profiler documentation, which describes tools to identify bottlenecks, and resources focused on numerical stability considerations. These resources will help solidify understanding beyond the basic techniques I've shown and provide a framework for a comprehensive debugging strategy.
