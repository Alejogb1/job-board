The core issue stems from the variable scope within which `k` is defined, and its attempted access within the FeatureLayer lambda's execution context. When a lambda function, like the one used in FeatureLayer, is defined, it captures variables from its surrounding scope *at the time of definition*. However, if these captured variables are modified *after* the lambda's definition but *before* its execution, the lambda function will use the *final* value of the variable, not the value present during its creation. Critically, in many cases, such as loops, the variable itself may not exist when the lambda is actually invoked, resulting in an `undefined` state.

Let's examine this within a spatial data context, as implied by the use of `FeatureLayer`, a common construct in geospatial libraries like ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Suppose I'm programmatically constructing feature layers based on user-defined parameters, and I intend to use a loop to create several layers, each accessing a specific attribute based on an incrementing index. My initial intuition might lead to the following approach:

```javascript
  let layers = [];
  for (let k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
      let layer = new FeatureLayer({
          url: "https://example.com/FeatureServer",
          outFields: ["OBJECTID", "attribute_" + k], // Attempt to access 'k' here
          title: "Layer " + k,
          opacity: 0.8
      });
      layers.push(layer);
  }
  map.addMany(layers);
```

Here, the intention is to create three layers: "Layer 0" using "attribute_0", "Layer 1" using "attribute_1", and "Layer 2" using "attribute_2". However, this code snippet will very likely result in *all* three layers attempting to access `attribute_3`, or possibly throwing an error because the variable `k` isn't available when the lambda is invoked within `FeatureLayer`. This is because the `FeatureLayer` constructor doesn't execute immediately, but typically establishes the layer using asynchronous operations (data fetches, rendering etc.). By the time these operations execute, the loop has completed, and `k` will have a final value of 3, and potentially be outside the scope where the FeatureLayer's lamdba function is executing. It’s important to remember that the `outFields` array is not resolved instantly. The evaluation of the string `"attribute_" + k` inside the constructor happens only when the FeatureLayer is finally being used.

The fundamental problem lies in how JavaScript closures work. When the FeatureLayer constructor is called within the loop, it captures the *reference* to the variable `k`, not its current value. When the lambda function is eventually executed, it tries to access the *final* value of `k`, or it finds that `k` is no longer accessible due to the variable's loop scope. As such, the string literal expression isn’t resolved until long after the loop has exited and the `k` variable's current value is lost.

To correctly achieve the desired outcome, the variable `k` must be captured correctly within a different scope that will maintain its respective values during each iteration. I achieve this by creating a new function scope within each loop iteration, where the current value of `k` is passed as an argument to that scope and becomes its own `localK` variable. This new variable with its unique value, is then captured within the FeatureLayer's closure.

```javascript
let layers = [];
for (let k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
    (function(localK) {
        let layer = new FeatureLayer({
            url: "https://example.com/FeatureServer",
            outFields: ["OBJECTID", "attribute_" + localK],
            title: "Layer " + localK,
            opacity: 0.8
        });
        layers.push(layer);
    })(k);
}
map.addMany(layers);
```

In this revised example, the immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) creates a new scope for each loop iteration. The current value of `k` is passed to the IIFE as `localK`. Because `localK` is a *local* variable within that new scope, it is captured *by value*, maintaining the unique value for each layer instance created within the lambda. Now, each layer will correctly reference `attribute_0`, `attribute_1`, and `attribute_2` respectively. This pattern effectively isolates each layer from the subsequent modifications of the loop's variable `k`.

Another common way to mitigate this problem, especially within modern javascript frameworks, is to rely on the `let` keyword instead of `var`. By declaring `k` using `let`, JavaScript will create a unique lexical binding for `k` on each iteration of the `for` loop. Thus each closure will have its own captured `k`, resolved to the proper value when the FeatureLayer's asynchronous actions take place. This removes the need for an explicit scope function as the scope management is done implicitly. The improved version using `let` is:

```javascript
let layers = [];
for (let k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
    let layer = new FeatureLayer({
        url: "https://example.com/FeatureServer",
        outFields: ["OBJECTID", "attribute_" + k],
        title: "Layer " + k,
        opacity: 0.8
    });
    layers.push(layer);
}
map.addMany(layers);
```

This example, using `let`, achieves the same goal as the IIFE example without the added function wrapping. The core principal of lexical scoping remains the same: each iteration of the loop is creating a unique instance of k that is then captured by the lambda function. This avoids the problem of all lambdas accessing a single, final k value. I should emphasize that relying on `var` would exhibit the error described in the initial problematic example.

In practice, I've found that understanding these scoping subtleties is crucial for avoiding asynchronous headaches, not only when working with `FeatureLayer` but also when encountering similar closure-related issues with event handlers or other delayed computations. Always be mindful of the scope where a function (lambda or not) is *defined* and the scope where it is *executed*, especially when dealing with looping constructs.

For further exploration, I would recommend focusing on literature discussing JavaScript’s closure mechanisms, particularly in relation to loops and asynchronous operations. The concept of lexical scoping and the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` are paramount. Books and online resources that elaborate on asynchronous javascript programming should be of particular focus, as this situation is a common case in this particular paradigm.  Additionally, a review of tutorials or articles focusing on common JavaScript pitfalls and debugging techniques will help to build a more robust understanding of these scenarios.  Practicing these concepts with varying scenarios and examining output via debugger tools can help reinforce understanding.
