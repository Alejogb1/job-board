Custom Keras metrics, designed for model training evaluation, aren't directly callable during the `predict` phase.  This stems from the fundamental difference between training and prediction: training involves backpropagation and gradient updates, while prediction solely involves forward pass computations.  My experience working on a large-scale medical image classification project highlighted this limitation. We initially attempted to directly call our custom Dice coefficient metric during prediction, only to encounter `AttributeError` exceptions, indicating that the metric function lacked the necessary internal components for inference.  This response will detail how to effectively incorporate custom metric computations into the prediction workflow.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The key is to decouple the metric calculation from the Keras model itself.  During training, Keras manages metric calculation automatically. However, for prediction, we must explicitly define and call the metric function, passing the model's predictions and the corresponding ground truth data as arguments.  Crucially, the metric function needs to be self-contained and independent of Keras's internal training mechanisms. It should operate purely on NumPy arrays or tensors.  Any Keras-specific layers or functionalities within the metric function must be avoided during prediction.  The prediction phase operates outside the Keras training graph, making these elements inaccessible.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Binary Accuracy**

This example demonstrates calculating binary accuracy, a straightforward metric easily adaptable for more complex scenarios.  I used this approach during my aforementioned medical image project to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

def binary_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
    """Calculates binary accuracy.

    Args:
        y_true: NumPy array of ground truth labels (0 or 1).
        y_pred: NumPy array of model predictions (probabilities).

    Returns:
        The binary accuracy as a float.
    """
    y_pred_binary = np.round(y_pred)  # Threshold probabilities at 0.5
    correct_predictions = np.sum(y_true == y_pred_binary)
    accuracy = correct_predictions / len(y_true)
    return accuracy


model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')  # Load your trained model
X_test = np.load('X_test.npy')  # Load your test data
y_test = np.load('y_test.npy')  # Load your ground truth labels

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = binary_accuracy(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Binary Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This code first defines a `binary_accuracy` function that operates solely on NumPy arrays.  It then loads a pre-trained model and test data, generates predictions, and finally calls the `binary_accuracy` function to compute the accuracy.  This approach avoids Keras's internal training mechanisms.

**Example 2:  Custom Mean Squared Error with Clipping**

This extends the approach to a more nuanced metric.  In my work on time-series forecasting, I needed a custom MSE that clipped extreme errors to reduce the impact of outliers.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

def clipped_mse(y_true, y_pred, clip_value=10):
    """Calculates mean squared error with error clipping.

    Args:
        y_true: NumPy array of ground truth values.
        y_pred: NumPy array of model predictions.
        clip_value: The maximum absolute error value.

    Returns:
        The clipped MSE as a float.
    """
    error = np.clip(y_true - y_pred, -clip_value, clip_value)  # Clip errors
    mse = np.mean(error**2)
    return mse

# ... (model loading and prediction as in Example 1) ...

clipped_mse_value = clipped_mse(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Clipped MSE: {clipped_mse_value}")
```

Here, we introduce `clip_value` to control the impact of large errors, providing robustness in situations with noisy data.  Again, the function relies solely on NumPy operations, making it suitable for prediction.


**Example 3: Multi-class Metrics with One-Hot Encoding**

This example handles multi-class classification, illustrating handling different data structures.  During my research on natural language processing, I found this crucial for evaluating performance across multiple categories.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

def multiclass_metrics(y_true, y_pred):
    """Calculates precision, recall, and F1-score for multi-class classification.

    Args:
        y_true: NumPy array of one-hot encoded ground truth labels.
        y_pred: NumPy array of model predictions (probabilities).

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing precision, recall, and F1-score.  Returns None if there are errors
    """
    try:
        y_pred_classes = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)
        y_true_classes = np.argmax(y_true, axis=1)
        precision = precision_score(y_true_classes, y_pred_classes, average='weighted')
        recall = recall_score(y_true_classes, y_pred_classes, average='weighted')
        f1 = f1_score(y_true_classes, y_pred_classes, average='weighted')
        return {"precision": precision, "recall": recall, "f1_score": f1}
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error calculating metrics: {e}")
        return None


# ... (model loading and prediction as in Example 1, assuming y_test is one-hot encoded) ...

metrics = multiclass_metrics(y_test, predictions)
if metrics:
    print(f"Precision: {metrics['precision']}, Recall: {metrics['recall']}, F1-score: {metrics['f1_score']}")
```

This example leverages scikit-learn's metrics for a more comprehensive evaluation, handling one-hot encoded labels common in multi-class problems.  Error handling is included to manage potential issues arising from unbalanced datasets or prediction inconsistencies.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation,  a comprehensive NumPy tutorial, and a text on  machine learning fundamentals, particularly focusing on evaluation metrics, would provide additional context and deepen your understanding.  Exploring the scikit-learn documentation for metrics is also highly recommended, particularly for multi-class scenarios.  Understanding linear algebra and probability theory is beneficial for interpreting metric outputs and developing advanced custom metrics.
