The core issue stems from a mismatch between your model's output layer dimensionality and the desired target array shape.  Your model currently predicts a vector of length 100 (`(None, 100)`), while your target data consists of 6985 vectors, each of length 10 (`(6985, 10)`).  This discrepancy indicates a fundamental design flaw in either your model architecture or your data pre-processing pipeline.  Over the course of several projects involving multi-label classification and regression tasks, I’ve encountered similar problems, and the solutions typically involve modifying the output layer and potentially restructuring the target data.

**1. Explanation:**

The `(None, 100)` output shape signifies a variable-length batch dimension (`None`) and a 100-dimensional feature vector. This suggests your model is designed for a task where each input produces a 100-dimensional output.  However, your target data, `(6985, 10)`, represents 6985 samples, each with 10 features.  This indicates a significant difference: your model is predicting 100 values, while your target only provides 10. This incompatibility manifests as a shape mismatch during training.  Therefore, the solution hinges on aligning these dimensions.

There are several ways to achieve this alignment. The optimal approach depends on the nature of your task. If your task involves multi-label classification with 10 classes, your model's output layer should have a dimensionality of 10, not 100.  If your task involves regression where you are predicting 10 continuous values, the output layer should again have a dimensionality of 10.  If you’re attempting a more complex task where 100 values are indeed relevant, then you must re-evaluate your data preparation process to ensure it aligns with your model architecture.


**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples assume you're using Keras with TensorFlow backend.  Adjustments for other frameworks like PyTorch would be analogous.

**Example 1: Multi-label Classification (10 classes)**

This example assumes your task is multi-label classification, where each sample can belong to multiple classes out of 10.  The model's output layer uses a sigmoid activation to produce probabilities for each class.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... your existing layers ...
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='sigmoid') # Output layer with 10 units and sigmoid activation
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy', #Appropriate loss function for multi-label classification
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Reshape your target data if necessary to match the output shape.
# This assumes your target data is a NumPy array.
target_data = target_data.reshape(-1, 10)


model.fit(training_data, target_data, epochs=10)
```

**Commentary:** The key change here is the output layer.  It now has 10 units, representing the 10 classes.  The `binary_crossentropy` loss function is appropriate for multi-label classification because it operates independently on each class probability. The target data reshaping ensures its compatibility with the new output.


**Example 2: Regression (10 continuous outputs)**

If your task is regression, where you're predicting 10 continuous values, the output layer should use a linear activation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... your existing layers ...
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='linear') # Output layer with 10 units and linear activation
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='mse', # Mean Squared Error loss function suitable for regression
              metrics=['mae']) # Mean Absolute Error metric for regression

# Target data should already be in the (6985, 10) shape. No reshaping is required here.

model.fit(training_data, target_data, epochs=10)
```

**Commentary:** This example utilizes a linear activation in the output layer, suitable for predicting continuous values. Mean Squared Error (`mse`) is a common loss function for regression, and Mean Absolute Error (`mae`) is a useful metric.  No reshaping of the target data is typically necessary in this case.

**Example 3:  Addressing a potential dimensionality problem with a bottleneck layer**

This example addresses a scenario where your initial model architecture is indeed intended to produce 100 values, but there's an issue with the data mapping.  This often requires a re-evaluation of feature engineering or data generation processes.  However, a potential intermediate step involves adding a bottleneck layer that reduces the dimensionality.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... your existing layers ...
    keras.layers.Dense(50, activation='relu'), # Bottleneck layer
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='linear') # Output layer with 10 units
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='mse',
              metrics=['mae'])

#Careful preprocessing and feature engineering may be required.  
# This is where domain expertise becomes crucial.

model.fit(training_data, target_data, epochs=10)
```

**Commentary:**  This introduces a bottleneck layer to reduce the dimensionality from (None, 100) to (None, 50) before producing the final 10 outputs. This isn't a perfect solution, and may indicate problems upstream in feature engineering, data cleaning, or model design. However, it might help find an approximate mapping if the initial 100 features contain relevant information that needs to be condensed.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of neural network architectures and Keras, I recommend consulting the official Keras documentation and various textbooks on deep learning.  Furthermore, exploring online resources focusing on multi-label classification and regression techniques will provide valuable insights into selecting appropriate loss functions and metrics.  Study the documentation of your chosen deep learning framework meticulously, paying attention to the details of layer configurations and training parameters. The most effective way to resolve these issues is to have a thorough grasp of your data and the problem you're trying to solve. Carefully examining your data's statistical properties and visualizing it is crucial before making any architectural decisions. This rigorous approach will always lead to more robust and accurate models.
