The difficulty in debugging custom Keras metrics for path planning, particularly when they produce unexpected or NaN (Not a Number) outputs, often stems from a subtle mismatch between the metric's intended mathematical formulation and its actual implementation using TensorFlow operations. This is especially true in domains like path planning, where metrics may involve complex geometric calculations and variable length sequences, and where backpropagation interacts unexpectedly with custom logic.

My experience building navigation systems for simulated robotic platforms highlighted this issue. Initially, my custom metric designed to penalize inefficient path geometries consistently produced NaN outputs. The intended metric involved calculating the ratio of the actual path length to the shortest possible path, but I encountered issues with zero-length paths and unhandled edge cases within the TensorFlow graph.

The primary problem is that TensorFlow operations, while offering efficient numerical computation, strictly adhere to tensor shapes and numerical properties. This requires rigorous handling of edge cases that might be intuitively straightforward outside of a computational graph. Specifically, operations such as divisions, square roots, and trigonometric calculations, which are common in path planning metrics, can return NaN under certain conditions if not properly guarded against. When backpropagation calculates gradients through these potentially NaN-producing operations, it compounds the problem, resulting in entire optimization processes becoming unusable.

Consider, for example, the case where a predicted path is effectively zero-length (i.e., the robot remains stationary). A simple ratio calculation of *actual path length / optimal path length* would become 0/x = 0 in most cases, except when x itself is zero which would become 0/0 which is undefined. Naively implemented, this would generate a NaN, breaking the training cycle. Similarly, calculating the Euclidean distance with very small values could result in tiny gradients that are effectively zero, hindering training.

A crucial step for debugging such issues is to decompose the custom metric into its constituent parts. This allows step-by-step examination of the intermediate tensor values, identifying exactly where NaNs are introduced. TensorFlow's debugger tools are invaluable for this type of analysis, as is the usage of `tf.print()` for rudimentary observation. Below are specific examples of the pitfalls encountered and how I addressed them within my path-planning context.

**Example 1: Naive Path Length Calculation**

Initially, I employed a simplistic, albeit flawed, approach to calculating path length. The path was represented as a tensor of point coordinates and was intended to be a sequence of locations in x, y space. The metric calculation is shown below.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def naive_path_length(y_true, y_pred):
    """Naive path length calculation that can produce NaNs."""
    diffs = tf.sqrt(tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(y_pred[1:] - y_pred[:-1]), axis=-1))
    path_length = tf.reduce_sum(diffs)
    return path_length
```

*Commentary:*

This `naive_path_length` function takes two arguments `y_true` and `y_pred`, where `y_pred` is the predicted path as a tensor. It calculates the difference between subsequent points along the path, squares them, sums them, and takes the square root to get the euclidean distance between those points. Then the function sums up those distances to obtain the path length. However, if `y_pred` contains sequences where the difference between points is zero, the sum of squares and subsequent square root may cause backpropagation to be difficult or result in Nan values. Additionally, this example ignores `y_true` entirely and can produce NaN if `y_pred` has a zero length. This implementation lacks crucial checks for path validity and produces Nan if the distance is zero.

**Example 2: Introducing Numerical Stability**

To address the NaN issue from the prior example, I revised the path length calculation and added a small constant to prevent zero-division or zero inputs to square root calculations. This addresses the most frequent source of NaN errors.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def stable_path_length(y_true, y_pred):
    """More stable path length with a small constant for numerical stability."""
    epsilon = 1e-7  # Small constant
    diffs = tf.sqrt(tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(y_pred[1:] - y_pred[:-1]), axis=-1) + epsilon)
    path_length = tf.reduce_sum(diffs)
    return path_length
```

*Commentary:*

This `stable_path_length` function does a similar calculation to the prior function, but includes a small constant `epsilon` when calculating the euclidean distance between points. The addition of this small constant to the difference of each point in the path prevents the square root operation from returning Nan, which is a common problem in these kinds of calculations. However, this does not address problems which can occur with other parts of the full metric. This highlights the importance of making each step of the overall calculation more stable. This example still ignores `y_true` entirely and does not include any normalization by a target or optimal path length.

**Example 3: Comprehensive Path Metric with Edge Case Handling**

The ultimate resolution involved crafting a more comprehensive metric that addresses the ratio between actual and optimal path lengths and introduces several additional checks for edge cases to prevent numerical instability issues. It also incorporates `y_true` for use in the comparison.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def path_efficiency_metric(y_true, y_pred):
    """Comprehensive path efficiency metric with edge case handling."""
    epsilon = 1e-7
    
    # Calculate predicted path length
    pred_diffs = tf.sqrt(tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(y_pred[1:] - y_pred[:-1]), axis=-1) + epsilon)
    pred_path_length = tf.reduce_sum(pred_diffs)

    # Calculate true path length (assuming y_true has at least two points)
    true_diffs = tf.sqrt(tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(y_true[1:] - y_true[:-1]), axis=-1) + epsilon)
    true_path_length = tf.reduce_sum(true_diffs)
    
    # Avoid division by zero by ensuring true_path_length is greater than epsilon
    safe_divisor = tf.maximum(true_path_length, epsilon)
    
    # Calculate path efficiency
    efficiency = pred_path_length / safe_divisor

    return efficiency
```

*Commentary:*

In `path_efficiency_metric` I calculated both `y_pred` and `y_true` path lengths and have added the constant epsilon to ensure that the `sqrt` operation is stable. Then, before performing the ratio calculation, I have added a safeguard to ensure that `true_path_length` is at least the constant epsilon so as to ensure there is no division by zero. The true and predicted lengths are calculated using the same approach used in the previous examples. Note that this example assumes the `y_true` argument represents an optimal path and is not some other value. The return value is the efficiency rating between the two paths. This more complete version of the metric demonstrates how a stable metric can be built with a variety of edge-case protections.

Key lessons I learned from this debugging process are that custom metrics require careful treatment of numerical stability issues and consideration of edge cases, particularly when dividing, taking roots, or handling small or zero values. Careful verification of the tensors and the calculations is key to identifying issues, and this can be done through the use of tools such as TensorFlow's debugger or `tf.print()`. Backpropagation can compound errors, so it is best to make each individual operation stable. Decomposing the metric into smaller pieces makes troubleshooting more manageable.

In terms of resources that might prove helpful, I would suggest exploring documentation of TensorFlow operations and their mathematical properties, focusing especially on functions that can return NaNs. Studying robust numerical computation techniques, such as how to prevent divide-by-zero errors, can also be beneficial. Also, reviewing the TensorFlow debugging toolkit will also aid in the resolution of such issues. Finally, studying examples of implementations of distance and similarity measures within TensorFlow can provide crucial insights on how to implement stable operations.
