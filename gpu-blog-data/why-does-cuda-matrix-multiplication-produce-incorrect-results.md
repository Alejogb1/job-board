Incorrect results in CUDA matrix multiplication for large matrices stem primarily from insufficient consideration of memory bandwidth limitations and potential for numerical instability.  In my experience optimizing high-performance computing applications, exceeding the memory bandwidth readily leads to performance bottlenecks that manifest as incorrect or corrupted results.  This isn't necessarily a bug in CUDA itself, but rather a consequence of exceeding the hardware's capabilities without employing appropriate optimization strategies.  The problem is exacerbated with increasing matrix size due to the compounding effect of limited memory access.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

CUDA's strength lies in its parallel processing capabilities.  However, efficiently utilizing this parallelism requires careful consideration of data movement.  Large matrices necessitate significant data transfers between the host (CPU) and the device (GPU) memory.  If the memory bandwidth cannot sustain the required data transfer rate, the kernels executing matrix multiplication operations will starve for data.  This starvation results in incomplete or incorrect calculations because the GPU threads are operating on stale or incomplete data.

Another crucial factor is numerical instability.  Matrix multiplication inherently involves numerous floating-point operations.  The accumulation of rounding errors during these operations can become significant with larger matrices, leading to deviations from the mathematically correct result.  The limited precision of floating-point numbers (single or double precision) further amplifies this effect.  Finally, inefficient memory access patterns within the kernel can lead to coalesced memory access issues further degrading performance and potentially introducing errors.

Addressing these issues requires a multi-pronged approach encompassing optimized memory management, algorithm selection, and careful handling of numerical precision.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different approaches to matrix multiplication in CUDA, highlighting the potential pitfalls and solutions for large matrices.  These examples are simplified for clarity but demonstrate the underlying principles.  In my past projects involving large-scale simulations, these optimizations were crucial.

**Example 1: Naive Approach (Inefficient):**

```cuda
__global__ void naiveMatrixMult(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int N) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < N && col < N) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k) {
            sum += A[row * N + k] * B[k * N + col];
        }
        C[row * N + col] = sum;
    }
}
```

This naive approach suffers from significant memory access inefficiencies.  Each thread accesses memory elements in a non-coalesced manner, leading to significant overhead.  For large matrices, this inefficiency severely impacts performance and can result in incomplete computations.  Memory bandwidth limitations will severely constrain this kernel's performance.

**Example 2: Optimized Approach with Tiled Matrix Multiplication:**

```cuda
__global__ void tiledMatrixMult(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int N, int tileSize) {
    __shared__ float tileA[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];
    __shared__ float tileB[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];

    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int globalRow = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int globalCol = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int k = 0; k < N; k += tileSize) {
        if (globalRow < N && k + threadIdx.x < N)
            tileA[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = A[globalRow * N + k + threadIdx.x];
        if (k + threadIdx.y < N && globalCol < N)
            tileB[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = B[(k + threadIdx.y) * N + globalCol];
        __syncthreads();

        for (int i = 0; i < tileSize; ++i) {
            sum += tileA[threadIdx.y][i] * tileB[i][threadIdx.x];
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }

    if (row < N && col < N)
        C[row * N + col] = sum;
}
```

This example uses tiling to improve memory access patterns.  By loading smaller tiles of the matrices into shared memory, threads access memory in a coalesced manner, significantly improving bandwidth utilization.  The `__syncthreads()` calls ensure data consistency between threads within a block.  This technique is crucial for mitigating memory bandwidth limitations, enabling efficient handling of larger matrices.  The `tileSize` parameter should be tuned based on the specific GPU architecture.

**Example 3: Handling Numerical Instability with Double Precision:**

```cuda
__global__ void doublePrecisionMatrixMult(const double *A, const double *B, double *C, int N) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < N && col < N) {
        double sum = 0.0;
        for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k) {
            sum += A[row * N + k] * B[k * N + col];
        }
        C[row * N + col] = sum;
    }
}
```

This example simply changes the data type to `double`.  Using double-precision floating-point numbers reduces the impact of rounding errors, thus improving the accuracy of the result, especially for large matrices where the accumulation of errors can become significant. The performance cost is an increase in memory usage and computational time, but this is a trade-off often necessary for maintaining accuracy.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To further enhance your understanding and address challenges with CUDA matrix multiplication for large matrices, I strongly recommend consulting the CUDA C Programming Guide and the CUDA Best Practices Guide.  Additionally, familiarizing yourself with the specifics of your target GPU's architecture and memory bandwidth capabilities is essential for effective optimization.  A thorough understanding of linear algebra principles and numerical methods will also be beneficial.  Exploring advanced techniques like using cuBLAS or other optimized libraries for matrix operations is highly recommended for production-level code.  Profiling tools like NVIDIA Nsight can pinpoint performance bottlenecks.
