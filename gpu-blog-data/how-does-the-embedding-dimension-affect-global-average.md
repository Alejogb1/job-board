The dimensionality of the embedding space in a natural language processing (NLP) model directly dictates the information density available to subsequent layers, including global average pooling (GAP), impacting the model's capacity to learn complex patterns. My experience developing text classification and sentiment analysis systems has consistently shown that the chosen embedding dimension is not a hyperparameter to be treated lightly; its influence on GAP performance, specifically in capturing the overall document semantics, is profound.

Global Average Pooling, unlike max pooling, calculates the average activation across the spatial dimensions of a feature map. In NLP, particularly when applied after a recurrent or convolutional sequence processing layer, the feature map's spatial dimensions typically correspond to the sequence length. Consequently, GAP collapses the temporal information into a single vector, which, in theory, represents a summarized representation of the entire sequence. The effectiveness of this summarized representation hinges heavily on the quality and richness of the input feature maps, which, in turn, are directly influenced by the embedding dimension. A higher embedding dimension provides a richer vector space capable of capturing subtle nuances in the input tokens’ relationships. Conversely, a lower dimension may lead to information bottlenecks, resulting in the GAP layer receiving an impoverished representation that is not discriminative enough to produce effective final classification or regression outcomes.

Consider a scenario where we are classifying customer reviews for product satisfaction. A low embedding dimension, say 32, might only distinguish between the most basic semantic contrasts – “good” versus “bad.” In this case, subtle differences between “amazing,” “great,” and “acceptable” are likely to be compressed into a single space, or lost entirely during averaging by GAP. This limitation is amplified by the averaging process, since the already less expressive embedding is pooled, further diminishing fine-grained differences.

Conversely, an embedding dimension that is too large, such as 512 or 1024, while theoretically offering greater capacity, might introduce unnecessary noise and overfitting, particularly if the available training data is limited. The model might overfit to specific word combinations rather than learning generalizable sentiment patterns and the high-dimensional embedding might contain irrelevant dimensions that are not useful for the downstream task. These unused dimensions will also contribute to the computation required by the GAP layer and subsequent layers. Therefore, finding the sweet spot through careful experimentation is crucial.

Let's examine some illustrative Keras code. We'll start with a model using a relatively small embedding dimension:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 64
sequence_length = 100

# Example 1: Low embedding dimension
model_low_dim = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim, input_length=sequence_length),
    layers.Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
    layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_low_dim.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_low_dim.summary()
```
Here, `embedding_dim` is set to 64.  The embedding layer converts each token into a 64-dimensional vector. The `Conv1D` layer operates on these embeddings, extracting local features. GAP then pools these features across the temporal dimension before producing a final single output by the dense layer. When training a binary classification model on review data with this model structure, I have observed that performance is typically limited because of the constrained embedding. The network has difficulty disambiguating subtle variations and often underperforms, particularly on longer reviews.

Now consider a model with a more substantial embedding dimension:

```python
# Example 2: Medium embedding dimension
embedding_dim = 256

model_medium_dim = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim, input_length=sequence_length),
    layers.Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
    layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_medium_dim.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_medium_dim.summary()

```
In this example, the embedding dimension has been increased to 256. With a four-fold increase, this enables a wider range of semantic relationships between tokens to be represented.  Training models like this has usually resulted in improved accuracy metrics and a better ability to generalize to unseen data. The trade-off is an increase in computational resources during training and inference and the risk of overfitting if training data is sparse.

Finally, let’s examine a high-dimensional embedding scenario.

```python
# Example 3: High embedding dimension
embedding_dim = 512

model_high_dim = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim, input_length=sequence_length),
    layers.Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
    layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_high_dim.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_high_dim.summary()
```
The `embedding_dim` here is now 512.  In my experience with models using embedding dimensions in this range, performance gains, while sometimes attainable, often come with a substantial cost in terms of computation. In some cases, I have even observed decreased performance due to overfitting on spurious patterns in the training set. The model may end up memorizing nuances of specific reviews, rather than actually understanding the sentiment expressed in the text. It's critical to note, that simply increasing dimensions doesn't always lead to improved results. The training data volume and complexity play a significant role in determining the optimal setting for the embedding dimension, as does the overall model architecture.

To select the correct embedding dimension, consider the complexity of the task and the dataset size. If dealing with simple sentiment analysis, or small data sets, a lower dimension might be adequate, and even advantageous for avoiding overfitting. In more complex tasks involving nuanced language understanding or extensive data sets, a higher dimension would be a viable starting point but should be thoroughly validated through rigorous experimentation, such as techniques like cross-validation or using held out validation sets. I typically start with a moderate value, such as 128 or 256, and then proceed to fine-tune the embedding dimension based on the validation performance. The optimal dimension depends heavily on the specific task and data at hand, and there is no universally best setting.

For further study, I recommend examining academic texts on word embeddings to deepen the theoretical understanding of embedding space. Research papers on convolutional neural networks in NLP would provide context for the convolutional layers preceding the Global Average Pooling layer. Also, literature focused on hyperparameter optimization provides practical guidance on how to evaluate various embedding dimensions effectively. These resources, combined with practical experimentation, are essential for successfully incorporating embedding dimension adjustments into effective NLP models using GAP.
