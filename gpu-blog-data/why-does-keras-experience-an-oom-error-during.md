The core issue behind Keras encountering an Out-of-Memory (OOM) error during fine-tuning but not during initial training often stems from the drastically increased memory footprint associated with managing both the original model weights and the newly added or modified layers, coupled with the gradient calculations required for backpropagation across the expanded model.  My experience troubleshooting this across several large-scale image recognition projects has consistently pointed towards this memory management bottleneck as the primary culprit.  Initial training, by comparison, deals with a smaller, more defined model architecture, resulting in a comparatively lower memory demand.

Let's break down the contributing factors and examine this through practical examples.

**1.  Expanded Model Architecture:**  Fine-tuning fundamentally alters the model's architecture.  You are not simply training on a pre-existing model; you are adding layers, modifying existing ones (e.g., unfreezing layers for further training), or potentially even combining multiple models.  This immediately expands the number of trainable parameters, directly increasing the memory required to store the model weights, gradients, and optimizer states.  During initial training, you start with a model of a pre-defined size, with a known and manageable parameter count.  The memory allocation can be readily accommodated.  However, adding layers, even relatively small ones, can significantly multiply this requirement.  This effect is further compounded if your fine-tuning strategy involves adding layers that are densely connected to the pre-trained layers, particularly in models with deep architectures.

**2.  Gradient Accumulation and Backpropagation:**  The backpropagation process, the core of training, involves calculating gradients across the entire expanded model architecture during fine-tuning. This necessitates storing intermediate activation values and gradients for all layers.  The memory burden increases significantly compared to initial training where the calculation is confined to the original, smaller model.  The larger the model, the more activations and gradients need to be retained in memory, directly contributing to OOM issues.

**3.  Batch Size Considerations:**  While not always the direct cause, batch size plays a crucial role.  A larger batch size reduces the number of training iterations but dramatically increases the memory consumption during each iteration, as it requires storing activations and gradients for the entire batch.  During fine-tuning, you might unintentionally keep the batch size large, exacerbating the memory limitations compared to the possibly smaller batch size utilized during initial training due to resource constraints. This becomes particularly pronounced when working with large datasets and complex architectures.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Fine-tuning with added layers, demonstrating memory concerns:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Load pre-trained model
base_model = keras.applications.ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze base model layers
base_model.trainable = False

# Add custom classification head
x = base_model.output
x = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)

# Create fine-tuned model
model = keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Compile and train (potential OOM here due to increased parameters)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, batch_size=32, epochs=10) #Potential OOM here
```

This code demonstrates a common fine-tuning approach.  Adding dense layers (`Dense(1024)`, `Dense(num_classes)`) significantly increases the number of parameters.  A large batch size (32 in this example) further amplifies the memory usage during training.  Reducing the batch size or using techniques like gradient accumulation (explained later) might mitigate the OOM.

**Example 2:  Unfreezing layers, further increasing memory demands:**

```python
# ... (load base_model as in Example 1) ...

# Unfreeze some layers of the base model
for layer in base_model.layers[-5:]:  #Unfreeze last 5 layers for example
    layer.trainable = True

# ... (add custom head as in Example 1) ...

# Compile and train (OOM more likely due to increased trainable parameters)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, batch_size=32, epochs=10) #Higher likelihood of OOM
```

Unfreezing layers in the pre-trained model makes even more parameters trainable, greatly escalating the memory pressure during gradient calculations.  The impact depends on the depth of the unfrozen layers.  Unfreezing deeper layers generally leads to a greater increase in memory consumption.

**Example 3: Implementing Gradient Accumulation to reduce memory footprint:**

```python
import numpy as np

# ... (load and modify model as in Example 1 or 2) ...

accumulation_steps = 4 #Example value
batch_size = 8 #Smaller batch size

# Modify training loop for gradient accumulation
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch_idx in range(len(train_data) // batch_size):
        accumulated_grads = None
        for i in range(accumulation_steps):
            mini_batch_x, mini_batch_y = train_data[batch_idx*batch_size + i*batch_size:(batch_idx+1)*batch_size + i*batch_size], train_labels[batch_idx*batch_size + i*batch_size:(batch_idx+1)*batch_size + i*batch_size]
            with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
                loss = model.compiled_loss(mini_batch_y, model(mini_batch_x))
            grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
            if accumulated_grads is None:
                accumulated_grads = [np.zeros_like(g) for g in grads]
            for j, g in enumerate(grads):
                accumulated_grads[j] += g

        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(accumulated_grads, model.trainable_variables))
```

This example illustrates gradient accumulation.  By accumulating gradients over multiple smaller batches before applying them, the effective batch size is increased without increasing the memory required for a single forward and backward pass.  This is a crucial technique for handling large models and datasets where OOM errors are prevalent.

By carefully considering model architecture, batch size, and employing techniques like gradient accumulation, one can effectively manage memory consumption and prevent OOM errors during fine-tuning, even when dealing with large and complex models. Remember to profile your memory usage to pinpoint the exact bottleneck during fine-tuning for optimal debugging and mitigation strategies.
