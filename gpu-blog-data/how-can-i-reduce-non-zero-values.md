The core challenge in reducing non-zero values within a dataset lies in determining the specific reduction behavior required. "Reducing" is ambiguous; it could mean decreasing magnitude, compressing range, applying a logarithmic transformation, or even something contextually specific. Before any transformation, we must define what constitutes 'reduction' within the problem's framework. I've encountered various scenarios where simply diminishing values wasn't the goal; the intent was often to reshape the distribution or emphasize relative differences while decreasing absolute magnitude.

The first consideration is the type of data: integer, floating-point, or even categorical data encoded numerically. Integers can be directly manipulated with arithmetic operations, while floating-point numbers require careful attention to precision issues. Categorical data will likely need to be re-mapped to numerical scales before such reductions apply. In all cases, we also need to consider whether the reduction should occur in place or if a new array or data structure should be produced.

A common scenario involves scaling down non-zero numerical values, effectively compressing the distribution of their magnitudes. This is frequently useful when dealing with data containing large outliers or when differences need to be visualized or processed on a more granular scale. The simplest way to accomplish this is through scalar division, while respecting the original sign of values. Below, I will demonstrate this behavior with a Python example.

```python
import numpy as np

def reduce_magnitude_scalar(data, factor):
    """
    Reduces the magnitude of non-zero values in a numpy array by a given factor.
    Preserves the sign of the original value.
    
    Parameters:
        data (np.array): The input numpy array.
        factor (float): The factor by which to reduce the non-zero values.
                       Values greater than 1 will result in reduction.

    Returns:
        np.array: A new numpy array with reduced non-zero values.
    """
    data = np.array(data) #Ensure that the input is a NumPy array
    reduced_data = np.copy(data) # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original

    non_zero_mask = data != 0
    
    reduced_data[non_zero_mask] = data[non_zero_mask] / abs(data[non_zero_mask]) * (abs(data[non_zero_mask]) / factor)

    return reduced_data
    
# Example usage
example_array = np.array([-10, 5, 0, 20, -2])
reduction_factor = 2
reduced_array = reduce_magnitude_scalar(example_array, reduction_factor)
print(f"Original array: {example_array}")
print(f"Reduced array: {reduced_array}") # Output: [-5.   2.5  0.  10.  -1. ]
```

This function uses NumPy arrays for efficient vectorized operations. It creates a mask identifying the indices with non-zero values. Applying the division operation using this mask affects only those values, preserving the sign, and avoiding division by zero. Notably, I've used `np.copy` to avoid modification of the original array, which aligns with the functional programming paradigm. This method is appropriate when you desire a linear reduction of the scale.

Another scenario arises when the goal is to compress the range of values, especially when dealing with skewed data. A logarithmic transformation is an effective technique for this purpose. When a direct log transform of input containing non-positive values is not viable, an offset adjustment is required. Below I've provided a function that performs such a log-based compression.

```python
import numpy as np

def reduce_range_log(data, offset):
    """
    Applies a logarithmic transformation to reduce the range of non-zero values in a numpy array.
    Uses an offset to handle non-positive values.

    Parameters:
        data (np.array): The input numpy array.
        offset (float): A positive offset value to add to each data point before
                       applying log transformation to handle values less than 1.

    Returns:
        np.array: A new numpy array with reduced range values.
    """
    data = np.array(data) # Ensure it's a NumPy array
    reduced_data = np.copy(data) # Create a copy

    non_zero_mask = data != 0
    
    signed_data = data[non_zero_mask]
    sign = np.sign(signed_data) # Store the original sign for later application
    
    reduced_data[non_zero_mask] = sign * np.log(abs(signed_data) + offset)

    return reduced_data

# Example usage
example_array = np.array([-10, 5, 0, 20, -2])
offset_value = 1
reduced_array = reduce_range_log(example_array, offset_value)
print(f"Original array: {example_array}")
print(f"Reduced array: {reduced_array}")
# Example Output :
# Original array: [-10  5  0 20 -2]
# Reduced array: [-2.39789527  1.79175947  0.          3.04452244 -0.69314718]
```

In this function, the offset is added to the absolute value of all input values before applying the logarithmic transformation. This is essential to prevent errors when calculating the logarithm of zero or a negative number. I explicitly preserved the original sign after the transformation by multiplying the result by `np.sign`. The choice of offset depends on the range of the data; a larger offset results in a less aggressive reduction. It's important to remember that this kind of transformation will emphasize lower values relative to higher values, which could be either desirable or undesirable depending on the specific task.

Finally, there may be cases where we want to clamp non-zero values within a given range. For this, we would define a lower and upper bound. Any value exceeding the upper bound should be set to the upper bound and similarly for the lower bound. The following demonstrates this technique.

```python
import numpy as np

def clamp_non_zero_values(data, lower_bound, upper_bound):
  """
    Clamps the non-zero values in a numpy array to a given range.
    
    Parameters:
        data (np.array): The input numpy array.
        lower_bound (float): The lower bound for clamping.
        upper_bound (float): The upper bound for clamping.

    Returns:
        np.array: A new numpy array with clamped non-zero values.
    """
  data = np.array(data) # Ensure the input is a numpy array
  reduced_data = np.copy(data) # Create a copy

  non_zero_mask = data != 0

  signed_data = data[non_zero_mask]
  
  reduced_data[non_zero_mask] = np.clip(signed_data, lower_bound, upper_bound)


  return reduced_data

# Example usage
example_array = np.array([-10, 5, 0, 20, -2])
lower_bound_clamp = -3
upper_bound_clamp = 10
reduced_array = clamp_non_zero_values(example_array, lower_bound_clamp, upper_bound_clamp)
print(f"Original array: {example_array}")
print(f"Reduced array: {reduced_array}")
# Output:
# Original array: [-10  5  0 20 -2]
# Reduced array: [-3  5  0 10 -2]
```

This function makes use of NumPy's `np.clip` function, which conveniently clamps an array's values between given minimum and maximum values, enhancing readability. This is useful when there are outliers beyond a specific range that should not dominate the analysis.

Regarding additional learning, I highly recommend exploring texts and resources covering numerical analysis using NumPy, focusing on vectorization techniques and array manipulations. Books on data preprocessing often cover these kinds of transformations in depth, usually in the context of machine learning tasks. Familiarizing yourself with statistical principles behind data distribution and transformation is also paramount for selecting appropriate strategies. Documentation for NumPy and similar libraries should be a regular point of reference for advanced function application and understanding nuances. Also, textbooks on linear algebra will clarify underlying mechanisms of numerical manipulation, improving code maintainability and debuggability.
