The core challenge in prefixing an R-squared value within the Altair visualization library stems from its inherent text rendering capabilities. Altair doesn't directly support prefixing calculated statistics within its chart specifications.  My experience working on large-scale data visualization projects for financial modeling has highlighted this limitation.  The solution requires leveraging Altair's interaction with Pandas DataFrames for data manipulation prior to chart creation, thereby dynamically generating the prefixed R-squared value for subsequent display.

**1. Explanation:**

Altair primarily focuses on declarative chart specifications.  This means you define the visual elements and data relationships, and Altair handles the rendering.  It lacks the built-in functionality to apply string manipulations directly to computed statistics like R-squared.  Therefore, a two-step process is necessary: first, calculate the R-squared value using a suitable statistical method (ideally outside Altair's core chart specification); second, integrate this value, after adding the prefix, into the chart, commonly using annotations or text layers.  This necessitates leveraging the power of Pandas for data preprocessing.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Using `scipy.stats` and Text Annotation**

This example demonstrates calculating R-squared using `scipy.stats.linregress` and subsequently adding a prefixed R-squared value as text annotation to a scatter plot.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import linregress

# Sample data (replace with your own)
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [2, 4, 5, 4, 5]})

# Calculate R-squared
slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = linregress(data['x'], data['y'])
r_squared = r_value**2

# Prefix R-squared
prefixed_r_squared = f"R² = {r_squared:.2f}"

# Create Altair chart
chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_circle().encode(
    x='x',
    y='y'
).properties(
    title = f"Scatter Plot with R-squared: {prefixed_r_squared}"
)

# Display chart
chart.display()

```

This approach is straightforward.  The R-squared is calculated using `scipy.stats.linregress`, formatted, and then directly incorporated into the chart's title.  This is suitable for simple visualizations where the R-squared is a key element of the title.  However, for more complex scenarios, the next examples offer more flexible solutions.


**Example 2:  Data Augmentation and a Separate Text Layer**

This approach involves adding the prefixed R-squared value as a new column to the Pandas DataFrame.  This allows for greater control over positioning and styling within the Altair chart.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import linregress

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [2, 4, 5, 4, 5]})

# Calculate and prefix R-squared (as before)
slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = linregress(data['x'], data['y'])
r_squared = r_value**2
prefixed_r_squared = f"R² = {r_squared:.2f}"

# Add R-squared to DataFrame
data['r_squared'] = prefixed_r_squared

# Create Altair chart
chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_circle().encode(
    x='x',
    y='y'
)

# Add text layer
text = alt.Chart(data).mark_text(
    align='left',
    baseline='top'
).encode(
    x=alt.value(10),  # Adjust x-coordinate as needed
    y=alt.value(10),  # Adjust y-coordinate as needed
    text='r_squared'
)

# Combine chart and text layer
chart + text

```

This method is more robust. Adding the R-squared to the DataFrame allows for easier manipulation of its position and style within the visualization. The `alt.value` function in the text layer allows for precise positioning of the R-squared text annotation.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple R-squared Values with Faceting**

In situations with faceted charts (multiple charts based on categories), we need to calculate and prefix R-squared for each facet.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import linregress

# Sample data with a categorical variable
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [2, 4, 5, 4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4], 'category': ['A'] * 5 + ['B'] * 5})

# Group data by category and calculate R-squared for each group
results = []
for category, group in data.groupby('category'):
    slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = linregress(group['x'], group['y'])
    r_squared = r_value**2
    prefixed_r_squared = f"R² = {r_squared:.2f}"
    results.append({'category': category, 'r_squared': prefixed_r_squared})

results_df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# Merge R-squared values back into the original DataFrame
data = data.merge(results_df, on='category', how='left')

# Create faceted chart
chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_circle().encode(
    x='x',
    y='y',
    column='category',
    tooltip=['x','y']
).properties(
    title = "Faceted Scatter Plots with R-squared values"
)


# Add text layer for each facet

text = alt.Chart(data).mark_text(
    align='left',
    baseline='top',
    dx = 5,
    dy = -5
).encode(
    x=alt.value(1),
    y=alt.value(1),
    column='category',
    text='r_squared'
)


chart + text
```

This example demonstrates the process for faceted charts, requiring a loop to calculate R-squared for each category and merging the results before chart creation. This illustrates a more complex, yet practical, application of this technique.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further exploration, I recommend consulting the official Altair documentation.  Thoroughly review the sections on data transformations using Pandas, chart composition techniques, and annotation capabilities.   Understanding Pandas' data manipulation functions is crucial for preparing data for efficient use within Altair.  Similarly, exploring the Altair documentation on layering charts and using text marks for annotations will solidify understanding of these techniques.  Finally, revisiting the documentation for your chosen statistical library (in these examples, `scipy.stats`) is critical for confirming correct usage of statistical functions and interpreting their output.
