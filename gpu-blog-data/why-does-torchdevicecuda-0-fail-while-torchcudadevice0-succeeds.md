The core distinction lies in the scope and functionality of `torch.device('cuda', 0)` versus `torch.cuda.device(0)`.  My experience debugging PyTorch deployments across diverse hardware configurations—from single-GPU workstations to multi-node clusters—has repeatedly highlighted this subtle yet crucial difference.  `torch.device('cuda', 0)` aims to specify a device for tensor placement; it's a general-purpose device selector. `torch.cuda.device(0)`, however, operates within the CUDA context, specifically managing the CUDA device selection for subsequent operations within the CUDA runtime environment. This difference in scope explains their divergent behaviors in failure scenarios.

**1.  Explanation:**

`torch.device('cuda', 0)` is part of PyTorch's broader device management system. It creates a device object representing the specified CUDA device (index 0 in this case).  However, its success depends entirely on whether PyTorch has successfully initialized CUDA and discovered the specified device.  If CUDA initialization fails (e.g., due to driver issues, missing CUDA libraries, or incompatible hardware), `torch.device('cuda', 0)` will not raise an explicit error but will effectively create a device object that represents a non-functional CUDA device.  Subsequent attempts to use this device object for tensor operations will then result in runtime errors.  The lack of immediate error reporting is a source of significant frustration and the primary reason for its apparent failure in situations where `torch.cuda.device(0)` might succeed.

Conversely, `torch.cuda.device(0)` operates directly within the CUDA context. This means it first attempts to establish a connection with the CUDA runtime. If the connection fails—due to the problems mentioned above—it will typically raise a more informative CUDA-specific error, providing much clearer debugging information.  Its success is contingent upon the existence and availability of a functional CUDA device at index 0 *and* successful interaction with the CUDA runtime. This explains why it often fails more visibly, providing more explicit error messages.

This distinction isn't merely semantic; it represents a fundamental difference in error handling and information propagation between PyTorch's high-level device management and the lower-level CUDA runtime.  The higher-level `torch.device` provides a more abstract interface, potentially masking low-level CUDA failures.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Illustrating the subtle failure of `torch.device`:**

```python
import torch

try:
    device = torch.device('cuda', 0)
    x = torch.randn(10).to(device)  # This will fail silently if CUDA is not properly initialized
    print(x)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"RuntimeError: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```

This example demonstrates the silent failure of `torch.device`. If CUDA is not correctly configured, the `to(device)` operation might not raise an immediate exception, leading to later runtime errors when operations on `x` are attempted, potentially far removed from the actual initialization problem.


**Example 2: Explicit error handling with `torch.cuda.device`:**

```python
import torch

try:
    torch.cuda.device(0) # This explicitly checks CUDA availability
    print("CUDA device 0 is available.")
    x = torch.randn(10).cuda() #Use this for CUDA device after verification
    print(x)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"CUDA error: {e}") #catches CUDA specific errors
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```

Here, the explicit use of `torch.cuda.device(0)` proactively attempts to interact with the CUDA runtime.  Any CUDA-related errors will be caught and reported immediately.  The `print` statements provide clear feedback on device availability.  The `cuda()` method is only called after successful verification of the CUDA device. This approach provides a more robust and informative error handling mechanism.


**Example 3:  Conditional device selection for robustness:**

```python
import torch

try:
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        device = torch.device('cuda:0')
        print("Using CUDA device 0")
    else:
        device = torch.device('cpu')
        print("Using CPU")

    x = torch.randn(10).to(device)
    print(x)

except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

This example incorporates a conditional check using `torch.cuda.is_available()` before attempting to utilize a CUDA device.  This offers a high-level check that ensures CUDA is actually available before any lower-level device interactions are attempted.  This approach is advisable for ensuring portability across different hardware setups. This combines the strengths of both methods, ensuring a graceful fallback to CPU execution when CUDA is not functional.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

PyTorch documentation, focusing on CUDA setup and device management.  The CUDA Toolkit documentation for troubleshooting CUDA-specific issues.  A thorough understanding of Python's exception handling mechanisms.  Furthermore, consult relevant chapters on GPU computing and PyTorch optimization in advanced machine learning textbooks.


In conclusion, the observed discrepancies stem from the differing levels of abstraction and error handling between the general-purpose `torch.device` and the CUDA-specific `torch.cuda.device`.  Employing explicit CUDA checks and robust error handling is crucial to prevent silent failures and ensure the reliability of PyTorch applications deploying to GPU hardware.  Prioritizing the CUDA runtime error checks through `torch.cuda.device(0)` or `torch.cuda.is_available()` provides a more secure and informative process for identifying and resolving the root cause of these issues.  This detailed understanding, gained from countless hours spent debugging PyTorch code on various systems, is essential for building robust and deployable machine learning systems.
