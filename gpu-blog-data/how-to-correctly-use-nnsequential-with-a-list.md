The core challenge in utilizing `nn.Sequential` effectively stems from a nuanced understanding of how it manages the input and output tensors throughout its constituent modules.  In my experience debugging complex neural networks, I've found that many issues arise not from the `nn.Sequential` itself, but from mismatched tensor shapes or incompatible module functionalities within the sequence.  This response will address these points, focusing on the correct procedure and highlighting common pitfalls.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

`nn.Sequential` in PyTorch is a container module that applies a series of modules in a sequential manner.  Each module's output becomes the input to the next. This seemingly straightforward functionality requires careful consideration of several factors:

* **Input Tensor Dimensions:** The first module in the `nn.Sequential` must accept the input tensor's dimensions.  Mismatched input shapes will result in `RuntimeError` exceptions, often cryptic in their descriptions.  Therefore, thorough dimension checking before creating the sequence is crucial.

* **Module Output Dimensions:**  Each module’s output tensor should be compatible with the input requirements of the subsequent module. For instance, a convolutional layer might produce a feature map of a certain size; the following layer (e.g., a fully connected layer) needs to be configured to handle that specific output size. Failure to align these dimensions leads to propagation of errors.

* **Module Functionality Compatibility:** The modules within the sequence must be logically compatible.  For example, placing a fully connected layer immediately after a convolutional layer requires explicit reshaping of the convolutional output (flattening) to a one-dimensional vector.  Ignoring this will cause incompatibility.

* **Sequential Order:** The order of modules is crucial and affects the network's function.  A simple change in the order can drastically alter the network's behavior.  Carefully consider the intended processing flow when defining the sequential order.

* **Batch Processing:** `nn.Sequential` inherently handles batch processing. The input tensor’s first dimension should correspond to the batch size.  Each module within the sequence processes the entire batch simultaneously.


2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Classification Network**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):
        super(SimpleClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)

# Example usage:
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 50
num_classes = 2
model = SimpleClassifier(input_size, hidden_size, num_classes)
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, input_size) # Batch size of 32
output = model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape) # Output shape should be (32, 2)
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward classification network.  The `nn.Sequential` container neatly encapsulates the linear layers and ReLU activation.  Observe the clear input-output compatibility between layers. The input tensor has a batch size of 32, successfully handled by `nn.Sequential`.

**Example 2: CNN for Image Classification**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(CNN, self).__init__()
        self.model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1), # 3 input channels (RGB), 16 output channels
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1), # 16 input channels, 32 output channels
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Linear(32 * 8 * 8, 128), # Assuming input image size is 32x32; adjust accordingly
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, num_classes)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)

#Example Usage
model = CNN(num_classes=10)
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 3, 32, 32) # Batch size 32, 3 channels, 32x32 image
output = model(input_tensor)
print(output.shape)
```

Here, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) showcases the necessity of handling tensor shape changes.  The `nn.Flatten` layer is crucial for converting the convolutional output into a format suitable for the fully connected layers. Note that the input image size directly impacts the dimension of the flattened vector; adjusting this requires modification to the fully connected layer's input size. Incorrect input dimensions during the flattening stage is a common source of errors.

**Example 3: Handling Variable Input Shapes**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class VariableInputNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(VariableInputNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv1d(in_channels=1, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(16*25, 10) # Adjust this for different input sequence lengths

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.linear(x)
        return x

# Example usage:  Showing how to handle different input lengths.
model = VariableInputNetwork()
input_tensor1 = torch.randn(32, 1, 28) # Batch size 32, sequence length 28
input_tensor2 = torch.randn(32, 1, 50) # Batch size 32, sequence length 50
output1 = model(input_tensor1)
output2 = model(input_tensor2)
print(output1.shape, output2.shape) # Outputs will have the same number of classes, but different shapes before the linear layer
```
This example demonstrates a scenario where input sequence lengths can vary.  Note that the fully connected layer dimensions must be adjusted according to the varying output size of the convolutional layer.  In real-world applications, this might involve calculating the output shape dynamically based on the input's length.  Using `nn.Sequential` directly for this scenario would require a more sophisticated design using different modules for differing input lengths.  This example illustrates a more flexible approach for handling variability.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, covering PyTorch implementation details.  Advanced PyTorch tutorials focusing on custom module creation and advanced network architectures.  Several specialized publications on convolutional and recurrent neural networks are relevant depending on your application.


By diligently considering the input and output tensor dimensions, carefully selecting compatible modules, and structuring the sequential order appropriately, developers can leverage the power and simplicity of `nn.Sequential` to create effective and efficient neural networks in PyTorch. My experience suggests that preventative checks, such as explicitly printing tensor shapes at various points in the forward pass, are invaluable for debugging and resolving shape-related issues. Remember, careful planning and systematic testing are key to achieving successful results.
