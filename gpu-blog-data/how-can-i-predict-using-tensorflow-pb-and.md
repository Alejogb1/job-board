Predicting using both TensorFlow's `.pb` (protocol buffer) and Keras's `.h5` (HDF5) models concurrently within a Flask application necessitates a nuanced understanding of model loading and inference mechanics.  My experience building high-throughput prediction services highlighted the crucial difference between these formats: `.pb` files represent a frozen graph optimized for deployment, whereas `.h5` files contain the model architecture and weights, requiring runtime compilation.  Efficient concurrent prediction demands leveraging these inherent differences strategically.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in managing the resource contention and latency associated with loading and executing two distinct model types simultaneously.  Naive approaches involving loading both models immediately upon application startup can lead to significant memory overhead, especially with large models.  Furthermore, the inference processes, particularly for the `.h5` model, can be computationally intensive, potentially impacting the responsiveness of the Flask application. A robust solution necessitates asynchronous processing, careful resource management, and a well-defined prediction pipeline.  I've found that a multi-threaded or multi-process architecture, coupled with intelligent model caching, offers the best performance.  The specific implementation hinges on the scale of your application and the expected concurrency levels.  For relatively low concurrency, threading suffices; for higher demands, multiprocessing provides superior scalability.

Within the Flask application, different routes or endpoints could be designated for each model type.  This allows for specialized handling and optimization. The `.pb` model, being already compiled, lends itself to faster inference, potentially suitable for high-frequency requests.  The `.h5` model, due to the runtime compilation, could be reserved for requests requiring more flexible or customizable prediction parameters.  Implementing a caching mechanism is paramount for both models to reduce repeated loading overhead.  This could involve storing loaded models in memory, with appropriate eviction strategies to manage memory limits.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Asynchronous Prediction with `.pb` Model (using threading):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import threading
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the .pb model only once during application startup
with tf.gfile.GFile("my_pb_model.pb", "rb") as f:
    graph_def = tf.GraphDef()
    graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())

with tf.Graph().as_default() as graph:
    tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name="")
    sess = tf.Session(graph=graph)
    input_tensor = graph.get_tensor_by_name("input:0")  # Replace with your input tensor name
    output_tensor = graph.get_tensor_by_name("output:0") # Replace with your output tensor name


def predict_pb(input_data):
    result = sess.run(output_tensor, feed_dict={input_tensor: input_data})
    return result

@app.route('/predict_pb', methods=['POST'])
def pb_prediction():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        thread = threading.Thread(target=lambda: predict_pb(data))
        thread.start()
        return jsonify({'message': 'Prediction initiated asynchronously'}), 202
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500

# ... (Rest of Flask app) ...
```

This example utilizes threading to offload the prediction task, preventing blocking of the main Flask thread.  Error handling is crucial for production deployments.


**Example 2: Synchronous Prediction with `.h5` Model (using Keras):**

```python
from keras.models import load_model
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the .h5 model
model = load_model("my_keras_model.h5")

@app.route('/predict_h5', methods=['POST'])
def h5_prediction():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        prediction = model.predict(data)
        return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()}), 200
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500

# ... (Rest of Flask app) ...

```

This demonstrates a simpler synchronous approach for the `.h5` model, suitable if the prediction time is relatively short and concurrency demands are low.  Direct use of `model.predict` is efficient for this scenario.



**Example 3:  Model Caching (Illustrative Snippet):**

```python
model_cache = {} #Simple in-memory cache. Consider more sophisticated solutions like Redis or Memcached for production.

def get_model(model_type, model_path):
    if model_type not in model_cache or model_cache[model_type] is None:
        if model_type == ".pb":
            # Load .pb model as shown in Example 1
            # ...
            model_cache[model_type] = model
        elif model_type == ".h5":
            # Load .h5 model as shown in Example 2
            # ...
            model_cache[model_type] = model
    return model_cache[model_type]

# ... use get_model function in your prediction routes ...
```

This illustrates a basic model caching mechanism.  For production systems, explore more advanced caching strategies with eviction policies to prevent memory exhaustion.
