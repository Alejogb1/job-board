TensorBoard's functionality shifting after a TensorFlow version upgrade from 2.1.2 to 2.3.0 often stems from changes in the underlying logging mechanisms and the TensorBoard API itself.  During my work on the large-scale anomaly detection project at Xylos Corp., I encountered this exact problem. The root cause wasn't always immediately apparent; a simple reinstallation was insufficient.  The issue frequently involved incompatibilities between the logging methods used in the older codebase and the updated TensorFlow version's expectations.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core problem lies in the evolution of TensorFlow's logging infrastructure.  TensorFlow 2.x introduced significant modifications in how events are written to the log directory.  These changes are not always backward compatible.  TensorBoard 2.3.0 expects a specific structure and format for the event files generated during training. If your code, written for TensorFlow 2.1.2, utilizes older logging practices, TensorBoard 2.3.0 will either fail to read the data or display incomplete or inaccurate visualizations.  This is further complicated by potential inconsistencies between the TensorFlow version used during training and the TensorBoard version used for visualization.

Several factors can contribute to this incompatibility:

* **Changes in `tf.summary`:** The `tf.summary` API underwent revisions between 2.1.2 and 2.3.0.  Older summary ops might not be correctly interpreted by the newer TensorBoard.  Specifically, the handling of scalar, histogram, and image summaries might have changed.  Simple calls to `tf.summary.scalar`, for example, might need modifications based on the new API specifications.
* **Log Directory Structure:** The organization of the log directory itself could contribute to visualization problems. Older versions might not have meticulously structured the output according to the newer version's expectations.
* **Protocol Buffer Version Mismatch:**  TensorFlow's event files are serialized using Protocol Buffers.  Version mismatches between the protocol buffers used during training and the version TensorBoard uses for deserialization can lead to errors.  Although less frequent, this is a potential source of the issue.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Summary Usage (TensorFlow 2.1.2 Style):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your model definition ...

with tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter('logs/') as writer:  # Older style FileWriter
    for step, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_dataset):
        # ... your training step ...
        loss = # ... your loss calculation ...
        tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step) #Older style scalar logging
        writer.flush()

```

This code, while functional in TensorFlow 2.1.2, likely will not work correctly with TensorBoard 2.3.0.  The `tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter` and the scalar summary call are outdated.


**Example 2: Corrected Summary Usage (TensorFlow 2.3.0 Style):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your model definition ...

writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/')

for step, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_dataset):
    # ... your training step ...
    loss = # ... your loss calculation ...
    with writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=step) #Correct style using tf.summary.scalar
        # Add other summaries like images, histograms etc. appropriately


```

This revised example uses the modern `tf.summary.create_file_writer` and correctly integrates scalar logging within a `with` statement.  The explicit `step` argument is crucial.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Summaries:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your model definition ...

writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/')

for step, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_dataset):
    # ... your training step ...
    loss = # ... your loss calculation ...
    accuracy = # ... your accuracy calculation ...

    with writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=step)
        tf.summary.scalar('accuracy', accuracy, step=step)
        # Add other summaries, such as tf.summary.histogram('weights', model.weights)

    if step % 100 == 0:  #Control logging frequency to avoid excessive disk IO
        writer.flush()

```

This example demonstrates logging multiple metrics.  Controlling the frequency of `writer.flush()` is crucial, especially for large datasets, to avoid excessive disk I/O and performance degradation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation remains the primary resource.  Consult the sections dedicated to `tf.summary` and the TensorBoard usage guides.  Specific attention should be paid to any migration guides related to changes introduced in TensorFlow 2.3.0.  Pay close attention to example code provided in the documentation.  A thorough understanding of Protocol Buffers can also be helpful in diagnosing deeper issues.  Familiarize yourself with the structure of the TensorBoard event files to better understand potential discrepancies.  Reviewing relevant Stack Overflow questions focusing on TensorFlow 2.x and TensorBoard integration will also prove beneficial.  Finally, leveraging the debugging tools provided within TensorFlow itself can aid in identifying the precise point of failure in your logging pipeline.
