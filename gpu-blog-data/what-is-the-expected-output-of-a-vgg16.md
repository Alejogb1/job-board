The VGG16 network, pre-trained on ImageNet, outputs feature maps rather than probabilities at the individual layer level, and specifically, the shape and numerical values of those maps are dictated by the layer's configuration and the input data's journey through the network. The expected output, at a specific layer, is a tensor with dimensions corresponding to the spatial extent of the feature map and the number of channels learned by that layer. However, the observed output frequently differs from the *idealized* expected output due to several contributing factors, primarily centering on the nature of convolutional neural networks and their inherent sensitivity to input characteristics.

Letâ€™s clarify the typical behavior. Consider a batch of images entering the VGG16 network. A single convolutional layer doesn't output an image directly, but rather a multidimensional array (a tensor) representing features extracted from the input. This tensor's shape is a function of the convolutional layer's configuration: the kernel size, the number of filters (output channels), and the stride. The spatial dimensions shrink as we progress through the network as pooling layers are frequently employed, while the depth (number of channels) typically increases as the network learns more abstract features.

For a concrete example, let's focus on the output of a particular convolutional layer within the VGG16. Suppose we are examining the output of the first convolutional layer after its activation (ReLU). Given an input image of dimensions 224x224x3 (standard RGB), this first layer, configured with 64 filters, a 3x3 kernel, stride 1, and same padding, is *ideally* expected to produce an output tensor of 224x224x64. The spatial dimensions, in this case, are preserved because of same padding and stride one operations. The 64 is the number of filters which then forms the depth of the output tensor. Each of these 64 slices represents a feature map where numerical values indicate the presence and strength of a specific learned pattern within the input.

The observed output, in practice, may differ in several key areas. Firstly, the specific values in the tensor are influenced by the input image itself. Even a subtle variation in input pixel intensity impacts the resulting activation values and thus creates the learned representation that is produced. The weights of the trained network are fixed, but the activation maps change dynamically in response to the input. Secondly, the observed output may contain noise. This is common particularly in the deeper layers of the network. The specific values within the tensor are dependent on the initial weights, data, and any data augmentation applied during training. In deeper layers, this can manifest as small activations across all feature maps, or it could manifest as the dominance of one particular feature map over the other. Furthermore, if a VGG16 model has been loaded with improperly cast or structured weights, the weights could cause very low or high output activations and possibly cause error. Finally, there are subtle differences between deep learning libraries in terms of their implementation and numerical handling. These differences can cause very slight variations in output activations across various libraries, although the output dimensions should ideally remain consistent.

Here are three code examples demonstrating these concepts using Python and TensorFlow:

**Example 1: Observing Shape and Output**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
import numpy as np

# Load the pre-trained VGG16 model
vgg16_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Generate a dummy input image (batch size 1)
dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 224, 224, 3).astype(np.float32)

# Get the output of the first conv layer by accessing the layer by index.
first_conv_output = vgg16_model.layers[1].output

# Create a new model that outputs the first conv layer
intermediate_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=vgg16_model.input, outputs=first_conv_output)

# Get the output of the first convolutional layer
first_layer_output_tensor = intermediate_model(dummy_input)

# Print the shape of the output tensor
print(f"Shape of the first conv layer output: {first_layer_output_tensor.shape}")

# Print the first feature map to inspect the values
print(f"First Feature Map, First 10 elements: {first_layer_output_tensor[0,0,0,:10]}")
```
*This code snippet showcases a crucial aspect of using pre-trained models: the ability to extract intermediate outputs. We use the output of the first layer, and not the last layers, which are classification heads. We then print its shape as well as the first feature map so we can inspect it's values. As expected, we can confirm the output has dimensions (1, 224, 224, 64) and observe that the values in the first feature map contain floating-point numbers representing the extracted features. These values, despite being from a random image, are not all zero because of the random initialization of weights and ReLU activation.*

**Example 2: Impact of Input Variations**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
import numpy as np

# Load the pre-trained VGG16 model
vgg16_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Generate two dummy input images with slight variations
input1 = np.random.rand(1, 224, 224, 3).astype(np.float32)
input2 = input1 + 0.001 * np.random.rand(1, 224, 224, 3).astype(np.float32)


# Get the output of the fifth conv layer by accessing the layer by index.
fifth_conv_output = vgg16_model.layers[5].output

# Create a new model that outputs the fifth conv layer
intermediate_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=vgg16_model.input, outputs=fifth_conv_output)

# Get the output of the fifth convolutional layer
output1 = intermediate_model(input1)
output2 = intermediate_model(input2)

# compare the feature map to determine the impact of input changes
feature_map1 = output1[0,0,0,:10].numpy()
feature_map2 = output2[0,0,0,:10].numpy()

print(f"Output of Feature Map 1 from first input, first 10 values {feature_map1}")
print(f"Output of Feature Map 2 from second input, first 10 values: {feature_map2}")
print(f"Difference: {feature_map1 - feature_map2}")

```

*This code snippet shows that even small changes in input will affect the output feature maps. Although the changes are minor, they are observable and can become more pronounced in deeper layers. This demonstrates the non-linear nature of the convolutional network.*

**Example 3: Deeper Layer Activation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
import numpy as np

# Load the pre-trained VGG16 model
vgg16_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Generate a dummy input image
dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 224, 224, 3).astype(np.float32)


# Get the output of a deeper convolutional layer (e.g., layer 15)
layer_15_output = vgg16_model.layers[15].output

# Create a new model to isolate the output
intermediate_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=vgg16_model.input, outputs=layer_15_output)

# Get the feature maps
output_tensor_15 = intermediate_model(dummy_input)

print(f"Shape of the 15th conv layer output: {output_tensor_15.shape}")

# Print some values from the feature maps
print(f"First Feature Map First 10 values: {output_tensor_15[0,0,0,:10]}")
print(f"Second Feature Map First 10 values: {output_tensor_15[0,0,1,:10]}")
```

*This example demonstrates the output of a deeper layer, where the spatial dimensions have been reduced (because pooling has occured) and the number of channels has increased. The numerical values in a feature map show a greater diversity and increased feature activation. These deeper layers represent more abstract representations of the image content, compared to the earlier layers that capture lower level features.*

For further exploration, I recommend studying the following:

1.  **Convolutional Neural Network Architectures**: Understanding the fundamentals of convolution, pooling, and activation functions is crucial. Several books and online resources offer in-depth explanations.

2.  **ImageNet Pre-trained Models**: Examine the code examples provided by Keras/TensorFlow/PyTorch and try to access different intermediate layer outputs. Experiments with different layers and different inputs are important to improve intuition.
3.  **Deep Learning Libraries Documentation**: Focus on the tutorials and API references related to models, layers and model extraction.
4.  **Feature Visualization**: Explore different techniques to visualize the feature maps using heatmaps. This will help to understand what patterns each filter has learned and whether it is activating as expected.

By systematically investigating these resources and practicing, one can develop a solid grasp of the VGG16 architecture and its output characteristics, bridging the gap between expectations and observations.
