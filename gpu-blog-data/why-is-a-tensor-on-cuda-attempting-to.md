The root cause of a CUDA tensor attempting to use CPU storage frequently stems from improper memory allocation and data transfer management within the PyTorch framework.  Over the course of several large-scale GPU computing projects involving high-dimensional tensors, I've encountered this issue repeatedly. The key factor is understanding PyTorch's default behavior and explicitly directing data to the GPU. Failure to do so results in the tensor residing in CPU memory, leading to significantly slower performance and potentially errors.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch, by design, offers flexibility in handling tensor placement.  A tensor created without explicit device specification defaults to the CPU.  Even when working within a CUDA context (i.e., having a CUDA-enabled device available), this default behavior persists. This is a common pitfall for those transitioning from CPU-based computation to GPU acceleration.  Furthermore, operations involving tensors on different devices (CPU and GPU) necessitate explicit data transfer commands. Performing calculations between a CPU-resident tensor and a GPU-resident tensor will trigger data copying, negating the performance benefits of GPU computation.  This copying often happens silently, obscuring the underlying cause of performance bottlenecks or outright errors if the CPU memory becomes insufficient.

The problem manifests itself in various ways.  You might see performance far below expectations, despite having a powerful GPU.  You might encounter `OutOfMemoryError` exceptions even though your GPU possesses ample free memory because the operation is attempting to allocate memory on the CPU.  Profiling tools might reveal excessive CPU usage during what should be primarily GPU-bound computation.  The underlying issue in each case is that the critical tensor—or a tensor involved in a calculation—isn't correctly allocated on the GPU.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Allocation**

```python
import torch

# Incorrect: Tensor defaults to CPU
x = torch.randn(1000, 1000) 

# Attempts GPU operation, causing implicit, slow data transfer
y = x.cuda() * 2

# Correct allocation from the start
x_gpu = torch.randn(1000, 1000).cuda()
y_gpu = x_gpu * 2 # Operation entirely on GPU

```

Commentary: The first instance demonstrates the default CPU allocation.  The subsequent `x.cuda()` operation implicitly copies the entire tensor to the GPU, incurring significant overhead.  The corrected version allocates the tensor directly on the GPU, eliminating the unnecessary data transfer.  This is a fundamental best practice: always allocate tensors on the target device (CPU or GPU) from the outset.

**Example 2:  Inconsistent Device Handling in a Network**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(1000, 500)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(500, 100)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)  # Potential problem here!
        return x

# Incorrect: Model might be on CPU by default
model = MyNetwork()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1,1000).cuda()
output = model(input_tensor)

# Correct way: Move the model to the GPU
model.cuda()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1,1000).cuda()
output = model(input_tensor)
```

Commentary: This example highlights a common error within neural networks. If the `MyNetwork` isn’t explicitly moved to the GPU using `model.cuda()`, the model parameters remain on the CPU.  Even if the input tensor `input_tensor` resides on the GPU, the calculation will likely perform CPU-based operations before transferring the intermediate result to the GPU, leading to performance degradation.  The corrected code ensures both the model and input data reside on the GPU, optimizing computational efficiency.

**Example 3: Data Transfer Between CPU and GPU**

```python
import torch

cpu_tensor = torch.randn(500, 500)
gpu_tensor = torch.randn(500, 500).cuda()

# Explicit data transfer to GPU.  Asynchronous for potential performance improvement.
gpu_tensor_copy = cpu_tensor.cuda(non_blocking=True)

#Calculation only on GPU
result = gpu_tensor_copy * gpu_tensor

#Explicit transfer back to CPU (if needed)
cpu_result = result.cpu()
```

Commentary: This illustrates explicit data transfer between CPU and GPU.  The `cpu_tensor.cuda()` operation explicitly copies data to the GPU. The `non_blocking=True` argument allows asynchronous transfer, overlapping data transfer with computation, potentially improving performance. Similarly, `result.cpu()` explicitly transfers data back to the CPU. Explicitly managing these transfers highlights the importance of understanding data movement for optimal efficiency.  Avoid implicit conversions whenever possible.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation on CUDA and tensor operations.  The PyTorch tutorials provide numerous examples of effective GPU utilization.  Furthermore, understanding the basics of CUDA programming and memory management will be highly beneficial.  Finally, a good introductory text on parallel computing and GPU programming would be very helpful for a solid foundation in these concepts.  Debugging tools specific to PyTorch and CUDA will assist in pinpointing problematic code sections by visualizing tensor locations and memory usage.
