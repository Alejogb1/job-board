The root cause of your LSTM layer receiving a two-dimensional input when it expects three dimensions almost always stems from an incorrect understanding or implementation of the expected input shape:  `(samples, timesteps, features)`.  This isn't a bug in the LSTM layer itself; rather, it's a mismatch between the data you're providing and the layer's requirements.  Over the years, I've encountered this issue numerous times while developing time-series forecasting models and natural language processing applications, often tracing it back to data preprocessing errors.


**1. Clear Explanation of the Input Shape Expectation:**

An LSTM layer processes sequential data.  The three dimensions represent:

* **samples:** The number of independent data instances in your dataset. This is analogous to the number of rows in a typical dataset, where each row represents a separate sample. For example, if you're predicting stock prices, each sample could represent a different stock.

* **timesteps:** The length of the sequence for each sample. This refers to the number of time steps or data points within a single sequence.  Continuing the stock price example, each sample might contain the past 10 days' closing prices, making `timesteps` equal to 10. In natural language processing, this could represent the number of words in a sentence.

* **features:** The number of features at each time step. This is the dimensionality of the data at each point in your sequence.  For stock prices, this could be just the closing price (one feature), or it could include opening price, high, low, and volume (four features).  In NLP, this would be the dimension of your word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or GloVe vectors).


The common mistake is neglecting the `timesteps` dimension.  If your input is two-dimensional, it's likely you're either treating each sample as a single time step or collapsing the time series aspect of your data. The LSTM is then effectively trying to process each individual data point as an independent sample, ignoring the inherent sequential relationships.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Input Shape (2D)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Incorrect data -  Missing the timestep dimension
data = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # 100 samples, 5 features, NO timesteps

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(64, input_shape=(None, 5))) # input_shape expects (timesteps, features) - but data only has features.
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

model.fit(data, np.random.rand(100,1), epochs=10) # This will fail or give unexpected results.
```

This code demonstrates the most frequent error. The `data` array lacks the crucial `timesteps` dimension.  The `input_shape` parameter in the `LSTM` layer is incorrectly interpreting the 5 as the number of timesteps when it should be the number of features.  This will likely result in a `ValueError` during model training.

**Example 2: Correcting the Input Shape (3D)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Correct data - Added the timestep dimension
data = np.random.rand(100, 20, 5) # 100 samples, 20 timesteps, 5 features

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(64, input_shape=(20, 5))) # input_shape correctly specifies timesteps and features
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

model.fit(data, np.random.rand(100,1), epochs=10) # This should run without issues.
```

This example explicitly defines the `timesteps` dimension (20). The `input_shape` is now correctly set to `(20, 5)`, representing 20 timesteps and 5 features.  The model will now correctly process the sequential data.  Note that the `None` in the previous example could be used instead of 20 to allow varying length sequences.  Using `None` requires you to batch sequences of equal length.  


**Example 3: Reshaping Data for LSTM Input**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

# Data with only samples and features
data = np.random.rand(100, 100) # 100 samples, 100 features

# Reshape data to add the timesteps dimension
timesteps = 20
features = 5
reshaped_data = data.reshape((100, timesteps, features))


model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(64, input_shape=(timesteps, features)))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

model.fit(reshaped_data, np.random.rand(100,1), epochs=10) # This should run without error.

```

This example showcases how to handle data that initially lacks the `timesteps` dimension. We explicitly reshape the input data to introduce the required dimension. This assumes that the total number of data points (100 features in this case) can be neatly divided into `timesteps` x `features`. If not, you might need to adjust your data preprocessing to handle variable-length sequences or padding.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, etc.) on the LSTM layer specifics and input requirements.  Review introductory materials on time series analysis and sequence modeling to gain a stronger conceptual understanding of sequential data representation.  Familiarize yourself with common data preprocessing techniques for time series data, particularly techniques like padding and windowing for handling variable-length sequences. Explore dedicated resources focusing on recurrent neural networks and their applications to various problem domains.  Understanding the concepts of backpropagation through time (BPTT) and the vanishing/exploding gradient problem would further enrich your understanding.  Finally, textbooks on machine learning and deep learning can provide a robust foundation.
