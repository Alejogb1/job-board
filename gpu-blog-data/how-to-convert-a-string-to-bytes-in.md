The core challenge in converting strings to bytes when porting Python 2 code to Python 3.7 stems from the fundamental difference in how strings are handled.  Python 2 implicitly uses ASCII encoding for strings unless otherwise specified, leading to potential encoding errors when interacting with data using different character sets. Python 3, on the other hand, treats strings as Unicode by default, requiring explicit encoding specifications for byte conversion. This necessitates a careful approach during the migration process to ensure data integrity and prevent runtime exceptions.  My experience working on legacy systems revealed this subtle but crucial distinction repeatedly.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Python 2's `str` type behaved as a sequence of bytes, largely equivalent to Python 3's `bytes` type.  Python 3's `str` type represents Unicode characters.  Therefore, a direct conversion from a Python 2 string to a Python 3 bytes object requires understanding the original encoding of the Python 2 string.  If the original encoding is unknown, assumptions can lead to incorrect byte representations and data corruption. The best practice is to identify the encoding used in the Python 2 code.  If documentation is unavailable, careful examination of the data source and any existing error handling mechanisms within the Python 2 codebase can provide clues.  Once the encoding is determined, the appropriate encoding parameter can be used with the `encode()` method in Python 3.

Without knowledge of the encoding, assuming ASCII may seem like a simple solution, but this is dangerous, particularly with internationalized data.  Incorrectly assuming ASCII will result in the loss of characters outside the ASCII range, leading to functional failure or subtle errors difficult to trace.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Known Encoding (UTF-8)**

This example demonstrates converting a string explicitly encoded in UTF-8 in Python 2 to bytes in Python 3.

```python
# Python 2 code (Illustrative)
my_string = u"你好，世界" #Note the u prefix indicating Unicode in Python 2
my_bytes = my_string.encode('utf-8') 
# ... further processing of my_bytes ...


#Equivalent Python 3 code
my_string = "你好，世界"  # Python 3 string is Unicode by default
my_bytes = my_string.encode('utf-8')
# ... further processing of my_bytes ...

print(my_bytes) # Output: b'\xe4\xbd\xa0\xe5\xa5\xbd\xef\xbc\x8c\xe4\xb8\x96\xe7\x95\x8c'
print(type(my_bytes)) # Output: <class 'bytes'>
```

**Commentary:**  The Python 2 code explicitly indicates Unicode using the `u` prefix. In Python 3, this prefix is unnecessary because strings are Unicode by default.  The `encode('utf-8')` method consistently generates the UTF-8 byte representation.  The `b` prefix in the output indicates a bytes literal.


**Example 2:  Handling Potential Encoding Errors**

This example demonstrates gracefully handling potential encoding errors during conversion.  If the string contains characters outside the specified encoding's range, the `errors` parameter allows for handling these gracefully, preventing abrupt program termination.

```python
# Python 3 code
my_string = "你好，世界!  This contains some extended characters: ಠ_ಠ"
try:
    my_bytes = my_string.encode('ascii')
except UnicodeEncodeError as e:
    print(f"Encoding error: {e}")
    my_bytes = my_string.encode('utf-8', 'ignore') # Ignores unencodable characters
    print(f"Encoded with errors ignored: {my_bytes}")
    
    my_bytes_replace = my_string.encode('ascii', 'replace') #Replaces unencodable characters with '?'
    print(f"Encoded with characters replaced: {my_bytes_replace}")
```

**Commentary:**  This example shows the use of a `try-except` block to catch `UnicodeEncodeError` exceptions.  Two error handling strategies are illustrated: `'ignore'` which discards unencodable characters and `'replace'` which substitutes them with a replacement character ('?'). The choice depends on the application's tolerance for data loss.  Prefer `'replace'` unless data loss is acceptable.


**Example 3:  Conversion from a File**

This example showcases handling encoding when reading from a file, a common scenario in migrating legacy systems.

```python
# Python 3 code

def read_and_encode(filepath, encoding):
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r', encoding=encoding) as f:
            contents = f.read()
            return contents.encode(encoding)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return None
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        return None


encoded_data = read_and_encode("my_file.txt", "latin-1")
if encoded_data:
    print(encoded_data)
else:
    print("File not found or encoding error.")

```

**Commentary:** This function encapsulates the file reading and encoding process. It accepts the file path and encoding as input. It uses a `try-except` block to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and `UnicodeDecodeError`.  This structured approach minimizes potential errors and improves code robustness. The use of `with open(...)` ensures that the file is properly closed even if exceptions occur.  The function returns `None` on error.  Remember to replace `"latin-1"` with the actual encoding of your file.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The Python documentation on encoding and decoding is invaluable.   Consult official Python tutorials on file I/O and exception handling for robust error management.  Understanding Unicode and character encoding concepts is essential.  A good text on computer science fundamentals will cover these topics.  Finally, reviewing your existing Python 2 code’s documentation and comments for encoding information should be the first step.  Thorough testing of your ported code is imperative to identify any unforeseen encoding issues.
