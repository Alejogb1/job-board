The missing momentum state within a restored optimizer from a checkpoint stems from the way most deep learning frameworks serialize and deserialize optimizer states. It's not typically a flaw in the checkpointing mechanism itself, but rather an intentional design choice centered on efficiency and flexibility during model retraining or transfer learning. In practice, only the weights and, often, biases of the model are captured when creating a checkpoint. The optimizer's internal workings, which include variables like momentum, are considered to be transient states specific to the current training session. This approach allows for easier adaptation to new hyperparameters or datasets without carrying over optimizer-specific configurations from a potentially unrelated previous training run. I've encountered this issue frequently when transitioning models between different environments or after modifying the training regime, leading me to understand the nuances behind this behavior.

When training a deep learning model, optimizers such as Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum or Adam maintain internal states that influence the updating of model parameters. Momentum, specifically, represents a weighted average of past gradients. This contributes to faster convergence and can help navigate local minima. When a model and its optimizer are serialized to a checkpoint, the model’s learnable parameters are saved. However, the optimizer's specific historical states, such as the moving averages maintained for momentum, are commonly not included by default. This exclusion simplifies the process of loading a model's weights for inference or transfer learning without forcing the user to use the same training regime.

Consider a scenario where a model is trained using an Adam optimizer with a specific set of parameters, including beta1, beta2 and a small learning rate. If all of the optimizers internal states were saved and restored, upon reloading, the optimizer's momentum buffers could be in conflict with the new training parameters or dataset. This could lead to undesirable results, such as the optimizer pushing the model in the wrong direction. Therefore, restoring the entire optimizer state, including momentum, is typically avoided. The common practice is to simply restore the model parameters and then initialize a new optimizer instance with the desired training parameters to ensure control of the training procedure.

I’ll now provide three code examples, based on my experience using PyTorch, to better illustrate this process. The first example will be a simple demonstration of a model, optimizer, and training loop. In the second, I'll demonstrate checkpointing and loading, highlighting the missing momentum. Finally, the third example will show how momentum can be optionally saved and restored, with the understanding of the challenges this introduces.

**Example 1: Model and Optimizer Training Setup**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Initialize the model and optimizer
model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)

# Dummy training data
dummy_data = torch.randn(100, 10)
dummy_labels = torch.randn(100, 2)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Basic training loop
for epoch in range(3):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(dummy_data)
    loss = criterion(outputs, dummy_labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')
```

This example sets up a basic model and an SGD optimizer with momentum. The training loop simulates a few training steps, showcasing the operation of momentum. The critical point is that the optimizer's state, including momentum accumulators, are modified with each iteration but are *not* saved when the model parameters are saved.

**Example 2: Checkpointing and Loading (Missing Momentum)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import os

# (Model definition and training loop similar to Example 1, will omit for brevity)

# --- Assume the model and optimizer from example one are trained for some time. ---

# Save the model's parameters only (common practice)
checkpoint_path = "model_checkpoint.pth"
torch.save(model.state_dict(), checkpoint_path)

# Load the parameters, creating a new model instance
loaded_model = SimpleModel()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load(checkpoint_path))

# Initialize a new optimizer (momentum will be reset)
loaded_optimizer = optim.SGD(loaded_model.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)

# Verify that the loaded optimizer has a momentum initialized to zeros.
for group in loaded_optimizer.param_groups:
    for param in group['params']:
        if param.grad is not None: # Skip uninitialized parameters
            state = loaded_optimizer.state[param]
            if "momentum_buffer" in state:
                print('Momentum after loading:',state["momentum_buffer"])
            else:
                print('Momentum buffer not found')
                break
    break # Break after inspecting first group's first parameter

# Continue training with loaded model and *new* optimizer state.
print("Continuing training with loaded model and new optimizer")
for epoch in range(3):
  loaded_optimizer.zero_grad()
  outputs = loaded_model(dummy_data)
  loss = criterion(outputs, dummy_labels)
  loss.backward()
  loaded_optimizer.step()
  print(f'Epoch: {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

os.remove(checkpoint_path)
```
In this example, only the model's `state_dict` (containing weights and biases) is saved. When the model is loaded, the `optimizer` is initialized again as a new object. This means the historical momentum values that the original optimizer accumulated during the initial training phase are lost. This results in the model picking up training from a point where all momentum values are reset to zero. This behavior is by design and not an error; this ensures the loaded model is ready to be finetuned with a new optimizer setting, if necessary.

**Example 3: Saving and Restoring Momentum (with caution)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import os

# (Model definition, optimizer initialization and basic training loop similar to Example 1, will omit for brevity)

#--- Assume the model and optimizer from example one are trained for some time. ---

# Save not only the model's parameters but also the optimizer's state.
full_checkpoint = {"model_state": model.state_dict(),
                "optimizer_state": optimizer.state_dict()}
torch.save(full_checkpoint, "full_checkpoint.pth")

# Load full state
loaded_full_checkpoint = torch.load("full_checkpoint.pth")

# Load model and optimizer with states.
loaded_model_full = SimpleModel()
loaded_model_full.load_state_dict(loaded_full_checkpoint["model_state"])
loaded_optimizer_full = optim.SGD(loaded_model_full.parameters(), lr=0.01, momentum=0.9)
loaded_optimizer_full.load_state_dict(loaded_full_checkpoint["optimizer_state"])

# Verify that the loaded optimizer has its historical momentum
for group in loaded_optimizer_full.param_groups:
    for param in group['params']:
        if param.grad is not None: # Skip uninitialized parameters
            state = loaded_optimizer_full.state[param]
            if "momentum_buffer" in state:
                print('Momentum after loading:',state["momentum_buffer"])
            else:
                print("Momentum not found")
                break
    break # Break after inspecting first group's first parameter

print("Continuing training with loaded model and optimizer states")
# Continue training with loaded model and restored optimizer state.
for epoch in range(3):
    loaded_optimizer_full.zero_grad()
    outputs = loaded_model_full(dummy_data)
    loss = criterion(outputs, dummy_labels)
    loss.backward()
    loaded_optimizer_full.step()
    print(f'Epoch: {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

os.remove("full_checkpoint.pth")
```

This example demonstrates saving and restoring the entire optimizer state, including the historical momentum buffers.  While it might seem intuitive to do this to resume training seamlessly, this can be problematic. This approach limits the flexibility to modify optimizer parameters, learning rates, or even switch to different optimizers when continuing the training. As a result, this method should only be considered when the training configuration will be identical between sessions and when the risk of conflicting states is acceptable.

For further study, several resources can be beneficial. Deep learning framework documentation usually offers detailed insights into checkpointing mechanisms, including explanations of which states are serialized. Textbooks focusing on deep learning algorithms provide in-depth discussion on the mathematical background of optimizers and momentum, helping to better grasp the significance of optimizer state. Finally, open source repositories of deep learning projects often show best practices in action. By consulting these various sources, one can obtain a detailed understanding of why momentum is often absent in a restored optimizer state and when it can, or should, be included.
