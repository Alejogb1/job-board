CUDA's asynchronous `memcpy` operations, when allowed to overlap, exhibit behavior governed primarily by the underlying hardware's capabilities and the specific scheduling choices made by the CUDA runtime. My experience working on high-performance computing applications for geophysical simulations revealed a crucial aspect often overlooked:  the non-deterministic nature of overlapping asynchronous `memcpy` calls, even within a single stream.  This unpredictability stems from the interplay between the memory controller bandwidth, the number of concurrently active memory transactions, and the internal scheduling heuristics of the CUDA driver.  Therefore, expecting precisely predictable performance gains from overlapping `memcpy`s is misguided.  Instead, focusing on maximizing memory bandwidth utilization through careful stream management and data organization yields far more reliable performance improvements.

**1. Explanation of Asynchronous `memcpy` Overlap Behavior**

The CUDA runtime manages asynchronous `memcpy` calls using streams.  Each stream represents a sequence of operations executed in order.  However, different streams can execute concurrently. When multiple asynchronous `memcpy` operations are launched within a single stream or across multiple streams, the CUDA driver attempts to overlap them. This overlap is not guaranteed, and its effectiveness hinges on multiple factors.

Firstly, the hardware's memory bandwidth is a fundamental constraint.  If the total bandwidth demand from overlapping `memcpy` operations exceeds the available bandwidth, the operations will effectively serialize, negating any performance benefits from overlapping.  This is particularly relevant with large data transfers, especially on GPUs with limited memory bandwidth.

Secondly, the CUDA driver's internal scheduler plays a significant role.  The scheduler determines the order in which memory operations are executed, aiming to optimize utilization.  However, this scheduling is not transparent to the programmer.  Factors like memory access patterns, data locality, and the interplay with other kernel launches in the streams influence the scheduler's decisions. This lack of transparency makes precise prediction of overlap effectiveness difficult.  For example, a memory copy that requires access to frequently used memory locations might be prioritized over another, regardless of its chronological placement in the stream.

Finally, the size of the memory transfers influences overlap effectiveness. Smaller transfers might be grouped together by the scheduler, leading to efficient overlapping.  Larger transfers, requiring substantial amounts of bandwidth, might not see significant overlap if launched simultaneously in the same stream or even across different streams, depending on resource availability and driver behavior. In my experience optimizing seismic wave propagation simulations, I encountered this limitation when attempting to aggressively overlap numerous smaller data transfers.  This strategy proved less effective than carefully reorganizing data structures to allow for larger, more efficient, sequential transfers with minimal overlap.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different approaches to asynchronous `memcpy` and the potential for overlap.


**Example 1: Overlapping within a single stream (Limited Overlap)**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void kernel(const float* input, float* output) {
  // ... kernel operations ...
}

int main() {
  float *h_input, *h_output, *d_input, *d_output;
  // ... memory allocation ...

  cudaStream_t stream;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

  cudaMemcpyAsync(d_input, h_input, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream); // Copy 1
  cudaMemcpyAsync(d_output, h_output, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream); // Copy 2 (potentially overlapping Copy 1)
  kernel<<<blocks, threads, 0, stream>>>(d_input, d_output); // Kernel launch (potentially overlapping Copy 2)
  cudaMemcpyAsync(h_output, d_output, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream); // Copy 3 (potentially overlapping kernel)
  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream); // Ensure completion before exiting

  // ... memory deallocation ...
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream);

  return 0;
}
```

This example attempts to overlap three `memcpy` operations within a single stream. However, the degree of actual overlap is highly dependent on the factors mentioned earlier.  The scheduler might serialize the copies if the bandwidth is saturated.


**Example 2: Overlapping across multiple streams (Improved Potential for Overlap)**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// ... kernel and memory allocation as in Example 1 ...

int main() {
  cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);

  cudaMemcpyAsync(d_input, h_input, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream1);
  kernel<<<blocks, threads, 0, stream1>>>(d_input, d_output);

  cudaMemcpyAsync(d_output, h_output, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream2);
  cudaMemcpyAsync(h_output, d_output, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream2);

  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1);
  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream2);

  // ... memory deallocation ...
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);
  return 0;
}
```

This example uses two streams, offering a higher potential for overlap.  The operations in `stream1` and `stream2` can execute concurrently, provided there are sufficient resources.  However, the success of this approach still depends on sufficient memory bandwidth and efficient scheduling.


**Example 3:  Prioritizing Bandwidth Efficiency Over Aggressive Overlap**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// ... kernel and memory allocation as in Example 1 ...

int main() {
  cudaStream_t stream;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

  cudaMemcpyAsync(d_input, h_input, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);
  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream); // Ensure completion before kernel launch
  kernel<<<blocks, threads, 0, stream>>>(d_input, d_output);
  cudaMemcpyAsync(h_output, d_output, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream);
  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);

  // ... memory deallocation ...
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream);
  return 0;
}
```

This example prioritizes sequential execution. Although it avoids overlapping `memcpy` operations, it ensures that each operation completes before the next begins.  This approach can be more efficient in scenarios where aggressive overlap leads to contention and suboptimal bandwidth utilization.  In practice, this approach sometimes proved surprisingly better than more complex strategies involving multiple streams and overlapped copies.  The key takeaway is that careful profiling and analysis are critical for maximizing performance.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official CUDA Programming Guide and the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide.  Additionally, studying the CUDA Occupancy Calculator and the NVVP (NVIDIA Visual Profiler) are essential for performance analysis and optimization.  Analyzing memory access patterns through tools like the NVIDIA Nsight Compute are invaluable for identifying and mitigating memory bottlenecks.  Finally, a strong understanding of the target GPU architecture and its memory subsystem is crucial for effectively managing asynchronous memory transfers.
