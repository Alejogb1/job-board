The root cause of a non-terminating iteration over a PyTorch DataLoader almost always stems from an incorrect understanding or misconfiguration of the `DataLoader`'s `drop_last` parameter, combined with subtle issues related to dataset size and batch size interactions.  My experience debugging this type of issue in large-scale image classification projects has shown that neglecting this parameter's implications often leads to infinite loops.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `PyTorch DataLoader` is designed for efficient batching of data.  It iterates over your dataset, dividing it into batches of a specified size. The `drop_last` parameter controls the handling of the last batch.  If `drop_last=True`, the `DataLoader` discards the last batch if its size is smaller than the specified batch size. This ensures that all batches are of uniform size, which can be beneficial for certain models and training procedures. However, if `drop_last=False` (the default), the `DataLoader` *always* returns the last batch, regardless of its size.  This last batch might contain fewer samples than the defined batch size.

The problem arises when you have a dataset size that is not perfectly divisible by your batch size. If `drop_last=False`, the `DataLoader` will create a final, incomplete batch.  Your loop, designed to iterate a specific number of times (perhaps based on an erroneous assumption about the number of full batches), will then continue indefinitely because it doesn't account for this incomplete, but still present, final batch.  This often manifests as a loop that runs longer than expected, appearing as a never-ending iteration. The infinite loop isn't a fault of the `DataLoader` itself but a mismatch between your iteration logic and its behavior in handling incomplete batches.  Careful consideration of the dataset size, batch size, and the `drop_last` flag is paramount.  Failing to do so can lead to unexpected program behavior, including seemingly infinite loops.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  The Problem Case (Infinite Loop)**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.data = torch.randn(size, 10) # Example data

    def __len__(self):
        return self.size

    def __getitem__(self):
        return self.data

dataset = MyDataset(size=17) # Dataset size not divisible by batch size
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=5, drop_last=False)

for i, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
    print(f"Iteration: {i}, Batch size: {batch.shape}")

```

This code will produce an infinite loop (or at least a loop far longer than expected). The dataset has 17 samples, and a batch size of 5 is used.  The `DataLoader` creates three full batches (5 samples each) and one final batch with only 2 samples.  Because `drop_last=False`, this final, incomplete batch is included.  A loop expecting only three iterations will never terminate.

**Example 2: Correcting with `drop_last=True`**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.data = torch.randn(size, 10)

    def __len__(self):
        return self.size

    def __getitem__(self):
        return self.data

dataset = MyDataset(size=17)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=5, drop_last=True) # drop_last set to True

for i, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
    print(f"Iteration: {i}, Batch size: {batch.shape}")
```

This corrected version utilizes `drop_last=True`.  The final, incomplete batch containing only two samples is dropped, resulting in exactly three iterations as expected. This approach guarantees a consistent number of iterations and eliminates the potential for an infinite loop.  It's crucial to choose the appropriate setting based on whether consistent batch size or complete data processing is prioritized.

**Example 3:  Iterating Safely with `len()`**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.data = torch.randn(size, 10)

    def __len__(self):
        return self.size

    def __getitem__(self):
        return self.data

dataset = MyDataset(size=17)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=5, drop_last=False) # drop_last remains False

num_iterations = len(dataloader) # Get the number of iterations using len()

for i in range(num_iterations):
    batch = next(iter(dataloader))
    print(f"Iteration: {i}, Batch size: {batch.shape}")
```

This example demonstrates a safe way to iterate even when `drop_last=False`.  We leverage the `len()` function of the `DataLoader`, which correctly accounts for the incomplete last batch.  This method is robust and avoids the infinite loop issue by explicitly defining the number of iterations based on the actual number of batches produced by the `DataLoader`.  This is especially useful when dealing with datasets where you might not want to drop the last batch, but you still need to control the number of iterations of your training loop.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation provides comprehensive details on the `DataLoader` class and its parameters.  Examining the `Dataset` class documentation will also be helpful in understanding how data is structured and accessed.  Familiarizing yourself with the `itertools` library can provide additional tools for managing iteration in complex data processing tasks.  A thorough understanding of Python's iteration protocols is fundamental for effectively utilizing and debugging data loaders.  Finally, carefully consider the use of debugging tools and the Python debugger (`pdb`) to step through the code and examine variable values during execution.  This can be invaluable in pinpointing the source of issues in complex data processing pipelines.
