The challenge of mapping input IDs to a limited set of embedding indexes arises frequently in natural language processing, specifically when working with large vocabularies or resource-constrained environments. The core problem is this: the size of a vocabulary, which might easily contain hundreds of thousands or even millions of unique tokens, often exceeds the practical dimensions for embedding layers, whose size directly impacts model parameter count and computational complexity. Consequently, directly mapping each vocabulary token to a unique embedding index is not feasible. Instead, we require a strategy to reduce the dimensionality of the input space before accessing the embedding table. This is essentially a form of compression, trading off some potential representational fidelity for efficiency.

One common and effective approach utilizes a hashing function applied to the input ID. The goal is to map the input ID space, which is typically a large contiguous range of integers corresponding to a vocabulary, to a smaller range of integers representing indices in the embedding table. This hashing mechanism ideally distributes the input IDs relatively evenly across the target range, minimizing collisions where different input IDs are mapped to the same embedding index. The quality of the hashing function greatly influences the performance of the model; a poor distribution can lead to an underutilized embedding space or a significant number of collisions. A good hashing function minimizes these issues.

Another method involves subword tokenization coupled with vocabulary truncation. Instead of mapping entire words, the model works with smaller units like word pieces or byte-pair encodings (BPE). This inherently reduces the vocabulary size and consequently the range of input IDs. Further, we can limit the vocabulary to only the most frequent tokens, creating a truncated vocabulary. This smaller vocabulary is then used in conjunction with a straightforward index mapping (e.g., sequential integers representing the position of the token in the truncated vocabulary). Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens are handled by mapping them to a single index, often representing a generic 'unknown' token. The advantage here is in directly reducing the input space and simplifying the mapping rather than employing hashing.

In practice, a combination of subword tokenization and a hash-based embedding lookup can provide a good balance between efficiency and model performance. Subword tokenization curtails the vocabulary size, while hashing manages potential vocabulary increases and distributes tokens more randomly within the limited embedding space.

Here are three code examples demonstrating different approaches:

**Example 1: Simple modulo hashing**

```python
import numpy as np

def modulo_hash(input_id, embedding_size):
  """Maps an input ID to an embedding index using modulo hashing."""
  return input_id % embedding_size

# Example Usage:
vocab_size = 10000
embedding_size = 100
input_ids = np.arange(vocab_size)
embedding_indices = [modulo_hash(id, embedding_size) for id in input_ids]
print(f"Example Modulo Hash Output: {embedding_indices[0:10]} ... {embedding_indices[-10:]}")
```

In this example, `modulo_hash` is a simple hash function that maps each `input_id` to an index by calculating the remainder when divided by `embedding_size`. The range of the output is guaranteed to be within `[0, embedding_size -1]`, making it suitable for embedding lookup. However, this specific method can lead to clusters, where input IDs that are multiples of the `embedding_size` end up mapping to the same indices, resulting in an uneven embedding usage and potential collisions. The output section shows the first and last 10 mapped indexes for demonstration, illustrating the repeating patterns created by the modulo function.

**Example 2: Subword tokenization with a fixed vocabulary and OOV handling**

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

def subword_mapping(text, tokenizer, vocab_size, oov_token_index):
  """Maps text to embedding indices using subword tokenization."""
  tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
  token_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)
  embedding_indices = [id if id < vocab_size else oov_token_index for id in token_ids]
  return embedding_indices

# Example Usage:
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"  # example model using subword tokenization
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
vocab_size = 1000 # Fixed vocabulary size. Must be lower than the tokenizer vocabulary.
oov_token_index = 0 # Index to map out-of-vocabulary tokens to

example_text = "This is an example of using subword tokenization."
mapped_indices = subword_mapping(example_text, tokenizer, vocab_size, oov_token_index)
print(f"Example Subword mapping output: {mapped_indices}")

example_text_oov = "This is an example with an UNKNOWNword."
mapped_indices_oov = subword_mapping(example_text_oov, tokenizer, vocab_size, oov_token_index)
print(f"Example Subword mapping output with OOV: {mapped_indices_oov}")
```

This example employs the `transformers` library's subword tokenization capabilities. It tokenizes input text, converts tokens to IDs, and then truncates these IDs by mapping any ID larger than a defined `vocab_size` to a specific `oov_token_index`. This approach demonstrably reduces the effective vocabulary used for lookup. The two output sections demonstrate first with vocabulary tokens and secondly with an out-of-vocabulary token mapped to the `oov_token_index`, demonstrating the handling of tokens not in the set of considered vocabulary.

**Example 3: Combination of subword tokenization and a hash function**

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
import hashlib

def combined_mapping(text, tokenizer, embedding_size, oov_token_index):
    """Maps text to embedding indices using subword tokenization followed by hashing."""
    tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
    token_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)

    def hash_to_index(token_id, embedding_size):
      hash_object = hashlib.md5(str(token_id).encode())
      hash_int = int(hash_object.hexdigest(), 16)
      return hash_int % embedding_size

    embedding_indices = [hash_to_index(id,embedding_size) if id else oov_token_index for id in token_ids]
    return embedding_indices

# Example Usage:
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
embedding_size = 500 # Fixed embedding size
oov_token_index = 0  # Index to map out-of-vocabulary tokens to

example_text = "This is an example of combined mapping."
mapped_indices = combined_mapping(example_text, tokenizer, embedding_size, oov_token_index)
print(f"Example combined approach output: {mapped_indices}")

example_text_oov = "This is an example with an UNKNOWNword."
mapped_indices_oov = combined_mapping(example_text_oov, tokenizer, embedding_size, oov_token_index)
print(f"Example combined approach output with OOV: {mapped_indices_oov}")
```

This final example combines subword tokenization with a hashing approach. The text is tokenized, and each token ID is then processed using `hashlib.md5`. The resulting hash is used to calculate the embedding index, again using the modulo operation. This method combines the vocabulary size reduction of subword tokenization with the mapping of a larger vocabulary to a smaller space via hashing. The output demonstrates the mapped indexes for vocabulary and an out-of-vocabulary token, which is mapped to 0. The hashing provides better distribution of vocabulary tokens within the available embedding space. This is typically a better solution than the first example and better suited for larger vocabularies than the second.

For further exploration, I recommend looking into research related to the following concepts: locality-sensitive hashing, which can optimize the distribution of tokens; techniques for efficient computation of embeddings like quantized embeddings; and more advanced subword tokenization algorithms such as SentencePiece. Additionally, studies on the impact of hashing function selection and embedding size on model performance are valuable resources. Exploring how these methods can be used in conjunction with other techniques such as knowledge distillation is also worthwhile.
