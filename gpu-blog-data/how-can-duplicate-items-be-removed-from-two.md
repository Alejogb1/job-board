The core challenge in deduplicating items across two lists while preserving uniqueness within each lies in efficiently comparing elements across both data structures and selectively removing duplicates based on a global, not local, uniqueness criterion.  My experience optimizing database queries with similar constraints informs my approach.  Simply concatenating and then applying a set operation is insufficient, as it would incorrectly eliminate duplicates that exist only within a single list. A more nuanced strategy is necessary.

The solution involves iterative comparison, leveraging the inherent properties of sets for efficient membership checking.  The algorithm proceeds in two steps: first, we create a combined set of all unique elements from both lists; second, we iterate through this combined set, reconstructing new lists containing only those elements that meet our deduplication criteria. This method ensures that we maintain the integrity of individual list membership while removing cross-list duplicates.

**Explanation:**

1. **Combined Set Creation:** The initial step focuses on building a set containing every unique element present in either input list. Sets, by definition, only store unique values, providing an efficient way to identify and remove duplicates within the combined data. This avoids redundant comparisons and improves overall performance, particularly with larger lists.

2. **Iterative Reconstruction:**  The subsequent step iterates through this combined set. For each element, we check its presence in both the original lists. If the element exists in only one of the original lists, it is added to the corresponding reconstructed list.  If the element exists in both original lists, it's added to only one of the reconstructed lists (arbitrarily chosen, or a more sophisticated selection could be implemented based on specific criteria).  This careful reconstruction guarantees that elements are not removed if they appear exclusively within a single list, thereby meeting the problem's constraint.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Python using sets and list comprehensions (for brevity and readability)**

```python
def deduplicate_across_lists(list1, list2):
    """Removes duplicates across two lists while preserving within-list uniqueness."""

    combined_set = set(list1 + list2)  # Efficiently combines and removes duplicates
    list1_deduplicated = [item for item in combined_set if item in list1]
    list2_deduplicated = [item for item in combined_set if item in list2 and item not in list1_deduplicated] # Prioritizes list1.  Alternative logic could be applied here.

    return list1_deduplicated, list2_deduplicated


list_a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list_b = [3, 5, 6, 7, 8]

deduplicated_a, deduplicated_b = deduplicate_across_lists(list_a, list_b)
print(f"Deduplicated List A: {deduplicated_a}")  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(f"Deduplicated List B: {deduplicated_b}")  # Output: [6, 7, 8]
```

This Python example leverages the efficiency of sets for initial deduplication and list comprehensions for concise reconstruction. The prioritization of `list1` in the second list comprehension is arbitrary and can be adjusted based on specific requirements.

**Example 2:  C++ using `std::set` and iterators (for performance in larger datasets)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

std::pair<std::vector<int>, std::vector<int>> deduplicate_across_lists(const std::vector<int>& list1, const std::vector<int>& list2) {
  std::set<int> combined_set;
  combined_set.insert(list1.begin(), list1.end());
  combined_set.insert(list2.begin(), list2.end());

  std::vector<int> list1_deduplicated;
  std::vector<int> list2_deduplicated;

  for (int item : combined_set) {
    if (std::find(list1.begin(), list1.end(), item) != list1.end()) {
      list1_deduplicated.push_back(item);
    }
    if (std::find(list2.begin(), list2.end(), item) != list2.end() && std::find(list1_deduplicated.begin(), list1_deduplicated.end(), item) == list1_deduplicated.end()) {
      list2_deduplicated.push_back(item);
    }
  }

  return std::make_pair(list1_deduplicated, list2_deduplicated);
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> list_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::vector<int> list_b = {3, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    auto result = deduplicate_across_lists(list_a, list_b);
    // Print the results (similar to Python example)
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ example demonstrates a more performance-oriented approach suitable for larger datasets. The use of `std::set` and iterators minimizes redundant operations.  The `std::find` function efficiently checks for element presence.

**Example 3: JavaScript using `Set` and `filter` (for browser-based applications)**

```javascript
function deduplicateAcrossLists(list1, list2) {
  const combinedSet = new Set([...list1, ...list2]);
  const list1Deduplicated = [...combinedSet].filter(item => list1.includes(item));
  const list2Deduplicated = [...combinedSet].filter(item => list2.includes(item) && !list1Deduplicated.includes(item));
  return [list1Deduplicated, list2Deduplicated];
}

const listA = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listB = [3, 5, 6, 7, 8];
const [deduplicatedA, deduplicatedB] = deduplicateAcrossLists(listA, listB);
console.log("Deduplicated List A:", deduplicatedA); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log("Deduplicated List B:", deduplicatedB); // Output: [6, 7, 8]
```

This JavaScript example mirrors the Python approach in its logic but utilizes JavaScript's built-in `Set` and `filter` methods, suitable for client-side scripting environments.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of set theory and its applications in algorithm design, I recommend exploring introductory texts on discrete mathematics and algorithm analysis.  Further, studying the standard library documentation for your chosen programming language (Python's `set` operations, C++'s `<algorithm>` header, JavaScript's `Set` object) will provide valuable insights into efficient data structure manipulation.  Finally, a solid grasp of Big O notation will aid in evaluating the efficiency of different deduplication strategies.
