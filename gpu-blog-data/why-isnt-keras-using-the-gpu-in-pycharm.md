It's not uncommon to experience a situation where Keras, seemingly configured for GPU usage, still defaults to the CPU, especially within specific IDE environments like PyCharm, and particularly with older configurations like Python 3.5 and TensorFlow 1.4. The core issue often stems from the interplay between TensorFlow's backend selection, CUDA availability and configuration, and the environment settings managed by the IDE itself. It's less about Keras failing and more about the underlying layers failing to communicate correctly with available GPU resources.

My experience, primarily involving training large image classification models during a research project in 2018, made this frustrating situation very familiar. Back then, ensuring that Keras actually used the GPU was almost as time-consuming as the actual training process, because things didn’t ‘just work’ out of the box. I repeatedly ran into scenarios where, despite having a powerful NVIDIA GPU, TensorFlow remained stubbornly on the CPU. This wasn't immediately apparent, since Keras itself doesn’t explicitly reveal what device it's using. I had to dig deeper using internal Tensorflow tools.

Let’s unpack the reasons why Keras might not be leveraging the GPU in your specific scenario, focusing on the combination of PyCharm, Python 3.5, and TensorFlow 1.4. First, TensorFlow 1.4, while functional, lacked the automatic GPU discovery and usage found in later versions. It required much more explicit configuration to utilize the GPU. Secondly, CUDA, the NVIDIA platform used by TensorFlow to perform GPU acceleration, must be installed and correctly configured. Finally, PyCharm's execution environment, particularly when running in debug mode, can interfere with how TensorFlow initializes, sometimes blocking access to the GPU.

The most common cause, as I’ve witnessed, revolves around the visibility of CUDA to TensorFlow. TensorFlow 1.4 required explicit specification of which devices to use, often accomplished through environment variables or in-code configuration. If these configurations are absent, or point to incorrect locations, TensorFlow will simply revert to CPU processing. Specifically, if CUDA and cuDNN were installed, but their paths are not visible to TensorFlow, or if the versions don't match TensorFlow's requirements, then GPU acceleration is impossible. The installation location of these libraries is paramount.

Another common culprit, especially within PyCharm, can be inconsistent environment settings. PyCharm uses virtual environments for each project. If you have TensorFlow installed in the project's virtual environment, you need to ensure the same environment includes the compatible CUDA and cuDNN libraries. A common pitfall is to have a globally accessible version of CUDA installed that is different from what the virtual environment expects. Also, when running Python scripts from within PyCharm’s Run or Debug configurations, you need to ensure the correct interpreter is selected. If the incorrect interpreter or virtual environment is selected, TensorFlow won’t have access to your GPU at all.

Furthermore, the debug mode in PyCharm can introduce subtle timing differences in initialization processes, sometimes leading to TensorFlow not properly detecting the GPU. This is less likely with the final model building, but during initial checks and test runs, it can be misleading. When you're not using debug, the code often initializes differently and will use the GPU correctly.

Let’s illustrate this using some Python code examples.

**Example 1: Verifying GPU Availability**

This example demonstrates how you can verify, within your Python environment, if TensorFlow is detecting a GPU. The code relies on Tensorflow internals for this detection.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check if TensorFlow can see any GPUs
devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if devices:
    print("TensorFlow is using GPU:")
    for device in devices:
      print(device)
else:
    print("TensorFlow is using CPU.")
    print("Check your CUDA and cuDNN installation and verify driver compatibility.")
```

The output of this code snippet will clearly tell you if TensorFlow can even 'see' your GPU. If it reports "TensorFlow is using CPU.", then the next step is to check your CUDA and cuDNN configurations. The output also explicitly indicates the underlying issue.

**Example 2: Explicit GPU Configuration**

In TensorFlow 1.4, you could explicitly tell TensorFlow which device to use. In many cases, if TensorFlow doesn’t detect GPUs automatically, explicitly setting it becomes a necessity. The following code snippet illustrates this process.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Explicitly configure TensorFlow to use the first GPU device (if available)
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
  a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3], name='a')
  b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2], name='b')
  c = tf.matmul(a, b)

  # Create a session and run the graph
  with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      print(sess.run(c))
```

Here, `/GPU:0` tells TensorFlow to perform the matrix multiplication on the first GPU device. If this code still runs on the CPU, it again points to underlying issues related to environment configuration. This is because a device specification forces the computational kernel to run in the specified devices. If the device is not found (not configured) then it will fail.

**Example 3: Limiting GPU Memory Consumption**

TensorFlow 1.4 sometimes faced issues with memory allocation, especially if other programs were using the GPU. The code below can prevent memory leaks or allocation errors. This code should be placed before defining the model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

# Limit TensorFlow GPU memory consumption
config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True  # Only allocate what's needed
sess = tf.compat.v1.Session(config=config)
K.set_session(sess)

# Keras model creation/training goes here
# model = Sequential()
```
This code initializes TensorFlow with configurations to allow the GPU to grow its memory allocation only as needed, preventing it from grabbing all available resources upfront. This can prevent allocation errors and improve resource management, especially in multi-GPU setups, or if other applications are using the GPU.

To resolve the original issue, I'd suggest the following steps. First, verify your CUDA and cuDNN installation. Make sure the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN versions are compatible with TensorFlow 1.4. You should consult the official TensorFlow documentation to check compatibility matrix. Second, verify that your virtual environment in PyCharm includes these correctly installed and configured CUDA and cuDNN versions, and make sure that you're selecting the correct virtual environment when running scripts in PyCharm. Third, explicitly define GPU usage in your TensorFlow/Keras code, especially if auto-detection is not functioning correctly, by using the methods demonstrated in Example 2 and using a memory growth configuration like in Example 3. Finally, consider testing the code outside of PyCharm (from command line) to ensure the IDE isn't influencing the result, since in many cases simply running the code from terminal and not through the IDE will work.

For further learning and debugging, resources like the official TensorFlow documentation (particularly version 1.4 specific docs if still available), CUDA and cuDNN installation guides, and community forums often provide very useful information. Online video tutorials also walk through the process of troubleshooting issues like these. The TensorFlow issue tracker and community forums also contains details of how others have resolved these issues using this particular environment combination.
