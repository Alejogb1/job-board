The core issue with `load_model()` not yielding probability predictions often stems from the mismatch between the model's output layer activation function during training and the expected output during inference.  My experience troubleshooting this across numerous deep learning projects, particularly those involving classification tasks, points to this as the most frequent culprit.  The model might have been trained with a suitable activation (like sigmoid for binary classification or softmax for multi-class classification), but this crucial aspect might be inadvertently lost or altered during the saving and loading process, resulting in raw logits instead of probabilities.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `load_model()` function in Keras (and TensorFlow/Keras) is designed to reconstruct a model's architecture and weights from a saved file.  However, it doesn't inherently manage the post-processing steps that are often integral to generating probability predictions.  Specifically, the output layer of a classification model frequently employs an activation function to transform the raw output of the network (logits) into probabilities.  Logits are unnormalized scores representing the model's confidence in each class.  Sigmoid and softmax functions are common choices for normalizing these logits into probabilities, ranging between 0 and 1.  If the loaded model lacks this final activation step, the output will be logits, which are not interpretable as probabilities directly.  This could be due to several factors:

* **Model saving issues:**  Improper model saving techniques can omit crucial information about the model's configuration, including activation functions.  This is more likely with custom models or when saving the model without using the `save_model` method.

* **Inconsistencies in environments:**  Disparities in the Keras or TensorFlow versions between the training and inference environments can lead to loading discrepancies.  A subtle change in the underlying library's handling of activation functions can inadvertently alter the behavior.

* **Incorrect model architecture reconstruction:** Although rare, if the model architecture is not completely reconstructed during loading, this could omit the activation function from the output layer. This is often related to custom layers or complicated model architectures.

* **Overlooking the activation function during custom model definition:**  If building a custom model, failing to explicitly specify the activation function in the output layer during model construction will result in the model outputting logits.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate with three examples highlighting different scenarios and solutions.

**Example 1:  Missing Activation Function during Model Definition:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Incorrect model definition: Missing activation function in the output layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1) # Missing activation!
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy') # using binary cross entropy but no sigmoid

# ... training process ...

model.save('model_no_activation.h5')

# Loading and inference
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('model_no_activation.h5')
predictions = loaded_model.predict(test_data) # predictions will be logits

# Correct the model definition: Add the sigmoid activation
corrected_model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
corrected_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
# ... retrain with corrected model ...
corrected_model.save('model_with_activation.h5')

# Loading and inference with the corrected model
corrected_loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('model_with_activation.h5')
corrected_predictions = corrected_loaded_model.predict(test_data) # predictions will now be probabilities
```

This example demonstrates the crucial role of the activation function in the output layer.  Without it, the `load_model` will correctly load the architecture and weights but produce logits instead of probabilities. The corrected model explicitly adds the `sigmoid` activation function, ensuring probability outputs.

**Example 2:  Custom Layer without Activation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='random_normal',
                                  trainable=True)
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)


model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    MyCustomLayer(1) # Custom layer without activation
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... training process ...
#Model saving
model.save('custom_layer_model.h5')


# Loading and inference (logits)
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('custom_layer_model.h5', custom_objects={'MyCustomLayer': MyCustomLayer})
predictions = loaded_model.predict(test_data)

#Corrected Model Definition (Add a Sigmoid activation after the custom layer)
corrected_model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    MyCustomLayer(1),
    keras.layers.Activation('sigmoid')
])
corrected_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... retrain with corrected model ...
#Model saving
corrected_model.save('corrected_custom_layer_model.h5')

# Loading and inference (probabilities)
corrected_loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('corrected_custom_layer_model.h5', custom_objects={'MyCustomLayer': MyCustomLayer})
corrected_predictions = corrected_loaded_model.predict(test_data)

```
This example shows a situation with a custom layer.  Note the importance of specifying the `custom_objects` argument in `load_model` when dealing with custom layers.  The crucial correction lies in adding a separate activation layer after the custom layer.


**Example 3: Multi-class Classification and Softmax:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax') # Softmax for multi-class
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... training process ...
model.save('multiclass_model.h5')

# Loading and Inference
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('multiclass_model.h5')
predictions = loaded_model.predict(test_data) # Predictions are probabilities (because of softmax)

```

This example demonstrates the correct use of `softmax` for multi-class classification.  `softmax` ensures that the output is a probability distribution over the classes.  If `softmax` were missing, you'd again obtain logits.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on Keras model saving and loading, and the sections on various activation functions.  A thorough understanding of  linear algebra and probability distributions is highly beneficial.  Consider consulting textbooks on deep learning for a comprehensive theoretical background.  Finally, actively utilize the debugging tools provided by your IDE and TensorFlow/Keras to trace the model's output at different stages of the loading and prediction process.  This will help pin down the exact point where the probability transformation is not happening as expected.
