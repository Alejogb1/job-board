Visual Studio 2013's performance profiling capabilities, while functional, are notoriously sensitive to environment configuration and project setup.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous large-scale C# projects points to several common culprits, often overlooked in initial diagnostics.  The absence of profiling reports frequently stems not from outright failure of the profiling tools themselves, but rather from subtle mismatches between the application's build configuration, the chosen profiling method, and the instrumentation settings.

**1.  Clarification: Understanding the Profiling Pipeline**

Before addressing potential solutions, let's clarify the process. Visual Studio's profiling functionality involves several steps:  instrumentation, execution, data collection, and report generation. Instrumentation inserts profiling code into your application, modifying its behavior to track execution time, memory allocation, and other relevant metrics.  The instrumented application is then run, ideally under realistic conditions, to generate profiling data. Finally, the profiling engine processes this raw data to create a human-readable report.  Failure at any stage—from instrumentation issues to faulty report generation—can lead to the absence of output.

**2. Code Examples and Troubleshooting**

Let's examine three scenarios, each illustrating a common cause and the corresponding solution.  I’ve encountered these repeatedly in projects ranging from high-frequency trading systems to enterprise resource planning applications.

**Example 1:  Incorrect Build Configuration**

The most prevalent reason for failed profiling is the selection of an incorrect build configuration.  Profiling tools often require specific optimizations disabled or debug information enabled.  Building in Release mode with aggressive optimizations can interfere with the instrumentation process, leading to incomplete or missing data.

```C#
//Incorrect - Release mode might interfere with profiling
//Project Properties -> Build -> Configuration: Release

//Correct - Debug configuration is usually necessary for profiling
//Project Properties -> Build -> Configuration: Debug
```

I once spent days chasing down a phantom profiling bug on a high-performance computing project before realizing the team was inadvertently building in Release mode. Switching to Debug mode instantly resolved the issue.  Always double-check your build configuration to ensure it's compatible with profiling, and consider creating a separate configuration explicitly for profiling.


**Example 2:  Incompatible Profiling Method**

Visual Studio 2013 offers multiple profiling methods, each with specific requirements.  The sampling method, for example, relies on periodic snapshots of the call stack, while the instrumentation method inserts code into the application. Choosing the wrong method for your application's characteristics can result in poor or missing data.

```C#
//Incorrect: Sampling might miss short-lived, critical code paths
//Performance Wizard -> Choose Profiling Method: Sampling

//Correct: Instrumentation provides more detailed data, but might slow down execution
//Performance Wizard -> Choose Profiling Method: Instrumentation
```

In one instance, we were using the sampling method to profile a real-time system with numerous short, critical operations.  The sampling method proved ineffective; the infrequent sampling intervals missed many performance bottlenecks. Switching to instrumentation, despite the slight runtime overhead, revealed the true culprits.  Choosing the right method depends on the application’s nature and profiling goals.  For long-running applications, sampling is often sufficient; for short or highly critical code sections, instrumentation may be required.


**Example 3:  Missing or Corrupted Profiling Symbols**

Accurate profiling reports necessitate the presence of debugging symbols (PDB files).  These symbols link the compiled code back to the source code, enabling the profiler to generate meaningful reports that identify specific lines of code and functions contributing to performance issues.  If the PDB files are missing or corrupted, the profiler will generate an incomplete report or fail entirely.

```C#
//Incorrect: Missing PDBs will hinder the profiler's ability to generate a meaningful report
//Project Properties -> Build -> Output -> Debug Info: None

//Correct: Ensure PDB files are generated and readily accessible during profiling
//Project Properties -> Build -> Output -> Debug Info: Full
```

During a large project refactoring, we encountered this problem after inadvertently disabling the generation of PDB files.  The resulting profiling reports were entirely useless, showing only call stack addresses without function names or line numbers. Ensuring PDB generation and their correct placement relative to the executables is paramount for accurate profiling.


**3.  Resource Recommendations**

Consult the official Visual Studio 2013 documentation for detailed information on performance profiling.  Pay close attention to the sections on configuring build options for profiling, choosing appropriate profiling methods, and troubleshooting common issues. The Visual Studio help files and any available online MSDN documentation (if still accessible) provide invaluable technical guidance on this specific release.  Furthermore, a thorough understanding of the .NET Framework and the intricacies of the CLR will aid in the advanced debugging and profiling of your applications.  Understanding the concepts of garbage collection and memory management is crucial, especially when addressing memory profiling issues.  Finally, consider using a dedicated performance monitoring tool alongside Visual Studio to gather complementary data and gain a more comprehensive perspective.

In conclusion, resolving Visual Studio 2013's profiling issues hinges on meticulous attention to the various stages of the profiling process.  Careful consideration of build configuration, the selection of profiling methods, and the availability of debugging symbols are crucial. Addressing these elements systematically will usually resolve the problem of missing performance reports.  Remember, consistent attention to detail is key when dealing with the often-subtle nuances of performance analysis tools in older IDE versions.
