The core challenge in utilizing hyperspectral 1x1 pixel data within convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on datasets like CIFAR-10 or MNIST lies in the fundamental mismatch between the input dimensionality and feature representation. CIFAR-10 and MNIST, fundamentally, deal with spatial information structured as 2D images with three (RGB) or one (grayscale) channels, respectively. Hyperspectral data, even at a 1x1 spatial resolution, presents a high dimensionality across the spectral domain, typically ranging from tens to hundreds of bands. Simply feeding a single pixel's spectral signature as a flat vector into a CNN expecting a 2D input is ineffective without careful adaptation.

Here’s the breakdown of why and how we might approach this: CNNs, by their inherent design, utilize convolutional filters that slide across spatial dimensions, detecting patterns like edges and textures in images. These filters, during training, learn to activate in response to spatial relationships between neighboring pixels within the receptive field. A single pixel, even with multiple spectral bands, lacks this spatial context. The core spatial operations (convolution, pooling) of a standard CNN trained on spatial data would become largely meaningless when applied to a hyperspectral vector. Consider, for instance, a 3x3 convolution. Typically, this is calculated by multiplying the filter weights with a corresponding 3x3 pixel neighborhood within the input image. When operating on a 1x1 pixel with several spectral bands, this operation would require significant modification to handle the 1-dimensional input, resulting in an input channel-wise or point-wise multiplication, rather than a spatial correlation calculation. Therefore, the primary issue lies in the interpretation of a 1x1 hyperspectral vector as if it holds spatial information.

To reconcile the structural differences and explore the feasibility of using these data in a CNN, we need to view the spectral vector as a feature vector, rather than as spatial information. Instead of trying to impose spatial CNN operations on 1x1 pixel hyperspectral data, we should instead approach the classification problem as one of spectral feature classification. One possible strategy, though not straightforward or guaranteed, is using a 1D convolution approach. Instead of applying the CNN in a spatially adjacent sense, we apply 1D kernels that convolve through the spectral dimension. The output of these 1D convolutions then has some meaningful patterns in the spectral dimension, and it can subsequently be fed to fully-connected layers for classification. The objective would be to leverage the network's ability to learn discriminative features, not spatially-oriented features, from the spectral signal.

Let's illustrate this through code examples. Using Python with the TensorFlow/Keras library, we can adapt a basic CNN for this purpose. Here’s the first example, showcasing a conceptual adaptation for classifying hyperspectral data. This is not a direct transfer-learning from, for example, CIFAR-10, but rather a standalone architecture:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def create_hyperspectral_cnn(num_bands, num_classes):
    input_layer = Input(shape=(num_bands, 1)) # (bands, 1) for 1D Conv
    conv1 = Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')(input_layer)
    pool1 = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2)(conv1)
    conv2 = Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu')(pool1)
    pool2 = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2)(conv2)
    flat = Flatten()(pool2)
    dense1 = Dense(128, activation='relu')(flat)
    output_layer = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(dense1)
    model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
    return model

# Example usage:
num_bands = 100 # Arbitrary number of bands for hyperspectral data
num_classes = 10  # For example, equivalent to CIFAR-10 classes.
model = create_hyperspectral_cnn(num_bands, num_classes)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```
In this example, the input shape is structured as `(num_bands, 1)` to accommodate the spectral vector. The key adaptation is the use of `Conv1D` layers, which performs convolutions across the spectral domain. `MaxPooling1D` further reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps. This model is designed from scratch to accommodate the 1D nature of the hyperspectral vector. The parameters of this CNN are learnable from the training data.

However, directly training a CNN like the one above from scratch on small datasets may be problematic. We have limited training data, and the large number of parameters within the CNN can be a problem. Let’s explore a transfer-learning approach with a fully-connected neural network to address the problem with less complexity. This transfer-learning approach, though not directly leveraging the convolutional structure for spatial understanding, can benefit from pre-trained layers’ learned representations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16  # Using VGG16 as example

def create_transfer_learning_model(num_bands, num_classes):
    # Load a pre-trained model and exclude top FC layers.
    base_model = VGG16(include_top=False, input_shape=(32,32,3)) # Image shape is not directly used
    for layer in base_model.layers:
        layer.trainable = False # freeze the layers for initial transfer learning

    input_layer = Input(shape=(num_bands,)) #Input will be the flattened hyperspectral vector
    reshaped = tf.reshape(input_layer, shape=(1, num_bands, 1)) # reshape to 3D to feed into conv layers
    conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(3, kernel_size=3, padding='same')(reshaped) #1D convolution to get spatial information.
    flattened_layer = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(conv_layer)

    base_model_output = base_model(tf.tile(tf.reshape(flattened_layer, [1,1,12]), (1, 32,32,1))) #Use the reshaped output of the fully connected layer as input to the pre-trained model.

    flattened = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(base_model_output) #Flatten the pre-trained model output for the fully connected classification layers.
    dense1 = Dense(128, activation='relu')(flattened)
    output_layer = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(dense1)
    model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
    return model

# Example usage:
num_bands = 100 # Arbitrary number of bands for hyperspectral data
num_classes = 10
model = create_transfer_learning_model(num_bands, num_classes)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```
In this example, we are taking the output of the hyperspectral data through some transformation, and feeding it to a pre-trained VGG16 model (without the classification layers). This approach leverages feature representations learned by the VGG16 during training on massive image datasets.  We add a simple 1D convolution layer to add spatial information, reshape it to something VGG16 can use, flatten, and then add fully connected layers for classification purposes. This technique could offer faster training times and potentially better results in cases where little training data exists for hyperspectral signatures, especially with a large number of spectral bands.

Finally, here is a more direct approach of classifying the hyperspectral data using a fully-connected network. This architecture is the simplest but still useful for baseline testing.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def create_fully_connected_model(num_bands, num_classes):
    input_layer = Input(shape=(num_bands,))
    dense1 = Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_layer)
    dense2 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(dense1)
    output_layer = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(dense2)
    model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
    return model

# Example usage:
num_bands = 100 # Arbitrary number of bands for hyperspectral data
num_classes = 10
model = create_fully_connected_model(num_bands, num_classes)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```
Here we directly feed the flattened hyperspectral vector into a series of fully connected layers. This structure ignores spatial convolution, and aims to derive meaningful spectral feature representation directly. This is a good base model for experimentation.

In summary, effectively using hyperspectral 1x1 pixel data with CNNs trained on standard image datasets requires a paradigm shift from spatial feature learning to spectral feature extraction. Techniques like using 1D convolutions, transfer learning with a pre-trained model that receives a transformed representation of hyperspectral data, or fully-connected networks on raw input can be used as a starting point. These approaches leverage the network's ability to extract discriminative features from the spectral domain, without the need for spatial correlation.

For further research, exploration of hyperspectral-specific analysis methods is highly recommended. Resources focusing on remote sensing analysis and spectral data classification can provide more detailed guidance on specialized techniques for preprocessing and feature extraction. Textbooks on hyperspectral imaging can further enhance the comprehension of these topics. Publications from academic journals focusing on remote sensing image analysis are also highly relevant. A good foundation in spectral analysis is crucial, complemented by experience with neural networks.
