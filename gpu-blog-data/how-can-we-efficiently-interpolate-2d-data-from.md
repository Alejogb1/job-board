Irregularly spaced 2D data interpolation presents a significant challenge compared to its regularly gridded counterpart.  The lack of a consistent spatial structure necessitates the use of methods that explicitly handle the variable distances between data points.  My experience working on subsurface geological modeling projects, specifically reservoir characterization, has heavily involved tackling this precise problem.  The optimal approach depends heavily on the nature of the data and the desired level of accuracy and computational cost.

**1.  Clear Explanation of Methods:**

Several techniques exist for interpolating 2D data from irregularly spaced points.  The most common approaches fall under two broad categories: global and local methods.

* **Global Methods:** These methods consider all data points simultaneously to construct an interpolating function that covers the entire domain.  Examples include radial basis functions (RBFs) and kriging.  Global methods generally provide smoother surfaces but can be computationally expensive for large datasets due to the need to solve large systems of equations.  Their accuracy is also sensitive to the distribution of data points; clustering can lead to artifacts.

* **Local Methods:**  These methods only consider a subset of neighboring data points for interpolation at each location.  Common examples include inverse distance weighting (IDW) and natural neighbor interpolation.  Local methods are generally faster than global methods, particularly for large datasets, and less sensitive to data point clustering.  However, they might produce less smooth surfaces and exhibit greater variability depending on the local data density.

The choice between global and local methods involves a trade-off between computational cost, accuracy, and smoothness of the interpolated surface.  In my experience, IDW provides a good balance for many geological applications where computational speed is crucial and a perfectly smooth surface is less critical than capturing the overall trends.  For applications requiring high accuracy and smoothness, RBFs often prove superior, despite their increased computational demands. Kriging, though statistically rigorous, necessitates assumptions about the underlying spatial autocorrelation which may not always be justified.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples utilize Python with the `scipy.interpolate` library, demonstrating IDW, RBF, and a custom implementation of a simplified linear interpolation method based on barycentric coordinates within a triangle.

**Example 1: Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import griddata

# Sample data
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2])
z = np.array([10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 11, 13, 16, 19, 22])

# Create grid for interpolation
xi = np.linspace(1, 5, 100)
yi = np.linspace(1, 2, 50)
Xi, Yi = np.meshgrid(xi, yi)

# Interpolate using IDW
Zi = griddata((x, y), z, (Xi, Yi), method='linear') #method='nearest' also available

#Further processing and visualization can be performed here (e.g., using Matplotlib)
```

This code uses `griddata` from `scipy.interpolate` for efficient IDW.  The `method='linear'` specifies the interpolation scheme.  The choice of `'nearest'` would result in a piecewise constant interpolation.  Note that the underlying implementation of IDW within `scipy` might differ slightly from a purely distance-based weighting.


**Example 2: Radial Basis Functions (RBFs)**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import Rbf

# Sample data (same as above)
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2])
z = np.array([10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 11, 13, 16, 19, 22])

# Create RBF interpolator
rbfi = Rbf(x, y, z, function='linear') #function can be 'gaussian', 'cubic', etc.

# Create grid for interpolation (same as above)
xi = np.linspace(1, 5, 100)
yi = np.linspace(1, 2, 50)
Xi, Yi = np.meshgrid(xi, yi)

# Interpolate using RBF
Zi = rbfi(Xi, Yi)

#Further processing and visualization can be performed here
```

This example showcases the use of `Rbf` for RBF interpolation.  The `function` parameter allows selecting different radial basis functions; 'linear', 'cubic', and 'gaussian' are common choices, each offering a different balance between smoothness and sensitivity to noise.


**Example 3: Simplified Linear Interpolation (Barycentric Coordinates)**

```python
import numpy as np

def barycentric_interpolate(x, y, z, xi, yi):
    #Implementation for a simplified case - assumes triangulation
    #Requires pre-existing triangulation - omitted here for brevity

    # This would involve finding the triangle containing (xi,yi) and applying
    # barycentric coordinates to compute the interpolated value based on vertices.

    #Illustrative Placeholder:
    #Zi = ... (calculation using barycentric coordinates)
    #return Zi

#Sample Data (same as before)
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2])
z = np.array([10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 11, 13, 16, 19, 22])

#Simplified grid for example purposes
xi = np.array([1.5, 2.5])
yi = np.array([1.5, 1.5])


#Simplified illustrative placeholder - actual implementation is significantly more complex
Zi = np.mean(z)
return Zi
```

This example outlines a simplified linear interpolation using barycentric coordinates within triangles.  A complete implementation would necessitate a triangulation algorithm (e.g., Delaunay triangulation) to find the triangle containing each interpolation point.  The barycentric coordinates would then be used to compute a weighted average of the triangle's vertices. The placeholder in the example illustrates the fundamental concept, while a real-world implementation would be substantially longer and more complex.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of the theoretical background of these methods, I strongly recommend consulting a numerical analysis textbook covering interpolation and approximation techniques.  Furthermore, a comprehensive text on geostatistics would provide valuable insights into the specifics of kriging and its applications.  Finally, a book on spatial data analysis would offer a broader perspective, encompassing various aspects relevant to handling irregularly spaced data.  Studying these resources will allow for a more nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each method and their applicability in different contexts.
