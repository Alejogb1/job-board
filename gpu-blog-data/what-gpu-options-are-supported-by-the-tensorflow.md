The TensorFlow Object Detection API's GPU support hinges not on a specific list of supported cards, but rather on the underlying CUDA and cuDNN compatibility.  My experience developing and deploying object detection models over the past five years has consistently shown that the crucial factor is the availability of a compatible CUDA toolkit version and a corresponding cuDNN library.  The API itself acts as an interface, leveraging these lower-level libraries for GPU acceleration.  Therefore, any GPU with a compatible CUDA driver and a suitable cuDNN version will theoretically work, though performance will vary significantly depending on the card's architecture and memory capacity.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Object Detection API, built upon TensorFlow, utilizes the CUDA parallel computing platform and the cuDNN deep neural network library for GPU acceleration. These are proprietary NVIDIA technologies.  Consequently,  only NVIDIA GPUs are directly supported.  While TensorFlow can run on CPUs, using a GPU dramatically accelerates training and inference, especially for large datasets and complex models.  The specific CUDA and cuDNN versions required depend on the TensorFlow version you are using.  It's crucial to check the TensorFlow documentation for your specific version to ensure compatibility.  Mismatches between TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN versions are a common source of errors, often manifesting as runtime crashes or exceptionally slow performance.

Furthermore,  performance isn't solely determined by GPU compatibility.  Memory bandwidth plays a critical role.  Models with large feature maps and extensive parameter counts demand substantial GPU memory (VRAM).  Insufficient VRAM leads to out-of-memory errors during training or inference, rendering a powerful GPU effectively unusable.  The selection process thus involves careful consideration of both compute capability and memory capacity in relation to the intended model size and dataset.

Finally, I've found that simply installing the necessary drivers isn't sufficient.  Proper configuration of the TensorFlow environment is paramount.  This involves setting environment variables to point to the correct CUDA and cuDNN installation directories, ensuring they are accessible to the Python interpreter used by TensorFlow.  Improper configuration, while often causing subtle performance degradation, can also lead to cryptic error messages that are difficult to diagnose.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Checking CUDA and cuDNN Availability:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# Check CUDA version (requires CUDA installed and accessible)
try:
    cuda_version = !nvcc --version
    print("CUDA Version:\n", cuda_version[0])
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("CUDA not found.  Ensure CUDA is installed and added to PATH.")

# Check cuDNN version (requires cuDNN installed and accessible)
# This requires a more nuanced approach, often involving inspecting cuDNN library files or querying through a CUDA API
# This example omits the cuDNN version check for brevity, as a robust solution requires accessing system files directly which is OS-specific and outside the scope.
```

This code snippet first verifies the availability of GPUs using TensorFlow.  Then, it attempts to retrieve the CUDA version using the `nvcc` compiler. The `try-except` block handles the scenario where CUDA is not installed or not properly configured, preventing a runtime crash.  A complete solution would include a similar approach for validating cuDNN, though the approach is markedly more complex and necessitates system-specific code.


**Example 2:  Configuring TensorFlow for GPU Usage:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check for GPU availability again
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
        logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
        print(e)
else:
    print("No GPUs found.")

# Proceed with your object detection model building and training here.
# Example (Illustrative - Replace with your actual model loading):
# model = tf.saved_model.load("path/to/your/model")
```

This example demonstrates a crucial aspect of TensorFlow GPU configuration: memory growth. By setting `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)`, we instruct TensorFlow to dynamically allocate GPU memory as needed, rather than reserving all available VRAM upfront.  This is particularly beneficial when dealing with models that might not require the full capacity of the GPU throughout the training process.  Without this configuration,  you might face out-of-memory errors even if you technically have enough VRAM.

**Example 3:  Inference on GPU (Illustrative):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming model is already loaded (see Example 2)

# Convert image to tensor
image = tf.io.read_file("path/to/your/image.jpg")
image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image)
image = tf.expand_dims(image, 0)  # Batch size 1

# Perform inference
detections = model(image)

# Process detections
# ... (Your code to process the output of the model)
```

This snippet highlights the inference stage.  Assuming the model (`model`) is loaded and properly configured for GPU usage (as in the previous examples), the inference operation (`model(image)`) will automatically leverage the GPU if available and configured correctly.  No explicit GPU specification is needed here because TensorFlow manages the device placement.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is the primary resource.  Consult the documentation for your specific TensorFlow version to determine the necessary CUDA and cuDNN versions. NVIDIA's CUDA and cuDNN documentation also provides valuable installation and configuration information.  Finally, the TensorFlow Object Detection API tutorials provide practical guidance on building and deploying models.  Understanding linear algebra and optimization algorithms is beneficial for deeper comprehension of GPU acceleration in deep learning.  Familiarity with profiling tools can aid in performance optimization.
