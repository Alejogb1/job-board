Reshaping tensors in a predetermined order necessitates a deep understanding of the underlying data layout and the implications of different reshaping strategies.  My experience optimizing deep learning models frequently involved manipulating tensor shapes to accommodate specific layers or memory constraints.  Directly manipulating indices is often inefficient; leveraging library functions that understand tensor semantics is crucial.  The key is recognizing that reshaping isn't simply about changing the dimensions; it's about rearranging the elements according to a defined order.  Failure to consider this can lead to incorrect results and unexpected behavior.

The challenge lies in precisely specifying the desired element ordering.  Simply stating the new dimensions is insufficient; one must define how elements from the original tensor map to the new shape.  This mapping is implicit in most reshaping functions, based on the underlying memory layout (typically row-major or column-major).  However, achieving arbitrary orderings requires explicit control over the element traversal.


**1. Understanding the Implicit Ordering:**

Most deep learning libraries, including TensorFlow and PyTorch, use contiguous memory allocation for tensors.  This means that elements are stored linearly in memory.  The order in which these elements are accessed is dictated by the data layout (row-major, the default in many libraries, or column-major).  When reshaping without explicit control, the library implicitly reinterprets the contiguous memory block according to the new dimensions, following the memory layout convention. This is efficient but limits the ordering possibilities.

**2. Explicit Ordering through Indexing:**

To achieve specific element orderings, we must bypass the implicit reshaping mechanisms and utilize direct indexing. This is often less efficient than library-provided functions but provides complete control.  This involves creating a new tensor and populating it with elements from the original tensor, selected in the desired order.

**Code Example 1:  Arbitrary Reshaping through Indexing (Python with NumPy)**

```python
import numpy as np

# Original tensor
original_tensor = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                           [5, 6, 7, 8],
                           [9, 10, 11, 12]])

# Desired shape (2, 6) and element order (row-major, but rearranged slices)
new_shape = (2, 6)
new_tensor = np.zeros(new_shape, dtype=original_tensor.dtype)

# Explicit element mapping
mapping = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)]

index = 0
for row, col in mapping:
    new_tensor[row, col] = original_tensor[index // 4, index % 4]
    index += 1

print(original_tensor)
print(new_tensor)

```

This example demonstrates explicit control over element placement. The `mapping` list defines the correspondence between the original and new tensor indices.  Each tuple represents the (row, column) index in the `new_tensor`, while the loop iterates through the `original_tensor` using integer division and modulo to extract the correct elements based on the pre-defined order.  While effective, this is less efficient than using library-optimized functions for simpler reshaping tasks.

**Code Example 2:  Reshaping with Advanced Indexing (Python with NumPy)**

```python
import numpy as np

original_tensor = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                           [5, 6, 7, 8],
                           [9, 10, 11, 12]])

#Define new shape and index permutation for a more concise approach
new_shape = (2, 6)
index_permutation = np.array([0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11])

new_tensor = original_tensor.flatten()[index_permutation].reshape(new_shape)

print(original_tensor)
print(new_tensor)

```

Here we've simplified the process using advanced indexing.  `flatten()` converts to a 1D array, then `index_permutation` directly selects the elements in the desired order before `reshape()` applies the new shape.  This approach is more concise and potentially more efficient than the previous one for certain orderings.


**Code Example 3:  Leveraging Library Functions for Common Cases (Python with TensorFlow)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

original_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                              [5, 6, 7, 8],
                              [9, 10, 11, 12]])

# Reshaping to (2, 6) using TensorFlow's reshape function - implicit row-major order
new_tensor = tf.reshape(original_tensor, (2, 6))

print(original_tensor)
print(new_tensor)


#Transpose before reshaping to illustrate how this impacts ordering
transposed_tensor = tf.transpose(original_tensor)
reshaped_transposed = tf.reshape(transposed_tensor,(2,6))

print(transposed_tensor)
print(reshaped_transposed)

```


This illustrates how TensorFlow's `tf.reshape` operates under the implicit row-major ordering. The second part shows that changing the order of elements can dramatically change the result of reshaping, demonstrating the importance of understanding implicit ordering.  Note that for this example, more complex orderings would necessitate indexing, as demonstrated previously.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official documentation for your chosen deep learning library (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) for detailed information on tensor operations and memory layouts.  Review introductory texts on linear algebra, specifically focusing on matrix and vector operations, to fully comprehend the implications of manipulating tensor dimensions.  Finally, investigate advanced indexing techniques provided by your chosen library to unlock greater flexibility in reshaping operations.  Understanding these concepts is key to efficiently manipulating tensor data.
