TensorFlow’s automatic differentiation system, while remarkably powerful for neural network training, presents challenges when applied directly to eigenvalue and eigenvector computations. Specifically, the gradients of these quantities with respect to the input matrix are frequently inaccurate, stemming primarily from the inherent non-smoothness and non-uniqueness issues associated with spectral decompositions. This isn’t a deficiency in the backpropagation mechanism itself, but rather a reflection of the underlying mathematical properties of the eigenvalue problem.

The core issue lies in the fact that eigenvalues and eigenvectors are not generally differentiable functions of the input matrix. Imagine a matrix undergoing a minute change; the corresponding eigenvalues might shift in a predictable manner, but in specific scenarios – particularly when eigenvalues are repeated, close, or the matrix is defective – the eigenvectors can abruptly "jump" or exchange their order, resulting in discontinuities and, consequently, inaccurate gradient calculations. These abrupt changes are not well-approximated by the linear assumptions that underly backpropagation.

Consider a real, symmetric matrix *A*. Its eigenvalues, denoted by λ<sub>i</sub>, and corresponding eigenvectors, v<sub>i</sub>, satisfy the equation *Av<sub>i</sub>* = λ<sub>i</sub>*v<sub>i</sub>*. The goal of gradient calculation here would be to find ∂λ<sub>i</sub>/∂A and ∂v<sub>i</sub>/∂A. When the eigenvalues are distinct, perturbation theory provides a solid foundation for understanding how these quantities change with infinitesimal changes in *A*. The eigenvalue derivative, for instance, can be expressed neatly as v<sub>i</sub><sup>T</sup>∂A/∂A v<sub>i</sub>, which becomes a simple projection of the change in A onto the eigenvector. However, when eigenvalues are repeated, this straightforward derivative approach breaks down. The eigenvectors become ill-defined, and thus, the gradients computed through finite differences in TensorFlow or its automatic differentiation engine become significantly inaccurate due to the discontinuity at the point of degeneracy.

Furthermore, eigenvectors are not uniquely defined. If *v<sub>i</sub>* is an eigenvector corresponding to λ<sub>i</sub>, then so is -*v<sub>i</sub>*, and generally, any vector *cv<sub>i</sub>*, where *c* is a scalar. The output of an eigenvector computation like `tf.linalg.eigh` is typically normalized but not unique in sign, or a combination of eigenvectors in degenerate cases. This arbitrary choice can introduce spurious "noise" into the gradient computations. While the numerical computation may return a sensible eigenvector, that selection can create gradients that are inaccurate with respect to the matrix changes.

The problem exacerbates in the case of non-symmetric matrices, where eigenvalues can become complex numbers and eigenvectors are generally not orthogonal. Additionally, numerical methods for eigenvalue decomposition, while computationally effective, often include approximations and iterative algorithms, which further hinder the stability and accuracy of gradient calculations. Finally, TensorFlow operates with floating-point numbers that have inherent limitations in precision. These factors accumulate during automatic differentiation, leading to incorrect gradients.

Let's consider several code examples that highlight the issues.

**Example 1: Eigenvalues of a Simple Symmetric Matrix**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def eig_val_grad(matrix):
    matrix_tf = tf.constant(matrix, dtype=tf.float32)
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(matrix_tf)
        eigenvalues = tf.linalg.eigvalsh(matrix_tf)
    gradients = tape.gradient(eigenvalues, matrix_tf)
    return gradients.numpy()

matrix_a = [[1.0, 0.0],
           [0.0, 2.0]]
gradients_a = eig_val_grad(matrix_a)
print("Gradients for A (distinct eigenvalues):\n", gradients_a)


matrix_b = [[1.0, 0.0],
           [0.0, 1.0]]
gradients_b = eig_val_grad(matrix_b)
print("Gradients for B (repeated eigenvalues):\n", gradients_b)
```

This code calculates the gradients of the eigenvalues of two 2x2 symmetric matrices. `matrix_a` has distinct eigenvalues (1 and 2), and the gradients computed by TensorFlow are relatively accurate. In `matrix_b` which has repeated eigenvalues (1 and 1), you will notice the gradients are less accurate, often exhibiting noisy artifacts or unexpected magnitudes due to the non-differentiability of eigenvectors at degeneracy. The lack of a clear, unique, stable gradient for the case of repeated eigenvalues is quite evident from the output. The automatic gradient calculation doesn't capture the true sensitivity in these situations.

**Example 2: Eigenvectors and Sensitivity**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def eig_vec_grad(matrix):
    matrix_tf = tf.constant(matrix, dtype=tf.float32)
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(matrix_tf)
        eigenvalues, eigenvectors = tf.linalg.eigh(matrix_tf)
    gradients = tape.gradient(eigenvectors, matrix_tf)
    return gradients.numpy()

matrix_c = [[2.0, 0.1],
           [0.1, 2.0]]
gradients_c = eig_vec_grad(matrix_c)
print("Gradients for C (non-zero off-diag):\n", gradients_c)

matrix_d = [[2.0, 0.0],
           [0.0, 2.0]]
gradients_d = eig_vec_grad(matrix_d)
print("Gradients for D (repeated eig value):\n", gradients_d)
```

Here we examine the eigenvectors. `matrix_c` has small off-diagonal elements that cause a slight difference between the eigenvalues; you might observe that the gradients are more sensitive to changes in specific elements, aligning with perturbation theory. However, for matrix_d, which has repeated eigenvalues (2 and 2), the gradients become even less reliable due to the eigenvector ambiguity. The gradients are likely not only inaccurate, but can also be poorly interpretable. The eigenvector returned by `tf.linalg.eigh` for matrix_d can vary depending on the underlying numerical solver. Small changes in input could lead to large fluctuations in the eigenvectors, yielding unstable gradients.

**Example 3: Non-Symmetric Matrices**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def eig_grad_nonsym(matrix):
    matrix_tf = tf.constant(matrix, dtype=tf.float32)
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(matrix_tf)
        eigenvalues, eigenvectors = tf.linalg.eig(matrix_tf)
    gradients_val = tape.gradient(eigenvalues, matrix_tf)
    gradients_vec = tape.gradient(eigenvectors, matrix_tf)
    return gradients_val.numpy(), gradients_vec.numpy()

matrix_e = [[2.0, 1.0],
           [0.0, 2.0]]
gradients_eval_e, gradients_evec_e  = eig_grad_nonsym(matrix_e)

print("Eigenvalue gradients of E: \n", gradients_eval_e)
print("Eigenvector gradients of E: \n", gradients_evec_e)

```

This example uses `tf.linalg.eig`, which computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for non-symmetric matrices.  You will observe that the eigenvector gradients are particularly inaccurate for `matrix_e`, which has a non-symmetric structure, compared to the symmetric cases. These gradients, in general, will be even less reliable due to the lack of orthogonality in the eigenvectors and the complex nature of the eigenvalues for non-symmetric matrices.

To summarize, TensorFlow’s direct gradient calculation of eigenvalue and eigenvectors via automatic differentiation is generally unreliable and inaccurate due to the following key reasons:

*   **Non-Smoothness:** Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are not smooth functions of the input matrix, particularly when eigenvalues are repeated.
*   **Non-Uniqueness:** Eigenvectors are not uniquely defined, and the algorithms are optimized for numerical computation not for accurate gradient propagation.
*   **Numerical Approximations:** The underlying numerical methods introduce approximations and iterative processes that interfere with accurate differentiation.
*   **Floating-Point Arithmetic:** Precision limitations can accumulate during differentiation, exacerbating the inaccuracies.

Given these considerations, it is generally advisable to avoid directly differentiating through eigenvalue/eigenvector computations in most TensorFlow workflows. In specific cases where gradients are essential for spectral operations, alternative strategies such as utilizing perturbation theory approximations or designing custom differentiable proxy operations may be more effective.

For more in-depth understanding of the theoretical underpinnings, consider studying texts on numerical linear algebra, particularly those focusing on eigenvalue perturbation theory. Publications on matrix analysis are also helpful for understanding the differentiability of matrix functions. For practical aspects, reviewing documentation of numerical libraries like LAPACK and related projects can offer insight into the computational details of these operations. Furthermore, literature focusing on automatic differentiation may provide a higher-level perspective on the strengths and limitations of numerical methods used to compute derivatives.
