The most frequent cause of a QPlainTextEdit not displaying output in PyQt5 stems from a misunderstanding of how the text insertion and display mechanisms interact with the Qt event loop.  Specifically,  text insertion isn't immediately reflected visually; it requires a Qt event to be processed. This often manifests when attempting to update the text outside the main thread or failing to properly integrate the text insertion with the application's event loop.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on large-scale data visualization projects within PyQt5.


**1. Understanding the Qt Event Loop and Text Updates**

Qt applications operate on an event-driven architecture.  The event loop continuously monitors for events (like user input, timer signals, or network activity) and dispatches them to the appropriate handlers.  UI updates, including text changes in QPlainTextEdit, are handled within this loop.  Attempting to modify the QPlainTextEdit from outside this loop – particularly from a separate thread – will often result in no visible changes.  The application's main thread is responsible for updating the GUI.


**2. Code Examples and Explanations**

The following examples illustrate common scenarios leading to this issue and demonstrate correct practices.


**Example 1: Incorrect Threading**

This example demonstrates incorrect usage of threading, resulting in no output in the QPlainTextEdit.

```python
import sys
import threading
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QPlainTextEdit

class MyWidget(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.textEdit = QPlainTextEdit()
        layout = QVBoxLayout()
        layout.addWidget(self.textEdit)
        self.setLayout(layout)

        def long_running_task():
            # Simulates a time-consuming operation
            for i in range(10):
                result = f"Result {i+1}\n"
                self.textEdit.appendPlainText(result) # Incorrect: Modifies UI from a different thread

        thread = threading.Thread(target=long_running_task)
        thread.start()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = MyWidget()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

```

This code attempts to update the QPlainTextEdit from within a separate thread (`long_running_task`).  This is incorrect because the GUI must be updated only by the main thread.  The output won’t appear.


**Example 2: Correct Threading with `queue.Queue` and `QTimer`**

This example demonstrates the correct approach, using a `queue.Queue` to communicate between threads and a `QTimer` to handle updates within the main thread.

```python
import sys
import threading
import queue
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QPlainTextEdit
from PyQt5.QtCore import QTimer

class MyWidget(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.textEdit = QPlainTextEdit()
        layout = QVBoxLayout()
        layout.addWidget(self.textEdit)
        self.setLayout(layout)
        self.queue = queue.Queue()
        self.timer = QTimer()
        self.timer.timeout.connect(self.process_queue)
        self.timer.start(100) # Check queue every 100ms

        def long_running_task():
            for i in range(10):
                result = f"Result {i+1}\n"
                self.queue.put(result) # Put result into queue

        thread = threading.Thread(target=long_running_task)
        thread.start()

    def process_queue(self):
        while not self.queue.empty():
            item = self.queue.get()
            self.textEdit.appendPlainText(item) # Update UI in main thread

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = MyWidget()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

Here, the `long_running_task` puts results into a queue.  The `QTimer` periodically checks the queue in the main thread and updates the `QPlainTextEdit`.  This ensures thread safety and proper UI updates.


**Example 3:  Signal and Slot Mechanism for Inter-Object Communication**

This example uses signals and slots, a fundamental aspect of Qt, for inter-object communication which also prevents issues arising from direct UI manipulation outside the main thread.

```python
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QPlainTextEdit, QPushButton
from PyQt5.QtCore import QObject, pyqtSignal

class DataProcessor(QObject):
    dataReady = pyqtSignal(str)

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def process_data(self):
        for i in range(10):
            result = f"Result {i+1}\n"
            self.dataReady.emit(result)


class MyWidget(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.textEdit = QPlainTextEdit()
        self.button = QPushButton("Process Data")
        self.button.clicked.connect(self.start_processing)
        layout = QVBoxLayout()
        layout.addWidget(self.textEdit)
        layout.addWidget(self.button)
        self.setLayout(layout)
        self.processor = DataProcessor()
        self.processor.dataReady.connect(self.update_text)

    def start_processing(self):
        self.processor.process_data()

    def update_text(self, data):
        self.textEdit.appendPlainText(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = MyWidget()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

This example demonstrates a clean separation of concerns. The `DataProcessor` handles data processing and emits a signal when data is ready. The `MyWidget` connects to this signal to update the `QPlainTextEdit` safely within the main thread.  This approach promotes better code organization and maintainability.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official Qt documentation, specifically the sections on threading, signals and slots, and the QPlainTextEdit class, are invaluable.  A thorough understanding of the Qt event loop is crucial.  Furthermore, exploring PyQt5's examples and tutorials, paying close attention to the interaction between threads and the GUI, is highly beneficial.  Consult advanced PyQt5 books for detailed explanations of these concepts and their practical applications in more complex scenarios.   Remember to consistently check your code for potential thread-related issues when dealing with GUI updates.
