GPUs offer significantly higher computational throughput for highly parallel workloads compared to CPUs, yet transitioning a concurrently designed program to leverage them requires a considerable shift in perspective from shared-memory concurrency to massively parallel, data-parallel execution. It's not a simple matter of substituting a few keywords; it necessitates a redesign focused on leveraging the GPU's architecture. I've experienced this firsthand during my work on computational fluid dynamics simulations, where moving from multi-threaded C++ to CUDA C++ yielded substantial performance gains, but only after significant refactoring.

The fundamental difference lies in how computation is organized. Concurrent CPU programs typically involve relatively few threads executing independent tasks, often communicating through shared memory and synchronization mechanisms like mutexes or semaphores. GPUs, on the other hand, excel at executing the same sequence of instructions (kernel) on a vast number of data elements simultaneously. Thus, the challenge in GPU parallelization lies in identifying the data-parallel sections of the concurrent CPU program, restructuring data for optimal GPU access, and rewriting the core computations within kernels that can execute in parallel.

This process breaks down into several distinct, yet interrelated, stages. The first is **profiling and analysis**. The existing CPU concurrent program must be thoroughly profiled to pinpoint the performance bottlenecks. Which functions consume the most time? Which data structures are accessed frequently? Where is concurrency already present, and where could it be further expanded? Tools like Intel VTune or Valgrind can help here. Identification of compute-intensive, data-parallel loops is crucial. This involves understanding what data elements are processed independently of each other, which forms the basis of GPU workload distribution.

The second stage involves **data transformation and memory management**. GPUs possess separate memory spaces from the CPU, thus requiring data to be explicitly copied back and forth. Optimal performance on the GPU requires data to be organized in a way that maximizes memory bandwidth and coalesced access by threads. In practice, it may necessitate reshaping your data structures to use arrays of structures (AoS) instead of structures of arrays (SoA), or vice versa, depending on the access patterns in the kernel. This is the most challenging and time-consuming aspect of the porting process. We also need to minimize data transfer by keeping relevant data on the GPU for as long as possible.

The third and final crucial phase is **kernel implementation and tuning**. This involves rewriting the computation logic of the targeted data-parallel loops into GPU kernels. Kernels are functions that execute on the GPU and are typically written in languages like CUDA C++ or OpenCL. Threads within a kernel run in parallel on different data elements and must follow certain rules: no branching in the execution path and limited memory access conflicts.

Letâ€™s consider a concrete example where we have a concurrent C++ program that calculates the average of several arrays. On the CPU side, we might use threads to compute each average independently. This represents a good, although simplified, scenario for GPU parallelization.

**Example 1: CPU Concurrent Calculation (Simplified C++)**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>

float calculate_average(const std::vector<float>& data) {
    if (data.empty()) return 0.0f;
    return std::accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), 0.0f) / data.size();
}

void cpu_average(const std::vector<std::vector<float>>& all_data, std::vector<float>& results) {
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < all_data.size(); ++i) {
      threads.emplace_back([&, i] {
            results[i] = calculate_average(all_data[i]);
        });
    }
   for (auto& thread : threads) {
    thread.join();
   }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::vector<float>> input_data = {{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, {4.0, 5.0, 6.0}, {7.0, 8.0, 9.0}};
    std::vector<float> cpu_results(input_data.size());
    cpu_average(input_data, cpu_results);

    for (float result : cpu_results)
      std::cout << result << " ";
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code divides the computation into parallel tasks, one for each vector, employing CPU threads. Now, consider the GPU version implemented using CUDA. We would need to rewrite the `calculate_average` function into a kernel and distribute the computation to multiple threads on the GPU:

**Example 2: GPU Kernel (CUDA C++)**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void gpu_average_kernel(float* input, float* output, int size, int rows) {
  int row_id = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (row_id < rows) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
          sum += input[row_id * size + i];
        }
        output[row_id] = sum / size;
    }
}

void gpu_average(const std::vector<std::vector<float>>& all_data, std::vector<float>& results) {
    int rows = all_data.size();
    int size = all_data[0].size();

    std::vector<float> flattened_input;
    for (const auto& row : all_data) {
        flattened_input.insert(flattened_input.end(), row.begin(), row.end());
    }

    float* d_input;
    float* d_output;

    cudaMalloc(&d_input, flattened_input.size() * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc(&d_output, rows * sizeof(float));

    cudaMemcpy(d_input, flattened_input.data(), flattened_input.size() * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (rows + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    gpu_average_kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_input, d_output, size, rows);

    cudaMemcpy(results.data(), d_output, rows * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    cudaFree(d_input);
    cudaFree(d_output);
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::vector<float>> input_data = {{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, {4.0, 5.0, 6.0}, {7.0, 8.0, 9.0}};
    std::vector<float> gpu_results(input_data.size());
    gpu_average(input_data, gpu_results);

    for (float result : gpu_results)
      std::cout << result << " ";
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This CUDA example demonstrates a basic implementation. The flattened input is copied to the GPU (d_input), and each row's average is calculated by a separate thread block on the GPU. Note how threads within the kernel are responsible for reading their designated data, demonstrating the data-parallel approach.

**Example 3: Optimization (Illustrative CUDA C++)**

For this simplified example, the optimization possibilities are somewhat limited, however, in a real-world scenario we'd be looking at more complex operations. Let's imagine a calculation where the size of the inner vectors is much larger. We might then explore methods of parallel reduction:

```c++
__global__ void gpu_average_kernel_opt(float* input, float* output, int size, int rows) {
    int row_id = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row_id < rows) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
          sum += input[row_id * size + i];
        }

        __shared__ float shared_sum[256];
        int thread_id_in_block = threadIdx.x;
        shared_sum[thread_id_in_block] = sum;

        __syncthreads();

        for (int stride = blockDim.x / 2; stride > 0; stride /= 2) {
          if (thread_id_in_block < stride)
            shared_sum[thread_id_in_block] += shared_sum[thread_id_in_block + stride];
           __syncthreads();
        }

      if(thread_id_in_block == 0)
        output[row_id] = shared_sum[0] / size;
    }

}
```

In this optimized, illustrative example, we add shared memory to avoid having each thread access global memory for every element, and a basic reduction operation within the block, which reduces the number of writes to global memory. This approach will reduce the memory read bandwidth significantly. This, of course, depends on the nature of the problem, and requires careful analysis.

The above examples illustrate the transition from concurrent CPU code to a data-parallel GPU solution. The key elements include data flattening (if needed), memory transfer, kernel writing, and potentially kernel tuning.

For deeper understanding and practical application of GPU parallelization, I would highly recommend resources such as the NVIDIA CUDA Programming Guide and related documentation. For a more generalized approach to heterogeneous computing, OpenCL guides and tutorials are valuable resources as well. Additionally, explore books on parallel programming paradigms for more theoretical depth. Studying examples and case studies of GPU applications in various fields will solidify your understanding of the process. Transitioning from CPU concurrency to GPU parallelization is a challenging but rewarding process when done correctly.
