The fundamental difference between computations in Turbo Pascal and Turbo C stems from their core design philosophies: Pascal emphasizes structured, procedural programming with strong type checking, while C prioritizes flexibility and direct memory manipulation. This divergence profoundly impacts how arithmetic operations, data handling, and program flow are implemented, despite both languages compiling to machine code that ultimately executes similar logical steps. Having worked extensively with both in embedded systems and software development projects over the past decade, I’ve observed these disparities directly.

Pascal's strong typing, for instance, mandates explicit data type declarations, reducing implicit type conversions and the risk of unintended data corruption. This contrasts with C's more permissive approach, where implicit conversions between numeric types are common and sometimes even assumed, placing the onus on the developer to manage potential overflow and data loss. In practice, this means that while a Pascal program might halt with a type mismatch error, a C program might silently proceed with erroneous results that are often difficult to debug, especially in complex scenarios. This difference extends to pointer arithmetic; Pascal's pointer handling is less flexible than C's which allows for direct access to memory addresses and pointer casting. The more direct pointer access in C provides the means for high performance but also opens up pathways to memory corruption issues.

Let us first examine a simple arithmetic calculation. Consider adding two integer variables.

```pascal
program IntegerAddition;
var
  num1, num2, sum: integer;
begin
  num1 := 10;
  num2 := 20;
  sum := num1 + num2;
  writeln('The sum is: ', sum);
end.
```

In this Pascal example, `num1`, `num2`, and `sum` are explicitly declared as integers. The addition operation `num1 + num2` is performed using the `+` operator, which is contextually understood for integer arithmetic based on the types of the operands. Attempting to perform an operation with mixed data types, such as adding an integer to a real number without explicit type conversion, would result in a compile-time error. This explicit nature encourages a more secure and predictable computation environment.

The corresponding operation in C presents a different perspective:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int num1 = 10;
  int num2 = 20;
  int sum = num1 + num2;
  printf("The sum is: %d\n", sum);
  return 0;
}
```

Here, the C code defines `num1`, `num2`, and `sum` as integers using the `int` keyword. The addition is similar to Pascal, but C might permit mixing data types without explicit conversions. For example, If `num1` were declared as a floating-point type, C would likely implicitly convert the integer to a floating-point representation before the addition takes place, possibly leading to a less accurate result than intended.  Furthermore, C allows operations like `sum++` or `sum += 1` which are direct manipulations of the variable in place and are not naturally expressed in Pascal without explicit assignment.

Secondly, consider the handling of arrays, specifically how they are indexed and accessed. In Pascal, arrays are typically indexed from one, although zero-based indexing is also supported, and bound checking is generally performed by the compiler. This check ensures that array accesses remain within the defined bounds, preventing memory violations. Here's a demonstration:

```pascal
program ArrayAccess;
var
  numbers: array[1..5] of integer;
  i: integer;
begin
  for i := 1 to 5 do
    numbers[i] := i * 10;
  writeln('The third element is: ', numbers[3]);
end.
```

This Pascal example declares an array `numbers` of five integers, indexed from 1 to 5. The loop populates the array with multiples of ten, and finally, the third element is displayed. Pascal will likely throw a runtime error if code attempts to access `numbers[0]` or `numbers[6]` as these locations are outside the array bounds.

In C, arrays are fundamentally different. Array indexing always begins at zero, and C typically does not perform any bounds checking. This implies direct access to memory using pointer arithmetic.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int numbers[5];
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    numbers[i] = (i + 1) * 10;
  }
  printf("The third element is: %d\n", numbers[2]);
  return 0;
}
```
This C code creates an array named `numbers` with five elements. Note the `for` loop iterates from 0 to 4 to cover all elements in the array. The third element is accessed by `numbers[2]` which is the 3rd element of the array.  If code attempted to access `numbers[10]`, C would allow the memory access without complaint, potentially overwriting adjacent memory, leading to program instability. C’s approach places the full burden of boundary checking and memory management on the developer.

Lastly, let's evaluate string manipulation. Pascal strings are often handled as a special type with implicit length information which allows for string manipulation using built in functions. String manipulations are generally more controlled, using built-in functions like `copy`, `concat`, and `insert`. This offers safer ways to work with string data.

```pascal
program StringManipulation;
var
  str1, str2: string;
begin
  str1 := 'Hello';
  str2 := ' World';
  str1 := str1 + str2; // String concatenation
  writeln('Combined string: ', str1);
end.
```

Here, two strings are defined, then concatenated via the `+` operator which operates on the string data type directly and not memory locations. Pascal generally manages string memory automatically.

C strings are handled differently, with strings represented as arrays of characters terminated by a null character (`\0`). String manipulations are performed with library functions like `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `strlen`, which require explicit memory allocation and careful handling of potential buffer overflows.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char str1[20] = "Hello";
    char str2[] = " World";
    strcat(str1, str2);
    printf("Combined string: %s\n", str1);
    return 0;
}
```

This C code declares two character arrays `str1` and `str2`, initializing the first with "Hello" and the second with " World". The `strcat` function concatenates the second string to the end of the first, potentially causing a buffer overflow if the combined string exceeds the declared size of `str1`. C's string handling is powerful but often leads to errors if developers don’t exercise diligence with memory management.

In summary, while both Pascal and C can accomplish the same logical computations, they differ vastly in approach. Pascal, with its focus on safety and structure, requires more explicit coding practices and offers a less flexible environment. C, on the other hand, prioritizes efficiency and direct memory access, enabling more versatile control but demanding meticulous resource management to avoid programming errors.  These differences are not simply syntactical, they dictate how computations are handled at a fundamental level, impacting program stability, debuggability, and overall performance characteristics.

For further study in Pascal, consult texts by Dale and Weems which often include detailed discussion of language design. For C, consider Kernighan and Ritchie’s foundational work. Other resources include texts on programming language design concepts which are essential to comprehending the historical differences between programming languages like Turbo Pascal and Turbo C. Exploring the historical context of each language can also be helpful; resources discussing the evolution of procedural programming (for Pascal) and the history of Unix (for C) can be insightful.
