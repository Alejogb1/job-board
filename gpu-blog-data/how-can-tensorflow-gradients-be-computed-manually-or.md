The core challenge in manually computing or deferring TensorFlow gradient calculations stems from the inherently automatic differentiation (AD) nature of the framework. TensorFlow's `GradientTape` automates the process, building a computational graph and subsequently applying backpropagation.  Circumventing this requires understanding the underlying operations and leveraging lower-level APIs.  Over the years, I've found that mastering this aspect is crucial for optimizing performance, debugging complex models, and implementing custom training loops.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's automatic differentiation is primarily achieved through the `tf.GradientTape` context manager. Within this context, operations are recorded, forming a computational graph.  The `gradient()` method then traverses this graph backward, applying the chain rule to compute gradients.  However, for specific scenarios—like memory optimization in very large models, implementing custom gradient functions, or debugging gradient flow—manual or deferred computation becomes necessary.

Manual computation involves explicitly applying the chain rule to the relevant operations. This is feasible for relatively simple functions but becomes extremely tedious and error-prone for complex models.  The process requires a deep understanding of calculus and the specific TensorFlow operations involved. Each operation needs its derivative to be applied according to the chain rule.

Deferred computation involves recording the operations without immediately computing the gradients.  This is accomplished by using `tf.GradientTape` with `persistent=True`.  The gradients can then be computed later by calling the `gradient()` method multiple times, enabling the reuse of the computational graph.  This is particularly useful when multiple gradients are needed for different variables or when the computation of gradients is computationally expensive.  The persistent tape should be explicitly deleted using `del` after usage to release resources.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Manual Gradient Calculation for a Simple Function**

This example demonstrates manual gradient calculation for a simple quadratic function. It is important to note that this approach is highly impractical for complex models.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def quadratic(x):
  return x**2

x = tf.constant(3.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = quadratic(x)

# Manual Gradient Calculation
dy_dx = 2 * x # Derivative of x**2 with respect to x

# TensorFlow's automatic gradient calculation for verification.
dy_dx_tf = tape.gradient(y, x)

print(f"Manual gradient: {dy_dx.numpy()}")
print(f"TensorFlow gradient: {dy_dx_tf.numpy()}")
```

This code first defines a quadratic function. Then, using `tf.GradientTape`, it calculates the value of the function at x=3.  The manual gradient calculation directly applies the derivative of the quadratic function.  Finally, the result is compared against TensorFlow's automatic gradient calculation for validation.


**Example 2: Deferred Gradient Calculation using a Persistent Tape**

This example shows how to defer gradient computation using a persistent tape. This is advantageous when multiple gradients need to be computed later.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
y = tf.Variable(3.0)

with tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as tape:
  z = x**2 + y**3

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
dz_dy = tape.gradient(z, y)

print(f"Gradient of z with respect to x: {dz_dx.numpy()}")
print(f"Gradient of z with respect to y: {dz_dy.numpy()}")

del tape # Explicitly delete the tape to release resources

```

Here, a persistent tape is created.  The gradients with respect to both `x` and `y` are computed separately, demonstrating the reuse of the computational graph.  Crucially, the `del tape` statement is included for proper resource management; forgetting this can lead to memory leaks in larger applications.


**Example 3: Custom Gradient Function**

This example showcases the creation of a custom gradient function.  This is often necessary when dealing with operations not directly supported by TensorFlow's automatic differentiation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.custom_gradient
def my_custom_op(x):
  y = tf.math.sin(x)

  def grad(dy):
    return dy * tf.math.cos(x)

  return y, grad

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  z = my_custom_op(x)

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)

print(f"Gradient of my_custom_op with respect to x: {dz_dx.numpy()}")

```

This example introduces a custom operation `my_custom_op` which calculates the sine of an input.  The `grad` function within the decorator specifies how to compute the gradient, ensuring correct backpropagation. This approach is essential when dealing with complex or non-standard mathematical operations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of automatic differentiation, consult established texts on numerical methods and machine learning.  Thoroughly review TensorFlow's official documentation, focusing on the `tf.GradientTape` API and its options. Explore resources dedicated to advanced TensorFlow techniques, such as custom training loops and performance optimization.  Furthermore, delve into the mathematical foundations of backpropagation and the chain rule.  Studying examples of custom gradient implementations will significantly aid comprehension.  Finally, consider working through tutorials focused on building custom layers and operations within TensorFlow.  These resources, together with practical experience, will provide a solid understanding of manual and deferred gradient computation within the framework.
