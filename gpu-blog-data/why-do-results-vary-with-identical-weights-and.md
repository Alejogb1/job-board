Identical weights and network architecture do not guarantee identical results in neural network training due to the inherent non-determinism introduced by several factors within the training process.  My experience debugging this issue across numerous large-scale NLP projects has highlighted three primary culprits:  random weight initialization, differing hardware behavior, and variations in data shuffling.

**1.  Random Weight Initialization:**  While the *architecture* might be identical – the same number of layers, neurons per layer, activation functions, etc. – the *initial weights* assigned to each connection are almost always randomly generated.  The initialization strategy (e.g., Xavier, He, Glorot uniform) defines the *distribution* from which these weights are drawn, not the precise values themselves.  Even with the same seed for the random number generator, subtle differences in the underlying pseudorandom number generation algorithm implementation across different hardware or software environments can lead to discrepancies in the generated weights, albeit usually minor. This minute variation in the starting point profoundly impacts the gradient descent trajectory, resulting in divergent final weight configurations despite starting from architecturally identical networks.

**2.  Hardware-Specific Behaviors:**  Floating-point arithmetic, the bedrock of neural network computations, is inherently imprecise.  Different hardware platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs) utilize distinct floating-point units with varying levels of precision and rounding behavior.  These subtle differences accumulate throughout the training process, especially during backpropagation where numerous floating-point operations are performed.  Furthermore, even on identical hardware, processes operating concurrently might experience minor variations in timing, impacting the order in which operations are executed and potentially influencing the final results. This is less of a concern with fully deterministic hardware, but the majority of systems used for deep learning exhibit some form of non-determinism.

**3.  Data Shuffling and Mini-batching:** Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants rely on randomly shuffling the training data before each epoch.  This randomization, meant to reduce bias and improve generalization, introduces variability into the order in which gradients are computed and updated.  Even with the same seed for the random shuffling, differences in implementation (e.g., using different shuffling algorithms or libraries) can lead to variations in the order of data presented during training.  Moreover, mini-batching—processing data in smaller chunks—further exacerbates this effect.  Different random mini-batch selections during each epoch will lead to distinct gradient updates, resulting in disparate final weights.

Let's illustrate these points with code examples using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.  These examples are simplified for clarity but capture the essence of the issues discussed.

**Code Example 1:  Impact of Random Weight Initialization:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def train_model(seed):
    tf.random.set_seed(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)

    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,), activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)
    return model.get_weights()

weights1 = train_model(42)
weights2 = train_model(42)  #Same seed, should be similar but not identical

print(np.allclose(weights1, weights2)) # Often returns False due to subtle differences.
```

This code demonstrates how even with the same seed, slight variations can occur, mainly due to the underlying random number generation library's implementation differences.  Note that the `allclose` function uses a tolerance, meaning very small differences might be ignored.


**Code Example 2:  Impact of Data Shuffling:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def train_model_shuffle(shuffle_seed):
  tf.random.set_seed(42)  # Keep weight init consistent
  np.random.seed(42)

  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,), activation='relu'),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
  ])
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
  x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
  y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)
  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, shuffle=True, seed=shuffle_seed, verbose=0)
  return model.get_weights()

weights3 = train_model_shuffle(10)
weights4 = train_model_shuffle(20) # Different Shuffle Seed

print(np.allclose(weights3, weights4)) # Likely returns False due to differing shuffle orders.
```

Here, we fix the weight initialization but vary the data shuffling seed, showing how differing order impacts the final weights.


**Code Example 3:  Illustrating Mini-batch Effects (Conceptual):**

This example is conceptual because demonstrating the exact impact of mini-batching on weight differences requires a more complex setup with explicit mini-batch control and careful monitoring of weight updates within each mini-batch iteration, which goes beyond the scope of a concise example. The fundamental concept is that with different random mini-batches, the gradient updates will vary in each iteration, leading to different final weights.  Consider the following (simplified) pseudo-code:

```python
#Pseudo-code illustrating mini-batch effect

for epoch in range(epochs):
  # Randomly shuffle data (using a seed for repeatability for comparison)
  shuffled_data = shuffle(data)
  for i in range(0, len(shuffled_data), batch_size):
    mini_batch = shuffled_data[i:i+batch_size]
    #compute gradients on mini_batch and update weights
    update_weights(model, mini_batch)

#Different random mini-batches across runs will change weight updates.
```

The key here is the repeated application of `update_weights` with varying mini-batches.  Each call will result in slightly different weight adjustments, leading to a diverging result compared to a run with a different, but equally valid, sequence of mini-batches.


**Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend reviewing advanced texts on numerical analysis and the mathematical foundations of deep learning to gain a more thorough understanding of the sources of these variations.   Consultations of specific deep learning framework documentation (TensorFlow, PyTorch)  regarding random number generation, seed management, and mini-batching will be helpful. Papers on deterministic deep learning might provide further insight into mitigating these inconsistencies.  Additionally, a deeper dive into the specifics of your chosen hardware’s floating-point implementation will be valuable.  Finally, exploration of techniques used to ensure reproducibility in research settings is crucial.
