TensorFlow's `tf.map_fn` requires a function that accepts a single tensor as input; it distributes an input tensor along its first dimension, applying the function to each slice. When a user wants to apply a function with multiple arguments within `map_fn`, careful consideration is needed to structure the input correctly and manage the additional data required for the custom logic. I’ve encountered this scenario frequently while working on dynamic neural networks where various inputs need to be processed in parallel using the same custom operation.

The core challenge lies in adapting a multi-argument function for use with `map_fn`, which inherently expects a function taking a single tensor representing a slice of the input. We achieve this by carefully bundling the necessary arguments into the input tensors passed to `tf.map_fn` and then unpacking them within the custom function. This process typically involves stacking or concatenating the arguments before invoking `map_fn` and then slicing or splitting them within the mapping function. The return value of the function, as per the question's requirement, is a single tensor.

Consider a scenario where I need to compute a weighted sum of two tensors, `tensor_a` and `tensor_b`, with a corresponding set of weights. Both `tensor_a` and `tensor_b` have dimensions of `[N, M]` and the weights tensor has dimensions `[N, 1]`. The custom function should compute `weight * tensor_a + (1-weight)* tensor_b` element-wise along the M dimension for each of the N entries. Since `map_fn` iterates across the first dimension, the function needs to receive a slice of each tensor (effectively a single element along the N dimension). This means it will receive individual N-length slices of `tensor_a`, `tensor_b`, and a single corresponding weight value.

Here’s how to define the function, prepare the inputs and map it with `map_fn`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_sum_op(inputs):
    """
    Performs a weighted sum of two tensors using the provided weight.

    Args:
        inputs: A tuple containing three tensors:
            - tensor_a_slice: A tensor of shape [M].
            - tensor_b_slice: A tensor of shape [M].
            - weight: A tensor of shape [1].

    Returns:
        A tensor of shape [M], representing the weighted sum.
    """
    tensor_a_slice, tensor_b_slice, weight = inputs
    return weight * tensor_a_slice + (1 - weight) * tensor_b_slice


# Example usage
N = 5
M = 3
tensor_a = tf.random.normal(shape=[N, M])
tensor_b = tf.random.normal(shape=[N, M])
weights = tf.random.uniform(shape=[N, 1])

# Stack tensors along a new axis so they can be processed by map_fn
stacked_inputs = tf.stack([tensor_a, tensor_b, tf.broadcast_to(weights, [N, M])], axis=1)

# Map the custom operation
output = tf.map_fn(lambda x: weighted_sum_op((x[0],x[1],tf.reshape(x[2][0], [1]))), stacked_inputs)

print("Input tensor A shape:", tensor_a.shape)
print("Input tensor B shape:", tensor_b.shape)
print("Input weights shape:", weights.shape)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)
```

In this example, the `weighted_sum_op` function expects a tuple containing a slice from `tensor_a`, a slice from `tensor_b`, and a single weight.  Before calling `map_fn`, I stacked `tensor_a`, `tensor_b` and `weights` along a new axis (the second axis) into `stacked_inputs`. I also broadcast the weights to the shape of the input tensors to simplify the stacking process. Within the `map_fn`, I define a lambda function that unpacks each slice of `stacked_inputs`, extracts the weight and reshapes it to a tensor for use in the weighted sum.  The function `weighted_sum_op` is then applied to this unpacked input. Crucially, each slice passed to the lambda function has the shape of `[3, M]`. The final output tensor has a shape of `[N, M]`, indicating the function is executed for each of the N entries.

Another common situation is when we need to pass additional constant parameters into the custom function. Let’s consider a scenario where we want to apply a polynomial function to each element of a tensor, with coefficients passed as an argument. Suppose the polynomial is of the form `ax^2 + bx + c` and coefficients a, b and c are constant scalars for all elements. In the following, `tensor_x` has the dimensions `[N, M]` and `a`, `b` and `c` are scalars.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def polynomial_op(inputs, a, b, c):
    """
    Evaluates a polynomial of degree 2 given coefficients a, b, and c.

    Args:
        inputs:  A tensor of shape [M].
        a: The coefficient for x^2 (scalar).
        b: The coefficient for x (scalar).
        c: The constant (scalar).

    Returns:
         A tensor of shape [M], representing the result of the polynomial.
    """
    return a * tf.square(inputs) + b * inputs + c


# Example Usage
N = 4
M = 2
tensor_x = tf.random.normal(shape=[N, M])
a_coeff = tf.constant(2.0, dtype=tf.float32)
b_coeff = tf.constant(3.0, dtype=tf.float32)
c_coeff = tf.constant(1.0, dtype=tf.float32)

# Map the custom function with additional parameters
output = tf.map_fn(lambda x: polynomial_op(x, a_coeff, b_coeff, c_coeff), tensor_x)


print("Input tensor shape:", tensor_x.shape)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)
```

In this case, `polynomial_op` now accepts the input tensor slice and additional constant parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`. The `map_fn` then iterates through each slice of the tensor, passing the constant parameters along with the current slice to the function. The result is a tensor with the same shape as the original, but with each element having the polynomial operation applied. The coefficients here are scalars, so their usage within `map_fn` is straightforward.

Finally, consider a slightly more complex scenario involving more intricate tensors. Suppose I'm working with time-series data, and I need to calculate the moving average for each time series individually. The input tensor `time_series_data` has dimensions of `[N, T]` where N is the number of time series and T is the number of time steps, and I will use a convolution with the kernel `kernel_window` of size K. The custom function needs to receive a time-series slice and the kernel window and return a new tensor representing the smoothed time series data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def moving_average_op(inputs, kernel_window):
    """
    Calculates the moving average of a time series data using a kernel window.

    Args:
        inputs: A tensor of shape [T], representing a time series.
        kernel_window: A tensor of shape [K] representing the kernel weights

    Returns:
        A tensor of shape [T], representing the moving average of the input time series.
    """

    inputs = tf.reshape(inputs, [1, -1, 1])
    kernel_window = tf.reshape(kernel_window, [-1, 1, 1])
    return tf.squeeze(tf.nn.conv1d(inputs, kernel_window, stride=1, padding='SAME'))


# Example Usage
N = 3
T = 10
K = 3
time_series_data = tf.random.normal(shape=[N, T])
kernel_window = tf.ones(shape=[K], dtype=tf.float32) / K

# Map the custom moving average function
output = tf.map_fn(lambda x: moving_average_op(x, kernel_window), time_series_data)


print("Input time series data shape:", time_series_data.shape)
print("Kernel window shape:", kernel_window.shape)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)
```

In this example, `moving_average_op` receives a single time series and a fixed kernel window. `map_fn` applies the convolutional function, which returns a tensor of the same shape as the input time series, but smoothed by the moving average. Notice that within `moving_average_op`, I reshape the input and kernel to the expected shapes for `tf.nn.conv1d` and reshape the output back to the input's dimensionality. This demonstrates that the function operating on the slice may involve significantly complex operations. The `tf.nn.conv1d` is just a means to generate a moving average - other approaches can be taken for such a task.

For further learning and skill development on similar tasks, I recommend exploring resources focusing on TensorFlow’s core API, and particularly on the following areas:  tensor manipulation techniques such as stacking, splitting, and reshaping; understanding the difference between tensors with different ranks and shapes;  and functional programming paradigms, including the use of lambda functions for concise code. Exploring the documentation and examples of `tf.map_fn`, `tf.scan`, and other methods for data parallelism can help you choose the correct tools for specific situations. Experimenting with different approaches and test cases provides valuable hands-on experience.
