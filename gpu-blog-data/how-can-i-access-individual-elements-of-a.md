TensorFlow.js's `Tensor2D` objects, while offering efficient computation, require a nuanced approach for accessing individual elements.  Direct indexing, familiar from standard JavaScript arrays, is unavailable due to the underlying optimized memory management.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines using TensorFlow.js highlighted this constraint early on, necessitating a deeper understanding of the available access methods.  Efficient element retrieval hinges on employing the appropriate TensorFlow.js functions tailored for tensor manipulation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Accessing individual elements of a `Tensor2D` in TensorFlow.js doesn't involve direct bracket notation like `tensor[row][col]`. Instead, we rely on functions that leverage TensorFlow.js's internal optimizations.  The primary methods are `dataSync()` and `gather()`.  `dataSync()` provides a synchronous copy of the underlying data as a JavaScript `Float32Array`.  This is straightforward but can be inefficient for large tensors due to the data transfer overhead. `gather()`, on the other hand, allows selective element retrieval without copying the entire tensor, making it more memory-efficient for large datasets or when accessing only a subset of elements.  The choice between these methods depends heavily on the application's context and the scale of the tensor. For extremely large tensors, consider asynchronous methods or processing in batches to prevent blocking the main thread.  I've found that careful selection based on the access pattern significantly influences performance.  Incorrect selection often leads to performance bottlenecks, especially during the prototyping and testing stages of a project.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `dataSync()` for complete tensor access**

```javascript
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Create a 2x3 Tensor2D
const tensor = tf.tensor2d([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]);

// Get the underlying data as a Float32Array
const data = tensor.dataSync();

// Access elements using array indexing
console.log("Element at (0,0):", data[0]);  // Output: 1
console.log("Element at (1,2):", data[5]);  // Output: 6

//Remember to dispose of the tensor when finished to free up memory.
tensor.dispose();
```

This example demonstrates the straightforward approach using `dataSync()`.  The function synchronously returns a `Float32Array` mirroring the tensor's data.  While simple, its efficiency decreases with increasing tensor size because of the data copying.  It's ideal for smaller tensors where simplicity outweighs performance considerations.  The crucial addition of `tensor.dispose()` underscores the importance of memory management in TensorFlow.js. Neglecting this step can lead to memory leaks, especially in applications involving frequent tensor creation and manipulation.


**Example 2: Using `gather()` for selective element access**

```javascript
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Create a 2x3 Tensor2D
const tensor = tf.tensor2d([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]);

// Define indices to gather
const indices = tf.tensor1d([0, 3, 5], 'int32');

// Gather elements at specified indices
const gathered = tf.gather(tensor, indices);

// Access gathered elements (Note: gather returns a 1D tensor)
gathered.dataSync().forEach((element, index) => {
    console.log(`Element at index ${indices.dataSync()[index]}:`, element);
}); // Output: Element at index 0: 1, Element at index 3: 4, Element at index 5: 6

// Dispose of tensors
tensor.dispose();
indices.dispose();
gathered.dispose();
```

This example showcases `gather()`, a more efficient method for accessing specific elements.  Instead of retrieving the entire tensor, we specify the indices of the desired elements using a `tf.tensor1d`. The output is a 1D tensor containing only the selected values. This approach reduces the memory footprint and processing time, especially when dealing with only a fraction of the total elements.  The explicit disposal of all created tensors is paramount for maintaining application stability.

**Example 3: Handling higher-dimensional tensors with `gatherND()`**

```javascript
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

// Create a 3x2x2 Tensor3D
const tensor3D = tf.tensor3d([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]], [[9, 10], [11, 12]]]);

// Define indices to gather (using multi-dimensional indices)
const indices = tf.tensor2d([[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [2, 0, 1]], 'int32');

// Gather elements using gatherND
const gathered3D = tf.gatherND(tensor3D, indices);


// Access the gathered elements
gathered3D.print(); // Output: Tensor [1, 8, 10]

//Dispose of tensors
tensor3D.dispose();
indices.dispose();
gathered3D.dispose();
```

This example extends the concept to higher-dimensional tensors using `gatherND()`.  This function enables selection of elements based on multi-dimensional indices. This is crucial when working with tensors representing data like images or volumes. The output is a 1D tensor containing the gathered elements, ordered according to the provided indices.  The clear example demonstrates the adaptability of TensorFlow.js to handle various tensor dimensions.  The consistent application of resource disposal further highlights best practices for preventing memory leaks and ensuring application performance.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow.js documentation offers comprehensive details on tensor manipulation and related functions.  Further exploration into the specifics of `tf.gather()` and `tf.gatherND()` is strongly recommended.  Reviewing examples related to tensor reshaping and manipulation will solidify understanding.  Supplementing this with a textbook on linear algebra will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical operations.  Finally, consulting advanced TensorFlow.js tutorials focused on performance optimization will prove invaluable for large-scale applications.
