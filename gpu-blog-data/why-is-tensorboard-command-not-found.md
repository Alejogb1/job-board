The `tensorboard` command not being found stems primarily from an absence of the TensorBoard package within the system's PATH environment variable or a failure to correctly install the TensorFlow package.  In my experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous projects,  I've observed that the root cause often lies in inconsistencies between the Python environment used for TensorFlow installation and the system's shell environment configuration.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The `tensorboard` command is a command-line utility provided by TensorFlow.  It's responsible for launching the TensorBoard server, a powerful visualization tool for monitoring and analyzing machine learning model training progress.  This command relies on several underlying factors:

* **TensorFlow Installation:**  The `tensorboard` command is part of the TensorFlow package.  If TensorFlow is not installed, or not installed correctly, the command will be unavailable.  This is the most common reason for the error. Incorrect installation can manifest in partial installations, conflicting versions, or installations within virtual environments that aren't activated during command execution.

* **Environment Variables:** The system's PATH environment variable dictates which directories the shell searches for executable files. If the directory containing the `tensorboard` executable (typically within the TensorFlow installation directory) is not included in the PATH, the shell will not be able to find it. This is often overlooked, particularly when using virtual environments or multiple Python installations.

* **Virtual Environments:**  Using virtual environments (like `venv`, `conda`, or `virtualenv`) is a best practice for managing project dependencies. However,  if you install TensorFlow within a virtual environment but don't activate it before running `tensorboard`, the command will not be found as the system's PATH remains unchanged.

* **Shell Configuration:**  The specifics of how environment variables are set and managed vary depending on the shell (bash, zsh, PowerShell, etc.).  Incorrect configuration or typos in shell scripts can prevent the PATH variable from being correctly populated.

* **Incorrect Python Version:** Tensorflow has specific python version requirements. Using an unsupported version can lead to the Tensorflow package not installing correctly, or some of its components being missing.

Addressing these aspects systematically is crucial in resolving the "command not found" issue.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Verifying TensorFlow Installation**

This code snippet confirms TensorFlow's installation within the currently active Python environment and checks for the `tensorboard` function within the TensorFlow library.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
try:
    print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
    print(f"TensorBoard function exists: {hasattr(tf, 'tensorboard')}") #Checks for Tensorboard function
except ImportError:
    print("TensorFlow is not installed in the current environment.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

If TensorFlow is not installed, this will output an error message.  The second `print` statement is a double-check to ensure the TensorBoard functionality is available even if TensorFlow is installed.  The error handling ensures informative output even with unusual issues.

**Example 2: Activating a Virtual Environment (using `venv`)**

This example demonstrates activating a virtual environment before running `tensorboard`.  Assuming you have a virtual environment named "myenv" in your project directory.

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
myenv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
#Now run tensorboard command here
tensorboard --logdir runs
deactivate #Deactivate the environment when finished.
```

Failure to activate the virtual environment before running `tensorboard` is a frequent cause of the error.  The `deactivate` command is crucial for returning to the system's default Python environment.

**Example 3:  Adding TensorFlow to PATH (bash)**

This demonstrates adding the TensorFlow directory to the PATH environment variable permanently in bash.  Replace `/path/to/your/tensorflow/installation` with the actual path.  This approach requires administrative privileges and should be done carefully.

```bash
#Check if the file exists (replace with the actual directory)
if [[ -d /path/to/your/tensorflow/installation/bin ]]; then
    echo "TensorFlow directory found"
    # Add TensorFlow to PATH (permanent)
    echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/your/tensorflow/installation/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
else
    echo "TensorFlow directory NOT found"
fi

```

This script first verifies the existence of the TensorFlow directory before modifying the `~/.bashrc` file.  Appending to this file ensures the PATH update persists across shell sessions.  The `source ~/.bashrc` command applies the changes immediately.  Similar methods exist for other shells like zsh or PowerShell, but the specifics of the commands will vary.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

Consult the official TensorFlow documentation for detailed instructions on installation and troubleshooting.  Familiarize yourself with the documentation for your operating system's shell, focusing on how to manage environment variables. Review tutorials on using virtual environments effectively; understanding their usage is critical for managing project dependencies.  Finally, utilize online forums and communities dedicated to TensorFlow; they often have comprehensive discussions and solutions to common problems.
