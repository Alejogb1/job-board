Partial derivative computation in PyTorch, with respect to model inputs, hinges on the framework’s automatic differentiation capabilities. Specifically, the `torch.autograd` engine tracks operations on tensors, constructing a computational graph that enables backpropagation – the core mechanism for calculating gradients. I've utilized this functionality extensively in both image processing tasks where per-pixel gradient analysis proved beneficial and in reinforcement learning scenarios where understanding the impact of input state on action selection is critical.

The fundamental idea is to treat the input tensor itself as a variable that can have gradients computed with respect to it. To achieve this, we need to set the `requires_grad` attribute of the input tensor to `True`. This flag signals to PyTorch that it should track operations performed on this tensor. Subsequent calculations involving this tensor form the computational graph. Once a scalar output (often a loss value) is produced, we call `.backward()` on this output, which triggers the backpropagation process. The resulting gradients with respect to the input tensor are then stored in the `.grad` attribute of the input tensor.

It is imperative to understand that gradients are computed with respect to scalar values. Therefore, if your output tensor is multi-dimensional, you will need to reduce it to a scalar value before calling `.backward()`. Common reduction methods include summing all elements (`.sum()`) or calculating the mean (`.mean()`). The chosen method influences the resulting gradients, which represent the local rate of change of the scalar output concerning each element of the input tensor.

Let’s consider three code examples that illustrate this process, each with a different context:

**Example 1: Simple Linear Regression**

Imagine a basic linear regression scenario where the model is simply a matrix multiplication. We want to examine how changes in the input data impact the output.

```python
import torch

# Initialize a random input tensor and a weight matrix
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 5, requires_grad=True)  # Shape (1, 5) - one sample with 5 features
weights = torch.randn(5, 1)       # Shape (5, 1) - 5 input features to 1 output feature

# Perform the forward pass (linear regression in this case)
output = torch.matmul(input_tensor, weights)  # Shape (1, 1)

# Compute the loss (e.g., sum of the output)
loss = output.sum()

# Backpropagate to calculate gradients with respect to input
loss.backward()

# Access the gradients
input_gradients = input_tensor.grad

print("Input Tensor:\n", input_tensor)
print("\nOutput Tensor:\n", output)
print("\nInput Gradients:\n", input_gradients)
```
In this example, `input_tensor` is our input, whose derivative we seek. I set `requires_grad=True` during its initialization. I'm modelling a regression using `torch.matmul` and obtain a single output (1,1) tensor. Before calling `.backward()`, I reduce the 1x1 tensor to a scalar value using `.sum()` (although this particular case is somewhat redundant, it is used for illustrative purposes.) Following `loss.backward()`, `input_gradients` now contains the partial derivatives of the `loss` with respect to the `input_tensor`. The shape of the gradient will match the shape of the input (`1, 5`). The output is simply to show the different tensors involved in the process.

**Example 2: Partial Derivatives of an Activation Function**

Let’s explore a scenario where we are interested in the gradient of a specific activation function with respect to its input. In my image processing, analyzing activations like this was useful when studying the gradients that propagated through feature maps after non-linearities.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Initialize a random input tensor with requires_grad=True
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10, requires_grad=True)  # Batch size 1, 10 features.

# Apply a sigmoid activation
output = F.sigmoid(input_tensor)

# Reduce output to a single scalar
loss = output.mean() # Compute mean of the output

# Compute partial derivatives of output w.r.t. input
loss.backward()

# Access gradients
input_gradients = input_tensor.grad

print("Input Tensor:\n", input_tensor)
print("\nOutput Tensor:\n", output)
print("\nInput Gradients:\n", input_gradients)

```
Here, the core idea remains unchanged. I utilize the `F.sigmoid` function from `torch.nn.functional`. Again, `requires_grad=True` ensures the computation graph is built and the mean of the sigmoid output is reduced to a scalar using `.mean()`. When `loss.backward()` is called, the gradient of the mean of sigmoid output is computed and stored in `input_tensor.grad`. The resulting gradient provides an insight into the local rate of change of the sigmoid’s output with respect to each element of the input tensor.

**Example 3: Input Gradient in a Small Convolutional Network**

Lastly, let's explore a gradient calculation in a slightly more complex context: a small convolutional neural network. This example mirrors situations in computer vision where a sensitivity analysis with respect to input images could be useful.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Define a simple CNN model
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 14 * 14, 10) # Assuming input size 28x28

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 14 * 14)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x


# Initialize the model and input
model = SimpleCNN()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 28, 28, requires_grad=True) # Batch of size 1, 3 color channels, 28x28 image size

# Forward pass
output = model(input_tensor)

# Reduce to a scalar
loss = output.sum()

# Backpropagate
loss.backward()

# Access input gradients
input_gradients = input_tensor.grad

print("Input Tensor:\n", input_tensor)
print("\nOutput Tensor:\n", output)
print("\nInput Gradients:\n", input_gradients)
```
Here, I create a small CNN and pass an input image through it. The `requires_grad=True` is applied to the input image and `.backward()` is called on the summed output, just like before. This time we see the gradients represent how much the loss (sum of output features) changes given infinitesimal changes in the input image. This example displays how these gradients propagate even in models involving multiple operations.

In each of these examples, the critical step is setting `requires_grad=True` on the input tensor. The backpropagation is then carried out by calling `.backward()` on a reduced (scalar) output tensor. The partial derivatives with respect to the input are then accessed using the `.grad` attribute of the input tensor.

For further exploration of this concept, I recommend investigating resources that delve deeper into PyTorch's autograd engine. The official PyTorch documentation provides comprehensive information on automatic differentiation and gradient calculations. Works that discuss deep learning frameworks will also often contain a chapter dedicated to backpropagation and automatic differentiation. The documentation on `torch.autograd` within the PyTorch API is highly beneficial as well. Familiarizing oneself with the nuances of `torch.nn.functional` can also be helpful in understanding operations like activation functions. Lastly, example implementations and demonstrations of PyTorch are plentiful on both the official PyTorch website and other educational platforms, further solidifying understanding through experimentation.
