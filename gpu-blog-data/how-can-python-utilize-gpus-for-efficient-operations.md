Large integer arithmetic, while readily handled by Python's built-in types for smaller values, becomes computationally expensive for numbers exceeding the capacity of standard integer representations.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing (HPC) applications within the financial modeling sector highlighted this limitation extensively.  Leveraging GPU acceleration for such computations requires careful consideration of data structures and algorithmic choices, moving away from Python's interpreted nature and relying on libraries designed for GPU programming.

**1.  Explanation: The Bottleneck and the Solution**

The primary bottleneck stems from the sequential nature of Python's CPU-bound integer operations.  Standard Python integers are dynamically sized, meaning memory allocation and management overhead increase proportionally with the integer's magnitude.  Furthermore, basic arithmetic operations on these large integers are performed sequentially by the CPU. GPUs, however, excel at parallel processing.  To utilize their power, we must represent large integers in a format suitable for parallel operations and employ libraries capable of offloading the computations to the GPU.

The solution involves representing large integers as arrays of smaller integers or specialized data structures that can be easily parallelized across GPU cores.  This allows for simultaneous execution of arithmetic operations on different parts of the large integers, dramatically reducing computation time.  Libraries like CuPy and Numba provide the necessary functionalities to achieve this.  CuPy offers a NumPy-like interface specifically designed for GPU computations, while Numba allows for just-in-time (JIT) compilation of Python code to run on the GPU, albeit with limitations regarding the complexity of the supported operations.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate how to perform large integer addition, multiplication, and modular exponentiation using CuPy and Numba.  These examples assume a basic familiarity with NumPy and the associated concepts.

**Example 1: Large Integer Addition with CuPy**

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np

# Define two large integers as NumPy arrays
a = np.array([12345678901234567890, 98765432109876543210], dtype=np.uint64)
b = np.array([98765432109876543210, 12345678901234567890], dtype=np.uint64)

# Transfer the arrays to the GPU
a_gpu = cp.asarray(a)
b_gpu = cp.asarray(b)

# Perform addition on the GPU
c_gpu = cp.add(a_gpu, b_gpu)

# Transfer the result back to the CPU
c_cpu = cp.asnumpy(c_gpu)

# Print the result
print(c_cpu)
```

This example showcases the fundamental workflow: data transfer to the GPU, computation on the GPU using CuPy's element-wise addition function, and retrieval of the result.  The `dtype=np.uint64` ensures sufficient precision for handling large integers.  This approach is efficient for element-wise operations.


**Example 2: Large Integer Multiplication with Numba**

```python
from numba import cuda
import numpy as np

@cuda.jit
def multiply_large_integers(a, b, c):
    i = cuda.grid(1)
    if i < len(a):
        c[i] = a[i] * b[i]

# Define large integers as NumPy arrays
a = np.array([1234567890123456789, 9876543210987654321], dtype=np.uint64)
b = np.array([9876543210987654321, 1234567890123456789], dtype=np.uint64)
c = np.zeros_like(a)

# Allocate GPU memory
a_gpu = cuda.to_device(a)
b_gpu = cuda.to_device(b)
c_gpu = cuda.device_array_like(c)

# Launch the kernel
threads_per_block = 256
blocks_per_grid = (len(a) + threads_per_block - 1) // threads_per_block
multiply_large_integers[blocks_per_grid, threads_per_block](a_gpu, b_gpu, c_gpu)

# Copy the result back to the CPU
c = c_gpu.copy_to_host()

# Print the result
print(c)
```

This example leverages Numba's CUDA capabilities for parallel multiplication.  The `@cuda.jit` decorator compiles the Python function into a CUDA kernel.  Note the manual management of GPU memory and the explicit specification of thread and block configurations for optimal performance.  This example is advantageous for situations where custom kernels are needed for more complex operations.  However, Numba's suitability is highly dependent on the complexity of the arithmetic involved.


**Example 3: Modular Exponentiation using CuPy (Illustrative)**

Direct modular exponentiation with arbitrary-precision integers on a GPU using only CuPy might require custom kernel development due to the complexities of handling carries and modulo operations within a parallel framework.  Libraries like CuPy primarily focus on vectorized operations, not arbitrary-precision arithmetic at this level of complexity.  Therefore, a more sophisticated approach would be necessary, potentially involving a hybrid strategy â€“ processing portions of the calculation on the GPU and then handling the more complex parts (carry propagation, modular reduction) on the CPU.

While I cannot provide a complete, fully optimized CuPy example for this, the conceptual outline would be:

1. **Data partitioning:** Divide the large integers into smaller chunks suitable for parallel processing on the GPU.
2. **Parallel exponentiation:**  Employ CuPy's element-wise operations to perform exponentiation on the smaller chunks in parallel.
3. **Modular reduction:**  After the parallel exponentiation, the results would need to be assembled and subjected to modular reduction. This part might be more CPU-bound, requiring a more classical approach for handling the carry operations and modulo calculations.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For in-depth understanding of GPU computing with Python, I strongly suggest exploring the official documentation for CuPy and Numba.  Furthermore, a textbook on parallel computing principles and GPU programming would be valuable, supplemented by literature specific to large integer arithmetic algorithms.  A good understanding of linear algebra and numerical methods is also crucial for efficiently utilizing GPUs in this context.  Finally, familiarity with CUDA programming concepts will be extremely beneficial when working with Numba for more advanced GPU tasks.
