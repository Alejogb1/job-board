Implementing neural networks with variable connections between layers, rather than the standard fully-connected approach, represents a significant step towards more biologically plausible and efficient models. Traditional dense layers link each node in one layer to every node in the subsequent layer, a connectivity pattern often too rigid for complex data or specialized tasks. The ability to control which nodes connect, and how strongly, opens up possibilities for feature specialization, reduced computation, and customized network topologies. I've encountered this challenge on several occasions while developing sparse neural networks for image analysis and time-series prediction, requiring me to move beyond typical Keras or PyTorch implementations.

The core challenge lies in defining and managing this connectivity pattern. Instead of relying on inherent layer-wise connections, we must explicitly specify them. This can be achieved by using an adjacency matrix or an equivalent representation that details which node from the preceding layer connects to which node in the subsequent layer. This contrasts sharply with fully connected layers where the weights alone implicitly determine connections. Variable connections allow for scenarios such as: skipping connections where a node connects to a non-adjacent layer, locally connected layers where connections are constrained to a region, or dynamically connected layers where the connections adapt during training.

Letâ€™s delve into some practical strategies using common deep learning libraries. It is crucial to note that standard `Dense` layers, for example, within Keras or PyTorch will not suffice; custom layer implementation will be required. I've personally found this approach to be beneficial when building models where the input data had a very high number of dimensions and needed to discover relevant patterns efficiently without creating an overly parameterised structure.

**Code Example 1: Custom Layer using NumPy**

This example illustrates the core concept by building a custom layer within Python, using NumPy for the underlying matrix operations. We will specify the connection matrix using a simple binary encoding: a '1' indicates a connection between corresponding nodes; a '0' indicates no connection. This is a basic implementation, suitable to clarify the principal concepts involved.

```python
import numpy as np

class CustomConnectedLayer:
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size, connection_matrix, activation='relu'):
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.output_size = output_size
        self.connection_matrix = np.array(connection_matrix)
        self.weights = np.random.randn(input_size, output_size) * 0.01 #Initialize weights
        self.bias = np.zeros(output_size)
        self.activation = activation

    def forward(self, x):
        weighted_sum = np.dot(x, self.weights * self.connection_matrix) + self.bias # Element wise multiplication
        if self.activation == 'relu':
             return np.maximum(0, weighted_sum)
        elif self.activation == 'sigmoid':
            return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-weighted_sum))
        else:
           return weighted_sum # No activation

    def backward(self, x, d_out, learning_rate=0.01):
        if self.activation == 'relu':
            d_weighted_sum = d_out * (np.array(np.dot(x, self.weights*self.connection_matrix) + self.bias ) > 0) #ReLU derivative
        elif self.activation == 'sigmoid':
            sig = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(np.dot(x, self.weights * self.connection_matrix) + self.bias) ) )
            d_weighted_sum = d_out * sig * (1 - sig)
        else:
             d_weighted_sum = d_out # derivative of Linear

        d_weights = np.dot(x.T, d_weighted_sum) * self.connection_matrix
        d_bias = np.sum(d_weighted_sum, axis=0)
        d_input = np.dot(d_weighted_sum, self.weights.T * self.connection_matrix.T)

        self.weights -= learning_rate * d_weights
        self.bias -= learning_rate * d_bias

        return d_input

# Example usage
input_size = 4
output_size = 3

# 4 nodes in the first layer, 3 nodes in the second layer. Connections specified below.
connection_matrix = [
    [1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]
]


layer = CustomConnectedLayer(input_size, output_size, connection_matrix, activation = 'relu')

input_data = np.random.randn(1, input_size)
output = layer.forward(input_data)
print("output:", output)

d_out = np.random.randn(1,output_size)
d_input = layer.backward(input_data, d_out)
print("d_input:", d_input)
```
In the above code, the `connection_matrix` governs which of the input features are connected to each output neuron. It is essential to ensure both the weight and connection matrix have matching dimensions for the element-wise multiplication to function.  The backpropagation update respects the established connection mapping: it updates only those weights that have been specified in `connection_matrix`.

**Code Example 2: Custom Layer Using TensorFlow**

TensorFlow enables efficient GPU acceleration. Here's an implementation of a custom layer with sparse connections:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomConnectedLayerTF(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size, connection_matrix, activation='relu'):
        super(CustomConnectedLayerTF, self).__init__()
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.output_size = output_size
        self.connection_matrix = tf.constant(connection_matrix, dtype=tf.float32)
        self.weights = self.add_weight(shape=(input_size, output_size),
                                      initializer='random_normal',
                                      trainable=True)
        self.bias = self.add_weight(shape=(output_size,),
                                     initializer='zeros',
                                     trainable=True)
        self.activation = activation

    def call(self, inputs):
        weighted_sum = tf.matmul(inputs, self.weights * self.connection_matrix) + self.bias
        if self.activation == 'relu':
            return tf.nn.relu(weighted_sum)
        elif self.activation == 'sigmoid':
            return tf.sigmoid(weighted_sum)
        else:
            return weighted_sum


# Example usage:

input_size = 4
output_size = 3

connection_matrix = [
    [1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]
]

layer = CustomConnectedLayerTF(input_size, output_size, connection_matrix, activation='relu')
input_data = tf.random.normal((1, input_size))
output = layer(input_data)
print("output:", output)
```
This code implements a custom layer as a `tf.keras.layers.Layer`. Similar to NumPy, the core concept lies in the element-wise multiplication of the weight matrix by the `connection_matrix`. This forces gradient updates to be performed only on the active connections. The advantage of using TensorFlow lies in its efficient automatic differentiation capabilities and ability to manage computations on GPUs.

**Code Example 3: Sparse Matrix Representation (PyTorch)**

In cases of extremely sparse connectivity, storing the connections using sparse matrices can optimize memory usage and speed up computation. This approach is particularly useful for large networks.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.sparse as sparse

class CustomConnectedLayerSparse(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size, connection_matrix, activation='relu'):
        super(CustomConnectedLayerSparse, self).__init__()
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.output_size = output_size
        self.connection_matrix = connection_matrix # expect sparse tensor.
        self.weights = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(input_size, output_size) * 0.01)
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(output_size))
        self.activation = activation


    def forward(self, x):
        weighted_sum = torch.matmul(x,  self.weights * self.connection_matrix.to_dense()) + self.bias

        if self.activation == 'relu':
            return torch.relu(weighted_sum)
        elif self.activation == 'sigmoid':
            return torch.sigmoid(weighted_sum)
        else:
           return weighted_sum



# Example usage
input_size = 4
output_size = 3

connection_matrix = [
    [1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]
]

indices = []
values = []
for row_idx, row in enumerate(connection_matrix):
     for col_idx, value in enumerate(row):
          if value == 1:
             indices.append([row_idx,col_idx])
             values.append(1)

indices_tensor = torch.tensor(indices, dtype=torch.long)
values_tensor = torch.tensor(values, dtype=torch.float)
connection_matrix_sparse = sparse.FloatTensor(indices_tensor.T,values_tensor,torch.Size([input_size,output_size]))


layer = CustomConnectedLayerSparse(input_size, output_size, connection_matrix_sparse, activation = 'relu')

input_data = torch.randn(1, input_size)
output = layer(input_data)
print("output:", output)
```

In this PyTorch example, the `connection_matrix` is now represented as a sparse tensor. The multiplication with the weight matrix is performed after converting the sparse matrix to a dense form in the `forward` pass; whilst more efficient, using sparse methods for the computation themselves is possible, and can be implemented to further improve performance with large sparse connection matrices, though outside of this scope. Sparse matrices excel in reducing memory footprints especially in complex networks with few connections.  This approach is especially relevant when dealing with very large networks with sparse connections.

In summary, building networks with variable connections requires custom layer implementations. Whether one uses NumPy, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, the critical principle is to define and enforce the connectivity through a connection matrix during both the forward pass and backpropagation. Selecting the correct representation for the connection matrix, specifically between dense and sparse matrices, is vital for efficient memory management and computation when dealing with very large and sparsely connected networks.

For further exploration of custom layer development within these frameworks, I would recommend studying the official documentation and examples from each of these tools. Moreover, gaining a deeper understanding of sparse matrix algorithms and numerical computation will allow better management of the computational costs involved with these types of structures. Finally, exploring academic publications focused on sparse neural networks and their applications could give more insight into use cases.
