TensorFlow 2.0's `__inference_train_function` (a private method, hence the double underscore) isn't directly accessible for modification in the manner one might alter a publicly exposed training loop.  Attempts to directly interfere with its internal workings are discouraged due to potential instability and incompatibility across TensorFlow versions.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition models highlighted this limitation.  The key is to manipulate the data *before* it reaches the `__inference_train_function`, focusing on preprocessing and data selection.  Extraneous information removal, therefore, hinges on efficient data management strategies.

My approach, honed over years of optimizing TensorFlow models, centers on three primary techniques: data filtering, feature selection, and selective data augmentation.  These methods, applied strategically, allow for significant reduction in computational overhead and improved model performance during inference without needing to modify the internal functions of TensorFlow.

**1. Data Filtering:** This involves preprocessing the input data to exclude irrelevant or noisy features before feeding it into the model.  This is particularly effective when dealing with high-dimensional data, where many features might be redundant or contribute little to the predictive power of the model.  For instance, in image classification, filtering might involve removing pixel values outside a specific range or discarding images with excessive noise.

**Code Example 1: Filtering Noisy Images based on Variance**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def filter_noisy_images(images, variance_threshold=0.05):
  """Filters out images with high variance, indicating noise.

  Args:
    images: A NumPy array of images.
    variance_threshold: The maximum acceptable variance.

  Returns:
    A NumPy array of filtered images.
  """
  filtered_images = []
  for image in images:
    variance = np.var(image)
    if variance <= variance_threshold:
      filtered_images.append(image)
  return np.array(filtered_images)


# Example usage:
images = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28, 1)  # 100 images, 28x28 pixels, 1 channel
filtered_images = filter_noisy_images(images, variance_threshold=0.02)
# Proceed with filtered_images in your training/inference pipeline.
```

This code snippet demonstrates a simple filtering technique.  The `variance_threshold` parameter controls the sensitivity.  Lower values mean stricter filtering, removing more images, potentially discarding useful data if set too low.  Adjusting this parameter is crucial for balancing noise reduction and data preservation.  More sophisticated filtering could utilize techniques such as median filtering or wavelet denoising for improved results.  Note that this filtering happens *before* the data enters the TensorFlow graph.

**2. Feature Selection:**  This approach focuses on identifying and retaining only the most relevant features within the input data.  This is especially useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets where many features are redundant or irrelevant.  Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or feature importance scores from tree-based models can be employed to select a subset of the most informative features.

**Code Example 2: Feature Selection using PCA**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

def select_features_pca(data, num_components):
    """Reduces dimensionality using PCA.

    Args:
      data: A NumPy array of features.
      num_components: The number of principal components to retain.

    Returns:
      A NumPy array of reduced features.
    """
    pca = PCA(n_components=num_components)
    reduced_data = pca.fit_transform(data)
    return reduced_data

#Example usage:
features = np.random.rand(100, 1000) # 100 samples, 1000 features
reduced_features = select_features_pca(features, num_components=100)
#reduced_features now contains only 100 principal components
```

This example utilizes scikit-learn's PCA for dimensionality reduction. The `num_components` parameter dictates the number of principal components retained. Choosing an appropriate number is essential to balance dimensionality reduction and information preservation.   Improper selection can lead to information loss.  Experimentation and validation are vital here.


**3. Selective Data Augmentation:**  Data augmentation techniques, while typically used to increase training data, can also be used selectively to remove extraneous information.  For example, applying cropping to focus on relevant regions of an image or applying noise reduction filters during augmentation can refine the data before it's fed to the model.

**Code Example 3: Selective Cropping for Image Focus**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def selective_crop(image, crop_size):
    """Crops a central region of an image.

    Args:
      image: A TensorFlow tensor representing the image.
      crop_size: A tuple (height, width) specifying the crop size.

    Returns:
      A TensorFlow tensor representing the cropped image.
    """
    image_height, image_width = image.shape[:2]
    y_start = (image_height - crop_size[0]) // 2
    x_start = (image_width - crop_size[1]) // 2
    cropped_image = tf.image.crop_to_bounding_box(image, y_start, x_start, crop_size[0], crop_size[1])
    return cropped_image


# Example usage:
image = tf.random.normal((256, 256, 3))
cropped_image = selective_crop(image, (128, 128))
```

This code demonstrates selective cropping. By focusing on a central region, peripheral or irrelevant information is excluded.  Similar strategies can be employed with other augmentation techniques, such as contrast adjustment or sharpening, to enhance relevant features while suppressing noise.

In conclusion, optimizing inference with TensorFlow 2.0+ does not involve direct manipulation of the `__inference_train_function`.  Instead, concentrate on efficient preprocessing and data management. Data filtering, feature selection, and selective data augmentation provide powerful tools to remove extraneous information *before* the data enters the model, leading to improved efficiency and performance without compromising model integrity or resorting to unstable modifications of internal TensorFlow mechanisms.  Remember to carefully validate and tune these techniques based on your specific data and model requirements.  Consider exploring resources on data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction techniques, and image processing for a deeper understanding of these methods.  Careful experimentation with different parameter settings is crucial for optimal results.
