In neural network training, the ability to directly manipulate a model's weights offers crucial control over its learning process and behavior, extending beyond the standard backpropagation algorithm. I've frequently leveraged this capability in situations where pre-trained weights required fine-tuning, where I needed to enforce specific constraints on the network's parameters, or in experimental training techniques involving weight initialization strategies. In a sequential model, such as those built using Keras or PyTorch, weight customization essentially involves directly accessing and modifying the internal tensors representing the network's weights. This level of manipulation departs from the typical gradient descent process, allowing one to implement custom initialization schemes, weight pruning, or even transfer learning techniques with greater granularity.

The weights of a sequential model are not uniform or monolithic; instead, they reside within each layer of the network as individual tensors. To modify them, we must first gain access to these tensors, and then implement the desired change using appropriate methods from the relevant deep learning framework. This process involves understanding the underlying data structures used by the library and directly assigning new tensor values to those attributes. The key is to maintain a compatible shape and data type when performing these modifications.

For instance, consider a basic sequential model in Keras consisting of dense layers. Accessing the weights of a specific layer requires interacting with the `layers` attribute of the model and subsequently accessing the `weights` attribute of the target layer. Each layer’s `weights` attribute is a list of two tensors: the weight matrix itself, and the bias vector. Customizing the weights will then involve performing direct tensor manipulation, assigning them back to the `weights` attribute of the corresponding layer.

Let's illustrate with a basic Keras example.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple sequential model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax')
])

# Access weights of the first dense layer
first_layer = model.layers[0]
weights = first_layer.get_weights()  # returns a list: [weight matrix, bias vector]
weight_matrix, bias_vector = weights

# Example 1: Custom weight initialization (all values 0)
new_weight_matrix = np.zeros_like(weight_matrix)
new_bias_vector = np.zeros_like(bias_vector)

# Update the layer's weights. Important to use the set_weights function and not the layer's weight attribute directly
first_layer.set_weights([new_weight_matrix, new_bias_vector])

# Verify that the change took effect
new_weights = first_layer.get_weights()
new_weight_matrix_verification, new_bias_vector_verification = new_weights
print(np.all(new_weight_matrix_verification == 0)) # Output: True
print(np.all(new_bias_vector_verification == 0))    # Output: True
```

In this code example, I retrieve the weights of the first dense layer. Then, I create new tensors filled with zeros using `numpy.zeros_like()`. These new tensors are subsequently assigned to the first layer using the `set_weights()` method. This approach allows for a complete reset of the layer’s weights. Notice that I did not simply overwrite the `first_layer.weights` attribute; instead, I used `first_layer.set_weights()` to update the internal state of the layer correctly.

Here's another scenario using PyTorch, which handles weight customization somewhat differently. PyTorch exposes a more direct API for accessing parameters:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import numpy as np

# Define a simple sequential model
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 64),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(64, 10),
    nn.Softmax(dim=1)
)

# Access parameters of the first linear layer
first_layer = model[0]
weight_matrix = first_layer.weight
bias_vector = first_layer.bias

# Example 2: Custom weight initialization (random uniform distribution)
with torch.no_grad():
    new_weight_matrix = torch.rand_like(weight_matrix)
    new_bias_vector = torch.rand_like(bias_vector)

    # Important to use data method to replace the underlying tensors
    first_layer.weight.data = new_weight_matrix
    first_layer.bias.data = new_bias_vector

# Verify that the change took effect
print(torch.all(first_layer.weight.data == new_weight_matrix)) # Output: True
print(torch.all(first_layer.bias.data == new_bias_vector)) # Output: True
```

In the PyTorch example, I retrieved the `weight` and `bias` attributes directly from the first linear layer (`nn.Linear`). Crucially, modifications must happen within the `torch.no_grad()` context because we are not performing backpropagation, and modifications should not affect the gradient computation. Directly modifying the `weight` and `bias` tensors with the `.data` attribute is the standard procedure. This overwrites the tensor's data without affecting its computation graph context. I've used a random uniform distribution initialization in this case, showing that it's as simple as generating appropriate tensors of the same shape and type and assigning them.

Finally, consider a more specialized application: enforcing weight constraints. Let's say you want to prune a Keras model, forcing specific weights to be zero. This can be implemented after training, by checking the current weights and zeroing the ones beneath a set threshold:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple sequential model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax')
])


# Pretend the model has been trained and weights are set

# Access weights of the first dense layer
first_layer = model.layers[0]
weights = first_layer.get_weights()
weight_matrix, bias_vector = weights


# Example 3: Pruning weights (setting small weights to zero)
threshold = 0.1
mask = np.abs(weight_matrix) > threshold  # Create a boolean mask
pruned_weight_matrix = weight_matrix * mask # Apply the mask

# Update the layer's weights
first_layer.set_weights([pruned_weight_matrix, bias_vector])

# Verify some of the original weights have been set to zero
new_weights = first_layer.get_weights()
new_weight_matrix_verification, _ = new_weights
print(np.sum(new_weight_matrix_verification==0) > 0) # Output: True
```

In this pruning example, I first retrieve the trained weights and apply a mask based on an absolute value threshold. This mask is then used to zero out weight values that are deemed below the threshold, thus resulting in a pruned weight matrix. This is again implemented by directly manipulating the weight tensor and assigning it using the `set_weights()` method. Note that only weights of the weight matrix are pruned; the bias vector remains unchanged in this specific case, as indicated by using the original bias_vector during the update of the layer’s weights.

Several resources delve deeper into weight manipulation within deep learning frameworks. The official documentation for Keras, particularly the sections on layer operations and the model API, is essential. Similarly, PyTorch's documentation on `nn.Module` classes and parameters provides granular detail on how parameters are stored and manipulated. Books such as “Deep Learning with Python” by François Chollet (for Keras) or “Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning” by Ian Pointer (for PyTorch) offer in-depth explanations, code samples, and real-world applications, solidifying understanding of the fundamental concepts involved in direct weight manipulation. Academic papers detailing specific techniques such as weight pruning or customized initialization can also provide more theoretical background to the processes detailed above. These combined resources offer a broad foundation to understand, and apply, direct weight manipulation techniques within sequential models.
