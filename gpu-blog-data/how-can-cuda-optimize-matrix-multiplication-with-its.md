Matrix multiplication, specifically involving a transpose, benefits significantly from CUDA's parallel processing capabilities, but optimal performance requires a thorough understanding of memory access patterns and thread scheduling. Over my years developing high-performance linear algebra routines, I've found that naïve implementations in CUDA often fall short, leading to poor resource utilization and diminished speed gains compared to CPU equivalents. The key optimization revolves around efficiently managing the global memory accesses, coalescing them whenever possible, and utilizing shared memory to minimize redundant reads.

Fundamentally, matrix multiplication C = A * B, where B is transposed (B^T), means that each element C(i,j) is computed by taking the dot product of row 'i' of matrix A and column 'j' of matrix B. Since B is transposed, the rows of B become the columns in this operation. In a traditional nested loop implementation, calculating each element of C involves accessing elements of A row-wise and B column-wise. This access pattern becomes problematic on GPUs because global memory is not optimized for arbitrary access patterns. GPUs are designed for sequential access patterns (coalesced reads and writes) within a block of threads. Therefore, the challenge becomes restructuring the computation to align with the GPU’s memory architecture.

The core idea to enhance this process using CUDA is to divide the computation into blocks, with each block responsible for computing a sub-matrix of C. This sub-matrix is a part of a tile in the final matrix, which is computed by the block. Each block has multiple threads, and ideally, each thread in the block operates on a single element of the sub-matrix.  The A matrix is read row-wise by threads in a block. Because B is transposed in C = A * B^T, the columns of B must be accessed row-wise. Instead of directly reading B from global memory in a manner that does not align with access patterns conducive to high-bandwidth global memory access, we store tiles of B in shared memory. Each thread in the block would then load a piece of B^T, which corresponds to a row of the original matrix B, into shared memory, enabling fast, localized access for all threads within that block.

Now let's examine some code examples. The first one shows a basic, non-optimized kernel which does not use shared memory, to illustrate common performance pitfalls:

```cuda
__global__ void matrixMulNaive(float *A, float *B, float *C, int m, int n, int k) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < m && col < n) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            sum += A[row * k + i] * B[col * k + i]; // B access transposed implicitly
        }
        C[row * n + col] = sum;
    }
}
```

In this kernel, each thread computes an element of the C matrix. Note that B is accessed as if it was not transposed using the regular matrix indexing. While mathematically correct, this approach leads to very fragmented access patterns to global memory for B, resulting in poor performance. There are no coalesced reads when accessing B since consecutive threads are accessing disparate regions of the global memory. This kernel demonstrates the baseline for which we will compare further optimization attempts. `m`, `n`, and `k` define the dimensions of A (m x k), B (n x k), and C (m x n). The size of A and B is assumed for simplicity to be large enough that they must be in global memory.

Now, let’s look at an improved version that utilizes shared memory to store tiles of A and B, which will resolve the non-coalesced access.

```cuda
__global__ void matrixMulSharedMem(float *A, float *B, float *C, int m, int n, int k) {
    const int blockRow = blockIdx.y;
    const int blockCol = blockIdx.x;
    const int threadRow = threadIdx.y;
    const int threadCol = threadIdx.x;

    const int row = blockRow * blockDim.y + threadRow;
    const int col = blockCol * blockDim.x + threadCol;

    __shared__ float Asub[BLOCK_SIZE][BLOCK_SIZE];
    __shared__ float Bsub[BLOCK_SIZE][BLOCK_SIZE];

    float sum = 0.0f;
    for(int sub = 0; sub < k / BLOCK_SIZE; ++sub) {

        int aRow = row;
        int aCol = sub * BLOCK_SIZE + threadCol;
        int bRow = sub * BLOCK_SIZE + threadRow;
        int bCol = col;

        if(aRow < m && aCol < k)
            Asub[threadRow][threadCol] = A[aRow * k + aCol];
        else
            Asub[threadRow][threadCol] = 0.0f;

         if (bRow < k && bCol < n)
           Bsub[threadRow][threadCol] = B[bCol * k + bRow]; // B accessed as if not transposed
        else
            Bsub[threadRow][threadCol] = 0.0f;

        __syncthreads(); // Ensure all threads have loaded their data

        for (int p = 0; p < BLOCK_SIZE; ++p) {
            sum += Asub[threadRow][p] * Bsub[p][threadCol];
        }

        __syncthreads(); // Ensure all computations on shared memory are complete
    }


   if (row < m && col < n)
        C[row * n + col] = sum;
}
```

This kernel performs block-based matrix multiplication. A tile of A and a tile of B, `BLOCK_SIZE` x `BLOCK_SIZE`, are loaded into shared memory (Asub and Bsub). The crucial performance enhancement is that the B matrix, which is accessed as if not transposed, is accessed in blocks for processing, using a loop over the sub-matrix values of dimension `k`. This local memory facilitates the reuse of data by all threads within the block. Each thread computes part of the result based on the loaded data from A and B.  `__syncthreads()` is used to ensure that all threads within a block have completed loading the shared memory before proceeding with the computation. `BLOCK_SIZE` is a template constant to be passed in at compile time, and should ideally be a multiple of the warp size (typically 32) and should be tuned for specific hardware.

For further performance improvements, loop unrolling and memory alignment can be utilized to increase instruction throughput and memory bandwidth. An example implementation of such concepts is given below.

```cuda
__global__ void matrixMulSharedMemUnrolled(float *A, float *B, float *C, int m, int n, int k) {
    const int blockRow = blockIdx.y;
    const int blockCol = blockIdx.x;
    const int threadRow = threadIdx.y;
    const int threadCol = threadIdx.x;

    const int row = blockRow * blockDim.y + threadRow;
    const int col = blockCol * blockDim.x + threadCol;

    __shared__ float Asub[BLOCK_SIZE][BLOCK_SIZE];
    __shared__ float Bsub[BLOCK_SIZE][BLOCK_SIZE];

    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int sub = 0; sub < k / BLOCK_SIZE; ++sub) {

        int aRow = row;
        int aCol = sub * BLOCK_SIZE + threadCol;
        int bRow = sub * BLOCK_SIZE + threadRow;
        int bCol = col;


        if(aRow < m && aCol < k)
            Asub[threadRow][threadCol] = A[aRow * k + aCol];
        else
            Asub[threadRow][threadCol] = 0.0f;

        if (bRow < k && bCol < n)
            Bsub[threadRow][threadCol] = B[bCol * k + bRow]; // B accessed as if not transposed
        else
            Bsub[threadRow][threadCol] = 0.0f;


        __syncthreads();

        #pragma unroll
        for (int p = 0; p < BLOCK_SIZE; ++p) {
            sum += Asub[threadRow][p] * Bsub[p][threadCol];
        }

        __syncthreads();
    }


    if (row < m && col < n)
        C[row * n + col] = sum;
}
```

The addition of `#pragma unroll` instructs the compiler to unroll the inner loop. This reduces loop overhead and allows for more pipelining of memory access and computation instructions, potentially further increasing throughput. The effectiveness of loop unrolling depends on the specific hardware and the loop size; sometimes, over-unrolling can lead to an increase in register pressure, degrading performance. The primary focus here continues to be using shared memory to avoid the disparate memory access patterns from the naïve version, while we have also implemented more refined low level tuning.

For developers looking to delve deeper, I recommend exploring resources that cover CUDA performance optimization in general, especially those pertaining to memory management, shared memory usage, and thread divergence. Consider examining materials discussing warp-level programming, occupancy considerations, and memory alignment for even further performance tuning. Furthermore, carefully selecting the `BLOCK_SIZE` parameter, and the overall block grid sizes are extremely important and depend on the problem size and underlying hardware. Analyzing the hardware resources for a specific architecture and adjusting the CUDA kernel parameters to match its characteristics will likely lead to further performance benefits, which is crucial when developing real world applications of such methods.
