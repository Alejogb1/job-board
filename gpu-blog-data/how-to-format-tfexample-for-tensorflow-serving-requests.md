The core challenge in formatting `tf.Example` for TensorFlow Serving requests lies in understanding the precise mapping between your serialized protocol buffer and the model's input signature.  I've encountered numerous instances where seemingly correct `tf.Example` instances failed to be processed, stemming from mismatches in feature names, types, and shapes.  The key is rigorous adherence to the model's expected input, which is typically defined during the model's export process.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow Serving expects requests formatted as `PredictRequest` protocol buffers.  Crucially, these requests contain a `inputs` field, which is a map.  The keys of this map correspond to the names of the input tensors defined in your SavedModel's signature. The values are `TensorProto` objects, representing the input data.  To utilize `tf.Example` effectively, you serialize your `tf.Example` instances and embed them as the `TensorProto` value within the `inputs` map of the `PredictRequest`. This serialized `tf.Example` then needs to be parsed within the serving model's input function.

This approach offers several advantages:

* **Flexibility:** You can represent diverse data types (integers, floats, strings) within the `tf.Example`.
* **Structure:** `tf.Example` allows structured data representation, beneficial for models processing multiple features.
* **Efficiency:** Serialization minimizes data transfer overhead.


However, this method necessitates careful handling of:

* **Feature Names:**  The names of features within your `tf.Example` *must* precisely match the input tensor names specified in your SavedModel's signature. A single character mismatch will result in a processing error.
* **Data Types:** The types of features in your `tf.Example` must correspond to the types expected by the input tensors. Implicit type coercion is generally not performed.
* **Shape:** Although often implicitly handled for single-example requests, ensuring your input tensors' shapes are consistent with batching expectations during model deployment is crucial for proper functionality.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Example with Single Feature**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow_serving.apis import predict_pb2

# Assume your model expects an input tensor named 'input_feature' of type float32
# and shape [1] (single value).
model_input_name = "input_feature"

# Create a tf.Example
example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={
    model_input_name: tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=[3.14]))
}))

# Serialize the tf.Example
serialized_example = example.SerializeToString()

# Create a PredictRequest
request = predict_pb2.PredictRequest()
request.model_spec.name = "my_model"  # Replace with your model's name
request.inputs[model_input_name].CopyFrom(tf.make_tensor_proto(serialized_example, shape=[1]))

# Send the request to TensorFlow Serving (not shown here - requires gRPC client)

```

**Commentary:**  This example shows a straightforward mapping. The `tf.Example` contains a single feature with the same name as the model's input tensor. The serialized `tf.Example` is then directly inserted into the `PredictRequest`.  The crucial step is using `tf.make_tensor_proto` to correctly format the serialized bytes as a `TensorProto`.

**Example 2: Multiple Features and Type Handling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow_serving.apis import predict_pb2

model_input_name1 = "feature_a"
model_input_name2 = "feature_b"

example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={
    model_input_name1: tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[10])),
    model_input_name2: tf.train.Feature(bytes_list=tf.train.BytesList(value=[b'some_string']))
}))

serialized_example = example.SerializeToString()

# In a real-world scenario, you'd likely need to manage multiple examples, potentially
# reshaping into a batch.  This is a simplification for demonstrative purposes.

request = predict_pb2.PredictRequest()
request.model_spec.name = "my_model"
request.inputs[model_input_name1].CopyFrom(tf.make_tensor_proto(serialized_example, shape=[1]))
# Note:  The second feature is not included in this request. This example demonstrates the need
# for careful management of input features. Correct handling of feature_b would likely require
# a different input tensor or preprocessing step within the model.

# Send the request to TensorFlow Serving

```

**Commentary:** This showcases handling multiple features with different types (integer and string).  Note that embedding the entire serialized `tf.Example` into a single input tensor is a design decision. Depending on your model's input signature, you may need to parse the `tf.Example` within the model itself and feed individual features into separate tensors.


**Example 3:  Batching Requests**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow_serving.apis import predict_pb2

model_input_name = "input_data" #Assumed to expect shape [None, 1]

examples = [
    tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={model_input_name: tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=[1.0]))})),
    tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={model_input_name: tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=[2.0]))})),
    tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={model_input_name: tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=[3.0]))}))
]

serialized_examples = [example.SerializeToString() for example in examples]

request = predict_pb2.PredictRequest()
request.model_spec.name = "my_model"
request.inputs[model_input_name].CopyFrom(tf.make_tensor_proto(serialized_examples, shape=[3, 1])) # Shape reflects batch size

#Send the request to TensorFlow Serving
```

**Commentary:** This illustrates handling multiple `tf.Example` instances within a single request, leveraging batching for efficiency.  The shape of the `TensorProto` is explicitly set to reflect the batch size. Note that the model's input must explicitly handle batching.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow Serving documentation,  the TensorFlow Protocol Buffer definitions, and  a good understanding of gRPC are indispensable.  Understanding the SavedModel format and its signature definition is also critical.  Thoroughly reviewing the input signature of your exported model before attempting to construct requests is strongly advised.  Finally, a robust testing strategy, incorporating edge cases and error handling, is essential.
