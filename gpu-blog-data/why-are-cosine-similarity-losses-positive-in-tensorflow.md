Cosine similarity, in its standard implementation, doesn't directly produce a *loss*.  It yields a similarity score between -1 and 1, where 1 represents perfect similarity and -1 represents perfect dissimilarity.  The positivity of the loss function observed in TensorFlow 1.15 stems from how cosine similarity is *integrated* into a loss function, not from an inherent property of the similarity measure itself.  My experience working on large-scale recommendation systems using TensorFlow 1.15 exposed this nuance repeatedly.  The perceived "positive" loss arises from the common practice of transforming the cosine similarity into a loss suitable for gradient descent optimization.

The core issue is that maximizing cosine similarity is equivalent to minimizing the negative of cosine similarity.  Thus, a typical approach involves creating a loss function that penalizes low cosine similarity scores.  Several formulations achieve this.  The apparent positivity of the loss is therefore a direct consequence of the design of the loss function, not a bug in TensorFlow 1.15.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow 1.15, while lacking some of the higher-level abstractions of later versions, provides the necessary tools for constructing custom loss functions.  In the context of cosine similarity, the common practice is to frame the problem as a minimization task.  Given two vectors, `a` and `b`, their cosine similarity is defined as:

`CosineSimilarity(a, b) = dot(a, b) / (||a|| * ||b||)`

where `dot(a, b)` is the dot product and `||a||` and `||b||` are the Euclidean norms (magnitudes) of vectors `a` and `b`.  To turn this into a loss, we typically negate the cosine similarity or use a function that penalizes values far from 1. This creates a loss that's always non-negative (or positive if the similarity isn't perfect).  A smaller loss indicates higher similarity.

Therefore, the positivity observed originates from the mathematical manipulation of the cosine similarity metric to fit into the framework of a loss function designed for gradient-based optimization.  A negative cosine similarity, indicating dissimilarity, would translate to a positive loss value, reflecting the distance from perfect similarity.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with three distinct approaches to building a cosine similarity loss in TensorFlow 1.15.

**Example 1:  Simple Negation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def cosine_similarity_loss(a, b):
  """Calculates a loss based on the negative of cosine similarity."""
  a_norm = tf.norm(a, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
  b_norm = tf.norm(b, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
  normalized_a = a / a_norm
  normalized_b = b / b_norm
  similarity = tf.reduce_sum(normalized_a * normalized_b, axis=-1)
  loss = -similarity  # Negation: high similarity means low loss
  return loss

# Example usage
a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
b = tf.constant([[2.0, 1.0], [4.0, 3.0]])
loss = cosine_similarity_loss(a, b)
print(loss) # Output will be a tensor of negative values, resulting in a positive loss after negation
```

This example directly negates the cosine similarity, making a higher similarity score correspond to a lower loss value, which is precisely what a loss function should do.  The `keepdims=True` argument in `tf.norm` ensures that the normalization maintains the same dimensionality, allowing for element-wise multiplication.


**Example 2:  Using 1 - Cosine Similarity:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def cosine_similarity_loss_v2(a, b):
  """Calculates loss as 1 - cosine similarity."""
  a_norm = tf.norm(a, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
  b_norm = tf.norm(b, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
  normalized_a = a / a_norm
  normalized_b = b / b_norm
  similarity = tf.reduce_sum(normalized_a * normalized_b, axis=-1)
  loss = 1.0 - similarity # 1 - similarity; ranges from 0 to 2
  return loss

# Example usage
a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
b = tf.constant([[2.0, 1.0], [4.0, 3.0]])
loss = cosine_similarity_loss_v2(a, b)
print(loss) # Output will be a tensor of positive values.
```

This approach uses the difference between the maximum possible similarity (1) and the actual similarity.  The resulting loss is always non-negative, directly representing the deviation from perfect similarity. This is often preferred for its interpretability.


**Example 3:  Squared Difference:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def cosine_similarity_loss_v3(a, b):
  """Calculates loss as the squared difference from 1."""
  a_norm = tf.norm(a, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
  b_norm = tf.norm(b, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
  normalized_a = a / a_norm
  normalized_b = b / b_norm
  similarity = tf.reduce_sum(normalized_a * normalized_b, axis=-1)
  loss = tf.square(1.0 - similarity) # Squared difference; emphasizes larger deviations
  return loss

# Example usage
a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
b = tf.constant([[2.0, 1.0], [4.0, 3.0]])
loss = cosine_similarity_loss_v3(a, b)
print(loss) # Output will be a tensor of positive values.
```

This method squares the difference, amplifying the penalty for lower cosine similarity scores. This can be beneficial when larger deviations need to be penalized more heavily.  It also ensures the gradient remains non-zero even when the similarity approaches 1.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of loss functions and optimization in TensorFlow, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation (specifically the sections on custom loss functions and gradient descent).  A comprehensive textbook on machine learning or deep learning would also provide valuable background on optimization algorithms and their application.  Finally, exploring research papers on contrastive learning, a field heavily reliant on cosine similarity, would illuminate advanced techniques and their associated loss functions.
