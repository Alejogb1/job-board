Docker containers disappearing silently upon system startup points to a fundamental misunderstanding of Docker's daemon behavior and container lifecycle management.  The issue isn't about containers being *silently* removed, but rather about them failing to start or being explicitly removed by the system due to configuration or resource limitations.  My experience debugging similar issues in high-availability production environments has highlighted three primary causes: insufficient resource allocation, incorrect startup configuration, and automated container cleanup mechanisms.

**1. Resource Exhaustion:**  This is the most common reason.  If the system lacks sufficient memory, CPU, or disk I/O, Docker might fail to start containers without explicitly reporting the error. This often manifests as seemingly "silent removal" because the container never reaches a running state visible in `docker ps`.  Docker's daemon logs, however, will contain critical information revealing resource constraints. I've personally witnessed instances where a surge in network traffic overwhelmed a server's resources, causing Docker to silently fail to start numerous containersâ€”a scenario masked until I examined the daemon logs.


**2. Incorrect Startup Configuration:** Docker containers require a correctly configured startup mechanism. If the command executing the container is incorrect, the container will fail to launch. Similarly, issues with the Dockerfile (e.g., missing dependencies, flawed ENTRYPOINT) can lead to silent failures.  The system may not register the container as 'running', effectively hiding it from basic `docker ps` queries.  This can be easily overlooked if one solely relies on visual inspection of running containers instead of thorough logging analysis.


**3. Automated Container Cleanup:** Docker offers various mechanisms for automated container cleanup, such as Docker's built-in prune functions or external orchestration tools.  These tools might automatically remove containers that haven't run for a specified duration, or those exhibiting errors.  While this is a beneficial feature for managing container sprawl, it can lead to the appearance of "silent removal" if the automated cleanup rules are improperly configured or if a container fails before it's fully registered with the monitoring system.  In one specific project, involving a large-scale microservices architecture, a misconfiguration in our Kubernetes cluster's resource limits inadvertently triggered automated container cleanup, resulting in intermittent service outages.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Resource Exhaustion Scenario (Illustrative Shell Script):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Simulate resource exhaustion by consuming memory
while true; do
  dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/memory_hog bs=1M count=1024 &
done

# Attempt to start a container (likely to fail due to memory pressure)
docker run -d --name my_container busybox sh -c "sleep 1000"

# Check container status (likely not running)
docker ps
```

This script illustrates how consuming substantial system memory can prevent Docker from starting new containers.  The `docker ps` command will likely show an empty list or only containers already running before the script initiated memory consumption.  Checking the system's memory usage (`free -h`) would reveal the root cause.  Moreover, the Docker daemon logs will contain entries related to the failure.


**Example 2: Incorrect Startup Configuration (Dockerfile):**

```dockerfile
# Incorrect Dockerfile: Missing ENTRYPOINT

FROM busybox

# No ENTRYPOINT defined, container will not start properly
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh

# ... other instructions
```

```bash
# entrypoint.sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello from container"
```

This Dockerfile lacks an `ENTRYPOINT`.  While the `entrypoint.sh` script exists, the container won't automatically execute it upon startup.  The container will either appear stopped or create no output, making it seem as though it has been silently removed.  Correcting this requires defining a proper `ENTRYPOINT` in the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox

ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]

COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
```


**Example 3:  Automated Container Cleanup (Docker Compose with prune command):**

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  my_app:
    image: my-app-image:latest
    restart: always
```

```bash
docker-compose up -d
# ... some time passes ...
docker compose down --remove-orphans
docker system prune -a  # Aggressive cleanup, removes all stopped containers
docker ps  # Check for the existence of my_app container
```

This example demonstrates how using `docker system prune -a` aggressively removes all stopped containers, which could include containers that failed to start.  The `restart: always` directive in the Docker Compose file means Docker would try to restart `my_app` but a fundamental issue could result in repeated failures followed by automatic removal through `prune`.   A more nuanced approach might involve analyzing the logs before issuing such a command to prevent unintended container removal.  Alternatively, a less aggressive cleanup strategy (e.g., specifying filter options with `docker container prune`) could prevent accidental removal of containers which simply failed to initialize.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For comprehensive understanding of Docker, I recommend consulting the official Docker documentation.  The documentation offers extensive information on the daemon's behavior, container lifecycle management, logging mechanisms, and automated cleanup features.  Furthermore, a deep understanding of system administration practices, especially pertaining to resource monitoring and process management, is crucial for troubleshooting this type of issue. Finally, exploring the documentation for any container orchestration tools (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) that are in use is critical if containers are managed through an orchestrator.  These tools frequently have their own logging and cleanup procedures that can influence the behaviour of the Docker daemon.
