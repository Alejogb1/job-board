TensorFlow's failure to utilize a GPU often stems from misconfigurations within the TensorFlow environment, driver issues, or incorrect hardware setup.  In my experience debugging high-performance computing applications, I've encountered this problem numerous times, and the solution rarely involves reinstalling TensorFlow itself.  Instead, a systematic investigation of the environment's configuration is key.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

The core problem lies in TensorFlow's dependency on CUDA and cuDNN libraries.  CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model. cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) provides highly optimized routines for deep learning operations.  If TensorFlow cannot locate, access, or properly link these libraries, GPU acceleration will not function.  This can manifest in various ways:  slow training times indistinguishable from CPU-only performance, error messages related to CUDA, or a complete lack of GPU usage indicated by system monitors (e.g., `nvidia-smi`).

Beyond library issues, the TensorFlow installation itself might be problematic.  A common pitfall involves conflicting installations of Python, CUDA toolkits, or cuDNN versions. Python virtual environments are essential for managing dependencies and preventing these conflicts.  Using a dedicated virtual environment for TensorFlow projects isolates the TensorFlow installation and its specific dependencies from other Python projects, guaranteeing predictable behavior.

Furthermore, the problem might reside in the TensorFlow code itself. Explicitly setting the device to use the GPU is crucial.  If the code omits device placement directives, TensorFlow will default to the CPU. This omission is frequently overlooked by novice users, leading to performance bottlenecks.

Finally, hardware limitations must be considered. The GPU might not be correctly installed, the drivers might be outdated or corrupted, or the GPU's memory capacity might be insufficient for the task. The latter is particularly pertinent when working with large models or datasets.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Verifying GPU Availability**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```

This concise snippet checks the number of available GPUs.  If the output is 0, it suggests a fundamental problem with GPU detection.  This should be the first step in the diagnostic process.  I've personally used this code countless times to quickly rule out hardware accessibility issues.  Confirming GPU availability ensures that the problem isn't a simple matter of TensorFlow not seeing the available hardware.  Remember to ensure your CUDA drivers are properly installed and working before running this code.  A non-zero output here doesn't guarantee GPU usage; it merely confirms that TensorFlow can detect it.


**Example 2:  Explicit GPU Device Placement**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check for GPU availability
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  try:
    # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
    for gpu in gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
    logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print(len(logical_gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
  except RuntimeError as e:
    # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
    print(e)

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])

# Explicitly place the model on the GPU
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):  # Or '/GPU:1' for the second GPU, and so on.
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates explicit device placement.  The `with tf.device('/GPU:0'):` block forces the model compilation and training to occur on the first available GPU.  The crucial aspect here is the `/GPU:0` specification.  Omitting this often results in CPU-only execution, even if TensorFlow detects the GPU.  The inclusion of memory growth management is vital for avoiding out-of-memory errors, especially with larger models and datasets. This is a technique I've relied on extensively to ensure efficient memory utilization on the GPU.

Furthermore,  `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` provides a robust way to detect available GPUs and handle cases where no GPU is found, preventing runtime errors.  The error handling ensures graceful degradation if a GPU isn't available.


**Example 3:  Using tf.distribute.Strategy for Multi-GPU Support**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy() # For multiple GPUs

with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

For multi-GPU setups, `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` is essential.  This strategy replicates the model across available GPUs, distributing the workload and accelerating training significantly.  Using this approach allows efficient parallelization over multiple GPUs. This is a more advanced technique, but crucial for leveraging the full potential of multiple GPUs.  In large-scale projects, I would almost always employ this method for maximum performance.  Remember to ensure that the GPUs are correctly configured in the system and that the necessary communication infrastructure (e.g., NVLink) is in place.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation;  the CUDA toolkit documentation; the cuDNN documentation; a comprehensive guide to Python virtual environments; and a book on advanced TensorFlow techniques.  Thoroughly understanding these resources will equip you to diagnose and resolve GPU utilization issues effectively.  Pay close attention to the sections on installation procedures, environment variables, and device placement.  Understanding these foundational concepts is critical.  Consult NVIDIA's documentation for detailed guidance on GPU hardware configuration and driver management.  The information provided in these resources is far more extensive and detailed than what can be contained in this response.
