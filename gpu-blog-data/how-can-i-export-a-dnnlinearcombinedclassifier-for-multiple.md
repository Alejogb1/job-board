The core challenge in exporting a `DNNLinearCombinedClassifier` for multiple serving functions lies in the inherent structure of the model and the diverse requirements of different serving environments.  My experience working on large-scale recommendation systems at a major e-commerce platform highlighted this issue;  a single, monolithic export wasn't sufficiently flexible for our real-time inference, batch prediction, and mobile application needs.  The solution necessitates a modular approach to export and subsequently import the model components, tailored to each specific deployment scenario.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A `DNNLinearCombinedClassifier` in TensorFlow (assuming TensorFlow 1.x, given the age of the question's implied context) combines a deep neural network (DNN) with a linear model.  This architecture allows for incorporating both high-level non-linear features learned by the DNN and low-level linear features, often beneficial for interpretability and handling sparse data.  However, directly exporting the entire model as a single unit for diverse serving applications often proves inefficient and inflexible.  Different serving environments (e.g., TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Lite, custom solutions) have specific input/output format requirements and performance optimizations.  A more robust strategy involves exporting the DNN and linear components separately, then reconstructing them in the target environment based on the specific requirements.  This modularity permits:

* **Optimized inference:**  Each serving function can utilize a tailored inference graph, optimized for its specific hardware and latency constraints.  For example, a mobile application benefits from a quantized model, whereas a cloud-based service might prioritize throughput.
* **Flexibility in feature engineering:**  The separation facilitates modification of pre-processing steps without retraining the entire model. Changes in feature engineering only require updating the pre-processing pipeline in the target environment, leaving the core DNN and linear model weights untouched.
* **Independent updates:**  The independent export allows for updating individual components (e.g., retraining only the DNN) without affecting other serving functions. This significantly improves the agility of model maintenance and deployment.

The process involves:

a)  Exporting the weights and biases of the DNN and linear components individually using TensorFlow's `Saver` class.

b)  Saving the model architecture definition separately, either as a text file or using a configuration management system.

c)  Reconstructing the model in each serving environment by loading the saved weights/biases and instantiating the appropriate model architecture using the saved definition.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Exporting DNN and Linear Components (TensorFlow 1.x)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Assume model definition: dnn_model, linear_model, combined_model) ...

saver_dnn = tf.train.Saver(var_list=tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES, scope='dnn'))
saver_linear = tf.train.Saver(var_list=tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES, scope='linear'))

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    # ... (Assume model training and evaluation) ...
    saver_dnn.save(sess, 'dnn_model.ckpt')
    saver_linear.save(sess, 'linear_model.ckpt')
```

This code snippet demonstrates saving the DNN and linear model parameters independently.  The `tf.get_collection` method is crucial for targeting specific variables within the model's scope.  This precision ensures that only the necessary weights and biases are saved, preventing unintended conflicts or bloat in the exported files.  Crucially, the scope names ('dnn' and 'linear') must be consistent with the model definition.


**Example 2:  Reconstructing the Model in TensorFlow Serving**

This example requires a `saved_model` representation, which TensorFlow Serving expects.  The below snippet, while not exhaustive, showcases the essential principles.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load architecture definition (from a file or config)
# ... (Load architecture details defining layers, etc.) ...

# Load saved weights
dnn_saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('dnn_model.ckpt.meta')
linear_saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('linear_model.ckpt.meta')

with tf.Session() as sess:
    dnn_saver.restore(sess, 'dnn_model.ckpt')
    linear_saver.restore(sess, 'linear_model.ckpt')

    # Reconstruct the combined model using loaded weights and architecture definition
    # ... (Recreate the combined model using tf.layers or equivalent) ...

    # Export as a SavedModel
    tf.saved_model.simple_save(
        sess,
        'exported_model',
        inputs={'input_features': tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, num_features])},
        outputs={'predictions': combined_model.predictions}
    )

```

Note that this example necessitates careful reconstruction of the model's architecture based on the previously saved definition.  This step is environment-specific, requiring adaptation to the respective serving framework.


**Example 3:  Simplified Inference with NumPy (for a custom environment)**

For less demanding environments, a lightweight approach using NumPy can suffice.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Load weights from 'dnn_model.ckpt' and 'linear_model.ckpt' using np.load) ...
dnn_weights = np.load('dnn_weights.npy')
linear_weights = np.load('linear_weights.npy')

def predict(input_features):
    # ... (Perform inference using NumPy operations with loaded weights) ...
    dnn_output = perform_dnn_inference(input_features, dnn_weights) # Custom function
    linear_output = perform_linear_inference(input_features, linear_weights) # Custom function
    combined_output = combine_outputs(dnn_output, linear_output) # Custom function
    return combined_output
```

This method relies on custom functions to implement the DNN and linear computations directly using NumPy.  It's crucial to meticulously recreate the original model's calculations in the NumPy functions. This approach sacrifices the benefits of TensorFlow's optimization but offers greater deployment simplicity in constrained environments.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation on model saving and restoration.
*   Comprehensive tutorials on TensorFlow Serving and TensorFlow Lite.
*   A thorough understanding of TensorFlow's graph construction and variable management is critical.
*   Relevant literature on model deployment and optimization strategies for machine learning.


This modular approach, combining independent component export with environment-specific reconstruction, offers a robust solution to deploying a `DNNLinearCombinedClassifier` across multiple serving functions, maximizing flexibility and efficiency.  The choice of implementation will depend on the specific requirements of the serving environments and the acceptable level of complexity. Remember to always thoroughly test the deployed model to ensure accuracy and performance.
