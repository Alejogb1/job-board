TensorFlow's core strength lies in numerical computation, particularly within the context of large-scale machine learning.  Directly "finding functions" in the mathematical sense – symbolically discovering an unknown function from data – isn't TensorFlow's primary design.  However, TensorFlow provides powerful tools for approximating unknown functions using data-driven approaches, primarily through function approximation with neural networks.  My experience in developing physics simulation software leveraging TensorFlow reinforced this understanding; accurately modeling complex, non-linear interactions required precisely this capability.

The process hinges on framing the problem as a supervised learning task. We assume we have a dataset consisting of input values and corresponding output values, representing points on the unknown function.  The goal becomes training a neural network to learn a mapping that closely approximates this function within the observed input range.  Extrapolation beyond this range is inherently risky and requires careful consideration of the model's generalization capabilities.

The choice of neural network architecture depends significantly on the nature of the function.  For relatively smooth, continuous functions, simpler architectures like multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) often suffice.  For functions exhibiting more complex behaviors, including discontinuities or high-frequency oscillations, more sophisticated architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) may be more appropriate.  My work on simulating fluid dynamics benefitted greatly from the application of CNNs, successfully capturing intricate spatial dependencies.

**1.  Approximating a Simple Polynomial using a Multilayer Perceptron:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data for a quadratic polynomial
X = np.linspace(-1, 1, 100)
y = 2*X**2 + X - 1 + 0.1*np.random.randn(100) #Adding some noise

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
loss = model.evaluate(X, y, verbose=0)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {loss}")

# Predict on new data
X_test = np.linspace(-1, 1, 200)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

This example utilizes a simple MLP to approximate a quadratic polynomial. The `relu` activation function introduces non-linearity, enabling the network to learn the quadratic relationship.  The mean squared error (MSE) loss function measures the difference between the network's predictions and the actual values.  Increasing the number of neurons or layers can improve the approximation, but also risks overfitting.  Regularization techniques, like dropout or L2 regularization, can mitigate this risk.  In my experience, careful hyperparameter tuning was crucial for optimal performance.


**2.  Approximating a Periodic Function using a Recurrent Neural Network:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data for a sinusoidal function
X = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(X) + 0.1*np.random.randn(100)

# Reshape data for time series processing
X = X.reshape(-1,1,1)
y = y.reshape(-1,1)

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(1,1), return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(32),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])


# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)


# Evaluate the model
loss = model.evaluate(X, y, verbose=0)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {loss}")

# Predict on new data
X_test = np.linspace(0, 10, 200).reshape(-1,1,1)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

```

This example leverages an LSTM network, a type of RNN, which is particularly well-suited for capturing temporal dependencies.  The sinusoidal function's periodicity is a form of temporal dependency.  The input data is reshaped to reflect the sequential nature of the time series.  While an MLP could potentially approximate this function, the RNN architecture is generally more efficient for functions with inherent temporal or sequential characteristics.  This was particularly relevant in my work on time series forecasting of solar irradiance.

**3.  Approximating an Image-Based Function using a Convolutional Neural Network:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic image data (replace with your actual data)
X = np.random.rand(100, 32, 32, 3) # 100 images, 32x32 pixels, 3 color channels
y = np.random.rand(100, 1) # Corresponding output values

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
loss = model.evaluate(X, y, verbose=0)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {loss}")

# Predict on new data
X_test = np.random.rand(20, 32, 32, 3)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

This example demonstrates the use of a CNN for approximating a function that takes an image as input. CNNs are adept at extracting features from images, making them ideal for image-based function approximation.  The convolutional and max-pooling layers extract relevant features, while the dense layer performs the final mapping to the output.  Replace the placeholder data generation with your specific image data and corresponding outputs.  My experience with object detection problems highlighted the power of CNNs in this context.
