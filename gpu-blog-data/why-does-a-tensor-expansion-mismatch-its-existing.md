Tensor expansion mismatches arise primarily from a fundamental misunderstanding of broadcasting semantics within the chosen deep learning framework.  Over the years, while working on large-scale natural language processing projects and collaborating on various research initiatives at the Allen Institute for AI, I've encountered this issue countless times.  The core problem isn't about a tensor's inherent size changing; instead, it stems from an incongruence between the intended operation and the framework's rules for implicit size adjustments during element-wise or matrix operations.  Implicit broadcasting, while convenient, is often the source of subtle, difficult-to-debug errors.

**1. A Clear Explanation of Tensor Expansion Mismatches:**

Tensor expansion, or broadcasting, is a mechanism designed to streamline operations between tensors of differing shapes.  Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch automatically attempt to "stretch" smaller tensors to match the dimensions of a larger tensor before performing the operation.  This is particularly useful when applying a scalar (a 0-dimensional tensor) to a larger tensor or when performing element-wise operations between tensors with compatible dimensions.  However, this "stretching" is governed by specific rules.  If these rules are not satisfied, the framework throws an error, indicating a tensor expansion mismatch.  This typically occurs when:

* **Incompatible Dimensions:** Broadcasting only works if the dimensions of the tensors are either equal or one of them is 1.  For example, a tensor of shape (3, 4) can be broadcasted with a tensor of shape (1, 4) or (3, 1) but not with (2, 5). The framework attempts to "expand" the dimension of size 1 to match the corresponding dimension of the other tensor.

* **Dimension Mismatch:** Broadcasting implicitly adds dimensions of size 1 at the beginning of a tensor's shape.  Therefore, a tensor of shape (4,) can be treated as (1, 4) depending on the operation.  Inconsistencies in how implicitly added dimensions interact can lead to expansion mismatches.  This is particularly tricky when working with tensors of varying dimensionality.

* **Incorrect use of broadcasting in advanced operations:** Broadcasting is intended for element-wise operations and certain matrix multiplications. For operations like convolutions, there are specific rules in place, and an incorrect understanding of the interactions between tensor shape and kernel/filter sizes will lead to expansion mismatch errors.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with examples using PyTorch, a framework I frequently employ due to its flexibility and ease of use with GPU acceleration.

**Example 1: Successful Broadcasting**

```python
import torch

tensor_a = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # Shape: (2, 2)
tensor_b = torch.tensor([10, 20])          # Shape: (2,)  Broadcasts to (1,2) then (2,2)

result = tensor_a + tensor_b
print(result)
# Output:
# tensor([[11, 22],
#         [13, 24]])
```

In this example, `tensor_b`, initially of shape (2,), is successfully broadcasted to (2, 2) before addition.  PyTorch implicitly adds a dimension of size 1 at the beginning of `tensor_b`'s shape, making it (1, 2), then expands it to match the dimensions of `tensor_a`.  The addition then proceeds element-wise.

**Example 2: Unsuccessful Broadcasting – Dimension Mismatch**

```python
import torch

tensor_a = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # Shape: (2, 2)
tensor_b = torch.tensor([[10, 20, 30]])     # Shape: (1, 3)

try:
    result = tensor_a + tensor_b
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
# Output:
# Error: The size of tensor a (2) must match the size of tensor b (3) at non-singleton dimension 1
```

Here, `tensor_a` has shape (2, 2), and `tensor_b` has shape (1, 3).  The second dimension (2 and 3) are unequal, preventing successful broadcasting. PyTorch identifies this incompatibility and raises a `RuntimeError`.

**Example 3:  Unsuccessful Broadcasting – Inconsistent Implicit Dimension Addition**

```python
import torch

tensor_a = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])  # Shape: (3,) Treated as (3,)
tensor_b = torch.tensor([[10], [20], [30]])  # Shape: (3, 1)

try:
    result = tensor_a * tensor_b
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
# Output:  The error message may vary slightly depending on the PyTorch version, but it will indicate a shape mismatch.  A common message is related to broadcasting dimensions.
```

This example demonstrates how implicit dimension addition can be a source of errors.  While one might expect broadcasting to work (treating `tensor_a` as (1,3) and `tensor_b` as (3,1)), the multiplication operation here requires a specific alignment of dimensions which does not naturally occur through standard broadcasting rules. This results in an error because the dimensions are not compatible.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, etc.) is crucial.  Thoroughly understand the sections pertaining to tensor operations, broadcasting rules, and shape manipulation functions.  Consult advanced texts on linear algebra and matrix operations; a solid grasp of these mathematical concepts is essential for understanding and resolving tensor shape issues.  Furthermore, I would recommend studying the implementation details of several tensor manipulation functions. Understanding how dimensions are handled internally provides a deeper understanding of potential pitfalls.  The key is to be explicit and avoid relying solely on implicit broadcasting where possible; this increases the code's readability and reduces the chances of encountering this common error.
