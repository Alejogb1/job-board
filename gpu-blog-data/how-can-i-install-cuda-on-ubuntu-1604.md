CUDA installation on Ubuntu 16.04 requires careful consideration of several interdependent factors, primarily the precise NVIDIA driver version compatibility with your specific GPU and the targeted CUDA Toolkit version.  My experience troubleshooting this on numerous projects, ranging from high-throughput computing simulations to deep learning model training, highlights the critical need for meticulous version matching.  A mismatch can lead to instability, application crashes, or, at best, significantly degraded performance.


**1.  System Verification and Preparation:**

Before initiating the CUDA installation, I always begin by verifying the system’s hardware and software configurations. The first step involves identifying the exact NVIDIA GPU model installed using the `lspci -nnk | grep -i nvidia` command. This provides crucial information for selecting the appropriate driver. Subsequently, I verify the current kernel version using `uname -r`.  This is important because driver compatibility is often kernel-specific.  It’s prudent to update the system’s package repository using `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` to ensure a clean and up-to-date base. Removing any pre-existing NVIDIA drivers or CUDA installations is crucial, using commands like `sudo apt-get purge nvidia-*`  and deleting any CUDA-related directories in `/usr/local`.  This eliminates potential conflicts.


**2. NVIDIA Driver Installation:**

The NVIDIA driver is the foundational component.  Determining the correct driver version requires checking the NVIDIA website for the specific GPU model identified earlier. Downloading the `.run` installer is the standard approach.   It's crucial to note that running the installer as root is essential (`sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-470.103.01.run`, replacing with the actual filename).  The installer provides options for configuring the X server; I recommend carefully reviewing these, opting for a clean install and avoiding any conflicts with pre-existing configurations.  A successful installation is typically confirmed through the `nvidia-smi` command, which displays GPU information and driver version. Post-installation, rebooting the system ensures the changes take effect.


**3. CUDA Toolkit Installation:**

Once the NVIDIA driver is successfully installed and verified, the CUDA Toolkit can be installed.  Again, compatibility is key. The CUDA Toolkit version must be compatible with both the NVIDIA driver and the target applications.  The official NVIDIA website provides the necessary download links for the appropriate CUDA Toolkit version for Ubuntu 16.04.  I prefer to download the `.deb` packages for a more system-integrated installation. After downloading, I use `dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604-11-8-local_11.8.0-460_amd64.deb` (adjusting the filename according to the downloaded package), followed by `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get install cuda`. This installs the base CUDA Toolkit components.  Depending on the specific application needs, additional CUDA libraries and tools can be installed selectively. For example, the cuDNN library, vital for deep learning frameworks, requires a separate download and installation.


**4.  Verification and Example Code:**

After the CUDA Toolkit installation, verification is critical.  This involves compiling and running simple CUDA programs to ensure everything functions correctly.  The `nvcc` compiler, part of the CUDA Toolkit, is used for compilation.


**Code Example 1:  Basic Kernel Execution**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void addKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  int *a, *b, *c;
  int *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

  // Allocate host memory
  a = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  b = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  c = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

  // Initialize host memory
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    a[i] = i;
    b[i] = i * 2;
  }

  // Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, n * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, n * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, n * sizeof(int));

  // Copy data from host to device
  cudaMemcpy(d_a, a, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_b, b, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // Launch kernel
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  addKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

  // Copy data from device to host
  cudaMemcpy(c, d_c, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // Verify results
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (c[i] != a[i] + b[i]) {
      printf("Error: c[%d] = %d, expected %d\n", i, c[i], a[i] + b[i]);
      return 1;
    }
  }

  // Free memory
  free(a);
  free(b);
  free(c);
  cudaFree(d_a);
  cudaFree(d_b);
  cudaFree(d_c);

  printf("Success!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates basic CUDA kernel execution, involving memory allocation on both host and device, data transfer, kernel launch, and result verification.  Compilation is done using `nvcc addKernel.cu -o addKernel`.  Successful execution confirms CUDA functionality.


**Code Example 2:  Using CUDA Libraries (cuBLAS)**

```cpp
#include <cublas_v2.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  cublasHandle_t handle;
  cublasCreate(&handle);

  int n = 1024;
  float *a, *b, *c;
  float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

  // Allocate host memory
  a = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
  b = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
  c = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

  // Initialize host memory (example values)
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    a[i] = i;
    b[i] = i * 2;
  }

  // Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, n * sizeof(float));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, n * sizeof(float));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, n * sizeof(float));

  // Copy data from host to device
  cudaMemcpy(d_a, a, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_b, b, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


  // Perform vector addition using cuBLAS
  cublasSaxpy(handle, n, &1.0f, d_a, 1, d_c, 1);

  // Copy data from device to host
  cudaMemcpy(c, d_c, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // Verification (simplified for brevity)
    // ... (Verification logic similar to Example 1)

  // Free resources
  free(a); free(b); free(c);
  cudaFree(d_a); cudaFree(d_b); cudaFree(d_c);
  cublasDestroy(handle);

  printf("cuBLAS vector addition complete.\n");
  return 0;
}
```

This example utilizes the cuBLAS library for vector addition, showcasing the utilization of higher-level CUDA libraries for optimized linear algebra operations.  Compilation involves linking with the cuBLAS library: `nvcc cublasExample.cu -o cublasExample -lcublas`.


**Code Example 3:  Simple CUDA Program with Error Handling**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: No CUDA devices found.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    int device;
    cudaGetDevice(&device);
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device);
    printf("Using device: %s\n", prop.name);


    // ... (rest of the CUDA code, similar to Example 1 but with error checks after every CUDA API call) ...

    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This demonstrates incorporating comprehensive error handling using `cudaGetLastError()` and `cudaGetErrorString()` for robust debugging.


**5. Resource Recommendations:**

For further information, I recommend consulting the official NVIDIA CUDA documentation, the CUDA Programming Guide, and the cuBLAS documentation.  Exploring sample code provided within the CUDA Toolkit installation is also highly beneficial.  Furthermore, familiarizing oneself with parallel programming concepts and CUDA's execution model is vital for effective CUDA development.  Finally, mastering debugging techniques for CUDA programs, particularly utilizing NVIDIA's debugging tools, is essential for resolving issues efficiently.
