The core challenge in performing arbitrary tensor transformations with Eigen lies in efficiently leveraging its optimized linear algebra routines while managing the inherent multi-dimensionality of tensor data.  My experience working on high-performance computational fluid dynamics simulations highlighted this, particularly when dealing with fourth-order tensors representing stress and strain.  Directly applying Eigen's matrix operations to higher-order tensors is inefficient and often requires restructuring the data into a matrix representation, which can be memory-intensive and computationally costly for large tensors.  A more effective approach involves exploiting Eigen's expressiveness to perform element-wise operations and contractions efficiently.

The optimal strategy hinges on understanding the specific transformation.  Is it a linear transformation?  A rank-one update?  Does it involve contractions?  This dictates the choice of Eigen components and data structures. For clarity, I'll assume we're dealing with a general linear transformation on a tensor, which can be readily adapted to other scenarios.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

We'll represent the tensor as a multi-dimensional array.  Eigen offers the `Eigen::Tensor` class which provides a flexible framework for handling multi-dimensional arrays.  However, for performance reasons, I've found that for many transformations,  reshaping the tensor into a matrix (or a series of matrices) and then applying Eigen's optimized matrix operations is significantly faster. The key here is intelligent reshaping which minimizes data movement and maximizes the utilization of Eigen's highly optimized BLAS and LAPACK backends. This strategy allows us to leverage Eigen's strengths in matrix multiplication and other linear algebra operations.  The reshaping process will depend on the specific tensor dimensions and the transformation being applied.  After the transformation is performed on the reshaped matrix representation, the result is then reshaped back into the original tensor structure.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Linear Transformation of a 3rd-Order Tensor**

This example demonstrates a linear transformation of a 3rd-order tensor using matrix multiplication after reshaping.

```cpp
#include <Eigen/Dense>
#include <Eigen/Core>

int main() {
  // Define the 3rd-order tensor (3x3x3)
  Eigen::Tensor<double, 3> tensor3D(3, 3, 3);
  tensor3D.setRandom();

  // Define the transformation matrix (27x27, as we are reshaping the 3x3x3 tensor into a 27x1 vector)
  Eigen::MatrixXd transformationMatrix(27, 27);
  transformationMatrix.setRandom();


  // Reshape the tensor into a column vector
  Eigen::Map<Eigen::VectorXd> tensorVec(tensor3D.data(), tensor3D.size());

  // Perform the matrix-vector multiplication
  Eigen::VectorXd transformedVec = transformationMatrix * tensorVec;

  // Reshape the transformed vector back into a 3rd-order tensor
  Eigen::Tensor<double, 3> transformedTensor(3, 3, 3);
  Eigen::Map<Eigen::Tensor<double, 3>>(transformedTensor.data(), 3, 3, 3) = transformedVec.reshaped(3,3,3);


  return 0;
}
```

This code first reshapes the 3x3x3 tensor into a 27x1 vector. Then, it performs a matrix multiplication with a 27x27 transformation matrix.  Finally, it reshapes the resulting vector back to a 3x3x3 tensor. The use of `Eigen::Map` avoids unnecessary data copies, enhancing efficiency.  This approach is particularly beneficial for large tensors.

**Example 2:  Contraction of a 4th-Order Tensor**

This example illustrates a tensor contraction, a common operation in physics and engineering. We'll contract a 4th-order tensor with a 2nd-order tensor.

```cpp
#include <Eigen/Dense>
#include <Eigen/Core>

int main() {
  // Define the 4th-order tensor (3x3x3x3)
  Eigen::Tensor<double, 4> tensor4D(3, 3, 3, 3);
  tensor4D.setRandom();

  // Define the 2nd-order tensor (3x3)
  Eigen::Matrix3d tensor2D;
  tensor2D.setRandom();

  // Perform the contraction (e.g., summing over the second and third indices)

  Eigen::Tensor<double, 2> contractedTensor(3,3);
  for(int i = 0; i < 3; ++i){
    for(int j = 0; j < 3; ++j){
      double sum = 0;
      for(int k = 0; k < 3; ++k){
        for(int l = 0; l < 3; ++l){
          sum += tensor4D(i,k,l,j) * tensor2D(k,l);
        }
      }
      contractedTensor(i,j) = sum;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

While this example uses explicit loops for clarity, for larger tensors, optimizing this with Eigen's array operations (e.g., using `Eigen::Tensor::contract`) or reshaping into matrices can offer significant performance improvements.

**Example 3:  Element-wise Operation on a 2nd-Order Tensor**

This example showcases an element-wise operation, a simpler case often used as a building block for more complex transformations.

```cpp
#include <Eigen/Dense>

int main() {
  // Define the 2nd-order tensor (matrix)
  Eigen::MatrixXd matrix(3, 3);
  matrix.setRandom();

  // Perform an element-wise square operation
  Eigen::MatrixXd squaredMatrix = matrix.array().square();


  return 0;
}
```

Eigen's `array()` method allows for efficient element-wise operations, avoiding the overhead of matrix multiplication when unnecessary.  This is fundamental for many tensor manipulations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Eigen documentation itself is invaluable.  Thoroughly understanding the `Tensor` class,  `Array` operations, and efficient ways to perform reshaping is crucial.  Furthermore, studying optimized linear algebra algorithms and their implementation within Eigen will provide deeper insights into performance tuning.  A strong grasp of linear algebra fundamentals is also a prerequisite.  Consider exploring books focused on numerical linear algebra and high-performance computing.  Familiarity with BLAS and LAPACK principles will enhance your understanding of Eigen's underlying mechanisms.
