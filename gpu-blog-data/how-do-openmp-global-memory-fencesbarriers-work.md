OpenMP's global memory fences, or barriers, enforce synchronization points within parallel regions.  My experience optimizing large-scale computational fluid dynamics simulations highlighted their crucial role in maintaining data consistency across multiple threads.  A critical understanding lies in differentiating between implicit and explicit barriers, and how they interact with the underlying memory model.

**1.  Explanation:**

OpenMP's parallel execution model relies on threads operating concurrently.  Without synchronization mechanisms, race conditions—where multiple threads access and modify shared memory concurrently, leading to unpredictable results—become prevalent.  Global memory fences address this by ensuring all threads reach a specific point in the code *before* any thread proceeds.  This guarantees that all memory modifications performed before the barrier are visible to all threads after crossing it.

OpenMP provides implicit and explicit barriers. Implicit barriers are automatically inserted at the end of parallel regions defined by constructs like `#pragma omp parallel for`.  This ensures that all threads within the parallel `for` loop complete their iterations before the program proceeds beyond the region. This simplifies programming but can be inefficient if fine-grained synchronization is unnecessary.

Explicit barriers, using the `#pragma omp barrier` directive, provide more granular control.  They can be placed at any point within a parallel region, forcing synchronization at that exact location.  This allows for optimizing parallel sections where data dependencies exist within the parallel execution.  Incorrectly placed explicit barriers, however, can introduce significant performance bottlenecks by forcing unnecessary waiting.

The underlying mechanism involves a counter managed by the OpenMP runtime.  Each thread increments the counter upon reaching the barrier. The runtime monitors this counter. When the counter reaches the number of threads in the team, all threads are signaled to proceed.  This is usually implemented using low-level system calls that are highly optimized for the underlying hardware, leveraging features like atomic operations to prevent race conditions within the barrier management itself.  The efficiency of these mechanisms depends greatly on the OpenMP implementation and the hardware architecture.

It's crucial to recognize that the barrier operation itself is not completely free.  There is overhead associated with managing the counter and signaling the threads. This overhead scales with the number of threads, so using barriers excessively can negate the performance benefits of parallelism.  Therefore, careful design and placement of barriers are key for optimizing parallel programs.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Implicit Barrier in a Parallel For Loop**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
  int n = 1000;
  double x[n], y[n];

  // Initialize x
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) x[i] = i;

  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    y[i] = x[i] * 2; // Computation on x; implicit barrier at the end
  }

  // Accessing y here is safe because of the implicit barrier
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) std::cout << y[i] << " ";
  std::cout << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the implicit barrier.  The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive automatically inserts a barrier at the end of the loop. This ensures all threads have completed their calculations on `x` before `y` is accessed sequentially.  Any attempt to access `y` before the implicit barrier would lead to undefined behavior due to potential race conditions.


**Example 2: Explicit Barrier for Phased Computation**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
  int n = 1000;
  double a[n], b[n], c[n];

  // Initialize a and b
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { a[i] = i; b[i] = i * 2; }

  #pragma omp parallel
  {
    #pragma omp for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) c[i] = a[i] + b[i];

    #pragma omp barrier // Explicit barrier ensures all additions are complete

    #pragma omp for
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) c[i] *= 2; //Further computation using the results from the previous stage.
  }

  // Access c after all computations.
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) std::cout << c[i] << " ";
  std::cout << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Here, an explicit barrier is used to separate two phases of computation. The first phase calculates `c` as the sum of `a` and `b`. The barrier ensures that all threads complete this phase before starting the second phase, where `c` is multiplied by 2.  Without the barrier, the second loop might begin before the first loop is complete in some threads, leading to incorrect results.


**Example 3: Avoiding Unnecessary Barriers**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <omp.h>

int main() {
  int n = 1000;
  double x[n];

  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    x[i] = i * i; // Independent computations; No need for a barrier here.
  }
  //Implicit Barrier exists here anyway.

  double sum = 0;
  #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum) //reduction clause handles synchronization internally
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) sum += x[i];

  std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This example highlights situations where explicit barriers are unnecessary. Each iteration of the first loop is independent, so no synchronization is needed. The reduction clause in the second loop implicitly handles the synchronization required to accumulate the sum, removing the need for an explicit barrier. Adding an explicit barrier here would introduce unnecessary overhead.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The OpenMP standard specification provides detailed information on synchronization mechanisms.  A comprehensive textbook on parallel programming techniques would offer valuable context for effective barrier usage.  Furthermore, profiling tools specifically designed for parallel applications can help identify performance bottlenecks caused by inefficient barrier placement. Consulting relevant publications on compiler optimizations and memory models will deepen your understanding of how barriers interact with hardware.
