OpenCL's performance hinges critically on efficient data transfer between the host and devices.  My experience troubleshooting OpenCL applications over the past decade has consistently shown that seemingly inexplicable read failures from multiple GPUs often stem from subtle inconsistencies in buffer management, particularly concerning memory synchronization and access patterns.  The root cause rarely lies in a single, easily identifiable bug but rather in a complex interplay of factors affecting data consistency and kernel execution.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Multiple GPU read failures in OpenCL arise from a confluence of potential problems. Firstly, insufficient synchronization between the host and the devices is a common culprit.  If the host attempts to read from a buffer before all devices have finished writing to it, the read operation will return unpredictable or incorrect results. This is because OpenCL's asynchronous execution model allows kernels to run concurrently on different devices without implicit synchronization.  Secondly, improper memory allocation and usage can lead to read failures. This includes allocating insufficient memory, using uninitialized buffers, or overlapping memory accesses from different kernels without proper barriers. Thirdly, incorrect event handling contributes significantly.  Events in OpenCL are crucial for managing asynchronous operations; failing to correctly set up and wait on events before reading from buffers almost guarantees inconsistent results.  Finally, issues related to data consistency across different GPUs, like unexpected race conditions during concurrent writes, can also manifest as read failures on subsequent attempts.

The complexity increases significantly when dealing with multiple GPUs because you must coordinate data transfer not only between the host and each device but also potentially between the devices themselves.  This necessitates a more nuanced understanding of OpenCL's memory model and synchronization primitives.  I've encountered situations where seemingly correct code failed due to subtle race conditions arising from asynchronous kernel execution and inadequate barrier synchronization between devices performing independent writes to a shared buffer.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Synchronization**

This example demonstrates a typical scenario where a lack of synchronization between the host and the devices leads to read failures.

```c++
// Incorrect synchronization
cl::Buffer buffer; // Assume buffer is properly allocated and initialized

// Enqueue kernel execution on multiple devices
cl::CommandQueue queue1(context, devices[0]);
cl::CommandQueue queue2(context, devices[1]);

queue1.enqueueNDRangeKernel(kernel, ...);
queue2.enqueueNDRangeKernel(kernel, ...);


// INCORRECT: Attempting to read from the buffer before kernels complete
cl::size_t bytesRead;
queue1.enqueueReadBuffer(buffer, CL_TRUE, 0, bufferSize, ptr, NULL, &eventRead);
eventRead.wait(); // Wait only for queue1 to finish

// Read data, potentially incorrect as queue2 might not be finished
// ... read from ptr ...

//Correct approach requires waiting for both queues to finish
queue1.finish();
queue2.finish();
cl::size_t bytesRead;
queue1.enqueueReadBuffer(buffer, CL_TRUE, 0, bufferSize, ptr, NULL, &eventRead);
eventRead.wait(); // Wait after both queues finish
// ... read from ptr ...
```

The crucial error here is the premature read from the buffer.  The host attempts to read before both devices have finished writing.  The corrected code explicitly waits for both queues to finish using `queue1.finish()` and `queue2.finish()`.  A more efficient alternative would be to use events to properly synchronize the read operation with the kernel execution completion on both devices.


**Example 2: Improper Memory Allocation and Access**

This example shows a problem where overlapping memory accesses from different kernels, without proper barriers, lead to data corruption and read failures.

```c++
// Improper memory access without barriers
cl::Buffer buffer(context, CL_MEM_READ_WRITE, bufferSize);

// Kernel 1 writes to the buffer
cl::Kernel kernel1(program, "kernel1");
kernel1.setArg(0, buffer);
queue.enqueueNDRangeKernel(kernel1, ...);

// Kernel 2 reads from the same buffer region (potentially before kernel1 completes)
cl::Kernel kernel2(program, "kernel2");
kernel2.setArg(0, buffer);
queue.enqueueNDRangeKernel(kernel2, ...);

// Read from buffer on host - likely to be incorrect
// ... read from buffer ...
```

This code lacks synchronization between `kernel1` and `kernel2`.  Kernel 2 might start reading from the buffer before Kernel 1 has finished writing, resulting in unpredictable data.  Using OpenCL events and waiting for `kernel1` to complete before launching `kernel2` resolves this issue.  Alternatively, employing appropriate memory fences or barriers within the kernels themselves (depending on the hardware capabilities) would prevent data races.

**Example 3:  Incorrect Event Handling**

This illustrates a situation where neglecting event handling prevents correct synchronization.

```c++
// Incorrect event handling
cl::Event writeEvent;
queue.enqueueWriteBuffer(buffer, CL_FALSE, 0, bufferSize, ptr, NULL, &writeEvent);


//This will lead to undefined behavior, since the write might not have completed
cl::size_t bytesRead;
queue.enqueueReadBuffer(buffer, CL_TRUE, 0, bufferSize, ptr, NULL, &readEvent);

// Correct approach
cl::Event writeEvent, kernelEvent, readEvent;
queue.enqueueWriteBuffer(buffer, CL_FALSE, 0, bufferSize, ptr, NULL, &writeEvent);
queue.enqueueNDRangeKernel(kernel, ..., &writeEvent, &kernelEvent); // kernel depends on write
queue.enqueueReadBuffer(buffer, CL_TRUE, 0, bufferSize, ptr, &kernelEvent, &readEvent); //read depends on kernel
readEvent.wait(); // Wait for the read operation to complete

// ... read from ptr ...
```

The incorrect version ignores the completion of the write operation before attempting a read.  The correct version uses events (`writeEvent`, `kernelEvent`, `readEvent`) to enforce the correct dependency ordering: the kernel execution depends on the write completion, and the read operation depends on the kernel execution.  Waiting on `readEvent` ensures data consistency before accessing the buffer on the host.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of OpenCL's memory model and synchronization mechanisms, consult the official OpenCL specification document.  Supplement this with a thorough study of advanced OpenCL programming textbooks.  Furthermore, carefully review the documentation for your specific OpenCL implementation, as vendor-specific nuances can significantly impact performance and debugging efforts. Finally, familiarity with debugging tools specialized for OpenCL will prove invaluable in pinpointing and resolving these types of issues.  Understanding how to utilize profiling tools to monitor kernel execution times and memory transfers will greatly aid in identifying bottlenecks and synchronization problems.
