When debugging a reinforcement learning agent in PyTorch, the sudden absence of gradients during backpropagation can be perplexing, especially when the rest of the neural network appears to function correctly. This typically occurs not because of a malfunction within PyTorch itself, but due to the computational graph becoming detached during the specific operations involved in reinforcement learning. This detachment arises most commonly from the need to treat target values as constants in temporal difference learning or when propagating gradients through operations involving discrete actions. In these scenarios, standard backpropagation can no longer be applied, leading to the 'missing gradients' phenomenon.

Fundamentally, PyTorch employs automatic differentiation by constructing a dynamic computational graph. This graph tracks all operations performed on tensors that have the `requires_grad=True` attribute set. During the backward pass (`.backward()`), gradients are calculated by traversing this graph from the output back to the inputs, adhering to the chain rule of calculus. Crucially, backpropagation only works if the graph is a clear, contiguous sequence of differentiable operations linking the loss to the parameters. This continuity is broken when we encounter parts of the computation, inherent in reinforcement learning, that violate these requirements. Specifically, the problem centers around target values and discrete policy actions.

Consider the typical Q-learning update. The update rule aims to minimize the difference between the current Q-value prediction and a target Q-value calculated using the Bellman equation. The target Q-value, however, is not a differentiable function of the current policy's parameters. During the update, the target value is often derived from the current Q-network output or from a separate target network. Itâ€™s tempting to include this target value calculation within the same computation graph as the loss, but if we do so, the gradients would flow through the target values, corrupting the actual goal of the learning process. Instead, we want the target value to be treated as a constant with respect to the current policy. This separation is often achieved by explicitly detaching the target values from the graph, effectively blocking the gradient flow.

Another common scenario relates to discrete actions. Reinforcement learning often involves making decisions from a set of discrete actions (e.g., move left, right, up, down). The typical approach is to represent these actions as one-hot vectors and to use the network to predict a probability distribution over them. However, the selection of a particular action (typically through a sampling mechanism or using `argmax`) introduces a non-differentiable operation. Backpropagation cannot pass through the sampling step directly, causing the gradient to stop. We need specialized methods to handle the non-differentiability introduced by the action selection itself.

Let's examine three code examples that illustrate these points and show how to correctly handle them.

**Example 1: Detaching Target Values in Q-learning**

In this scenario, the target Q-value is computed using the next state's maximum Q-value derived from the target network's output. We explicitly detach the target value to prevent gradient flow.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import random

class QNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        super(QNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, action_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)

state_size = 4
action_size = 2
gamma = 0.99
lr = 0.001
memory = []
batch_size = 32

q_network = QNetwork(state_size, action_size)
target_network = QNetwork(state_size, action_size)
target_network.load_state_dict(q_network.state_dict())
optimizer = optim.Adam(q_network.parameters(), lr=lr)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

#Dummy data for example
for i in range(100):
  state = torch.rand(state_size)
  next_state = torch.rand(state_size)
  action = random.randint(0, action_size - 1)
  reward = random.random()
  done = random.choice([True, False])
  memory.append((state,action,reward,next_state,done))


def optimize():
    if len(memory) < batch_size:
       return
    batch = random.sample(memory, batch_size)
    states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*batch)

    states = torch.stack(states)
    next_states = torch.stack(next_states)
    actions = torch.tensor(actions).unsqueeze(1)
    rewards = torch.tensor(rewards).unsqueeze(1)
    dones = torch.tensor(dones, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(1)


    q_values = q_network(states).gather(1, actions)
    
    with torch.no_grad():
      next_q_values_target = target_network(next_states).max(1, keepdim=True)[0]
      targets = rewards + gamma * next_q_values_target * (1 - dones)
    
    loss = criterion(q_values, targets)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

#Run optimize function multiple times
for i in range(100):
  optimize()

print("Optimization completed. Gradient exists for all parameters if detached.")
```

In this example, the crucial part is using `torch.no_grad()` context and detaching the target values via `next_q_values_target` calculation.  Without this, gradient flow would be directed through the target network, leading to incorrect learning.

**Example 2: Policy Gradient with a Discrete Action Space (Using a surrogate loss)**

Here, we showcase the use of a surrogate loss to enable gradient flow through non-differentiable sampling using advantages rather than actual values.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F
import random

class PolicyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        super(PolicyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, action_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return F.softmax(x, dim=-1)

state_size = 4
action_size = 2
lr = 0.001
gamma = 0.99
memory = []
batch_size = 32
policy = PolicyNetwork(state_size, action_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=lr)

#Dummy data
for i in range(100):
  state = torch.rand(state_size)
  action = random.randint(0, action_size - 1)
  reward = random.random()
  memory.append((state,action,reward))


def optimize():
    if len(memory) < batch_size:
       return
    batch = random.sample(memory, batch_size)
    states, actions, rewards = zip(*batch)
    states = torch.stack(states)
    actions = torch.tensor(actions)
    rewards = torch.tensor(rewards)

    action_probs = policy(states)
    log_probs = torch.log(action_probs.gather(1, actions.unsqueeze(1)))
    advantages = rewards - rewards.mean()
    loss = -(log_probs*advantages.unsqueeze(1)).mean()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

for i in range(100):
    optimize()
print("Optimization complete, gradient exists through surrogate loss")

```

In this example, instead of directly backpropagating through the sampled actions, we utilize the log probability of the sampled actions multiplied by the computed advantage. This effectively allows gradients to flow and update the policy without needing to directly differentiate through the non-differentiable action selection.

**Example 3: Gradient Clipping**

Sometimes, gradient explosions can cause issues within the learning process and lead to vanishing gradients (through numerical instability), even when the computational graph is correct. Gradient clipping is used to mitigate this.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import random

class BasicNetwork(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self,input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
    super(BasicNetwork, self).__init__()
    self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
    self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

  def forward(self,x):
    x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
    return self.fc2(x)

input_size = 4
hidden_size = 64
output_size = 1
lr = 0.001
memory = []
batch_size = 32
network = BasicNetwork(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(network.parameters(), lr=lr)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()


#Dummy Data
for i in range(100):
  state = torch.rand(input_size)
  target = random.random()
  memory.append((state, target))

def optimize():
    if len(memory) < batch_size:
       return
    batch = random.sample(memory, batch_size)
    states, targets = zip(*batch)
    states = torch.stack(states)
    targets = torch.tensor(targets).unsqueeze(1)

    predictions = network(states)
    loss = criterion(predictions, targets)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(network.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
    optimizer.step()

for i in range(100):
  optimize()
print("Optimization with gradient clipping completed, no gradient issues exist.")
```

This example shows how `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_` stabilizes the training, by preventing the gradients from getting too large and preventing possible vanishing gradient issues due to numerical instability. It does not specifically address missing gradients, but can prevent scenarios that lead to perceived missing gradients from destabilizing the training.

In summary, missing gradients in reinforcement learning with PyTorch are rarely the result of a bug within PyTorch itself. More often, they arise from misunderstanding the computational graph and its requirements for backpropagation. Correct handling of target values and discrete actions, which might involve detaching parts of the graph, employing a surrogate loss, or applying other techniques, is crucial for establishing a continuous differentiable path for gradients to propagate. Without these measures, learning becomes impossible because parameter updates don't properly account for changes in the policy's behavior.

For further understanding, I recommend exploring resources on the following topics:  dynamic computational graphs, policy gradients, temporal difference learning, and gradient clipping strategies. Additionally, investigating the source code of popular reinforcement learning implementations (e.g., those based on stable baselines, or cleanrl) can provide further clarity. Learning the fundamentals of autograd and related concepts in pytorch are crucial to debugging these problems.
