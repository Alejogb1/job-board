TensorFlow 2's performance hinges on efficient tensor operations, and calculating squared sums, a fundamental operation in many machine learning models, is no exception.  Directly using Python loops for this task is computationally expensive, especially with large datasets. My experience optimizing deep learning models has consistently shown that leveraging TensorFlow's built-in functionalities for this task is crucial for performance gains.  The key is understanding that TensorFlow is designed for optimized parallel computation, and we should exploit that capability.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The naive approach to calculating the sum of squared values involves iterating through a tensor element by element, squaring each, and accumulating the result.  This is fundamentally inefficient in TensorFlow. Instead, we should employ vectorized operations that allow TensorFlow to perform the computation across multiple elements concurrently. This leverages the underlying hardware acceleration capabilities, particularly on GPUs, leading to significant speed improvements.

Several approaches achieve this vectorization.  The most straightforward and often the most efficient involves using TensorFlow's built-in mathematical functions.  Specifically, the `tf.square()` function performs element-wise squaring, and `tf.reduce_sum()` computes the sum across all elements of a tensor. Combining these two functions provides a concise and highly optimized solution.  Further optimization can be achieved by considering data types.  Using `tf.float32` is generally preferable to `tf.float64` unless higher precision is demonstrably required, as `tf.float32` offers a better balance of precision and computational efficiency.

Another approach, particularly useful for more complex scenarios involving multiple tensors or conditional calculations, involves using `tf.math.reduce_sum` with a custom reduction function. This provides flexibility, though it may slightly impact performance compared to the direct `tf.square()` and `tf.reduce_sum()` combination for simple squared sums.  Finally, for very large tensors that exceed available GPU memory, techniques such as batch processing or distributed computation become necessary. These advanced methods are not the primary focus here, but their consideration is vital for handling truly massive datasets.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Squared Sum Calculation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample tensor
tensor = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], dtype=tf.float32)

# Calculate squared sum
squared_sum = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(tensor))

# Print the result
print(squared_sum.numpy()) # Output: 55.0
```

This example demonstrates the most straightforward method. We define a sample tensor, square each element using `tf.square()`, and then sum the results using `tf.reduce_sum()`. The `.numpy()` method converts the TensorFlow tensor to a NumPy array for printing, a common practice for visualizing results.  The use of `tf.float32` is deliberate for performance reasons.


**Example 2: Squared Sum with Axis Specification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample 2D tensor
tensor_2d = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Calculate squared sum along the columns (axis=0)
squared_sum_axis0 = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(tensor_2d), axis=0)

# Calculate squared sum along the rows (axis=1)
squared_sum_axis1 = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(tensor_2d), axis=1)

# Print the results
print(squared_sum_axis0.numpy()) # Output: [10. 20.]
print(squared_sum_axis1.numpy()) # Output: [ 5. 25.]
```

This example illustrates the flexibility of `tf.reduce_sum()` by calculating squared sums along different axes of a 2D tensor. Specifying `axis=0` sums along the columns, while `axis=1` sums along the rows.  This functionality is critical when dealing with multi-dimensional data.


**Example 3:  Squared Sum with Custom Reduction (Illustrative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample tensor
tensor = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], dtype=tf.float32)

# Custom reduction function
def custom_squared_sum(t):
  return tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(t))

# Calculate squared sum using custom reduction
squared_sum = tf.math.reduce_sum(input_tensor=tensor, reduction_indices=None, keepdims=False, axis=None, reduction_axes=None, func=custom_squared_sum)

#Print the result
print(squared_sum.numpy()) # Output: 55.0
```

This example showcases using a custom reduction function with `tf.math.reduce_sum`. Although functionally equivalent to Example 1 in this simple case, the custom function approach provides extensibility. For instance, the `custom_squared_sum` could incorporate additional logic such as conditional squaring or weighting, which would not be easily incorporated into the simpler method.  However, this added flexibility usually comes at a minor performance cost compared to the direct method in Example 1.  It's worth noting that this level of customization is rarely needed for simple squared sum calculations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's mathematical operations, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  Furthermore, studying numerical computation textbooks focusing on linear algebra and optimization will provide valuable context for understanding the underlying principles of efficient tensor manipulation.  Finally, exploring advanced topics like TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities will enhance your ability to optimize complex computations within the TensorFlow framework.  These resources, coupled with practical experience, will solidify your ability to implement and optimize such operations.
