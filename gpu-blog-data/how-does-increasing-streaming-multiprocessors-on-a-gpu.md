The impact of increasing streaming multiprocessors (SMs) on GPU performance isn't simply linear; it's a complex interplay of several factors, heavily dependent on the specific application and architecture.  My experience optimizing ray tracing kernels for a high-end simulation project highlighted this non-linearity.  While more SMs inherently increase raw processing power, limitations in memory bandwidth, inter-SM communication, and the nature of the workload itself can significantly constrain the performance gains.

**1.  Architectural Considerations and Bottlenecks:**

A GPU's performance isn't solely determined by the number of SMs.  Each SM contains multiple cores, and the efficiency of these cores depends on several factors:  the amount of on-chip shared memory, the register file size, the warp scheduler efficiency, and the memory subsystem's capacity to supply data. Increasing SM count without addressing these limitations can lead to diminishing returns.  In my project, we observed that increasing SMs beyond a certain point resulted in only marginal performance improvements because the memory bandwidth became the limiting factor.  The kernels we were using were memory-bound, meaning the time spent accessing data from global memory drastically exceeded the time spent performing computations.  Adding more SMs only increased the demand on the memory bus, leading to increased contention and wait times.  This highlights the importance of understanding the characteristics of the workload before blindly assuming that more SMs equate to better performance.

Another crucial consideration is the inter-SM communication overhead.  Many algorithms require data exchange between SMs. This communication, typically handled through global memory or a dedicated interconnect, incurs significant latency.  Increasing SM count can exacerbate this latency if the communication pattern is not optimized, effectively negating the potential benefits of the added processing power.  In one instance, we had to restructure a particle simulation algorithm to minimize inter-SM communication by utilizing more efficient data structures and reducing the need for global memory accesses. This restructuring allowed us to see a more substantial performance increase with the increased SM count.


**2.  Code Examples and Commentary:**

To illustrate the concepts discussed, let's consider three code examples showcasing different scenarios. These are simplified illustrations; real-world implementations would be considerably more complex.

**Example 1: Memory-Bound Kernel:**

```cuda
__global__ void memoryBoundKernel(float* input, float* output, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        output[i] = input[i] * 2.0f; // Simple computation, but memory-bound
    }
}
```

In this example, the computation is trivial. The performance is primarily determined by the time taken to read from `input` and write to `output`.  Increasing SMs might not significantly improve performance because the memory bandwidth bottleneck remains.  Optimizations would focus on memory access patterns, potentially using texture memory or shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.


**Example 2: Computation-Bound Kernel:**

```cuda
__global__ void computationBoundKernel(float* input, float* output, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        float result = 0.0f;
        for (int j = 0; j < 1024; ++j) {  //Significant computation
            result += sinf(input[i] + j);
        }
        output[i] = result;
    }
}
```

Here, the computation is intensive.  The performance scales more favorably with an increase in SMs, as each SM can perform more computations concurrently.  However, even here, limitations like shared memory size and register pressure could still constrain the scaling.  Optimizations could involve careful thread block configuration and exploitation of shared memory for intermediate results.


**Example 3: Kernel with Inter-SM Communication:**

```cuda
__global__ void communicationBoundKernel(float* input, float* output, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        // ... some computation ...
        __syncthreads(); //Synchronization point between threads within the same block
        atomicAdd(&output[i % 1024], input[i]); //Atomic operation creating inter-SM communication.
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates a kernel requiring inter-SM communication through atomic operations.  Increasing SMs can lead to performance degradation unless the communication strategy is optimized.  This often requires algorithmic changes to reduce contention on shared resources and optimize data transfer patterns.  The use of atomic operations is often a performance bottleneck. This kernel benefits from techniques like reducing atomic operations or using different synchronization mechanisms better suited to parallel processing.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I suggest consulting the official GPU architecture documentation from your hardware vendor.  Detailed performance analysis tools provided by these vendors are invaluable for identifying bottlenecks and optimizing code.  Textbooks on parallel computing and GPU programming provide valuable theoretical background and practical guidance.  Finally, exploring relevant research papers focusing on GPU architecture and parallel algorithm design offers a deep understanding of the advanced concepts involved in optimizing GPU performance.  Focusing on specific performance analysis tools associated with your specific hardware will greatly assist in optimizing code based on your specific hardware.
