Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), while powerful reinforcement learning algorithms, pose considerable challenges when directly integrated as base algorithms within TensorFlow Federated (TFF). Their inherent design, predicated on centralized training and immediate access to environmental interactions, clashes with the decentralized, communication-constrained nature of federated learning. While adapting them is feasible, it necessitates significant architectural modifications rather than a simple plug-and-play approach.

The fundamental difficulty lies in how DQN and PPO collect data. DQN, in its standard form, relies on an experience replay buffer which aggregates transitions (state, action, reward, next state) encountered by a single agent interacting with an environment. PPO similarly collects trajectories generated by a single policy. These data structures are essentially centralized, representing experience accumulated by a single agent's journey within a single environment. Federated learning, conversely, involves multiple agents interacting with heterogeneous environments, each generating data locally. Directly applying the standard replay buffer or policy trajectory collection to a federated setting undermines the federated learning goal – to train a global model without aggregating raw user data in a central location.

To implement DQN in a federated context, we would need to fundamentally change the data gathering process. Each client (device) would need to maintain its own local replay buffer, derived from its environment interactions. Instead of passing raw transitions, clients would compute parameter updates (gradients) from their respective buffer, passing these to the server. The server would then aggregate these parameter updates, updating the global model. This server-side aggregation must handle the heterogeneity of the local gradients effectively. The aggregation algorithm must account for the fact that different clients may be experiencing different types of environments which will bias their collected experiences. Consequently, the parameter update may not be ideal for the model’s generalization across all environments.

Similarly, adapting PPO for federated learning requires adjusting the trajectory collection and parameter update process. Each client would independently run the current policy on its own local environment, collecting trajectories locally. Then each client would compute policy and value function updates based on its local trajectories, passing only the updates to the server. The server must then aggregate these updates from different clients to obtain the updated global policy. The challenge resides in how the server handles the local policy update to ensure consistent and stable policy updates while considering the different local conditions and different experiences. PPO relies on a ratio of new action probabilities compared to the old action probability, this must be computed locally and only the final update should be sent to the server.

Here are three code examples, illustrating the conceptual modifications required, rather than providing fully runnable implementations within TFF. Note that these examples highlight the key adaptations at the local client level within TFF's context:

**Example 1: Federated DQN – Client-Side Gradient Calculation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class FederatedDQNAgent:
    def __init__(self, model, optimizer, gamma=0.99, buffer_size=1000):
        self.model = model  # Local copy of the global Q-network
        self.optimizer = optimizer
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.buffer_size = buffer_size
        self.replay_buffer = []  # Local replay buffer

    def store_transition(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        if len(self.replay_buffer) >= self.buffer_size:
            self.replay_buffer.pop(0)  # Remove oldest if full
        self.replay_buffer.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))

    def compute_local_gradient(self, batch_size=32):
        if len(self.replay_buffer) < batch_size:
            return None
        
        indices = np.random.choice(len(self.replay_buffer), size=batch_size, replace=False)
        batch = [self.replay_buffer[i] for i in indices]

        states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*batch)
        states = tf.convert_to_tensor(states, dtype=tf.float32)
        next_states = tf.convert_to_tensor(next_states, dtype=tf.float32)
        actions = tf.convert_to_tensor(actions, dtype=tf.int32)
        rewards = tf.convert_to_tensor(rewards, dtype=tf.float32)
        dones = tf.convert_to_tensor(dones, dtype=tf.float32)


        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            q_values = self.model(states)
            next_q_values = self.model(next_states)
            
            max_next_q_values = tf.reduce_max(next_q_values, axis=1)
            targets = rewards + self.gamma * max_next_q_values * (1 - dones)
            
            mask = tf.one_hot(actions, depth=q_values.shape[-1])
            q_values_selected = tf.reduce_sum(q_values * mask, axis=1)
            loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(targets - q_values_selected))

        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, self.model.trainable_variables)
        return gradients
```

*Commentary:* This example shows how a client, within a federated DQN implementation, collects its experiences and computes gradients from a local replay buffer. Importantly, raw experience data is never sent to the server. Only the gradients based on the model parameters are passed back. The `compute_local_gradient` method performs a mini-batch update similar to the original DQN implementation, before preparing to send the gradients to the server.

**Example 2: Federated PPO – Client-Side Policy Update**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class FederatedPPOAgent:
    def __init__(self, actor, critic, optimizer, gamma=0.99, lamda=0.95, epsilon=0.2):
        self.actor = actor # Local copy of the global policy network
        self.critic = critic # Local copy of the global value network
        self.optimizer = optimizer
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.lamda = lamda
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.trajectory = [] # Local trajectory buffer
        self.previous_log_probs = None # Log probability buffer

    def store_transition(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done, log_prob):
        self.trajectory.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))
        if self.previous_log_probs is None:
            self.previous_log_probs = [log_prob]
        else:
            self.previous_log_probs.append(log_prob)

    def compute_advantages_and_targets(self):
        states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*self.trajectory)
        states = tf.convert_to_tensor(states, dtype=tf.float32)
        next_states = tf.convert_to_tensor(next_states, dtype=tf.float32)
        rewards = tf.convert_to_tensor(rewards, dtype=tf.float32)
        dones = tf.convert_to_tensor(dones, dtype=tf.float32)

        values = tf.squeeze(self.critic(states), axis=-1)
        next_values = tf.squeeze(self.critic(next_states), axis=-1)
        
        advantage = np.zeros(len(rewards), dtype=np.float32)
        gae = 0
        for t in reversed(range(len(rewards))):
            delta = rewards[t] + self.gamma * next_values[t] * (1-dones[t]) - values[t]
            gae = delta + self.gamma * self.lamda * (1-dones[t]) * gae
            advantage[t] = gae

        advantage = tf.convert_to_tensor(advantage, dtype=tf.float32)
        targets = advantage + values

        return states, actions, advantage, targets

    def compute_local_gradient(self, batch_size=32):
        if len(self.trajectory) < batch_size:
            return None

        states, actions, advantage, targets = self.compute_advantages_and_targets()
        
        indices = np.random.choice(len(states), size=batch_size, replace=False)
        batch_states = tf.gather(states, indices)
        batch_actions = tf.gather(tf.convert_to_tensor(actions, dtype=tf.int32), indices)
        batch_advantage = tf.gather(advantage, indices)
        batch_targets = tf.gather(targets, indices)
        old_log_probs = tf.gather(tf.convert_to_tensor(self.previous_log_probs, dtype=tf.float32), indices)

        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            new_log_probs = self.actor.log_prob(batch_states, batch_actions)
            ratio = tf.exp(new_log_probs - old_log_probs)
            clipped_ratio = tf.clip_by_value(ratio, 1 - self.epsilon, 1 + self.epsilon)

            policy_loss = -tf.reduce_mean(tf.minimum(ratio * batch_advantage, clipped_ratio * batch_advantage))
            value_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(self.critic(batch_states)-tf.expand_dims(batch_targets, axis=-1)))
            loss = policy_loss + 0.5 * value_loss

        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, self.actor.trainable_variables + self.critic.trainable_variables)
        return gradients
```

*Commentary:* This example focuses on the client-side adaptation of PPO. The `FederatedPPOAgent` maintains a local trajectory. Crucially, only gradient updates are shared with the server, not the actual trajectories. The method `compute_local_gradient` does the same functionality as the traditional PPO and computes the advantage from the local trajectories before passing the gradients to the server.

**Example 3: Federated Server-Side Model Update**

```python
class FederatedServer:
    def __init__(self, global_model, aggregation_strategy):
        self.global_model = global_model
        self.aggregation_strategy = aggregation_strategy # Strategy for gradient aggregation

    def aggregate_and_update(self, client_gradients):
      aggregated_gradients = self.aggregation_strategy(client_gradients) #Aggregation
      
      # Update global model with the aggregated gradients
      self.global_model.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(aggregated_gradients, self.global_model.trainable_variables))

      return self.global_model
```

*Commentary:*  This example outlines the basic structure of a server-side class. A notable addition is the concept of an `aggregation_strategy`. The server collects gradient updates from different clients and must apply a strategy to aggregate these gradients for model updating. The simplest approach is averaging, however, there are many other more complex strategies (e.g., federated averaging, federated momentum) that are more suitable in practice.

While these code snippets only highlight key client adaptations, they illustrate the major challenge: modifying how data is collected and processed. Instead of directly using a centralized approach, the federated approach relies on local computations and exchanging parameter updates only.

For further study, I recommend exploring research papers on federated reinforcement learning, and specifically, federated policy optimization. Consider resources that discuss techniques like FedAvg and more advanced methods of aggregation and optimization in a federated context. Additionally, studying TensorFlow Federated documentation and examples related to custom models and algorithms is vital to understand the mechanics. Books and tutorials on multi-agent reinforcement learning could be beneficial as federated learning introduces similar challenges of heterogeneous agents. Finally, research that uses local replay buffers for distributed training. This can be relevant as the local buffers in this response are similar to distributed training.
