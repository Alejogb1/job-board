Accessing remote files managed by Globus using the Snakemake workflow engine requires a careful orchestration of the Globus CLI with Snakemake's file handling capabilities. The primary challenge lies in Snakemake's expectation of local filesystem paths versus Globus CLI operations that manage data movement, not symbolic links or direct remote access. I've encountered this frequently while managing large-scale genomics pipelines distributed across institutional clusters. My experience in integrating disparate data sources within Snakemake has shown that a combination of shell commands, input functions, and careful parameterization is essential for success.

The fundamental approach involves the following sequence of operations within a Snakemake workflow: 1) defining the Globus paths and local destination paths; 2) using the Globus CLI to transfer files from the remote Globus endpoint to local storage prior to rule execution; 3) specifying the locally downloaded files as input to the Snakemake rule; and 4) optional cleanup of local copies after rule execution. Central to this strategy is the use of Snakemake's `shell` directive and the `input` function, permitting dynamic generation of file dependencies and the seamless integration of external commands. Crucially, the workflow must be designed to handle potential transfer failures and must be mindful of storage limitations on the execution environment.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown with illustrative code examples:

**Example 1: Basic Globus Transfer with Direct Shell Commands**

This first example demonstrates a straightforward approach, embedding the `globus transfer` command directly within the Snakemake rule. This is the most basic method and can be suitable for simple workflows where dynamism is not a critical factor.

```python
# Snakefile

configfile: "config.yaml"

rule all:
  input:
    "results/output.txt"

rule process_globus_data:
    input:
       remote_path = config["globus_remote_path"],
       local_path = "data/input.txt" #local data path
    output:
        "results/output.txt"
    shell:
        """
        mkdir -p data
        globus transfer --json {input.remote_path} {input.local_path} #local file
        python process_data.py {input.local_path} {output}
        """
```

```yaml
# config.yaml
globus_remote_path: "globus://endpoint_uuid_a/remote_file.txt"
```

**Explanation:**

The `config.yaml` file stores the remote path to our input data on the Globus endpoint. The `process_globus_data` rule defines `remote_path` and `local_path` as input variables. The `shell` directive contains the necessary commands. `mkdir -p data` ensures the data directory exists before file transfer. The `globus transfer --json` command moves the specified file to the designated local path. Note the use of `--json` is recommended for easier automation and parsing. Finally, a mock `process_data.py` script (not shown, as it's outside the scope) processes the local data and generates the `output.txt` file. The `input` and `output` directives are not files with paths known *before* execution, as `local_path` is a parameter here. The local path needs to be created via the `mkdir` command. Using `input:` this way is how we tell Snakemake about the input files and their remote locations, so that dependencies are handled properly.

**Example 2: Input Functions for Dynamic Globus Transfers**

This example demonstrates a more dynamic approach, using Snakemake's input functions to construct paths and control the transfer process based on the workflow's needs. This method excels when the remote data paths are not static.

```python
# Snakefile

configfile: "config.yaml"

def get_local_path(wildcards):
    return os.path.join("data", wildcards.sample + ".txt")

rule all:
  input:
    expand("results/{sample}/output.txt", sample=["sample1", "sample2"])

rule process_globus_data:
    input:
        remote_path = lambda wildcards: config["globus_remote_base"] + wildcards.sample + ".txt",
        local_path = get_local_path
    output:
        "results/{sample}/output.txt"
    shell:
        """
        mkdir -p $(dirname {output}) # ensure output directory exists
        mkdir -p data
        globus transfer --json {input.remote_path} {input.local_path}
        python process_data.py {input.local_path} {output}
        """
```

```yaml
# config.yaml
globus_remote_base: "globus://endpoint_uuid_a/remote_data/"
```

**Explanation:**

Here, the `config.yaml` file contains a base path for the remote data. The `get_local_path` function dynamically generates a local path based on the sample name. Snakemake's `expand` function is used in the `all` rule to generate multiple output targets based on the list of samples. The `process_globus_data` rule uses a `lambda` function to dynamically assemble the remote path and the `get_local_path` function to derive the local path. The `shell` directive now includes `mkdir -p $(dirname {output})` to handle creating necessary subdirectories for the output files and proceeds with the transfer and data processing. Again, we use `mkdir` to handle dynamic creation of the local data directory. We still use the input variable `local_path` here, as a parameter for the shell script.

**Example 3: Handling Transfer Failures with a Dedicated Rule**

This example introduces a dedicated rule to handle the file transfer. This allows for better error management and improves the overall robustness of the workflow, by allowing for optional retries and logging.

```python
# Snakefile

configfile: "config.yaml"

def get_local_path(wildcards):
    return os.path.join("data", wildcards.sample + ".txt")

rule all:
  input:
    expand("results/{sample}/output.txt", sample=["sample1", "sample2"])


rule transfer_globus_data:
    input:
        remote_path = lambda wildcards: config["globus_remote_base"] + wildcards.sample + ".txt"
    output:
        local_path = get_local_path
    shell:
        """
        mkdir -p data
        globus transfer --json {input.remote_path} {output.local_path}
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Globus transfer failed for {input.remote_path}" >&2
          exit 1
        fi
        """

rule process_data:
  input:
      local_path = get_local_path
  output:
      "results/{sample}/output.txt"
  shell:
    """
    mkdir -p $(dirname {output})
    python process_data.py {input.local_path} {output}
    """
```

```yaml
# config.yaml
globus_remote_base: "globus://endpoint_uuid_a/remote_data/"
```

**Explanation:**

This refined approach introduces a dedicated `transfer_globus_data` rule, responsible solely for moving the files from the Globus endpoint to local storage. It captures the return code of the `globus transfer` command to check for success, exiting with an error if the transfer fails. Importantly, the `process_data` rule now depends on the output of the `transfer_globus_data` rule, allowing Snakemake to properly sequence these operations. Notice, again, the use of `mkdir` to create the necessary directories. We use the `get_local_path` function to generate the paths for `transfer_globus_data` output and `process_data` input.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of the concepts and technologies used, I recommend reviewing the following documentation:

*   **Snakemake documentation**: This provides in-depth explanations of the workflow engine's syntax, capabilities, and configuration options. Concentrate on sections covering input functions, the shell directive, wildcards, and workflow parameters.
*   **Globus CLI documentation**: Thoroughly read the `globus transfer` command documentation for detailed parameter options, error handling strategies, and authentication methods. Focus on the JSON output format for easier programmatic parsing.
*   **Shell scripting tutorials**: Proficiency in shell scripting is crucial for robust integration of the Globus CLI with Snakemake, as shell commands are often the glue that holds these components together. Specifically, familiarize yourself with error handling, file management, and variable manipulation.

Through these methods, I've found that managing remote data via Globus within a Snakemake environment becomes manageable, enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics analyses. Proper design focusing on error handling, dynamic path generation, and a separation of concerns between data transfer and processing operations is key to ensuring a smooth workflow.
