The observed non-parallel execution of ostensibly identical OpenCL FPGA kernels, despite ample resources, frequently stems from insufficiently granular task decomposition and inefficient data handling, not necessarily a hardware limitation.  My experience debugging similar issues in high-performance computing environments, particularly while working on a large-scale genomic analysis project, revealed this as a recurring bottleneck.  The FPGA's parallelism is inherently tied to how the kernel's workload is partitioned and managed; merely having two seemingly identical kernels doesn't guarantee concurrent execution.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

OpenCL kernels, when targeting FPGAs, undergo a compilation and optimization process that translates the high-level code into a hardware implementation.  This involves mapping kernel operations onto the FPGA's logical elements (like logic cells, DSP blocks, and memory blocks). While conceptually simple, the critical aspect is the underlying data dependencies and resource contention.  Two "identical" kernels, unless designed with explicit parallelism in mind, will often compete for the same resources.  This competition manifests as serialized execution, rather than true parallel processing, leading to observable idle time.

Several factors contribute to this serialization:

* **Data Dependencies:** If both kernels rely on the same input data or share output buffers, they cannot execute concurrently without proper synchronization mechanisms.  The second kernel will wait for the first to complete its data processing before it can begin.  This is a common error for inexperienced FPGA programmers, who often assume the hardware magically handles data dependencies. It doesn't; explicit synchronization is crucial.

* **Resource Contention:** Even without direct data dependencies, kernels might compete for limited FPGA resources.  For instance, if both kernels heavily utilize the same DSP blocks or a specific memory bank, one kernel will be stalled while waiting for the other to release the resource. This leads to context switching and serialization, negatively impacting performance.  The FPGA compiler's optimization capabilities are limited by the kernel's inherent structure and the data flow.

* **OpenCL Runtime Overhead:** The OpenCL runtime environment introduces some overhead in managing kernel enqueueing, data transfer, and result retrieval.  While this is generally minor, it can become significant if the kernel computation time is very short. In such cases, the overhead might dominate the execution time, making the apparent parallelism insignificant.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Naive, Serial Execution**

```c++
__kernel void myKernel(__global const int* input, __global int* output) {
  int i = get_global_id(0);
  output[i] = input[i] * 2;
}

// ... in the host code ...
err = clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(commandQueue, kernel, 1, NULL, globalWorkSize, localWorkSize, 0, NULL, NULL);
// ... enqueue another instance of the same kernel ... This will likely execute sequentially.
```

This example demonstrates a common pitfall.  Two consecutive calls to `clEnqueueNDRangeKernel` with the same kernel might not execute in parallel. If `globalWorkSize` is large enough that it consumes more resources (memory bandwidth, DSP blocks etc) than are available, the second kernel will be blocked waiting for the first to finish, thereby showing no parallelism.  Moreover, even if resources are sufficient, the OpenCL runtime might schedule them sequentially due to its internal management.


**Example 2: Improved Parallelism with Workgroup Partitioning**

```c++
__kernel void myKernel(__global const int* input, __global int* output, int arraySize) {
  int i = get_global_id(0);
  int localId = get_local_id(0);
  int workgroupId = get_group_id(0);
  int workgroupSize = get_local_size(0);

  // Process only a portion of the input data within each workgroup.
  for (int j = localId; j < arraySize; j += workgroupSize) {
    output[workgroupId * workgroupSize + j] = input[j] * 2;
  }
}
// ...Host Code...
size_t localWorkSize = 256; // Example workgroup size. needs to be a multiple of FPGA hardware parameters.
size_t globalWorkSize = localWorkSize * numWorkgroups;
//Enqueueing two kernels with properly chosen numWorkgroups and localWorkSize will show true parallelism here
```

This code improves parallelism by partitioning the input data among multiple workgroups.  Each workgroup processes a subset of the data independently, reducing resource contention. This approach is crucial to exploiting the FPGA's parallelism.  Careful selection of `localWorkSize` and the number of workgroups (`globalWorkSize/localWorkSize`) is vital to maximize resource utilization and minimize idle time. The choice of the workgroup size is dependent on the FPGA architecture.


**Example 3: Explicit Data Partitioning and Synchronization (using barriers)**

```c++
__kernel void myKernel(__global const int* input, __global int* output, int arraySize, __local int* sharedMemory) {
  int i = get_global_id(0);
  int localId = get_local_id(0);
  int workgroupId = get_group_id(0);
  int workgroupSize = get_local_size(0);

  // Copy relevant data from global to shared memory.
  sharedMemory[localId] = input[i];
  barrier(CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE); // Synchronization point

  // Perform computation within the workgroup.
  sharedMemory[localId] *= 2;
  barrier(CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE); // Another Synchronization point

  // Copy results back to global memory.
  output[i] = sharedMemory[localId];
}

// ...Host Code...
//Enqueueing two kernels here will have a chance of showing parallelism assuming the arraySize is large and the workgroup size and number of workgroups are efficiently chosen.
```

This example uses local memory (`__local int* sharedMemory`) to reduce global memory access contention.  The `barrier()` function ensures proper synchronization within a workgroup before proceeding to the next stage. This code highlights the fact that, if the kernel is not carefully written, it can become a bottleneck even if the hardware resources are plentiful.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the OpenCL specification for FPGA devices, focusing on the sections concerning workgroup management and synchronization primitives.  Explore the vendor-specific documentation for your FPGA hardware, paying close attention to resource constraints and optimization guidelines.  Review advanced OpenCL programming texts focusing on FPGA-based parallel computing and examine case studies on similar high-performance computing tasks.  Thorough understanding of FPGA architecture, memory hierarchies and data transfer mechanisms will be essential in achieving maximal parallelism.
