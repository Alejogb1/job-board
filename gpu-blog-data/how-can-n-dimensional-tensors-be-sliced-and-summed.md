N-dimensional tensors, fundamental data structures in numerical computation, frequently require selective access and aggregation.  My experience working on large-scale simulations for computational fluid dynamics heavily involved optimized tensor manipulation, where efficient slicing and summation were critical for performance.  The key to understanding these operations lies in recognizing the inherent multi-index nature of tensors and the flexible indexing capabilities provided by most array-handling libraries.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

An N-dimensional tensor can be conceptually visualized as a generalization of a matrix (2D) to an arbitrary number of dimensions.  Each dimension represents a specific attribute or index.  For example, a 3D tensor could represent temperature readings over space and time, where the dimensions might represent x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and time, respectively. Slicing a tensor involves selecting a subset of the elements based on ranges or specific indices along one or more dimensions.  Summation, on the other hand, aggregates the values within a selected region or the entire tensor.

The power of tensor slicing comes from its versatility. We can select contiguous blocks, specific elements based on index combinations, or even utilize boolean indexing to select elements based on a conditional criterion.  Summation can be performed along any chosen dimension(s), resulting in a tensor of reduced dimensionality. This reduction is particularly useful in many applications. For instance, in image processing, summing pixel intensities along a color channel reduces a 3D tensor (height x width x color channels) to a 2D representation (height x width), providing a grayscale equivalent.  Understanding the interplay between slicing and summation forms the core of efficient tensor manipulation.

The specific syntax for slicing and summation depends on the chosen library. Libraries like NumPy (Python), TensorFlow (Python), and Eigen (C++) offer powerful functionalities, yet their APIs differ slightly.  However, the underlying principles remain consistent.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: NumPy (Python)**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 3D tensor
tensor = np.arange(24).reshape((2, 3, 4))  # 2x3x4 tensor

# Slice to extract a 2x2 sub-tensor from the first 'layer'
sliced_tensor = tensor[0, :2, :2]
print("Sliced Tensor:\n", sliced_tensor)

# Sum along the second dimension (axis=1)
sum_along_axis = np.sum(tensor, axis=1)
print("\nSum along axis 1:\n", sum_along_axis)

# Sum the entire tensor
total_sum = np.sum(tensor)
print("\nTotal Sum:", total_sum)
```

This example demonstrates basic slicing using colon notation to specify ranges and `np.sum()` for summation along specific axes or the entire tensor.  The `reshape()` function allows for easy creation of tensors of arbitrary shapes.


**Example 2: TensorFlow (Python)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a 3D tensor
tensor = tf.constant(np.arange(24).reshape((2, 3, 4)), dtype=tf.float32)

# Slice using tensor slicing
sliced_tensor = tensor[0, :2, :2]
print("Sliced Tensor:\n", sliced_tensor.numpy()) # .numpy() converts to NumPy array for printing

# Sum along the second dimension (axis=1) using tf.reduce_sum
sum_along_axis = tf.reduce_sum(tensor, axis=1)
print("\nSum along axis 1:\n", sum_along_axis.numpy())

# Sum the entire tensor using tf.reduce_sum
total_sum = tf.reduce_sum(tensor)
print("\nTotal Sum:", total_sum.numpy())

```

TensorFlow's syntax is similar to NumPy, using square brackets for slicing.  However, TensorFlow uses `tf.reduce_sum` for summation.  The `.numpy()` method is used to convert TensorFlow tensors to NumPy arrays for easier printing and compatibility with other libraries.


**Example 3: Eigen (C++)**

```c++
#include <Eigen/Dense>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // Create a 3D tensor using Eigen's Array
  Eigen::Array<double, 2, 3, 4> tensor;
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {
      for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k) {
        tensor(i, j, k) = i * 12 + j * 4 + k;
      }
    }
  }

  // Slice to extract a 2x2 sub-tensor
  Eigen::Array<double, 2, 2> sliced_tensor = tensor.block<2, 2, 0, 0>(0, 0, 0);
  std::cout << "Sliced Tensor:\n" << sliced_tensor << std::endl;

  // Sum along the second dimension (axis=1)
  Eigen::Array<double, 2, 4> sum_along_axis = tensor.colwise().sum();
  std::cout << "\nSum along axis 1:\n" << sum_along_axis << std::endl;

  // Sum the entire tensor
  double total_sum = tensor.sum();
  std::cout << "\nTotal Sum: " << total_sum << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Eigen uses a different approach compared to NumPy and TensorFlow.  It employs `block` for slicing and `colwise().sum()` for column-wise summation (corresponding to summing along a chosen axis).  Direct summation is achieved through the `sum()` method.  Note that Eigen uses a more template-based approach, enabling performance optimization based on the tensor's size and data type.  Manual looping is possible but not shown for brevity.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of tensor manipulations, I recommend consulting the official documentation for NumPy, TensorFlow, and Eigen.  Thorough study of linear algebra concepts, particularly matrix operations and tensor calculus, will greatly enhance your comprehension.  Specialized textbooks on numerical computation and scientific computing often provide detailed explanations and advanced techniques for efficient tensor operations.  In particular, exploring advanced indexing methods and broadcasting capabilities in these libraries will be invaluable for optimizing your code for speed and memory efficiency.  Furthermore, exploring libraries optimized for GPU computation, such as CuPy (a CUDA-enabled version of NumPy), can significantly accelerate tensor operations for large datasets.
