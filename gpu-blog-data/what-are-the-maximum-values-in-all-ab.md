The inherent computational complexity of finding the maximum values within all A×B subarrays of a 2D array necessitates a careful consideration of algorithmic efficiency.  My experience optimizing image processing algorithms has shown that naive approaches, such as nested loops iterating through all possible subarrays, lead to unacceptable performance for larger input datasets.  Therefore, a more sophisticated strategy is required, leveraging sliding window techniques to reduce redundant computations.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The problem requires determining the maximum value present in every possible A×B subarray within a larger M×N 2D array. A brute-force approach would involve iterating through every possible starting position (i, j) of an A×B subarray, calculating the maximum within that subarray, and storing the result.  This yields a time complexity of O(M*N*A*B), which becomes computationally expensive for even moderately sized arrays.

To improve efficiency, we can utilize a sliding window approach.  This involves maintaining a window of size A×B that moves across the array.  Instead of recalculating the maximum for each new window position from scratch, we leverage the maximum from the previous window position. This dramatically reduces redundant calculations.  The algorithm can be described as follows:

1. **Initialization:** Create a result matrix of size (M-A+1) × (N-B+1) to store the maximum values for each subarray. Initialize a sliding window of size A×B.

2. **Iteration:** Iterate through the rows of the main array. For each row, iterate through the columns.  For each (i,j) position, the window is positioned at the subarray starting at (i,j).

3. **Maximum Calculation:** Calculate the maximum value within the current A×B window.  This can be efficiently accomplished using a single loop over the window elements.

4. **Result Storage:** Store the calculated maximum in the corresponding position in the result matrix.

5. **Sliding Window Update:** Instead of completely recalculating the maximum for the next window position,  update the maximum efficiently by removing the leftmost column and adding the next rightmost column, as well as the topmost row and the next bottommost row. This requires only O(A+B) operations, far less than the O(A*B) of a naive recalculation.

This optimized approach reduces the time complexity to O(M*N*(A+B)), which represents a significant improvement over the brute-force method, especially when A and B are significantly smaller than M and N. The space complexity remains O(M*N) due to the storage of the result matrix.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Python - Basic Implementation**

```python
import numpy as np

def max_subarray(arr, A, B):
    M, N = arr.shape
    result = np.zeros((M - A + 1, N - B + 1))

    for i in range(M - A + 1):
        for j in range(N - B + 1):
            sub_array = arr[i:i+A, j:j+B]
            result[i, j] = np.max(sub_array)
    return result

arr = np.random.randint(1, 100, size=(5, 5))  #Example 5x5 array
A = 2
B = 3
result = max_subarray(arr, A, B)
print(result)
```

This example uses nested loops and NumPy's `max` function for simplicity, demonstrating the basic concept.  It’s inefficient for large arrays.


**Example 2: Python - Sliding Window Optimization**

```python
import numpy as np

def max_subarray_optimized(arr, A, B):
    M, N = arr.shape
    result = np.zeros((M - A + 1, N - B + 1))

    for i in range(M - A + 1):
        for j in range(N - B + 1):
            if j == 0: # first column initialization
                max_val = np.max(arr[i:i+A, j:j+B])
            else:
                max_val = max_subarray_update(arr, i, j, A, B, max_val) # Function to efficiently update max
            result[i, j] = max_val
    return result

def max_subarray_update(arr, i, j, A, B, prev_max):
    #Efficiently updates the max value without full recalculation
    new_col = arr[i:i+A, j+B-1]
    old_col = arr[i:i+A, j-1]

    new_max = prev_max
    for val in new_col:
        new_max = max(new_max, val)
    for val in old_col:
        if val == prev_max:
            new_max = np.max(arr[i:i+A, j:j+B]) # Recalculate when removing prev max
            break
    return new_max

arr = np.random.randint(1, 100, size=(5, 5))
A = 2
B = 3
result = max_subarray_optimized(arr, A, B)
print(result)

```
This example showcases a partially optimized sliding window technique.  It reduces redundant calculations compared to Example 1, but further optimization is possible.


**Example 3: C++ -  Memory-Efficient Approach**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> maxSubarray(const vector<vector<int>>& arr, int A, int B) {
    int M = arr.size();
    int N = arr[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> result(M - A + 1, vector<int>(N - B + 1, 0));

    for (int i = 0; i <= M - A; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= N - B; ++j) {
            int maxVal = arr[i][j];
            for (int k = i; k < i + A; ++k) {
                for (int l = j; l < j + B; ++l) {
                    maxVal = max(maxVal, arr[k][l]);
                }
            }
            result[i][j] = maxVal;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> arr = {{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, {11, 12, 13, 14, 15}, {16,17,18,19,20}, {21,22,23,24,25}};
    int A = 2;
    int B = 3;
    vector<vector<int>> result = maxSubarray(arr, A, B);

    for (const auto& row : result) {
        for (int val : row) {
            cout << val << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ example provides a more memory-conscious implementation suitable for resource-constrained environments. While not employing a sliding window, it serves as a baseline for comparison.  A fully optimized C++ solution would incorporate the sliding window technique for better performance.
