TensorFlow graph disconnections manifest primarily as `NotFoundError` exceptions during execution, often stemming from inconsistencies between the graph definition and the data it's intended to process.  My experience debugging these issues across several large-scale production models highlighted a critical aspect:  the problem rarely lies in a single, obvious severed edge. Instead, it's frequently a cascade of subtle errors triggered by a mismatch in tensor shapes, data types, or the availability of expected operations within the computational graph.

**1.  Understanding the Root Causes:**

TensorFlow's execution relies on a carefully constructed graph where nodes represent operations and edges represent data flow (tensors).  A disconnection implies a break in this flowâ€”a node expecting an input tensor that isn't being produced, or an output tensor not connected to any subsequent operation. This can arise from several scenarios:

* **Shape Mismatches:**  The most common cause.  If a node expects a tensor of shape (10, 20) but receives one of shape (20, 10), or even (10, 20, 1),  a disconnection will occur.  TensorFlow's automatic shape inference is powerful, but limitations exist, especially with dynamic shapes or conditional operations.

* **Data Type Inconsistencies:**  Mixing data types (e.g., `int32` and `float32`) unexpectedly can lead to silent failures or explicit errors further down the graph. Implicit type conversions might not always be what is intended, generating mismatched tensors.

* **Missing or Redundant Operations:**  Incorrectly defining the graph structure, for instance, omitting an essential operation or including a duplicate, can cause unexpected disconnections.  This is especially prevalent when using custom layers or models imported from external sources.

* **Control Flow Issues:** The usage of `tf.cond`, `tf.while_loop`, or similar constructs can introduce intricate dependencies.  Errors in managing the control flow can lead to sections of the graph being unreachable or producing tensors that are never consumed.

* **Variable Scope Conflicts:** Improper scoping of variables (especially in multi-threaded environments or distributed training) can create ambiguous variable references, effectively leading to disconnected parts of the graph.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Shape Mismatch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect: Input tensor shape mismatch
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # Shape (2, 2)
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=3)
output = dense_layer(input_tensor)  # Error: Expecting shape (None, 2) but got (2, 2)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    try:
        sess.run(output)
    except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
        print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
```

This example demonstrates a common scenario. A dense layer expects an input with a variable-length first dimension (represented by `None`). Providing a fixed-shape tensor will cause an error.  The solution involves reshaping the input tensor or adjusting the layer's input shape.

**Example 2: Data Type Inconsistency**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

float_tensor = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
int_tensor = tf.constant([4, 5, 6], dtype=tf.int32)

# Incorrect: Attempting incompatible addition
result = float_tensor + int_tensor #Error: Incompatible types.


with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    try:
        sess.run(result)
    except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
        print(f"Error encountered: {e}")

#Correct: Explicit type casting
correct_result = tf.cast(int_tensor, tf.float32) + float_tensor
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(correct_result))
```
This code highlights the danger of mixing data types. The error is clearly visible.  Explicit type casting (`tf.cast`) is crucial to avoid such issues.

**Example 3: Control Flow Error**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=())
y = tf.cond(x > 0, lambda: x * 2, lambda: x + 1)  # Conditional operation

# Incorrect: Attempting to use y without defining x
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    try:
        sess.run(y) # Error:  Will fail unless x is fed a value.
    except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
        print(f"Error encountered: {e}")

#Correct: Feed a value to x during execution
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: 5.0}))

```
This example demonstrates a problem with control flow.  The `tf.cond` operation's output (`y`) depends on the value of `x`.  Attempting to evaluate `y` without providing a value for `x` will lead to an error. Feeding the placeholder using `feed_dict` during session execution resolves this.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I'd recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on graph construction, shape inference, and data types. Pay close attention to the sections dealing with debugging strategies.  Furthermore, understanding the intricacies of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation system can greatly aid in identifying issues related to gradient calculation and backpropagation, which frequently accompany disconnection errors. A solid grasp of the TensorFlow execution model (eager execution vs. graph execution) is also essential for avoiding many of these problems. Finally, familiarize yourself with TensorFlow's debugging tools, including using `tf.print` for monitoring tensor values during execution.  These tools help pinpoint the exact point of failure within your graph.
