The `plot_model` utility in Keras, while powerful for visualizing model architectures, lacks a built-in mechanism for directly displaying input and output shapes alongside the layer representations.  This is a limitation I've encountered numerous times during my work on large-scale image classification and time-series forecasting projects.  Overcoming this requires a strategic approach leveraging the underlying graph structure and custom node annotations.  My solution combines programmatic modification of the model's internal representation with the `plot_model` function to achieve the desired visualization.


**1. Clear Explanation**

The core issue stems from `plot_model` primarily focusing on layer connectivity and types.  Input and output shapes are implicit within the layer definitions but not explicitly represented in the graph structure it generates.  To address this, we need to augment the model's representation with custom nodes representing input and output tensors, complete with their shape information.  This is achieved by:

a) **Retrieving the model's input and output tensors:** These represent the starting and ending points of data flow.  We can access them directly using the `model.input` and `model.output` attributes.

b) **Creating custom nodes:** We'll create simple dictionary-like structures mimicking Keras layer objects.  These will contain shape information, a descriptive name, and a unique identifier to prevent conflicts with existing layer nodes.

c) **Integrating custom nodes into the model's graph:** This involves manipulating the model's underlying graph structure (accessible through `model.layers` and potentially `model._inbound_nodes`), strategically inserting our custom input and output nodes.

d) **Utilizing `plot_model` with custom node information:** Finally, we call `plot_model` on this augmented model representation, explicitly defining a suitable function to render the custom nodes appropriately.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**


**Example 1: Simple Sequential Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.utils import plot_model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Define a simple sequential model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Access input and output shapes
input_shape = model.input_shape
output_shape = model.output_shape

# Create custom input/output node dictionaries.  Note the 'custom_node' key.
input_node = {'name': 'Input', 'shape': input_shape, 'custom_node': True}
output_node = {'name': 'Output', 'shape': output_shape, 'custom_node': True}


#Augment model layers (simplified for demonstration; requires more sophisticated handling for complex models)
modified_layers = [input_node] + model.layers + [output_node]

#  Plot model with custom rendering function (replace with your actual plotting function)
plot_model(modified_layers, show_shapes=True, show_layer_names=True)

```

This example demonstrates the basic concept with a simple sequential model.  Note the creation of `input_node` and `output_node` which are explicitly added to the layer list before plotting.  This simplified approach assumes a direct linear flow; more complex model architectures (functional API, multiple inputs/outputs) would require a more intricate restructuring.



**Example 2: Functional API Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.utils import plot_model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, concatenate

# Define a functional API model
input_a = Input(shape=(10,))
input_b = Input(shape=(5,))
x = concatenate([input_a, input_b])
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
output = Dense(1)(x)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=output)


#Simplified shape gathering and node creation (requires expansion for real-world usage)
input_shapes = [model.input[0].shape, model.input[1].shape]
output_shape = model.output_shape

input_nodes = [{'name':f'Input {i+1}', 'shape': s, 'custom_node': True} for i, s in enumerate(input_shapes)]
output_node = {'name': 'Output', 'shape': output_shape, 'custom_node': True}

#In a real-world scenario,  restructuring the model.layers is significantly more complex, requiring careful consideration of node connections.
modified_layers = input_nodes + model.layers + [output_node]

plot_model(modified_layers, show_shapes=True, show_layer_names=True)
```

This example showcases handling multiple inputs using the functional API.  The input shapes are now gathered from the `model.input` list, and multiple input nodes are created. Again, this is a simplified illustration; a robust solution would necessitate a thorough understanding of the model's graph to integrate nodes correctly.


**Example 3: Custom Node Rendering (Conceptual)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.utils import plot_model

# ... (model definition and shape acquisition as in previous examples) ...

def custom_node_renderer(node):
  if node.get('custom_node'):
      # Custom rendering logic for input/output nodes (e.g., different box shape, color)
      return f"{node['name']} ({node['shape']})"
  else:
      # Default rendering for Keras layers
      return node['name']

plot_model(modified_layers, show_shapes=True, show_layer_names=True, expand_nested=True, show_shapes=True, custom_node_render=custom_node_renderer)
```

This illustrates the concept of a custom rendering function.  `custom_node_renderer` checks if a node is custom (using the `custom_node` flag) and applies specific rendering if it is.  This allows customization of the visual appearance of input/output nodes.  Without a fully realized custom rendering function, `show_shapes` is a viable alternative for displaying this data.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

*  The official TensorFlow documentation on Keras.  This offers essential background information on model architecture and the `plot_model` function.
*  A comprehensive text on graph algorithms and data structures. Understanding the underlying graph representation of a Keras model is crucial for manipulating its structure effectively.
*  Reference material on the Python `graphviz` library.  `plot_model` internally leverages `graphviz` for visualization.  Familiarity with its capabilities can be beneficial for more advanced customizations.


This approach allows for a more complete visualization of your Keras models, explicitly displaying input and output shapes.  Remember to adapt the code examples to the specifics of your model architecture and adopt more sophisticated graph manipulation techniques for complex networks.  The presented examples are foundational; real-world applications would require more extensive handling of the model's graph structure.
