Profiling a debug build versus a release build often yields drastically different performance characteristics, and choosing the appropriate build type is crucial for obtaining meaningful insights. The core issue lies in the compiler optimizations and debugging information included in each build configuration. Debug builds, designed for ease of debugging, introduce overhead that distorts performance, while release builds, optimized for speed, provide a more accurate representation of user-facing performance. Therefore, I typically profile release builds.

Debug builds contain extensive debugging information, such as symbol tables, variable mappings, and assertions. This information allows developers to trace program execution, inspect variable values, and set breakpoints. However, generating this information and integrating it into the executable adds a performance penalty. The compiler also disables many optimization techniques that might hinder debugging, such as function inlining, loop unrolling, and register allocation optimization. These disabled optimizations can result in code that executes slower and exhibits drastically different execution paths than optimized release code. Furthermore, assertions, frequently included in debug builds, can impose performance bottlenecks through their runtime checks. The performance seen in a debug build is therefore not representative of the production performance and may not highlight the true areas of improvement.

Release builds, conversely, are stripped of debugging information and aggressively optimized by the compiler. The optimization process seeks to reduce the executable size, execute faster, and use system resources more efficiently. The compiler will utilize techniques like inlining functions, which eliminates the overhead of function calls. Loop unrolling can remove loop branch checks, improving execution speed. Register allocation optimization reduces memory access, further improving performance. The absence of assertions and debugging information removes runtime overhead. This leads to a program that is typically much faster and more efficient than its debug counterpart and reflects the actual user experience.

Profiling a debug build often leads to misidentification of performance bottlenecks. The additional overhead introduced for debugging can skew execution times, inflating the perceived impact of specific code sections. This results in wasted development time spent optimizing parts of the code that will not be significant in the optimized release build. Profiling a debug build is suitable only for identifying functional bugs or memory errors, rather than performance issues. Identifying areas for optimization in a debug build can lead to "optimizations" that actually worsen performance in the release build, further wasting development effort.

To illustrate this difference, consider a scenario I faced involving a custom string parsing routine in a data processing application I developed. The application processed thousands of string records, and I was tasked with optimizing performance. Initially, I naively attempted to profile the debug build and found an area within string parsing algorithm where excessive time was spent performing substring comparisons.
```c++
//Debug Build Example (Simplified)

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <chrono>

// Assume debug build has a debug level > 0, thus assertions
// are enabled and function inlining is disabled.
bool DebugCompareSubstrings(const std::string& str, size_t start, size_t len, const std::string& sub) {
    assert(start + len <= str.size()); //Assertion adds overhead
    if(len != sub.size()){
        return false;
    }
    for(size_t i = 0; i < len; ++i){
        if(str[start+i] != sub[i]){
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::string longString = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
    std::string subString = "ghijkl";

    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    for(int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i){
       DebugCompareSubstrings(longString, 5, subString.size(), subString);
    }
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::chrono::duration<double> duration = end-start;
    std::cout << "Time taken Debug Build: " << duration.count() << " seconds" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this example the `DebugCompareSubstrings` function was being called repeatedly. I added an assert and a `for` loop. Profiling the debug build showed this function as a significant hotspot. However, this was largely because of disabled inlining and the overhead of the assertion check.

Switching to a release build, I re-profiled, and the results were drastically different. The same code, now optimized, showed that the bulk of the execution time was not spent in this specific substring comparison code, rather it was spent performing allocation, which was masked by the debug build. Here is the equivalent release build example:
```c++
// Release Build Example (Simplified)
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <chrono>

// Assume release build has a debug level = 0, thus assertions
// are disabled and function inlining is enabled.
bool ReleaseCompareSubstrings(const std::string& str, size_t start, size_t len, const std::string& sub) {
    if(len != sub.size()){
        return false;
    }
    for(size_t i = 0; i < len; ++i){
        if(str[start+i] != sub[i]){
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
int main() {
    std::string longString = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
    std::string subString = "ghijkl";

    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    for(int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i){
        ReleaseCompareSubstrings(longString, 5, subString.size(), subString);
    }
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::chrono::duration<double> duration = end-start;
    std::cout << "Time taken Release Build: " << duration.count() << " seconds" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

```
The time spent in `ReleaseCompareSubstrings` in the release build was far less than what the debug build measured for `DebugCompareSubstrings`. The inlining of functions and other optimizations by the compiler lead to far better performance of the function in the release build. These optimizations are critical to user facing performance, therefore only the release build can provide actionable insights.

Further, debugging information, while essential during development, also occupies space in the executable, leading to larger memory footprints. This is another aspect of performance that would not be reflective of a release build. It is particularly relevant to memory constrained environments, such as embedded systems. The differences can be stark. This was something I learned first hand, in another application dealing with time sensitive data streaming. In that situation, memory allocation was a severe bottleneck, masked by the debugging overhead, in the debug build. Here is a simple illustration:
```c++
//Memory Allocation Example
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
#include <vector>

void allocate_debug() { // debug build no optimization on allocations
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        std::vector<int> vec(1000);
        vec[0] = i; // Avoid compiler optimizations for unused vector.
    }
}

void allocate_release() { // release build, might use optimized allocations or reuse memory
   for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
       std::vector<int> vec(1000);
        vec[0] = i; // Avoid compiler optimizations for unused vector.
    }
}

int main() {
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    allocate_debug();
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    std::chrono::duration<double> duration = end-start;
    std::cout << "Time taken Debug build: " << duration.count() << " seconds" << std::endl;

    start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    allocate_release();
    end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    duration = end-start;
    std::cout << "Time taken Release Build: " << duration.count() << " seconds" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
While the exact difference in times will vary by compiler, and operating system, the principle remains consistent: the release build's memory allocation behaviour is closer to the final user experience. The release version can potentially preallocate memory, or use different allocation methods completely.

In conclusion, profiling should almost always be performed on a release build. Profiling a debug build is inappropriate for performance analysis because of the compiler optimizations disabled and the added overhead of debugging information. When investigating performance bottlenecks, I ensure my workflow includes profiling a release build to accurately reflect real-world performance. For further understanding of compiler optimization techniques and performance analysis, studying resources on compiler design, system programming, and performance engineering can be incredibly helpful. Additionally, exploring case studies on real-world performance optimization problems will provide valuable insights.
