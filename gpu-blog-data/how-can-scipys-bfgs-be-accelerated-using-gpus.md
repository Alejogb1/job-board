The core bottleneck in SciPy's implementation of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm lies primarily within the iterative computation of the Hessian approximation and the function evaluation calls, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional problems. Parallelizing these computations through GPU acceleration presents a significant opportunity for speedup. My experience developing numerical optimization routines for a high-resolution climate model highlighted the considerable computational cost associated with BFGS when optimizing parameters against large datasets. While SciPy's native implementation leverages NumPy and is optimized for CPU, it doesn’t inherently support GPU acceleration. Accelerating BFGS requires shifting computational kernels to the GPU and managing data transfer between CPU and GPU memory efficiently.

Specifically, the BFGS algorithm consists of several key steps: 1) evaluating the objective function and its gradient; 2) updating the inverse Hessian approximation using a formula based on the previous approximation and the changes in position and gradient; 3) determining the search direction via the negative of the inverse Hessian matrix multiplied by the gradient; and 4) performing a line search to find an optimal step size along the search direction. The most computationally intensive steps, especially for high-dimensional problems, are the gradient calculation, Hessian update (which involves matrix-vector multiplications), and potentially the objective function evaluation, especially if it is a complex function.

To leverage GPUs, these computations must be performed within a framework that allows GPU computation, such as CUDA or OpenCL. This generally requires re-implementing the numerical kernels using libraries like Numba, PyTorch, or TensorFlow. These frameworks allow you to write functions that will be compiled to run on the GPU using its inherent parallelism. Therefore, the key is to avoid relying solely on SciPy’s or NumPy's default functions. It involves substituting matrix operations like matrix-vector products, dot products, and element-wise arithmetic with their GPU accelerated equivalents. Data transfer between the CPU and GPU memory should be minimized as much as possible, since it is an often-costly process.

Here are three code examples illustrating the principles of GPU acceleration applied to key sections of a hypothetical BFGS implementation:

**Example 1: GPU-Accelerated Gradient Calculation using Numba**

```python
import numpy as np
from numba import cuda

@cuda.jit
def gpu_objective_function(x, params, output_arr):
    i = cuda.grid(1)
    if i < x.shape[0]:
        # Simulate a complex function evaluation that can be parallelized
        output_arr[i] = (np.sin(x[i]*params[0]) + np.cos(x[i]*params[1]) + x[i]**2) #dummy calculation
    

def calculate_gradient_gpu(x, params):
    n = len(x)
    d_x = cuda.to_device(x)
    d_output = cuda.to_device(np.zeros(n))
    d_params = cuda.to_device(params)

    threads_per_block = 256
    blocks_per_grid = (n + (threads_per_block - 1)) // threads_per_block

    gpu_objective_function[blocks_per_grid, threads_per_block](d_x, d_params, d_output)
    
    d_result = cuda.to_device(np.zeros(n))
    
    # Simple numerical differentiation for demo
    h = 1e-5
    x_plus_h = cuda.to_device(x+h)
    
    gpu_objective_function[blocks_per_grid, threads_per_block](x_plus_h, d_params, d_result)
    
    gradient = (d_result.copy_to_host() - d_output.copy_to_host())/h

    return gradient

# Dummy data for illustration
x_input = np.random.rand(1024).astype(np.float64)
params_input = np.array([2.0, 0.5])

gradient = calculate_gradient_gpu(x_input, params_input)
print("Gradient example:", gradient)
```
In this example, `gpu_objective_function` is decorated with `@cuda.jit`, indicating it will be executed on the GPU.  Numba's CUDA library is used to move input data to the GPU (`cuda.to_device`) and perform the computation. I avoid explicit differentiation by using a simple forward difference method for clarity. The crucial aspect is the ability to calculate each gradient component in parallel. Note that I am using a dummy objective function which is also parallelizable; real-world problems may require more complex implementation.

**Example 2: GPU-Accelerated Hessian Approximation Update using PyTorch**
```python
import torch

def update_hessian_approximation_gpu(hessian_approx, gradient_delta, position_delta):
    gradient_delta_torch = torch.tensor(gradient_delta, dtype=torch.float64, device='cuda')
    position_delta_torch = torch.tensor(position_delta, dtype=torch.float64, device='cuda').unsqueeze(1)
    hessian_approx_torch = torch.tensor(hessian_approx, dtype=torch.float64, device='cuda')


    denominator = torch.dot(gradient_delta_torch, position_delta_torch.squeeze())
    
    if denominator != 0:
       term1 = (torch.matmul(position_delta_torch, position_delta_torch.T) / denominator)
       term2 = (torch.matmul(torch.matmul(hessian_approx_torch,gradient_delta_torch.unsqueeze(1)),torch.matmul(gradient_delta_torch.unsqueeze(0),hessian_approx_torch)) / denominator)
       hessian_approx_torch = hessian_approx_torch + term1 - term2
    
    return hessian_approx_torch.cpu().numpy()

# Dummy data for illustration
dim = 100
hessian = np.eye(dim).astype(np.float64)
grad_delta = np.random.rand(dim).astype(np.float64)
pos_delta = np.random.rand(dim).astype(np.float64)

updated_hessian = update_hessian_approximation_gpu(hessian, grad_delta, pos_delta)

print("Hessian update shape:", updated_hessian.shape)
```

This example employs PyTorch tensors to compute the updated Hessian approximation on the GPU.  `torch.tensor` moves arrays to the GPU and `device='cuda'` specifies that computations will occur on the GPU.  Crucially, PyTorch leverages highly optimized GPU kernels for matrix multiplication (`torch.matmul`), making it more efficient than a direct NumPy-based implementation of the same update. All matrix operations are performed using PyTorch's functions, avoiding the CPU entirely.  Afterwards, the results are copied back to the CPU via `.cpu().numpy()`.

**Example 3: GPU-Accelerated Search Direction Computation using TensorFlow**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

def compute_search_direction_gpu(hessian_inv, gradient):
  hessian_inv_tensor = tf.constant(hessian_inv, dtype=tf.float64)
  gradient_tensor = tf.constant(gradient, dtype=tf.float64)

  with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
     direction = -tf.linalg.matvec(hessian_inv_tensor, gradient_tensor)

  return direction.numpy()

# Dummy data for illustration
dim = 100
hessian_inv_input = np.random.rand(dim, dim).astype(np.float64)
gradient_input = np.random.rand(dim).astype(np.float64)

search_direction = compute_search_direction_gpu(hessian_inv_input, gradient_input)
print("Search direction shape:", search_direction.shape)
```

This example shows using TensorFlow to calculate the search direction on the GPU. `tf.constant` creates tensors on the default device (CPU). However,  `tf.device('/GPU:0')` directs the execution to the GPU. TensorFlow automatically handles the necessary data transfer. I use `tf.linalg.matvec` for efficient matrix-vector multiplication. This demonstration emphasizes the importance of choosing appropriate operations that TensorFlow or the used library accelerates, rather than reimplementing them manually.

To implement a complete GPU-accelerated BFGS, one would need to integrate these accelerated kernels, paying close attention to data transfer costs between the CPU and GPU. In my personal experience this has involved creating custom classes that handle data transfers, initialization, and function calls so that there is minimal CPU involvement during the optimization loop itself. A typical implementation might involve utilizing a framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow for all operations, creating custom optimizers that mimic the BFGS updates. Libraries like Numba are also helpful but require a more explicit design of GPU kernels. Careful profiling of these computational kernels, using tools specific to each framework, is critical in identifying the bottlenecks and ensure proper usage of the hardware.
