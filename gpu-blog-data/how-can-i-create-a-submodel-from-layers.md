Extracting a sub-model from a Keras model, specifically layers 'm' to 'n', without explicit looping constructs necessitates leveraging Keras's functional API capabilities.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects highlighted the limitations of iterative approaches when dealing with complex model architectures; the functional API offers a far more elegant and efficient solution for such sub-model extraction.  This approach allows for dynamic sub-model definition, critical for tasks like transfer learning and model surgery where the layers of interest aren't necessarily known a priori.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core principle involves accessing the underlying layer objects within the Keras model,  identified by their index or name.  The Keras functional API, fundamentally a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of the model, enables us to specify the input and output tensors directly, effectively defining a new model composed of a subset of the original layers. This avoids the need for explicit looping, which would be both inefficient and less readable for complex architectures.  We achieve this by treating each layer as a function that transforms its input tensor into an output tensor.  By connecting the desired input layer (layer 'm') to the desired output layer (layer 'n'), we construct the sub-model.  This is significantly more efficient than iterating through layers, especially in large models, as it avoids unnecessary data copies and overhead.

Critical to this process is understanding the structure of your original model.  While accessing layers by index is straightforward, using layer names provides robustness against changes in model architecture.  Layer names are often more descriptive and less prone to errors during code maintenance.  Consequently, I strongly recommend utilizing layer names whenever feasible.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Sub-model Extraction by Index**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Assume 'model' is a pre-trained Keras sequential model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Extract sub-model from layer 1 (index 1) to layer 2 (index 2)
m = 1
n = 2
sub_model = keras.Model(inputs=model.layers[m].input, outputs=model.layers[n].output)

# Verify the sub-model architecture
sub_model.summary()
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward approach using layer indices.  `model.layers[m].input` provides the input tensor to layer 'm', while `model.layers[n].output` provides the output tensor from layer 'n'. The Keras `Model` class then constructs the sub-model from these specified input and output tensors.  The `sub_model.summary()` call verifies the created sub-model's structure. Note that this approach relies on correct indexing and is potentially brittle if the model architecture changes.


**Example 2: Sub-model Extraction by Name**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Assume 'model' is a pre-trained Keras sequential model with named layers
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,), name='dense_1'),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', name='dense_2'),
    keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', name='dense_3'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', name='dense_4')
])


#Extract sub-model from layer 'dense_2' to layer 'dense_3'
m_layer = model.get_layer('dense_2')
n_layer = model.get_layer('dense_3')
sub_model = keras.Model(inputs=m_layer.input, outputs=n_layer.output)

# Verify the sub-model architecture
sub_model.summary()

```

This improved version utilizes layer names. `model.get_layer()` is used to retrieve layers by their names, making the code more robust to changes in the model architecture and easier to understand. This is my preferred method for its clarity and maintainability.  It also prevents potential index-based errors.


**Example 3:  Handling Functional Models**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a functional model
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', name='dense_1')(input_tensor)
x = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', name='dense_2')(x)
x = keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', name='dense_3')(x)
output_tensor = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', name='dense_4')(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)


# Extract sub-model using layer names from a functional model
m_layer = model.get_layer('dense_2')
n_layer = model.get_layer('dense_3')
sub_model = keras.Model(inputs=m_layer.input, outputs=n_layer.output)

# Verify the sub-model architecture
sub_model.summary()

```

This example showcases sub-model extraction from a functional Keras model. Functional models offer greater flexibility in architecture design.  The process remains identical; we retrieve layers by name and define the sub-model using the input and output tensors of the selected layers.  This approach is crucial for dealing with more complex, non-sequential model architectures.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on the Keras functional API.  A comprehensive text on deep learning frameworks, focusing on practical implementation details.  A research paper exploring efficient model manipulation techniques, particularly for transfer learning applications.


In conclusion, leveraging the Keras functional API, as demonstrated, provides an elegant and efficient method for creating sub-models without explicit loops.  By directly specifying input and output tensors, we bypass the inefficiencies of iterative approaches, leading to cleaner, more maintainable, and robust code, particularly crucial when dealing with large or complex model architectures. The use of layer names over indices further enhances robustness and readability.  Remember to always verify the created sub-model's architecture using `sub_model.summary()` to ensure the extraction was successful.
