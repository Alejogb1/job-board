The computational complexity of comparing all pairs of rows in a 2D array inherently scales quadratically with the number of rows.  This is a fundamental limitation stemming from the necessity of examining each row against every other row. Optimization strategies focus on minimizing constant factors and leveraging hardware capabilities rather than fundamentally altering this O(nÂ²) complexity, where 'n' represents the number of rows. My experience optimizing large-scale similarity analysis for genomic datasets has underscored this reality.  Efficient solutions hinge on careful data structuring and algorithm selection, tailored to the specific nature of the comparison operation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The most straightforward approach involves nested loops iterating through each row and comparing it to every subsequent row. However, this naive implementation, while conceptually simple, can prove inefficient for large datasets.  Significant performance gains can be achieved by carefully considering data representation and utilizing appropriate comparison techniques.  For instance, if the rows represent vectors, employing optimized vectorized operations, available in libraries like NumPy, drastically improves performance by leveraging parallel processing capabilities of modern CPUs.  Furthermore, if the comparison involves complex calculations, pre-computing intermediate results can reduce redundancy.  Finally, exploiting data locality, especially within cache memory, plays a crucial role in optimizing performance.

The core challenge lies in minimizing the cost of each individual row comparison.  This cost depends on the type of comparison being performed.  Simple element-wise equality checks are computationally cheap, while more complex comparisons, such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance calculations, require significantly more processing.  Thus, the optimal algorithm is highly dependent on the nature of this comparison operation.  For instance, if the rows contain numerical data and the comparison involves calculating Euclidean distance, the use of optimized mathematical libraries is paramount.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Naive Approach (Python):**

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_all_rows_naive(array_2d):
    """
    Compares all pairs of rows in a 2D array using nested loops.  Suitable for small arrays only.
    """
    num_rows = array_2d.shape[0]
    results = []
    for i in range(num_rows):
        for j in range(i + 1, num_rows):  # Avoid redundant comparisons
            comparison_result = np.array_equal(array_2d[i], array_2d[j]) #Example: Element-wise equality
            results.append((i, j, comparison_result))
    return results


array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9]])
results = compare_all_rows_naive(array)
print(results)
```

This example showcases the fundamental nested loop approach.  Its simplicity comes at the cost of performance.  It's suitable only for relatively small arrays.  The `np.array_equal` function provides an efficient element-wise comparison for NumPy arrays.  Replacing this with a more computationally intensive comparison would further amplify the performance degradation.


**Example 2:  Vectorized Approach (NumPy):**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist

def compare_all_rows_vectorized(array_2d):
    """
    Compares all pairs of rows using NumPy's broadcasting and cdist for efficient distance calculations.
    """
    distances = cdist(array_2d, array_2d, 'euclidean') #Example: Euclidean distance
    np.fill_diagonal(distances, np.inf) # Ignore self-comparisons
    indices = np.unravel_index(np.argmin(distances), distances.shape)
    min_distance = distances[indices]
    return min_distance, indices

array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9]])
min_distance, indices = compare_all_rows_vectorized(array)
print(f"Minimum distance: {min_distance}, Indices: {indices}")
```

This example leverages NumPy's broadcasting capabilities and `scipy.spatial.distance.cdist` for efficient pairwise distance calculations.  `cdist` is highly optimized for vectorized operations.  This approach significantly outperforms the naive approach, especially for larger arrays.  Note the use of `np.fill_diagonal` to avoid comparing a row with itself.  The example calculates Euclidean distance;  other distance metrics can be specified as the third argument to `cdist`.


**Example 3:  Chunking for Memory Management (Python with NumPy):**

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_all_rows_chunked(array_2d, chunk_size=1000):
    """
    Compares all pairs of rows in chunks to manage memory usage efficiently for extremely large arrays.
    """
    num_rows = array_2d.shape[0]
    results = []
    for i in range(0, num_rows, chunk_size):
        for j in range(i + chunk_size, num_rows, chunk_size):
            chunk1 = array_2d[i:i + chunk_size]
            chunk2 = array_2d[j:j + chunk_size]
            #Perform comparisons between chunk1 and chunk2 (using vectorized methods as in Example 2)
            #Append results to the 'results' list

    return results


#Example usage (Illustrative;  comparison logic omitted for brevity)
array = np.random.rand(10000, 10)  # Example large array
results = compare_all_rows_chunked(array)

```

This example addresses the memory limitations encountered with extremely large 2D arrays that might not fit entirely into RAM.  It processes the array in smaller, manageable chunks.  The comparison logic within each chunk can utilize the vectorized techniques from Example 2.  This approach trades off some performance for significantly improved memory management, allowing processing of datasets that would otherwise be intractable.
