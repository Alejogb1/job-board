TensorFlow's computational graph relies on backpropagation to update weights and biases; if these parameters are not changing, it indicates an issue in the gradient calculation or the application of these gradients by the optimizer. During my time working on a recurrent neural network for time-series forecasting, I encountered a seemingly static model despite numerous training iterations. This experience helped me understand several critical failure points that commonly prevent weight and bias updates. The most common causes revolve around improper gradient flow, issues with the optimizer, and incorrect model definition.

First, let's examine issues with gradient flow. Gradients represent the rate of change of the loss function with respect to the trainable variables (weights and biases). If these gradients are not being correctly calculated or propagated, updates cannot occur. Several factors can impede gradient flow. One critical aspect is the chosen activation function. If a network uses saturating activation functions like sigmoid or tanh in deep layers and the gradients are multiplied repeatedly during backpropagation, gradients can diminish exponentially, becoming practically zero at earlier layers - a phenomenon known as vanishing gradients. This prevents weights and biases in earlier layers from being updated effectively. ReLU and its variants such as Leaky ReLU and ELU, are often preferred as they mitigate this issue due to having a linear segment where gradients remain constant during backpropagation. Another common problem is the presence of numerical instability. Computations involving very large or very small numbers can lead to overflow or underflow issues, causing the gradients to be incorrect, or in extreme cases, NaN values. This numerical instability can stem from the choice of loss function. The loss function needs to be designed to be numerically stable for gradient computations, and sometimes requires a transformation of the input data. Normalization techniques like batch normalization can also help in this scenario by ensuring that inputs to different layers have stable distributions.

Another cause of static models can stem from optimizer issues. The chosen optimizer plays a crucial role in how the computed gradients are used to update weights and biases. If the learning rate is too low, updates become extremely small and the learning process will appear stagnant. Similarly, if the learning rate is too high, it could cause oscillations and prevent the model from converging. Some advanced optimizers like Adam, RMSprop, or SGD with momentum use different strategies to find a good minimum in the loss landscape. A poorly tuned optimizer or an unsuitable choice will hamper progress despite correct gradient calculation. For example, a vanilla SGD may need a careful tuning of the learning rate and may not converge if the loss surface is not smooth. For example, when using a decaying learning rate scheduler, if the decay rate is excessively high or starts too early, learning could stall prematurely as well. Furthermore, gradient clipping is sometimes necessary to avoid exploding gradients. While not causing stagnation directly, unchecked exploding gradients can lead to unstable behavior and make progress difficult. The optimizer needs appropriate configuration in terms of parameters and also needs to be consistent with the magnitude of gradients it is receiving.

Finally, the model itself may have errors in its definition which prevent updating. An obvious, but often overlooked error is failing to mark variables as trainable. In TensorFlow, one needs to explicitly define which tensors are trainable variables, usually using `tf.Variable`. If these tensors are inadvertently treated as constant, their values will not change. Another source of error could be the way the loss is computed. If, for example, one forgets to take the mean of a batch loss or misuses `tf.reduce_sum` instead of `tf.reduce_mean`, the calculated gradients may be on very different scales. This mismatch may hinder the learning process. If the model architecture is poorly specified, it may simply lack the capacity to learn patterns in the data, causing weights and biases not to change in meaningful ways. This may be due to incorrect dimensions in layers or the lack of non-linearities.

Here are some code examples to illustrate these concepts.

**Example 1: Problematic activation function and numerical instability**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Inefficient usage of sigmoid resulting in vanishing gradients
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='sigmoid'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='sigmoid'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])


# Poor numerical stability, log(0) will result in -inf
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return -tf.reduce_mean(y_true * tf.math.log(y_pred) + (1-y_true) * tf.math.log(1-y_pred))

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# This type of model will likely not update the first layers
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates the issue of using sigmoid functions in deeper networks. The repeated gradients are often close to zero in the flat parts of the sigmoid function, particularly in the earlier layers. The custom loss function, when applied with probabilities close to 0 and 1 can also lead to numerical instabilities (attempting to take `log(0)`). The model training using `custom_loss` may be unstable and unable to converge effectively.

**Example 2: Incorrect trainable variables and optimizer configuration**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect use of tf.constant, model is not learning
weights = tf.constant(tf.random.normal((10, 1)), dtype=tf.float32)
bias = tf.constant(tf.random.normal((1,)), dtype=tf.float32)

def forward_pass(x):
    return tf.matmul(x, weights) + bias

# Loss defined in terms of tf.constant tensors
def loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.001) # Learning rate is very low

# This model will not learn, as weights and bias are not tf.Variable
```

**Commentary:** In this example, `weights` and `bias` are defined as constants using `tf.constant`. The optimizer will not be able to update these values during training. Additionally, the `SGD` optimizer is also configured with a very low learning rate that may cause slow progress. To allow training, one should use `tf.Variable` and may want to use a more advanced optimizer.

**Example 3: Correct update of weights and bias**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Correct usage of tf.Variable and ReLU
weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((10, 1)), dtype=tf.float32)
bias = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((1,)), dtype=tf.float32)

def forward_pass(x):
    return tf.matmul(x, weights) + bias

def loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))


optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)


@tf.function
def train_step(x, y_true):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      y_pred = forward_pass(x)
      loss_value = loss(y_true, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss_value, [weights, bias])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [weights, bias]))
    return loss_value

# This model will learn, if data is appropriate
```

**Commentary:** This final example shows the correct approach. Here, `weights` and `bias` are trainable variables using `tf.Variable`. We have used Adam as the optimizer. The `tf.GradientTape` is used to calculate the gradients, and the `apply_gradients` function is used to update weights and bias. This model will update parameters correctly.

For further reading, I would recommend researching literature on optimization algorithms, specifically Adam, RMSprop, and variants of Stochastic Gradient Descent. I would also encourage one to study material focusing on vanishing and exploding gradients, activation functions, and numerical stability in deep learning. Exploring how batch normalization can help stabilize gradients, and how regularization methods can improve learning can also prove valuable. Finally, studying Tensorflow official documentation and tutorials, particularly sections about `tf.Variable`, optimizers, and gradient calculation is highly recommended. Examining practical examples of model training with Tensorflow can greatly aid in troubleshooting related issues.
