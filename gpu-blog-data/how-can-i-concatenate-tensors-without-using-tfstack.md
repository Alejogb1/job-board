The fundamental difference between `tf.stack` and concatenation in TensorFlow lies in how they alter the dimensionality of the input tensors. `tf.stack` creates a new dimension, effectively stacking tensors along a new axis. Concatenation, conversely, combines tensors along an existing axis, without introducing new dimensions. When I've needed to join tensors without adding a dimension, direct concatenation has consistently been the preferred approach.

The typical use case for concatenation occurs when you want to combine, for instance, output feature maps from different branches of a neural network before further processing or when assembling batch data. The key here is the preservation of dimensionality; if your inputs are rank-3 tensors (e.g., representing images with channels) and you need the resulting output to also be rank-3, concatenation is the direct solution. Using `tf.stack` would produce a rank-4 tensor, requiring further reshaping operations.

TensorFlow provides two primary functions for concatenation: `tf.concat` and `tf.experimental.numpy.concatenate`. While they achieve the same result conceptually, they operate within different TensorFlow execution contexts. `tf.concat` is part of the core TensorFlow API and is suitable for typical TensorFlow graphs and eager execution. The numpy equivalent, `tf.experimental.numpy.concatenate`, works similarly but operates within the experimental NumPy API and facilitates compatibility with numpy arrays within TensorFlow. The choice between the two depends on the preferred development style and compatibility needs within a given project, but for a TensorFlow-centric workflow, `tf.concat` is generally preferred.

To understand how `tf.concat` operates, it’s important to specify the axis along which the tensors will be joined. This axis parameter, a zero-indexed integer, dictates which dimension of the input tensors is extended. The critical constraint is that all input tensors, except for the specified axis, must have matching dimensions. Attempting to concatenate tensors along the same axis with differing shapes will produce a runtime error, as the shapes become incompatible. Consider that, when concatenating tensors, the size of the target axis changes by summing the sizes of that axis across all concatenated tensors.

Let's consider three practical code examples to illustrate these concepts:

**Example 1: Concatenating along the Channel Dimension of Image Tensors**

Assume we're working with grayscale images represented as rank-3 tensors (height, width, channels). Suppose we have two such tensors, `image1` and `image2`, with a single channel each, representing two different image filters applied to the same underlying image. We want to combine these into a single tensor containing both channels.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume images are of size 10x10 with 1 channel
image1 = tf.random.normal((10, 10, 1))
image2 = tf.random.normal((10, 10, 1))

# Concatenate along the channel axis (axis=2)
combined_image = tf.concat([image1, image2], axis=2)

print("Shape of image1:", image1.shape)
print("Shape of image2:", image2.shape)
print("Shape of combined_image:", combined_image.shape)

# Expected output:
# Shape of image1: (10, 10, 1)
# Shape of image2: (10, 10, 1)
# Shape of combined_image: (10, 10, 2)
```

In this code, `tf.concat([image1, image2], axis=2)` combines `image1` and `image2` along the channel dimension (axis=2). The resulting tensor `combined_image` will have a shape of `(10, 10, 2)`, having two channels. Note that the height and width remain the same. This functionality is crucial for processing multi-channel feature maps in CNNs, where different filters' outputs are often combined before pooling or other operations.

**Example 2: Concatenating along the Batch Dimension**

Consider a situation where training is performed in smaller batches due to hardware constraints and there is a need to assemble the results into a larger batch after inference on the individual batches. Let’s assume we have two batches of feature vectors, each with 3 vectors of dimension 5.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume batches are of shape (3, 5)
batch1 = tf.random.normal((3, 5))
batch2 = tf.random.normal((3, 5))

# Concatenate along the batch dimension (axis=0)
combined_batch = tf.concat([batch1, batch2], axis=0)

print("Shape of batch1:", batch1.shape)
print("Shape of batch2:", batch2.shape)
print("Shape of combined_batch:", combined_batch.shape)

# Expected Output:
# Shape of batch1: (3, 5)
# Shape of batch2: (3, 5)
# Shape of combined_batch: (6, 5)
```

In this example, `tf.concat([batch1, batch2], axis=0)` joins `batch1` and `batch2` along the batch dimension (axis=0). The resulting `combined_batch` has a shape of `(6, 5)`, reflecting the combined batch size without altering the feature dimension. This method is regularly used during distributed training to aggregate results.

**Example 3: Combining different sized tensors along a sequence axis**

Let's consider how to use concatenation in a scenario with different sized sequences along a common feature dimension. Assume the vectors represents features in a time sequence, where the time dimension might be different between samples.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume sequences of lengths 3, 2 and 4, with 5 features
sequence1 = tf.random.normal((3, 5))
sequence2 = tf.random.normal((2, 5))
sequence3 = tf.random.normal((4, 5))

# Concatenate along the time axis (axis=0)
combined_sequence = tf.concat([sequence1, sequence2, sequence3], axis=0)

print("Shape of sequence1:", sequence1.shape)
print("Shape of sequence2:", sequence2.shape)
print("Shape of sequence3:", sequence3.shape)
print("Shape of combined_sequence:", combined_sequence.shape)

# Expected Output:
# Shape of sequence1: (3, 5)
# Shape of sequence2: (2, 5)
# Shape of sequence3: (4, 5)
# Shape of combined_sequence: (9, 5)
```

Here we combine three sequences along axis 0, which in this case represents the time or sequence axis. The number of time points increases from 3 to 9 while the feature dimension remains unchanged. This is essential in many sequential learning tasks and it highlights the flexibility of concatenation with variable input sizes when the common dimensions match.

In each of the preceding examples, the core operation remains the same: concatenate tensors along a specified existing axis without introducing a new dimension. The critical factor is ensuring the dimensions are compatible except along the axis of concatenation. This differs fundamentally from stacking where a new axis is introduced.

For further study, I recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.concat`, which delves deeper into the various use cases and potential edge cases. Similarly, exploring how concatenation is implemented in the context of recurrent neural networks can be insightful. Also, I recommend studying examples of sequence-to-sequence architectures as they often use concatenation as part of the decoder input construction. Finally, research papers detailing different model architectures that heavily rely on skip connections are another good source. These papers often show how feature maps are joined through concatenation. The key is to grasp the conceptual distinction between stacking and concatenation, along with the implications for tensor dimensionality.
