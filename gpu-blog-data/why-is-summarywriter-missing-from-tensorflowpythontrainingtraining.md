`SummaryWriter`, a crucial component for logging TensorFlow training data, is not directly located within the `tensorflow.python.training.training` module. This is a common source of confusion, particularly for those transitioning from older TensorFlow versions or relying on outdated documentation. The apparent absence stems from a significant architectural shift in TensorFlow, specifically concerning how graph execution and data management are handled. Historically, in TensorFlow 1.x, utilities related to training, like checkpointing and summary writing, were more tightly coupled within the core training loop. This is no longer the case.

The fundamental reason `SummaryWriter` is absent from `tensorflow.python.training.training` is that it is now primarily a utility associated with the `tf.summary` module and functions independently of the core training logic. This separation of concerns is a deliberate design choice. `tf.summary` handles the mechanics of collecting data (such as scalar values, histograms, or images) and writing this data in a format that TensorBoard can parse. The actual training loop, managed in part by classes within `tensorflow.python.training.training`, focuses purely on computation and model updates.

Previously, a single `FileWriter` object (the predecessor to `SummaryWriter`) was typically created and passed around within a training function. This tight integration often led to complex dependency management and limited flexibility. The new approach in TensorFlow 2.x decouples data logging from the training process itself. You create `SummaryWriter` instances where needed (often outside the training loop itself), enabling the user to log data from various points in the code without impacting the main model training pipeline. Furthermore, the `tf.summary` module offers context managers (like `tf.summary.FileWriter` when used with the `with` statement) that auto-manage the summary writer, simplifying the logging process further and ensuring that each log is tied to a correct scope.

This shift also aligns better with the use of Keras, which largely abstracts away much of the lower-level training loop manipulation. When using `model.fit()`, logging to TensorBoard through the `TensorBoard` callback leverages `tf.summary` and `SummaryWriter` implicitly. In custom training loops, we handle it ourselves, but the pattern is consistent. The benefit of this decoupling is increased modularity, allowing users to leverage summary logging in arbitrary contexts, whether they are training custom models, performing data preprocessing, or debugging network internals.

Here are several code snippets that will highlight how this separation works in practice.

**Example 1: Basic `SummaryWriter` Use**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

logdir = os.path.join("logs", "example_1")
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(logdir)

with writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.scalar('my_scalar', 0.75, step=0)
    tf.summary.scalar('my_scalar', 0.8, step=1)

print(f"Logs saved to {logdir}")
```

In this example, I'm not using a training loop at all, emphasizing that `SummaryWriter` is independent. `tf.summary.create_file_writer()` generates an instance pointing to the log directory, and data is written to the log using `tf.summary.scalar()` within the `writer.as_default()` context. This pattern decouples the summary logging logic from any particular training function. I intentionally used different step values, and the scalar value differs in each. This will show different steps in tensorboard.

**Example 2: `SummaryWriter` with a Custom Training Loop**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Sample model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

logdir = os.path.join("logs", "example_2")
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(logdir)

# Sample data
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, 1))

epochs = 100

for epoch in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x_train)
        loss = loss_fn(y_train, y_pred)

    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))

    with writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=epoch)
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch} , loss: {loss.numpy()}")

print(f"Logs saved to {logdir}")
```

Here, I implement a custom training loop, demonstrating how `SummaryWriter` integrates with a more traditional TensorFlow workflow. I create a `writer` outside the loop. Within the training loop, the loss is calculated, gradients are applied, and then, *after* a training step, the loss is logged. The `with writer.as_default()` context manager ensures that the logs go to the correct location and it's tied to a correct scope. Notice the absence of any `SummaryWriter`-related classes or methods inside the `training` module - everything is from `tf.summary`. The loop iterates for `epochs` to show several log outputs.

**Example 3: `SummaryWriter` with TensorBoard Callback in Keras**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Sample model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Sample data
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, 1))

logdir = os.path.join("logs", "example_3")
tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=logdir)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback], verbose=0)
print(f"Logs saved to {logdir}")
```

This final example shows how Keras handles `SummaryWriter` transparently. I configure the `TensorBoard` callback with a specified log directory, and it automatically uses `SummaryWriter` behind the scenes to record relevant metrics during the training process. I have set `verbose=0` to keep the output clean for the purpose of this example.  The `model.fit` automatically collects and saves the log file without requiring explicit calls to `tf.summary`.

For further learning and to gain a deeper understanding of this paradigm, I recommend exploring the following resources, all publicly available from TensorFlow:

1.  The official TensorFlow documentation on the `tf.summary` module. It contains detailed explanations of its functions, including `tf.summary.scalar`, `tf.summary.image`, and `tf.summary.histogram` as well as a deep explanation of how the `FileWriter` works internally.
2.  The Keras documentation about the `TensorBoard` callback. This resource helps understand how the callback interacts with `tf.summary` for seamless TensorBoard logging. The document provides important examples of both pre-built models and custom training loops.
3.  TensorFlow's official tutorial on writing custom training loops. This guide often details how to use `tf.summary` with custom loops, offering practical hands-on experience. These tutorials cover both standard approaches and less-common scenarios.

In conclusion, `SummaryWriter` is not in `tensorflow.python.training.training` because it has been intentionally decoupled to provide more flexible and modular logging capabilities, aligning with the shift in how TensorFlow manages its architecture, particularly when using Keras. The `tf.summary` module offers all the necessary components. This separation empowers users to implement sophisticated logging strategies both inside and outside traditional training loops.
