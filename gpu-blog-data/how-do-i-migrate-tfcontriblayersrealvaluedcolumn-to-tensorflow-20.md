Migrating from `tf.contrib.layers.real_valued_column` to TensorFlow 2.x requires a fundamental shift in how feature columns are handled. The `tf.contrib` module, where this function resided, has been deprecated. The core functionality, however, has been moved and restructured within TensorFlow 2's core API. In essence, `real_valued_column` was a mechanism to define a numeric feature for a model; in TensorFlow 2, we achieve the same with the `tf.feature_column` module and specifically, with the `tf.feature_column.numeric_column` function. This transition requires careful attention to argument mapping and how feature columns are subsequently used within the model building process.

The primary purpose of `real_valued_column` in older TensorFlow was to define a feature that holds continuous numeric data, and to potentially apply transformations like normalization or bucketization during the input pipeline. In its most basic form, it specified a feature's name and potentially its shape, which was often one-dimensional but could be adjusted for multi-dimensional input features. TensorFlow 2 maintains the basic functionality but reorganizes this into a more explicit and flexible system. Instead of `tf.contrib.layers.real_valued_column(column_name, ...)` you will use `tf.feature_column.numeric_column(key=column_name, ...)`.

The transformation logic, like normalization or bucketization, is not directly embedded within the `numeric_column` definition itself as it might have appeared within some use cases of the older `real_valued_column`. In TensorFlow 2, such transformations are handled separately using a combination of `tf.keras.layers` or by defining a transformation function and using it as part of the dataset pre-processing pipeline. This makes the data transformation process more explicit and allows for greater control over how features are processed.

The shift also affects how feature columns are used in the model construction phase. Previously, `real_valued_column` outputs could be directly fed into the deep neural network API such as a `DNNClassifier` or `DNNRegressor` within the `tf.estimator` framework. With TensorFlow 2, feature columns need to be embedded into the model using either `tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures` layer within the Keras framework or by directly using `tf.feature_column.input_layer` when building custom models.

To illustrate these changes with concrete examples, let us examine three scenarios based on my experience with migrating several older TensorFlow projects to the current version.

**Example 1: Basic Migration with Default Parameters**

Consider a scenario where a simple numerical feature, representing age, was defined in TensorFlow 1.x using `real_valued_column` without any additional transformations. The code might have looked something like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1.x syntax
age_column = tf.contrib.layers.real_valued_column("age")
```

In TensorFlow 2.x, this translates directly to:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 2.x syntax
age_column = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(key="age")
```

The functionality of this specific feature column remains the same; it describes a continuous numeric feature called "age." The difference is primarily in its API and location within the TensorFlow library. The usage within a model construction will differ as shown in the subsequent examples, as in TensorFlow 2, a `DenseFeatures` layer is generally used as an intermediate step before feeding the feature into subsequent layers.

**Example 2: Integrating with Keras Model using `DenseFeatures`**

Building on Example 1, let's say we now want to feed this `age_column` into a basic Keras model. In TensorFlow 1.x, feature columns could often be provided directly to a `DNNClassifier` estimator, alongside training data. The process is more explicit in TensorFlow 2. The following code snippet illustrates the model construction:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the numeric feature column
age_column = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(key="age")

# Define the inputs. This is a placeholder for a dataset
feature_layer_inputs = {
    'age': tf.keras.Input(shape=(1,), name='age', dtype=tf.float32)
}

# Instantiate a DenseFeatures layer to process the feature column
feature_layer = tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures(age_column)

# Build a simple Keras Model.
inputs = feature_layer_inputs
x = feature_layer(inputs)
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu')(x)
output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=output)

# Print a summary of the model.
model.summary()
```
This snippet first defines the numeric column. We then define an input dictionary which is a placeholder for our data. Critically, we utilize a `tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures` layer to take the feature column and transform it to an input layer suitable for the dense layers. The subsequent dense layers form our simple linear regression model that uses the processed feature as input. This demonstrates the necessary use of a transformation layer for feature columns within Keras framework.

**Example 3: Handling Transformations and Input Layers Directly**

In some scenarios you might need more fine-grained control of the feature processing such as applying normalization before feeding into the model. Using TensorFlow 2, this can be achieved by explicitly specifying a transformation using `tf.keras.layers`. Furthermore, we can bypass the `DenseFeatures` layer and use the `tf.feature_column.input_layer` API directly when custom model building is needed outside of a standard Keras setup.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the numeric feature column
age_column = tf.feature_column.numeric_column(key="age")

# Apply a simple normalization step.
def transform_fn(features):
    mean = tf.constant([30.0], dtype=tf.float32)  # Example mean of ages.
    std = tf.constant([10.0], dtype=tf.float32)   # Example standard deviation.
    normalized_feature = (features['age'] - mean) / std
    return {"age": normalized_feature}

# Create a sample batch of data.
features_batch = {"age": tf.constant(np.array([[20.0], [35.0], [40.0]], dtype=np.float32))}

# Apply transformation
transformed_features = transform_fn(features_batch)

# Build the input layer from the feature column
input_layer = tf.feature_column.input_layer(transformed_features, feature_columns=[age_column])

# Print to show result
print(input_layer)
```

In this example, a transformation function `transform_fn` performs standardization on the raw input value for age.  The `tf.feature_column.input_layer` then consumes the dictionary of transformed input features along with the feature columns, yielding the processed feature as a Tensor. This approach gives full control of feature transformation and can be directly integrated into custom model architectures, especially when utilizing low-level APIs of TensorFlow 2.

In summary, migrating from `tf.contrib.layers.real_valued_column` to TensorFlow 2 involves understanding the separation between feature definition and application. In TensorFlow 2, you use `tf.feature_column.numeric_column` for the definition, `tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures` or `tf.feature_column.input_layer` to utilize them within the model and you would explicitly construct custom transformation layers within your input pipeline when more advanced processing is necessary. This modular approach improves flexibility and encourages best practices in model development and feature engineering.

For further exploration of the TensorFlow 2 feature column API, I recommend referring to the official TensorFlow documentation for the `tf.feature_column` module and reviewing examples within the Keras section which detail how to use `DenseFeatures` effectively. Additionally, the TensorFlow tutorials on structured data processing can provide more examples of data transformation and feature engineering within the new ecosystem. Specifically focusing on sections detailing data input pipelines, dataset APIs, and the new Keras input API will improve understanding during this migration. Lastly, practicing these principles by migrating existing codebases incrementally and testing each step is key for a successful transition.
