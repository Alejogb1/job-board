A PyTorch fully connected layer, or Linear layer, appearing to have zero parameters is almost invariably a consequence of incorrect model construction or a misunderstanding of PyTorch's dynamic computation graph.  In my experience debugging large-scale neural networks, this issue frequently stems from either data-type mismatches within the input tensor or a failure to appropriately initialize the layer's weights and biases.  It's crucial to remember that PyTorch's `nn.Linear` module *does* contain parameters; the absence of reported parameters indicates a problem upstream in the network's definition or data pipeline.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `nn.Linear` module in PyTorch, representing a fully connected layer, internally maintains two primary parameter tensors:  `weight` and `bias`.  The `weight` tensor defines the connection weights between the input and output neurons, while the `bias` tensor provides a bias term added to each output neuron.  These parameters are learned during the training process using backpropagation.  The number of parameters directly correlates with the input and output dimensions of the layer:  `input_features * output_features` for the weight matrix and `output_features` for the bias vector.

A zero-parameter count suggests that these tensors are either not created or are of zero size.  This can occur due to several reasons:

* **Incorrect Input Dimensions:** If the input tensor fed to the `nn.Linear` layer has zero dimensions (e.g., an empty tensor or a tensor with shape `(0,*)`), the layer's internal mechanisms won't initialize the weight matrix correctly. The layer might be created, but the internal parameter tensors remain uninitialized, resulting in a zero parameter count.

* **Data Type Mismatch:** A subtle but easily overlooked error involves using incompatible data types. For example, if the input tensor is of an unsupported type (like a string tensor), or the layer's `dtype` is inconsistently defined, this can prevent parameter initialization.  PyTorch will often implicitly handle type conversions, but in edge cases, this can lead to unexpected behavior, including the failure to create parameters.

* **Layer Misconfiguration:**  Errors within the `nn.Linear` constructor, such as specifying incorrect input and output feature dimensions (e.g., `in_features=0` or `out_features=0`), will naturally result in no parameters being created.  This is a straightforward programming error easily caught during code review.

* **Incorrect Model Initialization:**  Failing to call `model.to(device)` before training, where `device` is 'cuda' or 'cpu', can sometimes lead to unexpected parameter behavior.  Even though parameters might exist, they could be on a device inaccessible to PyTorchâ€™s parameter counting mechanism.

* **Incorrect Parameter Sharing:**  If the `nn.Linear` layer is inadvertently sharing parameters with another layer in a manner that prevents independent parameter updates, it might appear parameterless. This is unusual but possible in complex network architectures.

Addressing these issues requires careful inspection of the model's structure, input data, and the layer's configuration.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Input Dimensions**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Linear(10, 5)  # Correctly defined layer
input_tensor = torch.randn(0, 10)  # Incorrect: Empty input tensor

output = model(input_tensor)
print(sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters()))  # Output: 0
```

This example demonstrates how an empty input tensor prevents the correct initialization of the `nn.Linear` layer's parameters. The `numel()` function calculates the total number of elements in a tensor. The sum over all parameters will correctly reflect the zero parameters created due to the flawed input.

**Example 2: Data Type Mismatch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Linear(10, 5)
input_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]], dtype=torch.int32) #Incorrect dtype

output = model(input_tensor.float()) #Explicit casting to float resolves the problem
print(sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters())) # Output: 55 (If not cast: Likely to throw an error)

```

This example highlights the potential problems arising from using integers when a float tensor is expected. While PyTorch often performs implicit casting, it's crucial to maintain data type consistency for reliability, especially within custom neural network modules.

**Example 3: Correct Implementation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Linear(10, 5)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)  # Correct input tensor

output = model(input_tensor)
print(sum(p.numel() for p in model.parameters()))  # Output: 55
print(model.weight.shape) # Output: torch.Size([5, 10])
print(model.bias.shape) # Output: torch.Size([5])
```

This example showcases a correctly implemented fully connected layer.  The output demonstrates the expected number of parameters (55 = (10 * 5) + 5). The weight and bias dimensions are also printed for clarity, confirming the correct initialization.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation is your most comprehensive resource.  Understanding the nuances of tensor operations and the `nn.Module` class is vital.  Thoroughly review the documentation on the `nn.Linear` module, paying close attention to the arguments and expected input formats.  Explore PyTorch's tutorials on building and training neural networks.  Finally, I'd recommend consulting textbooks on deep learning and neural networks to solidify your foundational understanding of the underlying concepts.  Debugging effectively relies on a firm grasp of theory and practice.
