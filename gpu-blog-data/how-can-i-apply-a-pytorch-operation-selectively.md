Selective application of PyTorch operations to specific rows hinges on efficient indexing and masking.  Over the years, working on large-scale image classification projects, I've encountered this frequently, particularly when dealing with data augmentation or applying specialized transformations only to subsets of my data based on class labels or other metadata.  Directly modifying tensors in-place is generally discouraged for maintainability and reproducibility; therefore, the preferred approach is to leverage PyTorch's powerful indexing capabilities.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core strategy involves creating a boolean mask that identifies the rows targeted for the operation.  This mask is then used to index the tensor, isolating the desired rows.  The operation is applied to this indexed subset, and the result is subsequently integrated back into the original tensor.  This process ensures that only the specified rows are modified, leaving the others untouched.  The efficiency of this approach largely depends on the choice of masking and indexing techniques, preferring vectorized operations whenever possible to avoid looping which can dramatically impact performance, especially on large datasets.  For instance, if I’m selectively applying a normalization operation to rows representing images belonging to a specific class, the class labels themselves would dictate the generation of the boolean mask.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Selective Row-wise Mean Subtraction using Boolean Indexing**

This example demonstrates selective mean subtraction on rows of a tensor based on a pre-defined condition.  Assume each row in the tensor represents a feature vector, and we want to subtract the mean only from rows where a corresponding boolean flag is True.

```python
import torch

# Sample data
data = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
flags = torch.tensor([True, False, True, False])  # Boolean mask

# Create a masked tensor
masked_data = data[flags]

# Calculate the mean across columns of selected rows
means = torch.mean(masked_data, dim=1, keepdim=True)

# Subtract the mean from selected rows and re-integrate into original tensor
result = data.clone()  # Ensures we do not modify the original data in place
result[flags] = masked_data - means

print(f"Original data:\n{data}\n")
print(f"Result:\n{result}")
```

This code first isolates the rows corresponding to True values in the `flags` tensor.  The mean is then calculated along the columns (dim=1) of the selected rows, while `keepdim=True` preserves the row dimension for subsequent subtraction.  The crucial step is the assignment `result[flags] = masked_data - means`, which efficiently updates only the selected rows in the cloned `result` tensor. Cloning ensures that the original `data` tensor remains untouched.

**Example 2:  Advanced Indexing with Multiple Conditions**

This example extends the previous one by incorporating multiple conditions for more nuanced selection.  We might want to apply an operation only to rows satisfying two or more criteria simultaneously.

```python
import torch

# Sample data
data = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
condition1 = data[:, 0] > 5  # Rows where the first element is greater than 5
condition2 = data[:, 2] < 10 # Rows where the last element is less than 10

# Combine conditions using logical AND
combined_condition = condition1 & condition2

# Apply operation only to rows satisfying both conditions
result = data.clone()
result[combined_condition] = result[combined_condition] * 2

print(f"Original data:\n{data}\n")
print(f"Result:\n{result}")

```

Here, `condition1` and `condition2` define separate selection criteria.  The `&` operator performs element-wise logical AND, creating a `combined_condition` that's only True when both conditions hold.  This combined condition serves as the boolean mask, enabling targeted application of the operation (doubling the values in this case).

**Example 3:  Selective Application of a Custom Function**

This example demonstrates using advanced indexing with a custom function for more complex transformations. This method is very useful when working with more sophisticated row operations that can't be expressed with simple arithmetic.

```python
import torch

def custom_operation(row):
    return torch.log(row + 1)  #Example custom function

# Sample data
data = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
indices_to_modify = torch.tensor([0, 2])  #Indices of rows to modify

# Apply the custom operation selectively
result = data.clone()
result[indices_to_modify] = custom_operation(result[indices_to_modify])

print(f"Original data:\n{data}\n")
print(f"Result:\n{result}")

```

This code directly applies a function `custom_operation` to rows specified by `indices_to_modify`. It highlights the flexibility of PyTorch’s indexing allowing for integration with custom logic without the performance hit often associated with explicit looping.  Note the use of `result.clone()` to protect the original data.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation itself is an invaluable resource.  Familiarize yourself with the sections on tensor indexing and advanced indexing.  Additionally, textbooks focusing on deep learning with PyTorch can provide further context and broader applications of these techniques.  Finally, review materials on efficient vectorized operations in NumPy and PyTorch as this significantly impacts performance in real-world applications.  Understanding broadcasting rules is crucial for leveraging PyTorch's efficient vectorization capabilities.  Careful consideration of memory management is also essential, particularly when working with very large datasets.  In my experience, prematurely optimizing memory often leads to less readable and maintainable code, so it’s usually best to focus on algorithmic efficiency first and then address memory issues.
