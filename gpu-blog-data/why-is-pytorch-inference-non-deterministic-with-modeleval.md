PyTorch's non-deterministic behavior during inference, even with `model.eval()` invoked, stems primarily from the use of stochastic operations within model architectures,  regardless of whether dropout or batch normalization are explicitly employed.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image recognition projects highlighted this frequently overlooked nuance. While `model.eval()` disables training-specific operations like dropout and sets batch normalization to use running statistics, several other components can introduce non-determinism.

**1.  Explanation of Non-Deterministic Inference in PyTorch**

The deterministic nature of a computation is guaranteed only when all operations involved are themselves deterministic and the order of execution is precisely defined.  PyTorch's flexibility, which allows for dynamic computation graphs and custom CUDA kernels, introduces potential deviations from this strict requirement.  Several sources contribute to this:

* **Non-deterministic CUDA operations:**  CUDA kernels, especially those involving parallel computations or memory access patterns, can exhibit non-deterministic behavior due to variations in thread scheduling and memory access timing.  Even seemingly simple operations can become non-deterministic across different GPU architectures or even different runs on the same GPU. This is significantly amplified when dealing with large models and extensive computational graphs.

* **CuDNN algorithms:** The cuDNN library, widely used for deep learning operations, offers various algorithms for operations like convolution and matrix multiplication.  These algorithms may use different internal heuristics, leading to slightly different results.  The selection of the algorithm might be influenced by factors like input tensor dimensions and GPU capabilities, resulting in variations across runs.  CuDNN's selection process is not consistently deterministic across different executions unless explicitly configured.

* **Random number generation:**  Although seemingly unrelated to `model.eval()`, subtle uses of random number generation within a model's architecture (beyond dropout) can cause non-determinism.  This might include custom layers involving stochastic processes, or even unintentional inclusion of random number generators within activation functions or loss calculations (if they are embedded in the forward pass and not solely during training).

* **Floating-point arithmetic:** The inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic can lead to subtle differences in results, especially with complex models and multiple operations.  These accumulated variations might not be significant in most cases, but can accumulate and affect the final output, particularly in situations where the model is sensitive to minute changes in intermediate values.

Therefore, even after setting the model to evaluation mode, subtle variations in CUDA kernel execution, cuDNN algorithm selection, and floating-point arithmetic can introduce non-determinism.  This is not a bug, but rather a consequence of the underlying hardware and software architecture involved.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate potential scenarios leading to non-deterministic inference, even with `model.eval()`:

**Example 1: Custom CUDA Kernel with Non-Deterministic Behavior**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyCustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # ... other code ...

    def forward(self, x):
        # Assume this involves a custom CUDA kernel that is non-deterministic
        with torch.no_grad():
            # Non-deterministic CUDA kernel call here (hypothetical)
            output = self.custom_cuda_kernel(x)
            return output

model = nn.Sequential(MyCustomLayer(), nn.Linear(10, 1))
model.eval()

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
output1 = model(input_tensor)
output2 = model(input_tensor)

print(torch.equal(output1, output2)) # Likely to print False
```

This example showcases a custom CUDA kernel that might have inherent non-determinism. Even in `eval()` mode, the kernel's unpredictable behavior would lead to differing outputs.

**Example 2:  CuDNN Algorithm Selection Variability**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.backends.cudnn as cudnn

model = nn.Sequential(nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(1024,10)) #Illustrative

cudnn.benchmark = True # Enable CuDNN auto-tuning, which can lead to variation

model.eval()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1,3,32,32)
output1 = model(input_tensor)

cudnn.benchmark = False # Disable to ensure some consistency
output2 = model(input_tensor)

print(torch.allclose(output1, output2, atol = 1e-5)) # Might print False even if atol is large
```

This example highlights the influence of CuDNN's algorithm selection.  Enabling `cudnn.benchmark` allows CuDNN to select the "fastest" algorithm, which might vary between runs.  Disabling it forces a deterministic algorithm choice, leading (likely) to more consistent results.

**Example 3: Unintentional Randomness in Activation Function**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import random

class MyActivation(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
      super().__init__()

    def forward(self, x):
      # Hypothetical example of injecting randomness
      random_noise = torch.randn_like(x) * 0.001
      return torch.relu(x + random_noise)

model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(10,5), MyActivation(), nn.Linear(5,1))
model.eval()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1,10)
output1 = model(input_tensor)
output2 = model(input_tensor)

print(torch.equal(output1, output2)) # Likely to print False
```

Here, a custom activation function unintentionally introduces noise, resulting in non-deterministic behavior irrespective of `model.eval()`.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of CUDA programming and its potential for non-determinism, I recommend consulting the official CUDA documentation and exploring resources on parallel computing and GPU programming.  Thoroughly understanding floating-point arithmetic limitations and their implications within numerical computations is crucial.  Finally, a solid grasp of PyTorch's internals, particularly the behavior of autograd and the underlying computational graph, is invaluable for troubleshooting such issues.  Reviewing materials on numerical stability in deep learning algorithms is highly recommended.
