TensorFlow's default behavior is to leverage available GPUs for computation, offering significant performance improvements for many operations.  However, situations arise where forcing CPU execution is necessaryâ€”debugging, resource constraints on shared systems, or the nature of the computation itself being unsuitable for GPU acceleration.  This necessitates explicit configuration adjustments.  My experience working on large-scale model deployments and embedded systems has highlighted the importance of precise control over hardware utilization in TensorFlow.  I've encountered numerous instances where seemingly innocuous GPU usage led to unexpected resource contention and system instability.

**1. Understanding TensorFlow's Hardware Selection:**

TensorFlow's device placement strategy is determined by a combination of factors.  Firstly, the availability of compatible hardware (CUDA-enabled GPUs, for instance).  Secondly, TensorFlow's internal heuristics prioritize GPUs if they are detected and deemed suitable for the operations being performed.  Thirdly, and most relevant to this question, user-specified configurations override these defaults.  Failing to specify a device explicitly allows TensorFlow to make its own determination, which may lead to unwanted GPU utilization.

The core mechanism for controlling device placement involves leveraging TensorFlow's device placement APIs.  These APIs allow the programmer to explicitly assign operations to specific devices, be it CPU or GPU. The key is the use of the `tf.device` context manager.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Restricting the entire computation to the CPU:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
  # All operations within this block will be executed on the CPU
  a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
  b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
  c = a + b
  print(c)  # This will print the result computed on the CPU
```

This example demonstrates the simplest approach.  The `with tf.device('/CPU:0'):` context manager ensures that all TensorFlow operations defined within its scope are executed on the CPU. The `/CPU:0` string specifies the device; `/CPU:1` would target a second CPU core (if available) and similarly, `/GPU:0` would target the first GPU.  This is the most straightforward and generally preferred method for ensuring complete CPU execution.  This method is ideal when dealing with models or operations ill-suited for GPU acceleration, or when testing a model independent of GPU interactions.


**Example 2:  Selective CPU placement for specific operations:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)

with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
  c = tf.multiply(a,b) #This multiplication happens on CPU

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    d = tf.reduce_sum(c) #This sum happens on GPU (assuming a GPU is available)

print(d)
```

This example highlights the flexibility of `tf.device`.  It demonstrates the ability to selectively place individual operations on the CPU, even within a broader computation that might otherwise utilize the GPU.  This granularity is crucial for optimizing performance when only certain parts of a model benefit from GPU acceleration. This would be particularly useful for situations where, for instance, a data loading operation is computationally expensive and better handled by a CPU.


**Example 3:  Handling potential exceptions and device availability:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
  with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
    c = a + b
    print(c)
except RuntimeError as e:
  print(f"Error during device placement: {e}")
except tf.errors.NotFoundError as e:
    print(f"CPU device not found: {e}")

try:
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        d = tf.reduce_sum(c)
        print(d)
except RuntimeError as e:
  print(f"Error during device placement: {e}")
except tf.errors.NotFoundError as e:
    print(f"GPU device not found: {e}")

```

Robust code incorporates error handling. This example includes `try-except` blocks to catch potential exceptions.  `RuntimeError` catches general errors during device placement, while `tf.errors.NotFoundError` specifically addresses situations where the specified CPU or GPU is unavailable.   This defensive programming approach is vital, particularly in production environments where hardware configurations might vary.  This is critical, especially when deploying models to different systems with varying hardware capabilities, preventing unexpected crashes due to incorrect device assignments.


**3.  Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of TensorFlow's device placement and other advanced topics, I strongly recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation.  The documentation is comprehensive and covers various aspects of TensorFlow programming, including detailed explanations of device placement strategies and best practices. Consulting advanced TensorFlow tutorials and exploring the source code itself can further enhance your understanding.  Finally, reviewing papers on parallel computation and GPU programming provides a broader theoretical foundation to support practical applications within TensorFlow. These resources will collectively equip you to efficiently manage TensorFlow's hardware utilization based on the specific requirements of your project.
