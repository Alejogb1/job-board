Gradients of a recurrent neural network's (RNN) hidden state with respect to its input are crucial for understanding and manipulating the model's internal representations, especially for tasks like adversarial example generation or sensitivity analysis. I've encountered this need frequently while building custom sequence models for time series forecasting where understanding what portion of the input sequence affects long-term hidden state dependencies is critical. Unlike standard model parameters, which are handled automatically during backpropagation, obtaining these specific gradients requires a more deliberate approach. TensorFlow's autodiff mechanisms do not provide these gradients as a direct, first-class result.

The core challenge lies in the nature of RNNs: they process sequences iteratively, maintaining an internal state that's updated at each timestep. This state, often a vector, encapsulates information from the past. When calculating gradients, the goal is to determine how a change in an input at a specific timestep affects this final hidden state. This involves backpropagating through the unrolled computation graph of the RNN. This unrolling process, which happens internally in TensorFlow for backpropagation during training, doesn't explicitly expose gradients of hidden states with respect to inputs. Standard loss-related gradient calculations focus on model parameters, not these input-to-hidden-state relationships.

To achieve this, the strategy requires a two-step process: first, explicitly calculating the hidden states; and then, calculating the gradient of the hidden state at a particular timestep with respect to the input at another timestep, usually the input at the very beginning of the sequence. This approach leverages TensorFlow's `GradientTape` context, which allows for the recording of operations and the subsequent calculation of gradients. Crucially, we compute the hidden states during forward propagation within this context and then invoke gradient calculation using this context.

Here's a breakdown of how this can be achieved with three example implementations:

**Example 1: Simple Vanilla RNN**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def get_hidden_state_gradients(rnn_cell, inputs):
    """Calculates the hidden state gradient w.r.t. input for a vanilla RNN."""

    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      tape.watch(inputs) # Mark the input as a variable to be tracked for gradient calcs
      state = rnn_cell.get_initial_state(batch_size=inputs.shape[0], dtype=tf.float32)
      all_states = [] # Store all hidden states

      for t in range(inputs.shape[1]):
        output, state = rnn_cell(inputs[:, t, :], state)
        all_states.append(state)

    last_state = all_states[-1] # Final hidden state
    gradients = tape.gradient(last_state, inputs) # Calculate gradient wrt input
    return gradients, all_states

# Example Usage
input_size = 5
hidden_size = 10
sequence_length = 20
batch_size = 32

rnn_cell = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNNCell(hidden_size)
inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size))

gradients, all_states = get_hidden_state_gradients(rnn_cell, inputs)
print("Shape of hidden state gradient:", gradients.shape)
print("Shape of all states", tf.stack(all_states).shape)
```

*   This example demonstrates the approach with a basic `SimpleRNNCell`. The `get_hidden_state_gradients` function records operations with `GradientTape`. Specifically, it watches the input to calculate gradients later and the hidden states are computed by iterating across the sequence. The final hidden state is then used as the target to compute its gradient with respect to the whole input sequence. The shape of the resulting gradient will match the shape of the input tensor, `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`. Additionally, all the states are returned for potentially further usage.

**Example 2: LSTM with state components**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def get_lstm_hidden_state_gradients(lstm_cell, inputs):
    """Calculates hidden state gradients for an LSTM, handling cell/hidden state."""
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      tape.watch(inputs)
      state = lstm_cell.get_initial_state(batch_size=inputs.shape[0], dtype=tf.float32) # Initial state as a tuple
      all_states = []

      for t in range(inputs.shape[1]):
        output, state = lstm_cell(inputs[:, t, :], state)
        all_states.append(state[0]) # Collect only the hidden state part

    last_hidden_state = all_states[-1] # Final hidden state
    gradients = tape.gradient(last_hidden_state, inputs)
    return gradients, all_states

# Example Usage
input_size = 5
hidden_size = 10
sequence_length = 20
batch_size = 32

lstm_cell = tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(hidden_size)
inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size))

gradients, all_states = get_lstm_hidden_state_gradients(lstm_cell, inputs)
print("Shape of hidden state gradient:", gradients.shape)
print("Shape of all states", tf.stack(all_states).shape)
```

*   This implementation addresses LSTMs, which have a more complex state structure including a hidden state and a cell state. The key modification here is in storing the hidden state part of the state tuple and using it to compute the gradient with respect to the input. Similar to the previous example, the gradient shape matches the input. The returned states, however, will only be the hidden states from every time step.

**Example 3: Selectively tracking a single hidden state**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def get_specific_hidden_state_gradient(rnn_cell, inputs, target_timestep=5):
  """Calculates gradients with respect to a specific hidden state."""
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(inputs)
    state = rnn_cell.get_initial_state(batch_size=inputs.shape[0], dtype=tf.float32)
    all_states = []
    for t in range(inputs.shape[1]):
        output, state = rnn_cell(inputs[:, t, :], state)
        all_states.append(state)

    target_state = all_states[target_timestep] # Select target time step
    gradients = tape.gradient(target_state, inputs)
    return gradients, all_states

# Example Usage
input_size = 5
hidden_size = 10
sequence_length = 20
batch_size = 32

rnn_cell = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNNCell(hidden_size)
inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size))

gradients, all_states = get_specific_hidden_state_gradient(rnn_cell, inputs)
print("Shape of specific hidden state gradient:", gradients.shape)
print("Shape of all states", tf.stack(all_states).shape)
```

*   This example introduces the capability to calculate gradients of a specific hidden state, not just the last one. The `target_timestep` parameter allows users to specify which hidden stateâ€™s gradients are of interest. It's useful for analyzing intermediate representations of an RNN. The gradient is still with respect to the entire input sequence, showcasing how inputs at any time step might influence the hidden state at the chosen target timestep.

These implementations provide a solid foundation for obtaining hidden state gradients. These techniques have allowed me to better diagnose and fine-tune my models, particularly in contexts where specific hidden state dynamics are important.

For further exploration, I recommend exploring the following resources: TensorFlow's official documentation on `tf.GradientTape`, specifically understanding the `watch` method and usage within a context. Furthermore, delving into the internal workings of `tf.keras.layers.RNN` and the underlying implementations of different RNN cells (e.g. `SimpleRNNCell`, `LSTMCell`, `GRUCell`) is valuable for understanding how to best extract hidden states. Research papers discussing sensitivity analysis in RNNs often provide context on the practical applications of these gradients, so seeking such resources would also be beneficial.
