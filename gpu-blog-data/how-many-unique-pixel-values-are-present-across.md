Determining the unique number of pixel values across a set of images necessitates careful consideration of data structures and computational efficiency.  My experience optimizing image processing pipelines for high-resolution satellite imagery has highlighted the importance of avoiding brute-force approaches when dealing with large datasets.  The key here lies in leveraging hash tables (or dictionaries in Python) to efficiently track observed pixel values.  A naive approach that iterates through every pixel and compares it to every other pixel would have unacceptable time complexity, scaling poorly with increasing image size and number of images.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The algorithm hinges on the use of a hash table to store unique pixel values.  A pixel, in this context, is represented as a tuple (or similar composite data structure) reflecting its color channels (e.g., (R, G, B) for RGB images or (R, G, B, A) for RGBA).  We iterate through each image in the set. For each image, we iterate through each pixel. If the pixel's value is not present as a key in the hash table, we add it as a key with a value of 1. If the pixel value already exists as a key, we increment its associated value (this step isn't strictly necessary for counting unique values, but it provides additional information on pixel frequency).  Once all images have been processed, the number of keys in the hash table represents the total number of unique pixel values across the entire set.

The choice of hash table is crucial for performance.  A well-implemented hash table, using a suitable hash function, provides average-case O(1) time complexity for insertion and lookup, making the overall algorithm effectively linear in the total number of pixels across all images.  This is a significant improvement over the quadratic time complexity of a naive comparison-based approach.  Furthermore, the memory consumption is proportional to the number of unique pixel values, which is typically much smaller than the total number of pixels, especially in images with limited color palettes or compression artifacts.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Python with a standard dictionary**

```python
from PIL import Image

def count_unique_pixels(image_paths):
    unique_pixels = {}
    for image_path in image_paths:
        try:
            img = Image.open(image_path)
            img_pixels = list(img.getdata()) #Get pixel data as a list of tuples.
            for pixel in img_pixels:
                if pixel not in unique_pixels:
                    unique_pixels[pixel] = 1
                else:
                    unique_pixels[pixel] += 1 #Optional: Track pixel frequencies.
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: Image file not found at {image_path}")
            continue #Skip to the next image if one is missing
    return len(unique_pixels)


image_paths = ["image1.png", "image2.jpg", "image3.bmp"]  # Replace with your image paths
unique_count = count_unique_pixels(image_paths)
print(f"Number of unique pixel values: {unique_count}")

```

This Python example leverages the PIL library for image handling and Python's built-in dictionary as a hash table.  Error handling is included to manage potential `FileNotFoundError` exceptions.  The `list(img.getdata())` call converts the image data into a list of tuples, suitable for direct use as dictionary keys.


**Example 2:  C++ using unordered_map**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

// Assume a simplified pixel representation for brevity.  Adapt as needed for your pixel format.
typedef std::tuple<uint8_t, uint8_t, uint8_t> Pixel;

int countUniquePixels(const std::vector<std::string>& imagePaths) {
    std::unordered_map<Pixel, int> uniquePixels;
    // ... (Image loading and processing logic similar to Python example, adapting to C++ file I/O and image libraries). ...
    return uniquePixels.size();
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> imagePaths = {"image1.png", "image2.jpg", "image3.bmp"}; // Replace with your image paths
    int uniqueCount = countUniquePixels(imagePaths);
    std::cout << "Number of unique pixel values: " << uniqueCount << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The C++ example demonstrates the use of `std::unordered_map`, the C++ standard library's hash table implementation.  Note that  actual image loading and processing would require a suitable image processing library (e.g., OpenCV). The pixel representation here is simplified for clarity;  a more robust implementation might use a struct or class for better type safety and extensibility.


**Example 3: Java with HashMap**

```java
import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import javax.imageio.ImageIO;

public class UniquePixelCounter {

    public static int countUniquePixels(String[] imagePaths) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> uniquePixels = new HashMap<>(); //Using Integer for simplicity. Consider a more robust pixel representation in a real-world application.
        // ... (Image loading and processing logic, similar to Python and C++ examples, adapting to Java's image handling and file I/O mechanisms). ...
        return uniquePixels.size();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] imagePaths = {"image1.png", "image2.jpg", "image3.bmp"}; // Replace with your image paths
        int uniqueCount = countUniquePixels(imagePaths);
        System.out.println("Number of unique pixel values: " + uniqueCount);
    }
}
```

This Java example uses `HashMap`, Java's equivalent of a hash table.  Similar to the C++ example,  a complete implementation would require incorporating Java's image I/O capabilities (e.g., using `BufferedImage` and `ImageIO`).   The use of `Integer` as the key type is a simplification; a more sophisticated approach would likely employ a custom class representing a pixel for improved code readability and maintainability.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For in-depth understanding of hash tables and their applications, I would recommend consulting standard algorithms and data structures textbooks.  Similarly, detailed treatments of image processing techniques can be found in various computer vision and digital image processing literature.  Finally,  the documentation for your chosen image processing library (PIL for Python, OpenCV for C++, Java's ImageIO) will be invaluable for specific implementation details.
