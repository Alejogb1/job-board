TensorFlow 2.0's handling of 4D tensor multiplication hinges on a nuanced understanding of broadcasting and the efficient utilization of its optimized matrix multiplication routines.  My experience optimizing deep learning models, particularly those employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), heavily involved manipulating and optimizing 4D tensors representing feature maps.  Crucially, direct "4D multiplication" isn't a primitive operation; instead, we leverage reshaping and TensorFlow's built-in matrix multiplication (`tf.matmul`) or its more general counterpart, `tf.einsum`, to achieve the desired outcome. The specific implementation depends heavily on the intended operation â€“ whether it's a convolution, a matrix multiplication across specific axes, or a more complex tensor contraction.

**1.  Explanation of Approaches:**

The core challenge in 4D tensor multiplication is identifying the dimensions along which the multiplication should occur. A 4D tensor can be visualized as a collection of matrices, or a collection of collections of vectors.  Understanding this hierarchical structure is critical.  We generally avoid explicitly multiplying 4D tensors directly.  Instead, we reshape them into 2D matrices suitable for `tf.matmul` or utilize `tf.einsum` for greater flexibility in specifying the multiplication axes.

Consider two 4D tensors, `A` and `B`, with shapes (N, H_A, W_A, C_A) and (N, H_B, W_B, C_B) respectively.  `N` represents the batch size, `H` and `W` represent height and width (often spatial dimensions in image processing), and `C` represents channels or features.  The multiplication strategy depends on the intended operation.

* **Convolution-like operations:**  If the goal is akin to a convolution, we'll often leverage `tf.nn.conv2d` which internally handles the necessary reshaping and optimized computations. This avoids manual manipulation and is generally the preferred approach for convolutional operations.

* **Matrix multiplication along specific axes:**  Here, we reshape the tensors to bring the relevant dimensions to the front, effectively treating the remaining dimensions as batch dimensions for a series of matrix multiplications.  For instance, if we want to multiply along the `C_A` and `C_B` axes, we would reshape to (N * H_A * W_A, C_A) and (N * H_B * W_B, C_B) before applying `tf.matmul`.  Careful attention must be paid to the resulting shape and the need for potential reshaping back to the original format.

* **Arbitrary tensor contractions:** `tf.einsum` offers the most flexibility. It allows explicit specification of the axes involved in the contraction using Einstein summation notation.  This provides a concise and powerful way to perform complex tensor operations, including those involving 4D tensors, without the need for manual reshaping in many cases.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Convolution-like operation using `tf.nn.conv2d`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor: (batch_size, height, width, channels)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((16, 28, 28, 3))

# Filter tensor: (filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels)
filter_tensor = tf.random.normal((3, 3, 3, 64))

# Perform convolution
output_tensor = tf.nn.conv2d(input_tensor, filter_tensor, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')

# Output tensor shape: (batch_size, height, width, out_channels)
print(output_tensor.shape)  # Output: (16, 28, 28, 64)
```

This example demonstrates the straightforward use of `tf.nn.conv2d`.  It's optimized for convolutional operations and avoids manual reshaping, which is vital for performance.  The strides and padding parameters control the convolution's behavior.  This approach is often the most efficient for tasks resembling convolutions.


**Example 2: Matrix multiplication along specific axes using `tf.matmul` and reshaping:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define two 4D tensors
tensor_a = tf.random.normal((2, 3, 4, 5))
tensor_b = tf.random.normal((2, 3, 5, 6))

# Reshape tensors for matmul
reshaped_a = tf.reshape(tensor_a, (2 * 3 * 4, 5))
reshaped_b = tf.reshape(tensor_b, (2 * 3 * 5, 6))

# Perform matrix multiplication
result = tf.matmul(reshaped_a, tf.transpose(reshaped_b, [1, 0]))

# Reshape back to 4D
output_tensor = tf.reshape(result, (2, 3, 4, 6))

print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: (2, 3, 4, 6)

```

This example showcases the use of `tf.matmul` after reshaping to multiply along the last two dimensions. Notice the transposition of `reshaped_b` to ensure correct matrix dimensions. The reshaping step is crucial and highlights the indirect nature of "4D multiplication" in TensorFlow.  The computational efficiency relies on the optimized `tf.matmul` function.


**Example 3:  Arbitrary tensor contraction using `tf.einsum`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_a = tf.random.normal((2, 3, 4, 5))
tensor_b = tf.random.normal((2, 3, 5, 6))

# Einstein summation notation for multiplication along the last two axes
output_tensor = tf.einsum('ijkl,ijlm->ijkm', tensor_a, tensor_b)

print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: (2, 3, 4, 6)

```

`tf.einsum` provides a very flexible method.  The equation `'ijkl,ijlm->ijkm'` specifies that summation occurs over the 'l' axis.  This concisely expresses the desired operation without explicit reshaping.   This is often the most readable and flexible approach for complex tensor manipulations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on tensor manipulations and the functions used in these examples.  Understanding linear algebra, particularly matrix multiplication and tensor contractions, is paramount.   A solid grasp of broadcasting rules in TensorFlow will also prove invaluable in optimizing tensor operations.  Exploring resources covering NumPy array manipulation can provide foundational knowledge which translates directly to TensorFlow's tensor operations. Studying the source code of existing CNN implementations can provide insights into real-world applications and efficient 4D tensor manipulation strategies.
