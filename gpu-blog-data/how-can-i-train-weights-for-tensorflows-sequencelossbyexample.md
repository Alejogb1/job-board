The nuanced challenge with `tf.contrib.seq2seq.sequence_loss_by_example()` lies not in its direct usage, but in correctly structuring the input data and understanding its internal mechanisms to effectively train model weights. This function, often employed in sequence-to-sequence tasks, inherently calculates loss for each element of a sequence separately, before averaging or summing over the batch. Incorrectly configuring the input, particularly masks and logits, will lead to inaccurate gradients and ultimately ineffective training.

The primary point of interaction for weight training with this loss function occurs through the gradients it generates. `sequence_loss_by_example()` contributes directly to the overall loss of the model. Optimization algorithms, such as Adam or SGD, leverage the derivatives of this loss with respect to model parameters to update the weights. Therefore, the key is to ensure the loss calculation is aligned with the intended learning objective, which involves careful consideration of the function's three primary input parameters: `logits`, `targets`, and `weights`.

Firstly, the `logits` parameter represents the unnormalized output of the neural network. In a sequence-to-sequence model, this is generally the output of the decoder component, having dimensions of [batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size]. The vocab_size dimension corresponds to the probability distribution over the available vocabulary of output tokens. The gradients backpropagated from `sequence_loss_by_example()` will update weights responsible for generating these logits in a direction that attempts to match the probability distribution implied by the `targets`.

Secondly, the `targets` parameter is a tensor of integer values, each representing the index of the desired output token in the vocabulary for the corresponding position in the sequence. It shares the same shape as the batch dimension and sequence length dimension as logits (i.e., [batch_size, sequence_length]). Incorrectly setting the target sequence, for instance, using zero-padding for sequence lengths instead of padding tokens, is a common error.

Lastly, the `weights` parameter acts as a mask, specifying which positions in the sequence are to be considered during the loss computation. It's another tensor of the shape [batch_size, sequence_length]. A weight of 1 indicates that the loss should be calculated for that specific position in the sequence; a weight of 0 signifies that position should be ignored. This parameter is crucial for variable-length sequences where we may need to pad short sequences up to the maximum length of other sequences. Without correct weights, the loss contribution of padded locations would confuse the optimization and lead to model degradation.

Here are three specific code examples demonstrating proper usage along with explanations:

**Example 1: Basic Sequence-to-Sequence with Masking**

In this example, I’m generating example data, demonstrating proper masking and the correct input tensor dimensions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

batch_size = 3
sequence_length = 5
vocab_size = 10

# Example logits (unnormalized probabilities)
logits = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size))

# Example targets (integer token indices)
targets = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, sequence_length), minval=0, maxval=vocab_size, dtype=tf.int32)

# Example sequence lengths for variable length inputs
sequence_lengths = tf.constant([3, 5, 2], dtype=tf.int32)

# Create a mask based on sequence lengths
mask = tf.sequence_mask(sequence_lengths, maxlen=sequence_length, dtype=tf.float32)

# Calculate sequence loss
loss_per_example = tf.contrib.seq2seq.sequence_loss_by_example(
    logits=logits,
    targets=targets,
    weights=mask
)

# Average the loss
average_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss_per_example)

# Simple optimizer for example usage only
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
trainable_variables = tf.trainable_variables() # Assume these exist

# Create a train operation for a dummy gradient step
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  loss = average_loss

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, trainable_variables)

optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, trainable_variables))


print(f"Average Loss: {average_loss.numpy()}")
```

Here, `tf.sequence_mask` creates a binary tensor with ones up to the sequence length of each instance within the batch. The `sequence_lengths` are `[3, 5, 2]`. Thus, the corresponding mask would be:
```
[[1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
```
This mask, used as the `weights` argument in `sequence_loss_by_example()`, ensures that loss is only calculated for valid, unpadded parts of each sequence.

**Example 2: Handling a Padded Target Sequence**

In this scenario, I'll focus on the importance of correctly setting the `targets` argument by ensuring that the pads aren't detrimental to training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

batch_size = 2
sequence_length = 4
vocab_size = 8

# Example logits
logits = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size))

# Example targets, with padding using a specific padding token
pad_token_id = 0
targets = tf.constant(
    [[1, 2, 3, pad_token_id],
     [4, 5, 6, 7]], dtype=tf.int32
)

# Example sequence lengths
sequence_lengths = tf.constant([3, 4], dtype=tf.int32)

# Create mask
mask = tf.sequence_mask(sequence_lengths, maxlen=sequence_length, dtype=tf.float32)

# Calculate loss
loss_per_example = tf.contrib.seq2seq.sequence_loss_by_example(
    logits=logits,
    targets=targets,
    weights=mask
)

# Average the loss
average_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss_per_example)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
trainable_variables = tf.trainable_variables() # Assume these exist

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  loss = average_loss

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, trainable_variables)

optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, trainable_variables))

print(f"Average Loss: {average_loss.numpy()}")
```

Here the crucial detail is how targets are constructed with a `pad_token_id`.  This `pad_token_id` is conventionally ‘0’, but it should be whatever token ID was used for padding when preparing the data. The mask then ensures the loss function doesn’t penalize the model for predicting incorrect values for the padded sequence. If this padding token is not correctly accounted for when preparing data, then using a non-zero weight on these locations will back propagate meaningless loss gradients.

**Example 3:  Weighted Loss for Important Tokens**

This final example demonstrates the functionality of `weights` beyond simply masking padded sequences by assigning different weight values to different parts of the sequences.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

batch_size = 1
sequence_length = 4
vocab_size = 6

# Example logits
logits = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size))

# Example targets
targets = tf.constant(
    [[1, 2, 3, 4]], dtype=tf.int32
)


#Example weights, where the second token has more influence on the loss
weights = tf.constant(
    [[0.5, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0]], dtype=tf.float32
)

# Calculate sequence loss
loss_per_example = tf.contrib.seq2seq.sequence_loss_by_example(
    logits=logits,
    targets=targets,
    weights=weights
)

# Average the loss
average_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss_per_example)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
trainable_variables = tf.trainable_variables() # Assume these exist

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  loss = average_loss

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, trainable_variables)

optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, trainable_variables))

print(f"Average Loss: {average_loss.numpy()}")
```

In this final example, the `weights` parameter is used to adjust the influence of each token on the loss calculation. In the example, we emphasize the second token with a higher weight (2.0) relative to the other positions. This is useful for various applications like emphasizing critical parts of a generated sequence or providing a teacher-forced component within a sequence.

**Recommendations**

For deeper understanding, consult TensorFlow's official API documentation. Research works on neural machine translation and sequence-to-sequence learning will provide a solid theoretical foundation. Furthermore, practical experience debugging model behaviors during training will greatly enhance mastery.

Successfully utilizing `tf.contrib.seq2seq.sequence_loss_by_example()` is less about invoking the function and more about a thorough understanding of sequence processing, masking, and proper handling of variable-length data. The three code examples along with the explanations show the common use cases and demonstrate areas where careful input formatting are required for optimal training. By ensuring the correct construction and interpretation of `logits`, `targets`, and `weights` tensors, one can reliably train weights for various sequence-to-sequence model architectures.
