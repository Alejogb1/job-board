TensorFlow 1.x installation on Apple Silicon (M1) presents a unique challenge due to the architecture's incompatibility with the standard TensorFlow 1.x binaries.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects within a research environment highlighted this issue early on.  While official support for TensorFlow 1.x on M1 is absent, a successful installation requires leveraging Rosetta 2 emulation coupled with careful dependency management.  Direct installation of the standard TensorFlow 1.x wheel files will fail.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow 1.x, built primarily for x86-64 architectures, lacks native support for Apple's ARM64 architecture used in M1 chips.  Rosetta 2, Apple's binary translation layer, allows x86-64 applications to run on ARM64, but this comes with performance implications.  Furthermore, certain dependencies within TensorFlow 1.x, particularly those reliant on highly optimized libraries, may experience compatibility issues even under emulation.  Therefore, a successful installation necessitates a multi-step process involving Rosetta 2, pip, and potentially manual intervention to resolve dependency conflicts.  My work involved extensive experimentation with various virtual environments and dependency versions before achieving a stable configuration.  The crucial aspects are using a compatible Python version, installing necessary build tools, and carefully managing the pip installation process to avoid conflicts between Rosetta-emulated libraries and native ARM64 libraries.  Failing to address these will invariably lead to runtime errors or segmentation faults.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Utilizing a Virtual Environment and Rosetta 2:**

```bash
# Create a virtual environment using Python 3.7 (TensorFlow 1.x compatibility is crucial)
python3.7 -m venv tf1_env

# Activate the virtual environment
source tf1_env/bin/activate

# Install necessary build tools (Homebrew is recommended for package management)
brew install cmake

# Install TensorFlow 1.x using pip (specify the appropriate wheel file if needed)
pip install tensorflow==1.15.0  # Replace with your desired 1.x version

# Verify the installation
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

*Commentary:*  This approach utilizes a virtual environment for isolated dependency management.  This is essential to prevent conflicts with other Python projects.  The specification of Python 3.7 is critical because later Python versions may lack sufficient compatibility with older TensorFlow 1.x versions.  The use of `brew install cmake` ensures the availability of essential build tools, which might be required by certain TensorFlow dependencies.  The final command verifies the TensorFlow installation within the virtual environment. Remember to run this within the Rosetta 2 environment for successful installation.


**Example 2: Handling Dependency Conflicts:**

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment (assuming it's already created)
source tf1_env/bin/activate

# If encountering dependency issues, try explicitly installing conflicting packages
pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel

# If you encounter errors related to specific libraries (e.g., cuDNN),  search for pre-built wheels compatible with Rosetta 2.
# This step requires detailed error analysis and potentially manual downloading of compatible packages.

#Attempt installing TensorFlow again after resolving conflicts
pip install tensorflow==1.15.0

#Verify the installation
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

*Commentary:*  This example addresses common issues encountered during TensorFlow 1.x installation, particularly dependency conflicts. Updating `setuptools` and `wheel` often resolves problems related to package installation and management.  Crucially, if you encounter errors specific to certain libraries, you'll need to investigate the error messages meticulously to identify the conflicting dependencies. Manual intervention might be necessary; you might need to locate and install pre-built wheels specifically compiled for x86-64 to work within the Rosetta 2 environment. This process usually requires in-depth analysis of the error logs and careful searching for compatible package versions.


**Example 3:  Testing with a Simple Program:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple TensorFlow graph
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess = tf.compat.v1.Session() # Compatibility with TF 1.x
print(sess.run(hello))
sess.close()
```

*Commentary:*  This code snippet is a basic test to verify the functionality of the installed TensorFlow.  It uses `tf.compat.v1.Session()` because `tf.Session()` is deprecated in later TensorFlow versions.  Successful execution confirms the successful installation and basic functionality of TensorFlow 1.x within the Rosetta 2 environment.  The lack of errors indicates a properly functioning installation.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation (search for the relevant version), the Python documentation, and the Homebrew package manager documentation are indispensable resources.  Thorough understanding of virtual environments and package management is vital.  Consult detailed guides and tutorials on resolving dependency conflicts in Python projects.  Finally, careful examination of error messages and log files is crucial for troubleshooting.  Proficient use of a debugger can also aid in identifying underlying issues.  Remember that troubleshooting will invariably involve consulting various Stack Overflow threads and forums.


In conclusion, installing TensorFlow 1.x on an M1 chip requires a careful, multi-step process that combines the use of Rosetta 2 emulation with diligent dependency management.  The examples provided illustrate the key steps involved, including the creation of a virtual environment, installation of essential build tools, and handling of potential dependency conflicts.  Consistent reference to the mentioned resources and meticulous troubleshooting based on error messages are crucial for a successful outcome. Remember that performance will be impacted by the use of Rosetta 2.  Consider migrating to a TensorFlow 2.x version if performance is critical.
