Convolutional neural networks, specifically their `Conv2D` layers, excel at detecting spatial hierarchies within data because of their reliance on learnable filters and the convolution operation. A core understanding of this mechanism clarifies how they discern patterns like vertical and horizontal edges in 2D feature maps. These maps, which might represent grayscale images or feature activations from a preceding layer, are processed not on individual pixel levels but as neighborhoods according to filter size.

The `Conv2D` layer employs a filter, essentially a small matrix of weights, which is slid across the input feature map. At each location, an element-wise multiplication is performed between the filter and the corresponding input sub-region. The results are summed, producing a single output value. This value represents the activation strength of that particular filter in that specific region. When this process is repeated across the entire feature map, an output feature map is formed. Each output location corresponds to the weighted sum of its inputs, thus capturing the presence or absence of the pattern represented by the filter.

The capacity for `Conv2D` to recognize vertical and horizontal patterns derives directly from the weight patterns within the filters themselves. Consider a 3x3 filter. A filter with a high positive value in a column and low or negative values in the remaining columns will be highly activated when it encounters a vertical edge in the input feature map aligned with its high values. Conversely, a filter with a high row of values and low values elsewhere will react strongly to horizontal edges. If the high value positions of two different filters are orthogonal to one another, they will tend to detect edges aligned on those orthogonal axes. The network learns these specific weights through backpropagation during the training process. Randomly initialized weights will be adjusted based on the gradient of the loss function which optimizes performance at the desired task, often including identifying edges.

Now, consider some concrete examples. During a project concerning the analysis of synthetic microscopic imagery, I observed that particular filter configurations consistently triggered specific activations. I've reproduced and simplified similar filters in code below using a Python environment with Keras:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D
import tensorflow as tf

# Example 1: Vertical Edge Detector

vertical_filter = np.array([[-1, 0, 1],
                            [-1, 0, 1],
                            [-1, 0, 1]], dtype=np.float32).reshape((3, 3, 1, 1))

input_data = tf.constant(np.array([
    [[1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [0,0,0,0]],
    [[1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [0,0,0,0]],
    [[1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [0,0,0,0]],
    [[1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [0,0,0,0]]
], dtype=np.float32).reshape((1, 4, 4, 1)))

vertical_layer = Conv2D(filters=1, kernel_size=(3, 3), use_bias=False, padding='valid',
                       kernel_initializer=tf.constant_initializer(vertical_filter))
output_vertical = vertical_layer(input_data)
print("Output of the vertical edge detector:\n", output_vertical)
```

In the first example, the `vertical_filter` is manually defined. This filter, when convolved across the `input_data`, produces an output that highlights regions containing vertical edges. A positive high result where the pattern matches, and zero values where no vertical pattern exists. Note, in practice the filters are learned by the model, not hard-coded like this example.  Padding is 'valid' here to demonstrate the boundary effect.

```python
# Example 2: Horizontal Edge Detector

horizontal_filter = np.array([[-1, -1, -1],
                            [ 0,  0,  0],
                            [ 1,  1,  1]], dtype=np.float32).reshape((3, 3, 1, 1))

horizontal_layer = Conv2D(filters=1, kernel_size=(3, 3), use_bias=False, padding='valid',
                       kernel_initializer=tf.constant_initializer(horizontal_filter))

output_horizontal = horizontal_layer(input_data)
print("\nOutput of the horizontal edge detector:\n", output_horizontal)
```

The second example uses a `horizontal_filter` structured to respond to horizontal edges. The structure of the filter is such that when a horizontal transition from a low region to a higher region is present in the image data a large positive value will be output, demonstrating the horizontal edge.

```python
# Example 3: Combined Pattern Detection using Learnable Weights

combined_layer = Conv2D(filters=2, kernel_size=(3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu') #filters=2, this is for demonstration only
input_data_combined = tf.constant(np.array([
    [[1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [0,0,0,0]],
    [[1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0,0,0,0]],
    [[1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [0,0,0,0]],
    [[1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1], [0,0,0,0]]
], dtype=np.float32).reshape((1, 4, 4, 1)))

output_combined = combined_layer(input_data_combined)
print("\nOutput of the learned pattern detection layer:\n", output_combined)

```
The third example demonstrates how a `Conv2D` layer might learn pattern detection using random initial weights, as typically found in CNN training. While the resulting filters are initially random, with backpropagation they would converge to feature detectors. The output will include two feature maps each demonstrating which locations in the input are more closely matched to the pattern of each of the learned filters. Padding has been set to 'same' in this case, and an activation function has been added. This demonstrates the real-world approach, but makes explicit visual correlation with input data patterns less clear in the early stages of training, since the filters are random before training.

These examples highlight the fundamental operating principle of `Conv2D` layers: learnable filters that, during operation, quantify the presence or absence of spatial features in feature maps. Vertical and horizontal lines are the result of specific weight patterns and these are learned during training. The ability to recognize complex hierarchical structures depends on the composition of `Conv2D` layers. Typically this involves sequences of convolutional layers, often with pooling, allowing a network to learn more complex features from the basic ones such as lines.

For further understanding, research on the mathematical foundations of convolution, and the mechanics of backpropagation, is beneficial. Material explaining the design and behavior of commonly used neural network architectures will complement this information. Focus on sources explaining spatial gradient detection and related topics in signal processing, as they will demonstrate the basic principles from another angle. I have found studying image recognition in practice to be helpful too. There are also several online resources which provide interactive demonstrations of convolution, providing an intuitive feel for the process.
