No, `torch.tensor.shape[3]` does not return a tensor; it returns an integer representing the size of the fourth dimension of the PyTorch tensor. I've frequently encountered confusion around accessing tensor shape attributes, particularly with newer users transitioning from NumPy arrays. The critical distinction is that the `shape` attribute of a PyTorch tensor, accessed using the `.shape` notation, yields a `torch.Size` object. This `torch.Size` is essentially a tuple of integers, not another tensor. Thus, accessing an element of this tuple by indexing, like `[3]`, retrieves the specific integer value representing the size of the corresponding dimension.

The behavior stems from the core design of PyTorch, where tensors are the fundamental data structures. The shape is not considered a tensor itself but rather metadata describing the arrangement of the tensor's underlying data in memory. The `torch.Size` class provides a way to represent these dimensions as an ordered collection. It’s immutable, guaranteeing the dimensions won’t be accidentally modified in place.

The indexing into the shape object directly accesses elements of this tuple. While indexing can return a single integer which looks and behaves like a single element tensor, crucially, it’s not a tensor and therefore won’t possess the same properties and functionalities (like backpropagation, for example). If you require a tensor representing the dimensions, there are specific functions provided by PyTorch to achieve this, which is distinct from simply accessing the `shape` attribute using indexing.

Here are three examples to illustrate this point, along with explanatory comments:

**Example 1: Basic shape retrieval and indexing**

```python
import torch

# Create a 4D tensor
my_tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 4, 5)

# Retrieve the shape as a torch.Size object
shape_object = my_tensor.shape
print(f"Shape object: {shape_object}, Type: {type(shape_object)}")

# Access the fourth dimension's size
dimension_size = my_tensor.shape[3]
print(f"Size of fourth dimension: {dimension_size}, Type: {type(dimension_size)}")

# Attempt to perform tensor operations directly (will fail)
try:
    dimension_size.add_(1)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error attempting to modify directly: {e}")
```

*   **Commentary:** This example demonstrates the fundamental difference between the `torch.Size` object returned by `.shape` and the integer size of an individual dimension, obtained by indexing. The output clearly shows that `my_tensor.shape` is of type `torch.Size`. Accessing `my_tensor.shape[3]` retrieves an `int`, and therefore you cannot perform tensor-specific methods like `add_()` on it, resulting in an `AttributeError`. This highlights that it's not a tensor.

**Example 2:  Converting Shape to a Tensor**

```python
import torch

# Create a 4D tensor
my_tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 4, 5)

# Convert shape to a tensor
shape_tensor = torch.tensor(my_tensor.shape)

# Access the fourth dimension's size as a tensor element
dimension_tensor_element = shape_tensor[3]
print(f"Fourth dimension from tensor: {dimension_tensor_element}, Type: {type(dimension_tensor_element)}")

# Attempt a tensor addition operation
modified_element = dimension_tensor_element + 1
print(f"Modified element: {modified_element}, Type: {type(modified_element)}")

# Demonstrating shape and the resultant type of torch.tensor.shape[3]
single_index_tensor = torch.tensor(my_tensor.shape)[3]
print(f"Shape [3]: {single_index_tensor}, Type: {type(single_index_tensor)}")
```

*   **Commentary:** This example shows how to properly create a tensor that represents the dimensions of a tensor. I use `torch.tensor` to explicitly convert the `torch.Size` object into a PyTorch tensor. Now, accessing `shape_tensor[3]` retrieves a tensor holding an integer, which allows tensor-specific operations to be performed on it. Critically, though, the direct index `my_tensor.shape[3]` continues to return an `int`, further illustrating that it's not a tensor. While `shape_tensor[3]` can now be added to 1, a single index operation such as `torch.tensor(my_tensor.shape)[3]` still results in an `int`. This underscores the behavior of indexing after a tensor-creation from `torch.Size`.

**Example 3: Reshaping using Dimension size**

```python
import torch

# Create a 4D tensor
my_tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 4, 5)

# Access the third and fourth dimension sizes directly.
dim3 = my_tensor.shape[2]
dim4 = my_tensor.shape[3]


# Reshape the tensor based on the dimensions retrieved, which are simple integers.
reshaped_tensor = my_tensor.reshape(2*3, dim3 * dim4 )
print(f"Original shape: {my_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Reshaped tensor: {reshaped_tensor.shape}")

# Attempt to reshape using the size as a tensor directly.
try:
  reshaped_tensor_fail = my_tensor.reshape(2*3, torch.tensor(my_tensor.shape[2]) * torch.tensor(my_tensor.shape[3]))
  print(f"Reshape fail: {reshaped_tensor_fail.shape}")
except TypeError as e:
  print(f"Error reshaping using size as tensor: {e}")
```

*   **Commentary:** This demonstrates a typical use case where dimension sizes obtained through indexing (`my_tensor.shape[2]`, `my_tensor.shape[3]`) are used to reshape a tensor. The code clearly shows how these integers are usable directly in operations and as inputs to functions such as `reshape`, which expects integers specifying sizes for new dimensions. Conversely, I've included a `try` block to demonstrate that passing tensors directly as size parameters within `reshape` leads to a TypeError. Again, we see that accessing shape using `[index]` results in the dimension size integer, not a tensor.

**In Summary:**

The key is understanding the difference between a `torch.Size` object, a tensor representing shape, and individual integers representing dimensions. Using `torch.tensor.shape[3]` directly gives you the size of the fourth dimension as a plain integer. If you need to perform tensor operations with that dimension size, the shape object has to be converted using `torch.tensor()`. I've frequently seen new PyTorch users confused by this, leading to type errors when manipulating tensor shapes.

For further information and more in-depth understanding of tensor operations, the official PyTorch documentation is the best resource. Specific sections covering tensor creation, shape manipulation, and mathematical operations on tensors are highly recommended. Additionally, online tutorials focusing on PyTorch's core functionalities offer practical guidance, and advanced books focusing on deep learning frameworks often cover these specific aspects of tensor manipulation.
