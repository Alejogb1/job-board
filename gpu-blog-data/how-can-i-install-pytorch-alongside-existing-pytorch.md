The coexistence of multiple PyTorch installations, particularly different versions like the desired new one alongside 1.10.1, requires careful environment management to prevent library conflicts. A direct system-wide upgrade is generally discouraged. My experience, spanning several years working on deep learning research projects, has consistently shown that virtual environments are the most reliable method for this scenario. They provide isolated Python installations, each with its own set of packages. This avoids the problematic overwriting of existing dependencies and allows for seamless switching between different PyTorch versions.

The primary challenge arises from PyTorch's reliance on native code (CUDA libraries, MKL) and specific system configurations. Attempting to mix these across different PyTorch versions can lead to runtime errors, module import issues, and even system instability. Therefore, isolating each version into its own environment is crucial. I've personally encountered subtle and frustrating errors that seemed inexplicable until I traced the problem back to conflicting PyTorch versions present in the system's global environment.

The recommended solution is using either `venv` (Python's built-in module for creating lightweight virtual environments) or `conda` (an environment manager provided by Anaconda). While `venv` is sufficient for most PyTorch installation scenarios, `conda` is often preferred due to its better handling of native dependencies, particularly if CUDA support is required. `venv` uses pip for package installation, whereas `conda` uses its own package manager, often resolving compatibility issues more reliably with packages containing native code.

Let's examine three code examples, first demonstrating the use of `venv`, then `conda` with a CPU build, and finally `conda` with a CUDA build.

**Example 1: Using `venv`**

First, we create a new virtual environment named "pytorch_new".

```python
# Terminal command:
python3 -m venv pytorch_new
```

This command creates a directory "pytorch_new" containing a minimal Python installation. We then activate the environment:

```python
# Linux/macOS:
source pytorch_new/bin/activate

# Windows:
pytorch_new\Scripts\activate
```

Once activated, the command prompt will show "(pytorch_new)" indicating that you're operating within the virtual environment. Next, we install the desired PyTorch version. For this example, we'll assume a generic CPU version is sufficient (substitute with your desired version if necessary from the PyTorch website):

```python
# Terminal command within activated environment:
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

`pip` downloads and installs PyTorch and its associated libraries within the "pytorch_new" virtual environment. Note that these are different from the ones installed with your `pip` outside the virtual environment. To deactivate the environment, simply run:

```python
# Terminal command:
deactivate
```

This returns you to your system's default Python environment. The existing PyTorch 1.10.1 remains untouched. This method works well for pure Python installations that don't require specific hardware acceleration. The drawback of `venv` lies in its reliance on `pip` which may struggle with native libraries.

**Example 2: Using `conda` with a CPU build**

`conda` provides a robust package manager, particularly useful when dealing with complex dependencies. We start by creating a new conda environment called "pytorch_cpu_env":

```python
# Terminal command:
conda create -n pytorch_cpu_env python=3.9
```

This creates a new conda environment with Python 3.9 (substitute with your preferred Python version). Now, we activate this environment:

```python
# Terminal command:
conda activate pytorch_cpu_env
```

Within this environment, we install PyTorch using the appropriate command as suggested by the PyTorch website, selecting the CPU version:

```python
# Terminal command within activated environment:
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
```

This command fetches the CPU version of PyTorch and its related libraries from the `pytorch` channel, ensuring compatible versions. To deactivate:

```python
# Terminal command:
conda deactivate
```

The existing environment containing PyTorch 1.10.1 is, again, undisturbed. This method handles potential conflicts in underlying dependencies more efficiently than `venv` does.

**Example 3: Using `conda` with a CUDA build**

To install PyTorch with CUDA support, a similar process is followed, but with the correct CUDA flags. The command varies slightly depending on your CUDA version. I will assume CUDA version 11.8 for illustration.

First, create and activate a new environment named "pytorch_cuda_env":

```python
# Terminal command:
conda create -n pytorch_cuda_env python=3.9
conda activate pytorch_cuda_env
```

Then, install the CUDA enabled version of PyTorch:

```python
# Terminal command within activated environment (CUDA 11.8):
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

This command downloads the CUDA-enabled PyTorch build, along with compatible versions of the torchvision and torchaudio libraries, from both the `pytorch` and `nvidia` channels. It specifically targets CUDA 11.8. Replace this with the exact CUDA version present on your system. In my experience, mismatching the specified CUDA version can lead to immediate import errors, usually associated with CUDA drivers. Deactivation proceeds as before:

```python
# Terminal command:
conda deactivate
```

Again, the previous 1.10.1 installation remains separate. The advantage of conda lies in its fine-grained dependency management, essential when working with CUDA environments. These environments, correctly established, provide a seamless pathway for parallel usage of both PyTorch 1.10.1 and the new version, each in its isolation.

For further reading on virtual environments and dependency management, I recommend exploring the official Python `venv` documentation, the Conda documentation, as well as specific tutorials aimed at machine learning practitioners. These resources offer a more in-depth understanding of these systems. Understanding these concepts of isolation is not merely about avoiding package conflicts; it is about promoting reproducible research and maintaining a stable development environment.
