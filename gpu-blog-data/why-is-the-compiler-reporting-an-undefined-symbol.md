The issue of an undefined symbol for `sqrtf()` despite including `<math.h>` and linking with `-lm` often stems from a mismatch between the expected floating-point type and the function's actual signature, particularly in mixed-language programming environments or when using less common compiler configurations.  My experience troubleshooting embedded systems has highlighted this problem repeatedly.  The compiler, while recognizing the declaration of `sqrtf()` within `<math.h>`, might fail to resolve the symbol at the linking stage if the linker cannot locate an appropriate implementation.  This is not solely a matter of missing libraries; rather, it's about ensuring type compatibility and correct library selection.


**1. Clear Explanation**

The `sqrtf()` function is specifically designed for single-precision floating-point numbers (floats).  Including `<math.h>` provides the *declaration* of this function—its prototype, which informs the compiler about its signature (return type and argument types).  However, the *definition*—the actual compiled code that performs the square root calculation—resides within a system library (often the math library).  Linking with `-lm` (or its equivalent) directs the linker to search for and incorporate this definition from the math library.

The problem arises when:

* **Incorrect Floating-Point Type:**  The code might attempt to pass a `double` (double-precision floating-point) instead of a `float` to `sqrtf()`.  While some compilers might implicitly cast the `double` to a `float`, this isn't guaranteed and leads to undefined behavior, often manifesting as a linker error.

* **Compiler-Specific Issues:** Different compilers and architectures might handle floating-point operations differently.  Older or less commonly used compilers might require specific flags to ensure proper linking of the math library's floating-point functions.  Also, some compilers may have separate libraries for single and double precision math functions that need explicit inclusion.

* **Multiple Math Libraries:** If your project utilizes multiple libraries that each provide their own implementation of the math functions (a possibility in larger embedded projects where you might include components from third-party vendors), name collisions could occur, potentially masking the correct `sqrtf()` implementation.

* **Linker Path Issues:** The linker's search path might not include the directory where the math library's object files are located.  This is less common with standard library linking but can manifest in custom build systems or cross-compilation scenarios.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Correct Usage**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    float num = 16.0f; // Explicitly a float
    float result = sqrtf(num);
    printf("The square root of %.2f is %.2f\n", num, result);
    return 0;
}
```

This example correctly uses `sqrtf()` with a `float` argument.  The `f` suffix in `16.0f` ensures the literal is interpreted as a single-precision float, preventing any implicit type conversions that might cause confusion for the compiler or linker.  The compilation and linking should proceed without errors if the math library is correctly included in the linker's path.


**Example 2: Incorrect Usage (Double Precision)**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    double num = 16.0; // A double, not a float
    float result = sqrtf(num); //Attempting to pass a double to sqrtf()
    printf("The square root of %.2f is %.2f\n", num, result);
    return 0;
}
```

This code is problematic. Although `sqrtf` is declared, passing a `double` to a function expecting a `float` is likely to cause problems during compilation or execution, depending on the compiler's behavior. In some cases this results in a warning or implicit conversion. In others, it leads to the undefined symbol error at the link stage if optimization removes the explicit cast.  Using `sqrt()` instead would solve this specific problem.


**Example 3:  Addressing Compiler-Specific Issues (Illustrative)**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    float num = 16.0f;
    float result = sqrtf(num);
    printf("The square root of %.2f is %.2f\n", num, result);
    return 0;
}
```

This example, while seemingly identical to Example 1, serves to illustrate how compiler flags might affect the outcome. For instance, some older compilers might require explicit flags like `-msoft-float` or `-mhard-float` (depending on the architecture's floating-point handling) to specify whether to use software or hardware floating-point units.  Without these flags, the compiler might fail to link correctly, even if the code is perfectly valid.  This highlights the necessity of consulting compiler documentation and recognizing that subtle flag settings can significantly impact the linking process, particularly when working with embedded systems or custom toolchains.  In my experience with a legacy ARM compiler, neglecting the `-mfloat-abi=softfp` flag resulted in a situation nearly identical to this question's original problem.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

Consult your compiler's documentation for details on linking options, floating-point handling, and any compiler-specific flags related to math libraries.  The standard C library documentation (available in many forms, including online or as part of your compiler's installation) will provide detailed information on the `math.h` header file and the functions it declares.  A comprehensive guide on your compiler's build system (Makefiles, CMake, etc.) will prove useful for understanding how the linker is invoked and how libraries are integrated into the build process.  Finally, a solid understanding of the differences between declarations and definitions in C is essential for debugging linking problems.  Examining the object files generated by the compiler (using a disassembler) will unveil if the symbols are indeed present or not. This is crucial for eliminating compiler or preprocessor problems from the list of possible causes.
