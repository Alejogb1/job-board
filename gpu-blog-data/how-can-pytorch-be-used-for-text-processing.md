PyTorch's strength lies in its dynamic computation graph, making it particularly well-suited for tasks involving variable-length sequences, a characteristic prevalent in natural language processing (NLP).  My experience working on a large-scale sentiment analysis project highlighted this advantage significantly.  While static computation graphs, as found in TensorFlow 1.x, imposed constraints on sequence handling, PyTorch's flexibility allowed for efficient processing of diverse text lengths without the need for excessive padding, a considerable performance and memory optimization.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch offers a rich ecosystem for text processing.  Its core functionality, coupled with readily available libraries like `torchtext`, provides the necessary tools for transforming raw text data into numerical representations suitable for deep learning models.  This transformation generally involves several key steps:

* **Tokenization:** Breaking down text into individual words or sub-word units (tokens).  This step is crucial for managing vocabulary size and handling out-of-vocabulary words.  Tools like `torchtext.data.Field` offer built-in tokenization capabilities with various options including word tokenization, sentencepiece, and byte-pair encoding (BPE).

* **Vocabulary Creation:** Building a mapping between tokens and unique integer indices. This allows the model to process text as numerical sequences, a format compatible with neural networks.  `torchtext.vocab.Vocab` facilitates vocabulary construction, allowing for frequency-based filtering and handling of special tokens like `<PAD>`, `<UNK>`, `<BOS>`, and `<EOS>`.

* **Numerical Representation (Embedding):** Converting token indices into dense vector representations (embeddings).  These vectors capture semantic relationships between words; words with similar meanings tend to have closer vectors in embedding space.  PyTorch allows the use of pre-trained embeddings like GloVe or Word2Vec, or the learning of embeddings from scratch as part of the model training process.

* **Data Loading and Batching:**  Efficiently loading and batching text data is crucial for training deep learning models.  `torchtext.data.Dataset` and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` provide tools for creating custom datasets and loaders that handle variable-length sequences efficiently.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Word-Level Tokenization and Embedding:**

```python
import torch
from torchtext.data import Field, TabularDataset
from torchtext.vocab import GloVe

# Define text field
TEXT = Field(tokenize='spacy', lower=True)

# Load dataset (replace with your data path)
train_data, test_data = TabularDataset.splits(
    path='.', train='train.csv', test='test.csv', format='csv',
    fields=[('text', TEXT)]
)

# Build vocabulary using pre-trained GloVe embeddings
TEXT.build_vocab(train_data, vectors=GloVe(name='6B', dim=300))

# Create iterator for batching
train_iterator = data.BucketIterator(train_data, batch_size=32, sort_key=lambda x: len(x.text), sort_within_batch=True)

# Accessing a batch
for batch in train_iterator:
    text = batch.text # Tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length)
    embeddings = TEXT.vocab.vectors[text] # Embeddings of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, 300)
```

This example demonstrates a basic setup using `torchtext`. We utilize spaCy for tokenization, GloVe for pre-trained embeddings, and `BucketIterator` for efficient batching considering variable sequence lengths.  The `sort_key` and `sort_within_batch` parameters optimize training by grouping similar-length sequences, minimizing padding.

**Example 2:  Character-Level RNN for Sentiment Analysis:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CharRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(CharRNN, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.rnn = nn.RNN(hidden_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        out, _ = self.rnn(embedded)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :]) # Use last hidden state for classification
        return out

# Example usage:
input_size = 70 # Size of character vocabulary
hidden_size = 128
output_size = 2 # Binary sentiment classification

model = CharRNN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
```

This example showcases a character-level RNN for sentiment analysis.  Each character is treated as a token, offering the ability to handle unseen words.  The model uses an embedding layer followed by an RNN to capture sequential information.  The output layer performs binary classification (positive/negative sentiment).  Note the use of `batch_first=True` in the RNN for ease of handling batched data.

**Example 3:  Transformer Model with Subword Tokenization:**

```python
import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel

# Load pre-trained BERT tokenizer and model
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Tokenize and encode text
text = "This is a sample sentence."
encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')

# Get BERT embeddings
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(**encoded_input)
    embeddings = output.last_hidden_state # Embeddings of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)
```

This example leverages the power of pre-trained Transformer models like BERT.  BERT uses subword tokenization (WordPiece), handling out-of-vocabulary words effectively.  The pre-trained model's embeddings capture rich contextual information, often resulting in superior performance compared to simpler approaches. The example shows how to easily obtain context-aware embeddings using the `transformers` library.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further study, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on `torchtext` and `torch.nn`.  Exploring resources on word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText), recurrent neural networks (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs), and transformer architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet) will provide a comprehensive understanding.  Furthermore, textbooks focusing on deep learning for natural language processing offer a strong theoretical foundation.  Reviewing research papers on state-of-the-art NLP models can offer insights into cutting-edge techniques.  Finally, exploring open-source code repositories on platforms like GitHub can be invaluable for practical learning and understanding implementation details.  These resources combined offer a robust path for mastering PyTorch applications in text processing.
