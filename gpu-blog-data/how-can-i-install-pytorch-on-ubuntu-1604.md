The most critical consideration when installing PyTorch on Ubuntu 16.04 for CPU-only use is ensuring you select the correct wheel file during installation.  My experience installing PyTorch across various Linux distributions, including extensive work supporting legacy systems like Ubuntu 16.04 within enterprise environments, highlights the frequent pitfalls associated with neglecting this step.  Incorrect wheel selection often leads to CUDA-related dependency errors despite explicitly intending a CPU-only build.

**1.  Explanation:**

PyTorch offers pre-built binaries (wheels) for various platforms and configurations.  Crucially, these binaries are differentiated based on the underlying hardware support: CUDA (for NVIDIA GPUs), ROCm (for AMD GPUs), and CPU-only.  Attempting to install a GPU-enabled wheel on a system lacking compatible hardware will result in installation failure. Ubuntu 16.04, while a somewhat outdated distribution, can still support a CPU-only PyTorch installation without issues provided the correct dependencies are satisfied. The core challenge lies in identifying and employing the appropriate command to utilize the correct wheel.

The installation process hinges on three primary aspects: satisfying system prerequisites, using the correct installation command emphasizing CPU-only support, and validating the installation.  I've encountered numerous situations where developers overlooked one or more of these stages, resulting in protracted debugging sessions.

First, the system must have fundamental prerequisites in place.  These include a suitable Python version (Python 3.7 or 3.8 are generally recommended for compatibility with older PyTorch versions suitable for Ubuntu 16.04).  Also, essential development packages, particularly those related to linear algebra and numerical computation (`libopenblas-base`, `libblas3`, `liblapack3`), must be installed.  I have personally found that explicitly installing these packages ahead of time resolves many conflicts that might otherwise arise.  Failure to do so often manifests as cryptic error messages related to missing BLAS or LAPACK libraries.

Second, the `pip` command must be leveraged correctly.  Simple installation via `pip install torch` is insufficient as it will, by default, attempt to install the most comprehensive package available – this will often be a CUDA-enabled wheel.  To explicitly use a CPU-only version, the installation must precisely specify this requirement. This is most effectively achieved through the PyTorch website's installation guide, which offers a command-line interface for generating the suitable installation instruction tailored to the specific system configuration. This addresses common errors stemming from relying on outdated or imprecise installation guides from third-party sources.  These sources are often not maintained and might offer instructions that were relevant only for past PyTorch versions or incorrect for a CPU-only build.

Third, verifying the successful installation is paramount.  This involves importing the PyTorch library within a Python interpreter and checking the availability of CPU-based tensors, ensuring that the GPU-related functionality is absent.  Failure to do so leads to developers believing the installation was successful when, in reality, crucial parts of the library are missing due to unmet dependencies.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Installing Necessary Dependencies (Ubuntu 16.04)**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev libopenblas-base libblas3 liblapack3
```

*Commentary:* This command sequence updates the local package repository, installs `pip` for package management (if not already installed), installs a suitable Python 3 version and essential linear algebra libraries necessary for PyTorch to function correctly on the CPU.  The `libopenblas-base` package is crucial, providing an optimized BLAS implementation for CPU calculations.  Skipping these steps commonly results in runtime errors during PyTorch tensor operations.


**Example 2:  Installing PyTorch CPU-only using the PyTorch Website's Installer**

```bash
# Navigate to your terminal and visit the official PyTorch website
# Use the command-line interface provided there (select options accordingly)
#   - Select your Operating System (Linux)
#   - Select your Package Manager (pip)
#   - Select your Language (Python)
#   - Select your CUDA version (None for CPU-only)
#   - Select your version of Python (Python 3.7 or 3.8 for example)
#   - Copy the generated command
# Example generated command (this will be system specific):
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# Modify this to remove the index-url if you are certain you want a CPU only build
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio 
```

*Commentary:*  This illustrates the process of generating a system-specific installation command via the official PyTorch website installer. The website’s interface dynamically generates the correct command, accounting for Python version, operating system, and the crucial "None" selection for CUDA. Directly using a pre-defined command from external resources can be unreliable; hence, using this official source is crucial for avoiding errors due to mismatched libraries. The modification to remove the `index-url` is shown to clarify the intention of CPU-only installation.  Always double check and confirm this step before running the command.

**Example 3: Verifying PyTorch Installation**

```python
import torch

print(torch.__version__)
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
x = torch.rand(5, 3)
print(x)
print(x.device)
```

*Commentary:* This Python snippet verifies the installation.  The `print(torch.__version__)` displays the installed PyTorch version, confirming a successful installation. More importantly, `print(torch.cuda.is_available())` should return `False`, explicitly indicating that the GPU-related components are not loaded. If it's `True`, that indicates that there's a CUDA-capable installation.  Finally, creating a tensor `x` and printing it along with its device confirms that operations are performed on the CPU (`cpu`).  The absence of a CUDA device in the output confirms the successful CPU-only installation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official PyTorch documentation.  This is an invaluable resource for accurate and up-to-date information.
* The official PyTorch website. It offers a dedicated installation guide with a command-line interface. This is the most reliable method to generate an appropriate command for your system.
* A comprehensive Linux system administration guide. This assists in efficiently managing system packages and dependencies.



By following these steps and employing the resources mentioned, you can confidently install PyTorch on Ubuntu 16.04 using only the CPU, avoiding common pitfalls and ensuring a stable development environment.  Remember, the official resources remain the primary source of truth for installation procedures, particularly concerning version compatibility and platform-specific configurations. Relying on secondary or outdated sources increases the probability of encountering unexpected issues.
