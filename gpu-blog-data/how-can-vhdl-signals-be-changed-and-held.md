The core challenge in conditionally modifying and retaining signal values within a VHDL `if` statement lies in understanding the inherently concurrent nature of VHDL and the distinction between signal assignment and signal update.  Signal assignments within a process do not take effect immediately; rather, they schedule a value change to occur at the end of the process.  This asynchronous update mechanism necessitates careful structuring of the code to achieve the desired conditional signal modification and retention.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on high-speed data path designs, especially when implementing state machines with conditional register updates.


**1.  Clear Explanation**

VHDL signals are not variables; they represent physical wires or registers in the hardware.  Direct assignment within an `if` statement, without the context of a process, will result in multiple drivers for the signal, leading to simulation errors or unpredictable hardware behavior. The correct approach involves enclosing the signal assignment within a process, typically a sequential process using a `wait` statement or a clocked process sensitive to a clock signal.  Within this process, the `if` statement controls the conditional signal update. The crucial point is that the signal assignment within the process only *schedules* a change; the actual update occurs at the end of the process's execution.  Therefore, using conditional assignments within a clocked process ensures that the updated value is registered and remains until the next clock edge.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Clocked Register Update**

This example demonstrates a simple register update conditioned by an input signal `enable`.  The register `reg_out` is updated only when `enable` is high.


```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity conditional_register is
  port (
    clk : in std_logic;
    enable : in std_logic;
    data_in : in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    reg_out : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of conditional_register is
  signal internal_reg : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
begin
  process (clk)
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      if enable = '1' then
        internal_reg <= data_in;
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;

  reg_out <= internal_reg;
end architecture;
```

* **Commentary:**  This uses a clocked process.  The `internal_reg` signal holds the intermediate value. The output `reg_out` is assigned directly from `internal_reg`, ensuring that the output reflects the conditionally updated value. The `rising_edge` function is crucial for synchronous update.

**Example 2:  State Machine with Conditional Updates**

This example expands on the previous one by introducing a state machine to control the register update based on different states.


```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity state_machine_register is
  port (
    clk : in std_logic;
    reset : in std_logic;
    data_in : in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    reg_out : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of state_machine_register is
  type state_type is (IDLE, PROCESS_DATA);
  signal current_state : state_type := IDLE;
  signal internal_reg : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
begin
  process (clk, reset)
  begin
    if reset = '1' then
      current_state <= IDLE;
      internal_reg <= (others => '0');
    elsif rising_edge(clk) then
      case current_state is
        when IDLE =>
          -- Transition logic to change state
          if some_condition = '1' then
            current_state <= PROCESS_DATA;
          end if;
        when PROCESS_DATA =>
          internal_reg <= data_in;
          current_state <= IDLE; -- Transition back to IDLE
        when others =>
          null;
      end case;
    end if;
  end process;

  reg_out <= internal_reg;
end architecture;
```

* **Commentary:**  This demonstrates conditional updates within a state machine.  The `internal_reg` is updated only when the state machine is in the `PROCESS_DATA` state. The `some_condition` signal represents logic determining the state transition.  Careful state management is paramount for proper operation.


**Example 3:  Asynchronous Update (with Caution)**

While generally discouraged for synchronous designs, an asynchronous update is possible, but requires careful consideration of potential race conditions and metastability issues.


```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity asynchronous_update is
  port (
    enable : in std_logic;
    data_in : in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    reg_out : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of asynchronous_update is
begin
  process (enable, data_in)
  begin
    if enable = '1' then
      reg_out <= data_in;
    end if;
  end process;
end architecture;
```

* **Commentary:**  This process is sensitive to `enable` and `data_in`.  Any change in either will trigger the process.  However, the lack of a clock makes this susceptible to timing issues and is generally avoided in most designs except for very specific circumstances where asynchronous behavior is explicitly required and carefully managed.  This would usually be avoided.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of VHDL signal assignments and concurrent processes, I suggest reviewing the relevant sections of a comprehensive VHDL textbook or reference manual. Pay close attention to the differences between signal assignments and variable assignments, the timing behavior of signals within processes, and the implications of sensitivity lists in process definitions.  Furthermore, a good grasp of digital logic fundamentals and state machine design principles will greatly enhance your ability to write robust and efficient VHDL code.  Finally, consider studying resources specifically focused on the synthesis process and how VHDL code is translated into hardware.  These concepts are integral to understanding how your signal assignments will ultimately behave in the actual implemented hardware.
