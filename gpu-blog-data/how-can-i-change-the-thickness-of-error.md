The control over error bar thickness in Altair isn't directly exposed through a single parameter like some other plotting libraries.  My experience working with statistical visualizations in Altair, spanning several large-scale data analysis projects, has consistently highlighted the need for a layered approach to achieve this.  The key is manipulating the underlying mark properties, specifically the strokeWidth, within the encoding specification.  We cannot modify the thickness of the error bar itself directly; instead we must modify the visual representation of the error bar, which is a line.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

Altair's declarative nature means we define the visual encoding of our data, and the error bars are rendered as lines connecting points defined by the uncertainty values (typically standard error or confidence intervals).  Consequently, modifying the thickness requires manipulating the `strokeWidth` property within the `mark_errorbar()` specification.  This property accepts numeric values, where higher values indicate thicker lines. However, simply adding `strokeWidth` to the `mark_errorbar` call is often insufficient. Because Altair's encoding is declarative, the application of `strokeWidth` needs to be coupled with a proper encoding of the error bar's data structure.  This often involves careful data preparation before charting, ensuring the data is structured to clearly define the upper and lower bounds for each error bar.  It is also important to note that this approach affects all error bars in the chart uniformly unless you introduce more sophisticated encoding schemes leveraging additional data columns.


2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Error Bar Thickness Modification**

This example demonstrates the fundamental method of changing error bar thickness.  We assume your data is already prepared with columns for x-values, y-values, and the upper and lower error bounds.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data
np.random.seed(42)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': np.arange(10),
    'y': np.random.randn(10),
    'lower': np.random.randn(10) * 0.5,
    'upper': np.random.randn(10) * 0.5
})

alt.Chart(data).mark_errorbar(strokeWidth=3).encode(
    x='x:O',
    y='y:Q',
    yError=('lower', 'upper')
).properties(width=400, height=300)
```

This code directly sets `strokeWidth` to 3 within `mark_errorbar()`.  This is the simplest method, effective when you need uniform thickness across all error bars.  Observe the `yError` parameter properly specifying the data columns representing the lower and upper error bounds.  The crucial aspect is the explicit inclusion of `strokeWidth` within the `mark_errorbar` definition.


**Example 2: Conditional Error Bar Thickness Based on a Data Column**

In more complex scenarios, you might need to vary error bar thickness depending on other variables within your dataset. This example introduces a new column, `category`, to control thickness.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data with a category column
np.random.seed(42)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': np.arange(10),
    'y': np.random.randn(10),
    'lower': np.random.randn(10) * 0.5,
    'upper': np.random.randn(10) * 0.5,
    'category': ['A'] * 5 + ['B'] * 5
})

alt.Chart(data).mark_errorbar().encode(
    x='x:O',
    y='y:Q',
    yError=('lower', 'upper'),
    strokeWidth='category:N' #Encoding strokeWidth based on category
).properties(width=400, height=300)

```

This example demonstrates conditional stroke width based on the 'category' column.  Altair automatically maps the categorical variable to different stroke widths. The underlying mechanism relies on Altair's internal legend mapping to assign different stroke widths to each category.  Note the absence of explicit strokeWidth assignment within `mark_errorbar`. The `strokeWidth` encoding leverages Altair's ability to map data columns to visual properties.


**Example 3:  Combining Error Bars with Points and Customizing Appearance**

This example integrates error bars with points, providing more comprehensive visualizations and demonstrating further customization.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(42)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': np.arange(10),
    'y': np.random.randn(10),
    'lower': np.random.randn(10) * 0.5,
    'upper': np.random.randn(10) * 0.5,
    'category': ['A']*5 + ['B']*5
})

points = alt.Chart(data).mark_point(size=100, color='red').encode(
    x='x:O',
    y='y:Q'
)

errorbars = alt.Chart(data).mark_errorbar(strokeWidth=2, color='red').encode(
    x='x:O',
    y='y:Q',
    yError=('lower', 'upper')
)

points + errorbars
```

Here, we define two separate chart layers: one for points and another for error bars. This allows for independent styling.   The error bars are styled using `strokeWidth` similar to Example 1, maintaining separation of visual elements. This layered approach adds clarity and allows for greater control over aesthetic aspects.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The Altair documentation, specifically the sections on encoding and marks, is invaluable.  Consult the official Altair tutorial and examples for deeper understanding of encoding schemes.  A comprehensive data visualization textbook will offer a broader context on the principles of visual communication and error representation.  Finally, browsing through Altair's GitHub repository and exploring community-contributed examples can reveal advanced techniques and solutions to similar challenges.  Exploring pandas' data manipulation capabilities is also vital for data preparation prior to visualization.
