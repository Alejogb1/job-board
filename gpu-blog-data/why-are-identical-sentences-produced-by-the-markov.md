The fundamental reason a Markov chain, trained on a corpus of text, can produce identical sentences is due to the deterministic nature of the process given identical starting states and transition probabilities. The inherent lack of true randomness within the Markov chain algorithm itself means that, under the same conditions, the same path through the probability matrix will consistently be followed.

A Markov chain operates on the principle of modeling transitions between states, where in the context of text generation, the states are typically words or n-grams. I’ve spent considerable time developing and debugging text generators, and one recurring issue I've observed is this tendency towards repetitive output when the training data is limited or when the order of the Markov chain (the 'n' in n-grams) is too low. The core problem lies in how the probabilities are calculated and applied.

During training, the algorithm traverses the input corpus, counting the occurrences of state transitions. For instance, if using a bigram model (n=2), it counts how often each word is followed by another word. These counts are then normalized to derive the probability of each transition. If a particular transition has a high probability and no viable alternatives exist or are assigned low probability, the chain will likely traverse that path repeatedly. The sequence of choices becomes predictable.

The generation process is also deterministic. Starting from a seed word, or a randomly chosen start state, the generator selects the next state based on the probabilities calculated during training. In a bigram model, it chooses the next word based solely on the current word. If the probability distribution of the next possible words is skewed and a few words have dramatically higher probability than others, it is exceptionally likely that, upon restarting the generation from the same initial condition, the same sequence of words will be chosen again and again. This problem exacerbates when the corpus is small, limiting the variability in the transitional probabilities and creating only a few dominant paths.

To clarify with examples, consider a tiny corpus consisting of just three sentences:

"The cat sat on the mat."
"The dog chased the cat."
"The mat was old."

Here are three different approaches to demonstrate the issue, focusing on different Markov chain orders:

**Example 1: Bigram (Order 2) Markov Chain**

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import random

corpus = ["The cat sat on the mat.", "The dog chased the cat.", "The mat was old."]

def generate_bigrams(corpus):
    bigrams = defaultdict(list)
    for sentence in corpus:
        words = sentence.lower().split()
        for i in range(len(words) - 1):
            bigrams[words[i]].append(words[i+1])
    return bigrams

def generate_sentence(bigrams, start_word = "the", max_length=10):
  current_word = start_word
  sentence = [current_word]
  for _ in range(max_length):
    if current_word in bigrams:
      next_word = random.choice(bigrams[current_word])
      sentence.append(next_word)
      current_word = next_word
    else:
      break # handle end of chain

  return " ".join(sentence)

bigram_model = generate_bigrams(corpus)

print(generate_sentence(bigram_model))
print(generate_sentence(bigram_model))
print(generate_sentence(bigram_model))
```

The output will most frequently be some variation of "the cat sat on the mat" or "the dog chased the cat" if you use the "the" word as a starting point, with less frequent "the mat was old". Since the transition "the" to "cat" or "dog" or "mat" is significantly more probable, given the small corpus and the use of "the" as a starting state, the chain will likely repeatedly select a short path leading to very similar sentences.

**Example 2: Trigram (Order 3) Markov Chain**

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import random

corpus = ["The cat sat on the mat.", "The dog chased the cat.", "The mat was old."]

def generate_trigrams(corpus):
    trigrams = defaultdict(list)
    for sentence in corpus:
        words = sentence.lower().split()
        for i in range(len(words) - 2):
            trigrams[(words[i], words[i+1])].append(words[i+2])
    return trigrams

def generate_sentence_trigram(trigrams, start_words=("the", "cat"), max_length=10):
  current_words = start_words
  sentence = list(current_words)

  for _ in range(max_length):
    if current_words in trigrams:
      next_word = random.choice(trigrams[current_words])
      sentence.append(next_word)
      current_words = (current_words[1], next_word)
    else:
        break
  return " ".join(sentence)

trigram_model = generate_trigrams(corpus)
print(generate_sentence_trigram(trigram_model))
print(generate_sentence_trigram(trigram_model))
print(generate_sentence_trigram(trigram_model))
```

With the trigram model, given starting words such as ("the", "cat"), the result will almost always produce "the cat sat on the mat", because there’s only one path in the training data, the chance of this being generated is extremely high. The increased context of the trigram increases the likelihood of reproducing the training sequences exactly. The problem is not that the model is unable to generate, rather it is that the data is limited, and the model is, therefore, too deterministic.

**Example 3: Bigram model with variable starting points and more words:**

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import random

corpus = ["The cat sat on the mat.", "The dog chased the cat.", "The mat was old.", "A bird flew high above the clouds"]

def generate_bigrams(corpus):
    bigrams = defaultdict(list)
    for sentence in corpus:
        words = sentence.lower().split()
        for i in range(len(words) - 1):
            bigrams[words[i]].append(words[i+1])
    return bigrams

def generate_sentence_random_start(bigrams, max_length=10):
    start_word = random.choice(list(bigrams.keys()))
    current_word = start_word
    sentence = [current_word]
    for _ in range(max_length):
        if current_word in bigrams:
            next_word = random.choice(bigrams[current_word])
            sentence.append(next_word)
            current_word = next_word
        else:
          break

    return " ".join(sentence)

bigram_model = generate_bigrams(corpus)
print(generate_sentence_random_start(bigram_model))
print(generate_sentence_random_start(bigram_model))
print(generate_sentence_random_start(bigram_model))
```
While this example adds an additional sentence to the corpus and employs a random starting word, the fundamental problem still persists. It is likely to produce the original sentences. With the additional sentence, the chance of new sentences increases. The tendency to repeat the training set, however, remains.

These examples illustrate the core issue. Limited data leads to highly biased probability distributions, causing the chain to converge on certain paths repeatedly, leading to identical or very similar sentences. Increasing the order (n) of the Markov chain does not solve this issue, rather it tends to increase the likelihood of copying training data because the n-grams become more specific and fewer options exist.  Therefore, a small corpus with a trigram is more likely to reproduce sentences exactly than a small corpus with a bigram model.

To mitigate this, several strategies are commonly employed, but ultimately the nature of the markov chain will often lead to repetition:

1.  **Larger Corpora:** The most effective approach is using a significantly larger, more diverse training corpus. This introduces variability in state transitions and reduces the dominance of a few pathways.
2.  **Higher Order Markov Chains:** While higher-order chains can capture more context, they also become increasingly sparse and susceptible to overfitting, which causes reproduction of the training data.
3.  **Smoothing:** Applying smoothing techniques to the probability distributions prevents probabilities from being zero or exceptionally small, thereby providing paths the Markov chain would not have had otherwise.
4. **Randomization**: Introducing some random variation beyond the standard choice mechanism can reduce the deterministic nature, but may also result in low grammatical sentences.

**Recommended Resources:**

For a more in-depth theoretical understanding, explore textbooks focusing on probabilistic models and natural language processing. University-level course materials on information theory and Markov processes can provide a solid foundation. Practical insights are best gained through experiment, debugging and observing the patterns in the output. Online tutorials for language processing in Python often cover Markov chain implementations and the associated issues of deterministic repetition, and are extremely valuable. These materials combined will provide a thorough understanding of the problem and how to mitigate it within the confines of the algorithm.
