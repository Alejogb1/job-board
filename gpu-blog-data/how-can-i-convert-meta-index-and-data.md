The direct conversion of `.meta`, `.index`, and `.data` files (typically associated with TensorFlow checkpoints) to the SavedModel format (.pb) isn't a straightforward file-type transformation.  These files represent a checkpoint – a snapshot of a TensorFlow model's variables and graph at a specific training point – and are fundamentally different from a SavedModel, which is a self-contained, servable representation of a model.  My experience working on large-scale TensorFlow deployments for financial modeling revealed this nuance repeatedly; directly manipulating these files is unreliable and often leads to errors.  The correct approach involves restoring the model from the checkpoint and then exporting it as a SavedModel.

This process leverages the TensorFlow API to reconstruct the computational graph and variables from the checkpoint files.  The `meta` file holds the graph definition, while `index` and `data` store the variable values. Rebuilding the graph from the `meta` file and populating it with the values from `index` and `data` allows for the creation of a session, necessary for the final export to SavedModel format. This meticulously recreates the model's state as it existed during checkpoint creation, preserving the `MetaGraphDef`.

**Explanation:**

The process involves three crucial steps: importing the metagraph, restoring the variables, and exporting the model as a SavedModel.  The metagraph definition, crucial for preserving model architecture and its associated data, is implicitly handled during this restoration and subsequent export.  Improper handling can lead to an incomplete or structurally flawed SavedModel, rendering it unusable for inference or deployment.  Failure to accurately reconstitute the variables from their serialized forms is equally problematic.  The correct procedure ensures the precise preservation of both the model's structure and its learned parameters.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Basic SavedModel Export**

This example demonstrates a basic workflow assuming you have successfully loaded your model from the checkpoint.  I've used this technique countless times in my work building production-ready models.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Code to restore the model from .meta, .index, .data files, resulting in a 'sess' object) ...

builder = tf.saved_model.builder.SavedModelBuilder("./my_saved_model")

# Add the metagraph to the builder.  The signature_def_map is crucial for specifying input and output tensors.
builder.add_meta_graph_and_variables(
    sess,  # The TensorFlow session containing your restored model.
    tags=[tf.saved_model.SERVING],  # Tags for serving the model.
    signature_def_map={
        "serving_default": tf.saved_model.signature_def_utils.predict_signature_def(
            inputs={"input_tensor": tf.saved_model.utils.build_tensor_info(your_input_tensor)}, # Replace with your actual input tensor
            outputs={"output_tensor": tf.saved_model.utils.build_tensor_info(your_output_tensor)} # Replace with your actual output tensor
        )
    }
)

builder.save()
```

**Example 2: Handling Multiple Metagraphs**

In scenarios with multiple metagraphs (e.g., different training phases or model variants), the process requires careful selection.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Code to restore the model from .meta, .index, .data files, resulting in a 'sess' object and metagraph_def) ...

builder = tf.saved_model.builder.SavedModelBuilder("./my_multi_saved_model")

# Select the desired metagraph for export
metagraph_def = sess.graph_def  #Potentially select a specific metagraph from a list, depending on your setup.

builder.add_meta_graph_and_variables(
    sess, tags=[tf.saved_model.SERVING],
    signature_def_map={ #Define signatures for each metagraph if necessary
        "serving_default":  tf.saved_model.signature_def_utils.predict_signature_def(
            inputs={"input_tensor": tf.saved_model.utils.build_tensor_info(your_input_tensor)},
            outputs={"output_tensor": tf.saved_model.utils.build_tensor_info(your_output_tensor)}
        )
    },
    clear_devices=True # optional for better portability across different hardware
)

builder.save()
```

**Example 3:  Error Handling and Session Management**

Robust code includes proper error handling and resource management.  This is especially vital in production environments where unexpected failures are costly.  I've encountered many instances where inadequate error handling caused significant disruptions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    # ... (Code to restore the model from .meta, .index, .data files) ...
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()) #Ensure variables are initialized
        #...restore the variables from checkpoint...

        builder = tf.saved_model.builder.SavedModelBuilder("./my_robust_saved_model")
        builder.add_meta_graph_and_variables(sess, tags=[tf.saved_model.SERVING])
        builder.save()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    # Ensure session is closed even if errors occur.
    if 'sess' in locals() and sess:
        sess.close()

```

**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guidance on SavedModel and checkpoint management.  Consult the TensorFlow API reference for details on `tf.saved_model` and `tf.compat.v1.Session` functionalities.  Consider reviewing advanced TensorFlow tutorials covering model deployment and serving.  Understanding the concepts of metagraphs and signature definitions is crucial for successful model export.  Furthermore, explore resources on best practices for handling exceptions and managing TensorFlow sessions efficiently. This will ensure the robustness and reliability of your model conversion process.
