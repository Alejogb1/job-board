Managing concurrency across multiple GPUs in CUDA necessitates a deep understanding of both CUDA's programming model and the underlying hardware architecture.  My experience optimizing large-scale simulations for computational fluid dynamics has highlighted the crucial role of inter-GPU communication and task scheduling in achieving efficient parallel execution.  Simply distributing the workload evenly is insufficient; careful consideration of data dependencies and communication overhead is paramount to maximizing performance.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Efficient concurrency in multi-GPU CUDA applications demands a multi-faceted approach.  It's not solely about throwing more GPUs at the problem; it's about intelligently distributing tasks and managing the flow of data between them.  This involves several key strategies:

* **Data Partitioning:**  The initial step is to partition the data across the available GPUs.  A common method involves dividing the input data into roughly equal chunks, assigning each chunk to a different GPU.  However, the optimal partitioning strategy depends heavily on the specific algorithm and data structure. For instance, in a spatial simulation, partitioning based on spatial locality often minimizes communication.  Conversely, a task-based approach might prove more beneficial for algorithms with independent tasks.

* **Inter-GPU Communication:**  Once data is partitioned, efficient communication mechanisms are critical.  CUDA provides several mechanisms for inter-GPU data transfer, including Peer-to-Peer (P2P) memory access and CUDA streams.  P2P access, if supported by the hardware, offers the lowest latency for data exchange.  However, it requires careful configuration and may be subject to bandwidth limitations.  CUDA streams enable asynchronous data transfers, allowing computation and communication to overlap, thus hiding communication latency.

* **Synchronization:**  Synchronization primitives are essential for coordinating tasks across GPUs.  CUDA events can be used to track the completion of kernels on different GPUs, ensuring that data dependencies are respected.  This is particularly crucial in iterative algorithms where the output of one GPU serves as the input for another.  Improper synchronization can lead to race conditions and incorrect results.

* **Task Scheduling:**  For complex applications with heterogeneous tasks, a dynamic task scheduler can be beneficial.  Such a scheduler can intelligently assign tasks to GPUs based on their current load and availability, maximizing utilization and minimizing idle time.  However, implementing a robust task scheduler adds complexity and requires careful consideration of overhead.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different aspects of multi-GPU concurrency management in CUDA.  Note that these examples are simplified for clarity and assume a suitable CUDA-capable environment.  Error handling and performance optimization techniques have been omitted for brevity.

**Example 1: Simple Data Partitioning and Kernel Launch**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>

// Kernel to process a portion of the data
__global__ void processData(float* data, int size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
        // Perform computation on data[i]
        data[i] *= 2.0f;
    }
}

int main() {
    int numGPUs = 0;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&numGPUs);
    std::cout << "Number of GPUs: " << numGPUs << std::endl;

    // Assuming data is already allocated and initialized
    float* h_data; // Host data
    float** d_data; // Device data pointers array

    // Allocate device memory for each GPU
    d_data = new float*[numGPUs];
    for (int i = 0; i < numGPUs; ++i) {
        cudaSetDevice(i);
        cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data[i], dataSize / numGPUs * sizeof(float));
    }

    // Copy data to each GPU
    // ...

    // Launch kernel on each GPU
    for (int i = 0; i < numGPUs; ++i) {
        cudaSetDevice(i);
        int blockSize = 256;
        int gridSize = (dataSize / numGPUs + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;
        processData<<<gridSize, blockSize>>>(d_data[i], dataSize / numGPUs);
    }

    // Copy data back from each GPU to host
    // ...

    // Release memory
    // ...

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates basic data partitioning and kernel launch across multiple GPUs.  Data is divided equally among the GPUs, and the `processData` kernel is launched independently on each.


**Example 2: Using CUDA Streams for Asynchronous Data Transfer**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
// ...

int main() {
    // ... data allocation and partitioning ...

    cudaStream_t stream;
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

    // Copy data to device asynchronously
    cudaMemcpyAsync(d_data[1], h_data + dataSize / 2, dataSize / 2 * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);

    // Launch kernel on GPU 0
    processData<<<...>>>(d_data[0], dataSize / 2);

    // Synchronize stream to ensure data transfer is complete before kernel launch on GPU 1
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);
    processData<<<...>>>(d_data[1], dataSize / 2);

    // ...
}
```

This shows how CUDA streams enable asynchronous data transfer, allowing the kernel on GPU 0 to execute concurrently with the data transfer to GPU 1.


**Example 3: Utilizing CUDA Events for Synchronization**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
// ...

int main() {
    // ... data allocation and partitioning ...

    cudaEvent_t startEvent, endEvent;
    cudaEventCreate(&startEvent);
    cudaEventCreate(&endEvent);

    // Launch kernel on GPU 0 and record start event
    cudaEventRecord(startEvent, 0);
    processData<<<...>>>(d_data[0], dataSize / 2);

    // Launch kernel on GPU 1
    processData<<<...>>>(d_data[1], dataSize / 2);

    // Wait for GPU 0 kernel completion
    cudaEventRecord(endEvent, 0);
    cudaEventSynchronize(endEvent);

    // Perform post-processing using results from both GPUs.  The synchronization ensures that data from GPU 0 is available.
    // ...
}

```

Here, CUDA events are used to synchronize the execution of kernels across GPUs. The main thread waits for the completion of the kernel on GPU 0 before proceeding.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the CUDA C Programming Guide, the CUDA Toolkit documentation, and relevant academic papers on parallel computing and multi-GPU programming.  Exploring examples from the NVIDIA CUDA samples repository is also invaluable for practical learning.  Furthermore, studying advanced techniques such as MPI for large-scale distributed computing complements CUDA's capabilities.  Finally, profiling tools within the NVIDIA Nsight ecosystem are critical for identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks in multi-GPU applications.
