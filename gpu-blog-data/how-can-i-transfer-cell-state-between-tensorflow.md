The core challenge in transferring cell state between TensorFlow LSTMs lies in understanding and appropriately managing the internal state tensors, specifically the `c` (cell state) and `h` (hidden state) tensors.  These tensors aren't directly accessible as model attributes; their manipulation requires a deeper understanding of the LSTM's internal workings and the TensorFlow graph.  My experience working on sequence-to-sequence models for financial time series prediction has highlighted this frequently.  Efficient state transfer is crucial for maintaining long-range dependencies and preventing information loss across distinct LSTM layers or even separate models.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow LSTMs, unlike some simpler recurrent units, possess a richer internal structure. The `cell_state` (often referred to as `c`) accumulates information over time, representing a long-term memory component.  The `hidden_state` (`h`) is a function of the current input and the cell state, often acting as a short-term memory summarizing the current context.  Simply assigning weights or copying outputs between LSTMs won't transfer this crucial cell state.  Instead, the mechanism for transferring cell state involves directly manipulating the internal tensors at the appropriate points in the computational graph.  This typically involves techniques such as:

* **Direct Tensor Manipulation:**  Using TensorFlow's low-level operations to directly access and assign the cell and hidden state tensors from one LSTM to another. This approach necessitates a thorough understanding of the LSTM's internal structure and the graph's execution order.

* **Custom LSTM Cell:**  Defining a custom LSTM cell class that incorporates the state transfer logic within its structure. This allows for more seamless integration and potentially improved readability compared to direct tensor manipulation.

* **Intermediate State Variables:** Creating TensorFlow variables explicitly to store and manage the cell and hidden state between separate LSTM instances.  This offers increased control but can lead to more complex graph structures.

The choice of the optimal technique depends on the specifics of the architecture and the desired level of integration.  For simple state transfers between adjacent LSTMs, direct tensor manipulation might suffice.  For more complex scenarios or when dealing with multiple LSTM networks, a custom cell or intermediate state variables provide a better structured approach.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Direct Tensor Manipulation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define two LSTMs
lstm1 = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_state=True)
lstm2 = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64)

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 10, 128)) # batch, timesteps, features

# Run lstm1 and extract states
output1, state_h1, state_c1 = lstm1(input_tensor)

# Manually feed the states to lstm2
output2 = lstm2(tf.expand_dims(output1[:, -1, :], axis=1), initial_state=[state_h1, state_c1]) #last output only, reshape to (1,1,64) for lstm2

# Accessing the output of the second LSTM
print(output2)
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates direct state passing.  `return_state=True` is crucial for retrieving `h` and `c` from `lstm1`. `tf.expand_dims` reshapes the final output of `lstm1` to match the expected input shape of `lstm2` since only the last output is passed for a clean state transfer.


**Example 2: Custom LSTM Cell**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class TransferLSTMCell(tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell):
    def __init__(self, units, initial_state=None, **kwargs):
        super(TransferLSTMCell, self).__init__(units, **kwargs)
        self.initial_state = initial_state

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        if self.initial_state is not None:
            states = self.initial_state
            self.initial_state = None # only use initial state once
        output, [h, c] = super(TransferLSTMCell, self).call(inputs, states)
        return output, [h, c]

# Create an instance with initial states
lstm_cell = TransferLSTMCell(64, initial_state=[tf.zeros((1, 64)), tf.zeros((1, 64))])

# Create a RNN layer using the custom cell
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.RNN(lstm_cell)

#Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 10, 128))

#Process the input
output, state = lstm_layer(input_tensor)

print(output,state)

#Subsequent use of this LSTM can use the states from previous outputs in its subsequent call
```

**Commentary:** This builds a custom LSTM cell enabling direct state injection during instantiation. This simplifies state management, particularly beneficial for complex networks.  Note that the initial state is applied only once in the first `call`.


**Example 3: Intermediate State Variables**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define two LSTMs
lstm1 = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_state=True)
lstm2 = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64)

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 10, 128))

# Run lstm1 and extract states
output1, state_h1, state_c1 = lstm1(input_tensor)

# Create state variables
state_h = tf.Variable(state_h1, name="state_h")
state_c = tf.Variable(state_c1, name="state_c")

# Assign states to new variables
state_h.assign(state_h1)
state_c.assign(state_c1)

# Feed states to lstm2, using the variables
output2 = lstm2(tf.expand_dims(output1[:,-1,:], axis=1), initial_state=[state_h, state_c])

print(output2)

```

**Commentary:** This approach uses TensorFlow variables to explicitly store and manage the state between LSTM instances.  This offers greater flexibility and control over the state, suitable when state needs to persist across multiple steps or be shared between multiple models.  However, it introduces the overhead of managing these variables.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on LSTMs and recurrent neural networks.  Explore the TensorFlow API reference for details on the `tf.keras.layers.LSTM` class and its attributes.  Study examples of sequence-to-sequence models and explore tutorials focused on building custom cells in TensorFlow.  Finally, examining code examples from research papers dealing with complex recurrent architectures can be highly beneficial.  These resources provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying concepts and practical implementation techniques.
