The inherent instability stemming from combining parameters from disparate networks within a single optimizer's purview frequently arises from the differing gradient magnitudes and update scales.  My experience working on large-scale multi-modal learning systems – specifically, a project involving audio-visual sentiment analysis – highlighted this issue acutely.  The model consisted of a convolutional neural network (CNN) processing visual data and a recurrent neural network (RNN) handling audio input, both feeding into a shared sentiment classification layer.  Optimizing all parameters simultaneously using Adam led to erratic training behavior, characterized by unstable loss fluctuations and ultimately, poor generalization performance. This instability is not merely an inconvenience; it significantly impacts convergence speed and the model's final accuracy.

The underlying reason for this instability boils down to the distinct characteristics of the individual networks.  CNNs, especially those processing high-dimensional image data, often exhibit larger gradient magnitudes compared to RNNs operating on lower-dimensional sequential data. This difference in magnitude means that the optimizer will effectively prioritize the updates to the CNN parameters, potentially causing the RNN parameters to undergo slow or insignificant adjustments. This imbalance can manifest as a "dominating" network hindering the learning process of the others, leading to suboptimal overall model performance.  The optimizer, attempting to satisfy the conflicting update directions and magnitudes from the disparate networks, effectively becomes overwhelmed.  This leads to oscillations, slow convergence, and potential divergence.

The solution is not to simply avoid combining parameters.  In many sophisticated architectures, such as those combining different sensory modalities or using auxiliary tasks, parameter sharing is crucial for efficient learning and effective knowledge transfer.  The key is in managing the gradient flow to mitigate the effects of these differing scales. Several strategies can address this, and I've employed them effectively in my work.

**1. Gradient Clipping:** This technique limits the magnitude of the gradients before they are applied to update the parameters. By setting a threshold, we prevent excessively large gradients from dominating the update process.  This effectively reduces the influence of networks with overwhelmingly large gradients, giving other networks more opportunity to adapt.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... define your model (CNN and RNN combined) ...

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)  #Standard Adam Optimizer

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in data_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(batch)
        loss = loss_function(output, labels)
        loss.backward()
        nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0) # Gradient clipping
        optimizer.step()

```

In this example, `nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)` clips the gradients of all model parameters to a maximum norm of 1.0.  The `max_norm` parameter needs careful tuning, as too low a value can limit learning, while too high a value loses the effectiveness of the clipping.  This is determined empirically through experimentation.


**2. Differential Learning Rates:** Assigning different learning rates to different parts of the network allows us to fine-tune the influence of each component.  Networks with larger gradients can use a smaller learning rate, while those with smaller gradients might benefit from a higher one. This directly addresses the scale mismatch problem.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... define your model (CNN and RNN combined) ...

cnn_params = list(model.cnn.parameters()) # Parameters specific to the CNN
rnn_params = list(model.rnn.parameters()) # Parameters specific to the RNN
shared_params = list(model.shared.parameters()) # Parameters shared between the networks

optimizer = optim.Adam([
    {'params': cnn_params, 'lr': 0.0001},  # Lower learning rate for CNN
    {'params': rnn_params, 'lr': 0.001},   # Higher learning rate for RNN
    {'params': shared_params, 'lr': 0.0005} # Moderate learning rate for shared layers
], lr=0.001) #Default learning rate

#...rest of the training loop remains the same as above...
```

This code showcases the use of separate learning rates for different parts of the model.  The learning rates are carefully chosen based on observations of gradient magnitudes during preliminary runs.  Proper tuning through experimentation is crucial here. The shared layer benefits from a moderate learning rate that balances the effects from the CNN and the RNN.


**3. Layer-wise Learning Rate Decay:** This is a more sophisticated approach that dynamically adjusts the learning rates for different layers based on their performance or gradient magnitude.  This could involve tracking the gradient norms for each layer, or using a decay schedule specific to each layer.  I have found this particularly useful when dealing with very deep networks where gradients can vanish or explode in certain layers.


```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... define your model ...

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

#Define decay schedule based on layer depth or other criteria
decay_rate = 0.95
for layer in model.named_modules():
    if isinstance(layer[1], (nn.Linear, nn.Conv2d)):
        lr_multiplier = decay_rate**(len(layer[0].split('.')))
        for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:
            if layer[1] in [p for p in param_group['params']]:
              param_group['lr'] = 0.001*lr_multiplier

# ... training loop ...

```

Here, the learning rate is decreased exponentially as the depth of the layers increases.  This approach, while more complex, allows for more nuanced control over the learning process, effectively addressing the gradient magnitude differences across different network depths, which can also contribute to instability.  The split of the layer names using '.' is a typical method for defining the path of a layer within a nested structure like a sequential network.  Alternative criteria like gradient magnitude could be substituted for layer depth.

In conclusion, combining parameters from disparate networks within the same optimizer requires careful consideration of gradient scaling issues. Techniques such as gradient clipping, differential learning rates, and layer-wise learning rate decay provide effective methods to mitigate the instability often encountered.  The optimal strategy depends on the specifics of the model architecture and the data, demanding thorough experimentation and careful monitoring of the training process.  Further resources to explore include advanced optimization techniques like different optimizer algorithms (e.g., SGD with momentum) and regularization strategies to better control the learning process.  Careful analysis of the gradient magnitudes and layer-wise contributions to the loss function through visualization tools are also highly recommended.
