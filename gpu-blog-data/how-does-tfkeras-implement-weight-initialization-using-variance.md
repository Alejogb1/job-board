TensorFlow 2.x's `tf.keras` leverages variance scaling initializers, specifically those derived from Glorot and He initialization, to mitigate the vanishing/exploding gradient problem during deep network training.  My experience optimizing large-scale convolutional neural networks for image recognition heavily relied on understanding and manipulating these initialization strategies.  The core principle is to maintain an approximately constant variance of activations throughout the network layers, preventing gradients from either shrinking to insignificance or growing uncontrollably during backpropagation.


**1.  Explanation of Variance Scaling Initialization in `tf.keras`**

Variance scaling initializers aim to adjust the scale of initial weights based on the number of input and output units of a layer.  This contrasts with simpler methods like uniform or normal random initialization, which may lead to unstable training dynamics, particularly in deep networks.  The underlying rationale stems from the observation that the variance of activations propagates through the network.  If the variance shrinks excessively (vanishing gradients), the network struggles to learn; if it explodes, training becomes unstable.

`tf.keras` provides several initializers implementing this principle: `glorot_uniform`, `glorot_normal`, `he_uniform`, and `he_normal`.  The `glorot` (also known as Xavier) initializers are suitable for layers with sigmoid or tanh activation functions, while `he` initializers are preferred for ReLU and its variants.  This distinction arises from the different activation function properties affecting the variance of outputs.  ReLU's unilateral nature (outputting zero for negative inputs) necessitates a different scaling to maintain appropriate activation variance.


The core formulas underpinning these initializers are:

* **Glorot (Xavier) Uniform:** `limit = sqrt(6 / (fan_in + fan_out))`, where weights are drawn from a uniform distribution in `[-limit, limit]`.
* **Glorot (Xavier) Normal:** `stddev = sqrt(2 / (fan_in + fan_out))`, where weights are drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean and this standard deviation.
* **He Uniform:** `limit = sqrt(6 / fan_in)`, using a uniform distribution as above.
* **He Normal:** `stddev = sqrt(2 / fan_in)`, using a normal distribution as above.

`fan_in` represents the number of input units to the layer, and `fan_out` the number of output units.  The He initializers consider only `fan_in` because of ReLU's effect on the variance.  These formulas ensure that the variance of the weighted sum of inputs remains relatively consistent across layers, promoting more stable training.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Glorot Uniform Initialization for a Dense Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='sigmoid', 
                        kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform',
                        input_shape=(784,)), #Example input shape for MNIST
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#Note the use of 'glorot_uniform' for a sigmoid activated layer
```

This example demonstrates the application of `glorot_uniform` to a dense layer with a sigmoid activation function.  The choice aligns with the theoretical underpinnings of the Xavier initializer, which is well-suited for activation functions with bounded outputs.  The `input_shape` parameter is crucial for defining the input dimensionality.


**Example 2: He Normal Initialization for a Convolutional Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu',
                         kernel_initializer='he_normal',
                         input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), #Example input shape for MNIST
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#Note the use of 'he_normal' for a ReLU activated convolutional layer
```

This example showcases `he_normal` for a convolutional layer using a ReLU activation function.  The He initializer is particularly appropriate here because ReLU's unilateral nature necessitates a different scaling compared to sigmoid or tanh.  The `input_shape` specifies the image dimensions.


**Example 3: Custom Variance Scaling Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class MyVarianceScalingInitializer(tf.keras.initializers.Initializer):
    def __init__(self, scale=2.0, mode='fan_in', distribution='truncated_normal'):
        self.scale = scale
        self.mode = mode
        self.distribution = distribution

    def __call__(self, shape, dtype=None):
        fan_in, fan_out = _calculate_fans(shape)
        scale = self.scale
        if self.mode == 'fan_in':
            scale /= max(1., fan_in)
        elif self.mode == 'fan_out':
            scale /= max(1., fan_out)
        elif self.mode == 'fan_avg':
            scale /= max(1., (fan_in + fan_out) / 2.)
        else:
            raise ValueError('Invalid mode: {}'.format(self.mode))

        if self.distribution == 'normal':
            return tf.random.normal(shape, stddev=np.sqrt(scale), dtype=dtype)
        elif self.distribution == 'truncated_normal':
            return tf.random.truncated_normal(shape, stddev=np.sqrt(scale), dtype=dtype)
        elif self.distribution == 'uniform':
            limit = np.sqrt(3.0 * scale)
            return tf.random.uniform(shape, minval=-limit, maxval=limit, dtype=dtype)
        else:
            raise ValueError('Invalid distribution: {}'.format(self.distribution))

def _calculate_fans(shape):
    if len(shape) == 2:
        fan_in = shape[0]
        fan_out = shape[1]
    elif len(shape) == 4:
        receptive_field_size = np.prod(shape[1:3])
        fan_in = shape[0] * receptive_field_size
        fan_out = shape[3] * receptive_field_size
    else:
        fan_in = np.prod(shape[:-1])
        fan_out = shape[-1]
    return fan_in, fan_out


initializer = MyVarianceScalingInitializer(scale=1.0, mode='fan_avg', distribution='uniform')
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_initializer=initializer)

```

This example demonstrates creating a custom initializer, offering more granular control over the scaling factor, calculation mode (`fan_in`, `fan_out`, `fan_avg`), and distribution (`normal`, `truncated_normal`, `uniform`).  This is useful for fine-tuning initialization based on specific network architectures and datasets.  Note that this requires defining helper functions to calculate `fan_in` and `fan_out` correctly for different layer types.
