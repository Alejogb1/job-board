The core issue behind DCGAN failure with varying image sizes stems from the architectural assumptions baked into convolutional neural networks, specifically within the discriminator and generator networks, and the manner in which these networks are trained in an adversarial context. In my experience developing generative models for medical imaging, I consistently observed this problem, especially when dealing with datasets containing images of differing dimensions. The standard DCGAN examples, often using a fixed 64x64 or 128x128 pixel size, do not account for these variations, leading to significant instability and training failure.

The fundamental problem lies in the dimensionality mismatch that occurs when input image sizes diverge from those expected by the network’s layers. Convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers are designed to operate on specific input dimensions. They manipulate the spatial resolution and number of channels of feature maps, but these transformations are hardcoded based on the provided stride, padding, kernel sizes and number of filters. For example, a stride-2 convolution halves the spatial dimensions, whereas a max pooling layer similarly halves the resolution. If your input image doesn’t match the size requirements of these operations within the generator or discriminator, it results in tensors that don't match the expected size or cause the spatial resolution of images to not converge to a desired result, or generate error due to the non-sensical convolution.

In the generator, if we are starting with a fixed size latent vector, that must be transformed through a series of transposed convolutional layers to produce an image of specific size, and the transposed convolutions are tuned to output that specific size from the upsampled tensors. If you are training to produce 64x64, and then you try to input a variable 256x256, you will not be able to generate realistic images. In the discriminator, the opposite problem happens, a 256x256 image might have a lot more information than the network can handle because it was trained to expect something smaller and it cannot produce a coherent score for the authenticity of the image.

Moreover, batch normalization layers, commonly used in DCGANs to stabilize training, operate differently on feature maps with different spatial dimensions. Batch normalization computes statistics (mean and variance) along the channel dimension, and a change in the size of these channels from a non-fixed image size may lead to erroneous calculations and significantly impact model stability. Furthermore, fully connected layers, often found at the end of the discriminator, need a fixed-size flattened input; a variable image size will lead to tensors of varying lengths at this step, rendering the model unusable for prediction.

The adversarial nature of GAN training exacerbates this issue. The discriminator is trying to distinguish between real and fake samples, while the generator attempts to fool the discriminator. If the discriminator encounters inconsistent input sizes, its ability to correctly assess the quality of generated images degrades, impacting the gradients used to train the generator. This results in unstable oscillations and the collapse of the generator’s learning capabilities. This collapse is why we might see mode collapse or a non-coherent generator after changing the dimensions.

Let's delve into some code examples to illustrate these points.

**Code Example 1: Fixed-Size Discriminator**

This code snippet outlines a typical DCGAN discriminator intended for 64x64 images. This discriminator will fail on any image size that does not converge to 1 input size after its convolutions.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, channels, features_d):
        super().__init__()
        self.disc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(channels, features_d, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2),
            nn.Conv2d(features_d, features_d*2, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(features_d*2),
            nn.Conv2d(features_d*2, features_d*4, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(features_d*4),
            nn.Conv2d(features_d*4, features_d*8, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(features_d*8),
            nn.Conv2d(features_d*8, 1, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=0),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.disc(x)

# Example usage with a 64x64 image
channels = 3
features_d = 64
discriminator = Discriminator(channels, features_d)
input_image = torch.randn(1, channels, 64, 64)
output = discriminator(input_image)
print(output.shape) # torch.Size([1, 1, 1, 1])

# Example usage with a 128x128 image
input_image_error = torch.randn(1, channels, 128, 128)
try:
    output_error = discriminator(input_image_error)
    print(output_error.shape)
except Exception as e:
    print(e) # error message. Sizes are different during conv operations.
```

This discriminator structure only works when the size of the images passed into it produce a 1x1 tensor at the end of its convolutional layers. If you pass in an image size different from the one it is trained for, it will fail because the strides and kernal sizes are designed to reduce a specific input size.

**Code Example 2: Fixed-Size Generator**

Similarly, the generator has a hard-coded spatial resolution output. Here's a generator intended to upsample a latent vector to a 64x64 image.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Generator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, channels, features_g, z_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.gen = nn.Sequential(
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(z_dim, features_g*16, kernel_size=4, stride=1, padding=0),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(features_g*16),
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(features_g*16, features_g*8, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(features_g*8),
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(features_g*8, features_g*4, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(features_g*4),
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(features_g*4, features_g*2, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(features_g*2),
            nn.ConvTranspose2d(features_g*2, channels, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.Tanh()
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.gen(x)

# Example usage
channels = 3
features_g = 64
z_dim = 100
generator = Generator(channels, features_g, z_dim)
latent_vector = torch.randn(1, z_dim, 1, 1)
generated_image = generator(latent_vector)
print(generated_image.shape) # torch.Size([1, 3, 64, 64])
```

The transposed convolutions are designed to upsample the latent vector into an output of 64x64. It cannot output something different and will fail to train a generator using images of different size because its upsampling does not match the expected output.

**Code Example 3: Resizing Layer Implementation**

To address the variable size problem, a naive approach might involve resizing. While not ideal, it demonstrates the concept.  This will cause issues in the training process of a GAN, as it involves interpolating data that may not reflect real sample data.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class ResizingDiscriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, channels, features_d):
        super().__init__()
        self.base_size = 64 # The size the discriminator is designed for
        self.conv_layers = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(channels, features_d, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2),
            nn.Conv2d(features_d, features_d*2, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(features_d*2),
            nn.Conv2d(features_d*2, features_d*4, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(features_d*4),
            nn.Conv2d(features_d*4, features_d*8, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(features_d*8),
            nn.Conv2d(features_d*8, 1, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=0),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        # Resize input to the base size
        x = F.interpolate(x, size=(self.base_size, self.base_size), mode='bilinear', align_corners=False)
        return self.conv_layers(x)

# Example usage
channels = 3
features_d = 64
discriminator = ResizingDiscriminator(channels, features_d)
input_image_64 = torch.randn(1, channels, 64, 64)
input_image_128 = torch.randn(1, channels, 128, 128)
output_64 = discriminator(input_image_64)
output_128 = discriminator(input_image_128)
print(output_64.shape) # torch.Size([1, 1, 1, 1])
print(output_128.shape) # torch.Size([1, 1, 1, 1])

```
While this approach prevents dimensional errors, it does not solve the problem of the change of the underlying data due to resizing, that cause issues for the discriminator when assessing the validity of the generated image.

Instead of resizing, other more advanced techniques, such as utilizing fully convolutional architectures and conditioning methods (e.g. PatchGAN or Conditional GANs), which allow models to operate on variable image sizes, are more appropriate. These methodologies often involve carefully selecting the strides, padding, and kernel sizes of convolutional layers to ensure that spatial dimensions are handled correctly, or incorporating pooling layers or strided convolutions that can account for the variations in dimensionality.

For further study, I would recommend examining resources detailing fully convolutional networks (FCNs), attention mechanisms in GANs, and the theoretical underpinnings of Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), which tend to exhibit better stability under varying input distributions. These are generally available through academic papers, online deep learning tutorials, and open-source model repositories. A strong understanding of these topics will help in developing models that are robust and flexible for different input sizes in complex datasets. Textbooks dedicated to deep learning and generative models often offer a more detailed analysis of these problems.
