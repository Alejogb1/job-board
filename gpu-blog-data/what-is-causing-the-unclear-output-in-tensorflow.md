TensorFlow’s often opaque output, especially for those new to the library, usually stems from a combination of computational graph execution intricacies and the fundamental difference between eager and graph modes. As a developer with several years of experience debugging complex TensorFlow models, I've observed that much of the apparent "unclarity" doesn't arise from bugs within the framework itself, but from how the developer interacts with its underlying computation model.

The primary source of confusion revolves around TensorFlow’s symbolic nature. In graph mode, which is TensorFlow's default in versions prior to 2.0 and still relevant for performance optimization, operations are not executed immediately. Instead, TensorFlow constructs a computational graph, a symbolic representation of the calculations to be performed. This graph consists of nodes representing operations (like additions, multiplications, or convolutions) and edges representing the flow of data (tensors) between these operations. When you define a tensor operation, it is not automatically executed, it is just added to the graph. The actual computation happens only when you run a session with the compiled graph.

This deferred execution paradigm can be baffling because the output of tensor definitions is typically a symbolic representation – a `Tensor` object – and not the actual computed numerical values. Printing these `Tensor` objects will display their symbolic descriptions: tensor type, shape, and the operation they originate from, not the underlying numerical content. Only when you explicitly execute the graph does the computation take place and the actual values become accessible. This is different from eager execution mode where operations are computed as soon as they're defined, making it behave more like a traditional numerical computing environment.

Another element contributing to perceived unclear output is variable management. TensorFlow variables are stateful containers that maintain values across multiple graph executions (or eager executions). If you’re modifying a variable inside a loop or during optimization without carefully considering the context, the output you see might not reflect your intended result. This can be particularly confusing during debugging. It's crucial to understand when variables are initialized, how their values are updated during a session, and how this might affect tensor values within the graph. Improper initialization or update steps often lead to unexpected results, which can look opaque if one isn't tracking the variable states correctly.

Lastly, the internal mechanics of TensorFlow's computational graph itself can contribute to unclear results. Operations such as `tf.function`, used for graph compilation to improve performance, can obscure the intermediate steps of a calculation. When a function is decorated with `tf.function`, it gets converted into a TensorFlow graph, and the values printed within this function will show the tensor representations, not the calculated values. To properly debug code under `tf.function`, the appropriate tools, such as using `tf.print` within the function, or explicitly debugging outside the function by calling it with eager execution, are essential.

To clarify further, let’s consider some examples.

**Example 1: Basic Tensor Definition and Output**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define two tensors
a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(10)

# Define an operation
c = a + b

# Print the tensors
print("Tensor a:", a)
print("Tensor b:", b)
print("Tensor c:", c)

# Eager execution output
if tf.executing_eagerly():
    print ("Eager Result:", c.numpy()) # Access actual values in eager mode
else:
    # Graph execution output
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        result = sess.run(c)
        print("Graph Result:", result)
```

In this first example, when the code runs in graph mode (TensorFlow 1.x default or explicitly set in 2.x), the outputs `Tensor a:`, `Tensor b:`, and `Tensor c:` will not display the actual numerical values of `5`, `10`, and `15` respectively. Instead, they'll show tensor objects. This is because the addition operation `c = a + b` only constructs a part of the computational graph, the actual calculation has not yet occurred. The output `Graph Result:` shows `15` because this is where the graph is actually executed. If we run in eager mode, the tensors `a`, `b`, and the result of `c` are immediately evaluated, and the `Eager Result:` output shows `15` directly after the definition of `c`.

**Example 2: Variable Updates and Output**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a variable
v = tf.Variable(0)

# Define an update operation
update_op = v.assign_add(1)

# Eager execution output
if tf.executing_eagerly():
    print("Variable v before:", v.numpy())
    for _ in range(3):
        v.assign_add(1)
        print("Variable v during:", v.numpy())
    print("Variable v after:", v.numpy())
else:
    # Graph execution output
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()) # Initialize variables in graph mode
        print("Variable v before:", sess.run(v))
        for _ in range(3):
            sess.run(update_op)
            print("Variable v during:", sess.run(v))
        print("Variable v after:", sess.run(v))
```

This example illustrates how variable updates are handled in both eager and graph mode. In eager mode, variables are updated immediately, and you get the correct expected output. In graph mode, the `assign_add` operation needs to be executed within a session to update the variable `v`. Failing to initialize the variable `v` and not executing the operations within the session would lead to incorrect or unclear output. When `sess.run` is used on `v`, it retrieves the current value in the session, showcasing the expected behavior. The key here is understanding that a variable within the graph represents a placeholder, and its value is updated by explicitly executing the graph.

**Example 3: tf.function and output**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_function(x, y):
  z = x + y
  print("Inside function z:", z) # Prints symbolic tensors inside the graph
  tf.print("Inside function tf.print z:", z) # Prints actual values during execution (with graph compilation)
  return z

a = tf.constant(2)
b = tf.constant(3)

result = my_function(a, b)
print ("Outside function result:", result)


# Eager execution output
if tf.executing_eagerly():
    print ("Eager Output:", result.numpy())
else:
    # Graph execution output
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      result_graph = sess.run(result)
      print("Graph Output:", result_graph)
```

In this example, when `my_function` is called, the output from the regular `print("Inside function z:", z)` within the `tf.function` is a `Tensor` object in graph mode, illustrating that this print happens during graph building, not during execution. The `tf.print` function however, does print the actual computed values during graph execution, in both graph and eager modes. The final `print ("Outside function result:", result)` will output the tensor object in the graph context. Only when the code is executed within a `tf.Session` or `result.numpy()` is called the actual value is retrieved (eager mode). This example highlights that understanding where values are printed within `tf.function` and the differences between `print` and `tf.print` is critical for debugging.

To improve clarity, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on eager execution versus graph mode, the use of `tf.function`, variable management, and debugging techniques. Studying code examples related to these topics is essential. Additionally, various online resources, such as tutorial series on TensorFlow, can provide helpful insights. Pay special attention to the visual representations of computational graphs available in some debugging tools; visualizing the flow of data can clear much of the confusion. There are also several books that delve deeper into the architecture of TensorFlow.

In conclusion, the seeming "unclear output" from TensorFlow isn't a flaw in the library but rather a consequence of its computational paradigm. By understanding the interplay between symbolic graphs, deferred execution, variable management, and the `tf.function` mechanism, one can effectively navigate and debug the framework and obtain predictable, understandable results. Focusing on a methodical approach, utilizing the provided resources, and careful examination of outputs will greatly improve clarity and proficiency with TensorFlow.
