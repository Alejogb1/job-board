The combination of CUDA's `nvcc` compiler, C++11 features, and clang 3.8 on Linux presents a specific incompatibility rooted in differing interpretations of the C++ standard and how these tools interact with the host compiler. My experience building high-performance simulation software with CUDA reveals this not as a simple bug, but rather a confluence of factors stemming from `nvcc`'s reliance on a host compiler for specific stages of its compilation pipeline and the version-specific evolution of C++ standard library support within clang.

The `nvcc` compiler is not a standalone C++ compiler. Instead, it performs several specialized actions, notably separating device code intended for execution on the GPU from host code, which executes on the CPU. The device code, written using CUDA's C++ extensions, is transformed by `nvcc` into an intermediate representation like PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) assembly. The host code, however, requires a fully functional C++ compiler, which, on Linux, is frequently GCC or, as in the scenario we're examining, clang. `nvcc` delegates the actual compilation of this host code to the specified host compiler via the `-ccbin` or similar flags.

The crux of the problem with clang 3.8 and C++11 stems from the standard library implementations of that era and the expectations of `nvcc`. Clang 3.8 had partial, sometimes inconsistent, support for C++11 features. Crucially, aspects related to move semantics, variadic templates, and some template instantiation mechanisms differed in detail from later clang versions and from GCC. `nvcc`, while it supports some C++11 features, effectively passes the standard library implementation to the host compiler. If the host compiler, in this case clang 3.8, isn't fully compliant or implements these features in a way `nvcc` doesn’t expect, it results in compilation failures. The incompatibility manifests not just as pure C++11 code rejection but rather frequently as link time errors when `nvcc` links the object files produced by clang with CUDA runtime libraries.

Specifically, `nvcc` relies on the host compiler producing object code containing well-defined mangled names for C++ symbols. Clang 3.8's mangling of C++11 symbols sometimes differed from what `nvcc`’s linking stage expected, which would result in unresolved symbols at the link phase. Further, C++11 features like lambdas might get compiled and managed differently, causing errors during the CUDA device code integration. Issues can arise from the host compiler not properly generating code for template-heavy constructs, which might have worked under older standards.

To illustrate, consider a scenario with a simple C++11 class using move semantics, which is often a source of trouble:

```c++
// example1.cu
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class MyData {
public:
    int* data;
    int size;

    MyData(int s) : size(s) {
        data = new int[s];
        for(int i = 0; i < s; ++i) data[i] = i;
        std::cout << "Constructor called" << std::endl;
    }

    MyData(const MyData& other) : size(other.size) {
         data = new int[size];
         for(int i = 0; i < size; ++i) data[i] = other.data[i];
         std::cout << "Copy Constructor called" << std::endl;
    }

    MyData(MyData&& other) noexcept : data(other.data), size(other.size) {
        other.data = nullptr;
        other.size = 0;
        std::cout << "Move Constructor called" << std::endl;
    }

    ~MyData() {
        delete[] data;
        std::cout << "Destructor called" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyData d1(5);
    MyData d2 = std::move(d1);
    std::vector<MyData> vec;
    vec.push_back(MyData(10));
    return 0;
}

```

This code compiles without issue using a modern GCC or clang. However, when compiled with `nvcc` using clang 3.8 as a host compiler, the issue might manifest as an error related to `std::vector<MyData>`. Specifically, the linker might not be able to find the necessary methods to support copying and moving of class instances in the `std::vector`. The root cause is clang 3.8's C++11 standard library not providing the required symbol with the name expected by nvcc, often occurring in template instantiations of the standard vector.

A more subtle failure involves lambda expressions within CUDA device code:

```c++
// example2.cu
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void kernel(int* a, int size) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if(idx < size) {
       auto lambda_func = [idx](int val) {
          return val + idx;
       };
       a[idx] = lambda_func(a[idx]);
    }
}


int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    int* host_a = new int[size];
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) host_a[i] = i;

    int* device_a;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&device_a, size * sizeof(int));
    cudaMemcpy(device_a, host_a, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    dim3 blockDim(256);
    dim3 gridDim((size + blockDim.x - 1) / blockDim.x);

    kernel<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(device_a, size);
    cudaMemcpy(host_a, device_a, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        std::cout << host_a[i] << " ";
    }
     std::cout << std::endl;

    cudaFree(device_a);
    delete[] host_a;
    return 0;
}

```

Here, a lambda function within a CUDA kernel is used. `nvcc` with a modern host compiler compiles this without issue, as modern clang understands how to generate correct device code for the lambda capture of `idx` which is an enclosing variable. However, if clang 3.8 is used as the host compiler, there could be errors related to how the lambda capture mechanism is handled at the device code level or during the compilation of the host stub code required by nvcc for invoking the kernel. The issue is usually not with the kernel itself but with the glue code generated by the host compiler and its ability to handle a closure or lambda capture in the context required for CUDA.

Finally, template instantiation complexities also highlight the issue:

```c++
// example3.cu
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
class MyTemplate {
public:
    T value;
    MyTemplate(T val) : value(val) {}
    T add(T other) { return value + other;}
};

int main() {
    MyTemplate<int> obj1(5);
    std::cout << obj1.add(10) << std::endl;
    MyTemplate<float> obj2(5.0f);
    std::cout << obj2.add(10.0f) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

```

This template example can lead to issues when using clang 3.8. `nvcc` relies on the host compiler to instantiate these templates and generate the necessary code for the specific template types (int and float). If clang 3.8 had inconsistent behavior or different name mangling for these template instantiations, particularly with C++11, linking would likely fail. In the linking phase, `nvcc` would not be able to resolve template instances and linking errors would appear. While this example does not contain device code, it showcases an error in the host code and how `nvcc` relies on host compilation success.

To overcome these issues, several strategies can be employed. First, upgrading to a more recent clang version is crucial. Clang 3.9 and later versions possess much more complete and correct C++11 support. Alternatively, using a modern GCC version as the host compiler is also a valid approach, given GCC's generally robust C++ standard support. While these are the two major fixes, if it is not possible, carefully checking error messages can help pinpoint the exact issue, especially with symbol mangling and template instantiation.

For further study, the official clang documentation offers a detailed breakdown of its compatibility with various C++ standards. Documentation from Nvidia regarding `nvcc` and its interaction with host compilers is highly recommended. Textbooks and online resources dealing with C++ standard compliance also provide valuable insight. Experimentation with different compiler versions and configurations is often the best way to fully understand the nuances of these build challenges.
