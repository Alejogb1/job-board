The inherent limitation of passing arbitrarily large datasets directly to a TensorFlow estimator stems from the Python `multiprocessing` module's limitations on the size of objects passed between processes.  This is often encountered when working with large datasets that exceed the available memory of a single process, which is typically what estimators utilize during training.  My experience with large-scale genomics data processing highlighted this issue repeatedly, necessitating alternative data ingestion strategies. The solution isn't about circumventing this memory restriction directly; instead, it focuses on optimizing data access and pipeline design.

**1. Data Pipelining with `tf.data`:**  The most effective approach involves leveraging TensorFlow's built-in data pipeline capabilities through the `tf.data` API.  This allows for on-the-fly data loading and preprocessing, avoiding the need to load the entire dataset into memory at once.  This approach is far superior to attempting workarounds like splitting the data into smaller chunks and concatenating them within the estimator, which adds unnecessary overhead and complexity.

The core idea is to create a `tf.data.Dataset` object that reads data from your source (e.g., a large file, database, or distributed file system) in manageable batches. This dataset then feeds directly into the estimator's input function.  This approach inherently handles data loading and preprocessing concurrently, maximizing resource utilization and minimizing bottlenecks.  The estimator only needs access to one batch at a time.

**Code Example 1:  `tf.data` Pipeline for CSV Data:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def input_fn(file_path, batch_size=32):
    dataset = tf.data.TextLineDataset(file_path)
    dataset = dataset.skip(1) # Skip header row if present
    dataset = dataset.map(lambda line: tf.decode_csv(line, record_defaults=[[0.0]] * 100)) # Adjust based on your data
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    dataset = dataset.prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
    return dataset

# ...rest of your estimator definition...

estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: input_fn("large_data.csv"), steps=10000)
```

This example demonstrates reading a large CSV file.  `tf.decode_csv` parses each line, and `tf.data.AUTOTUNE` dynamically optimizes the prefetch buffer size for optimal performance.  Remember to adjust the `record_defaults` list to match the number and data types of your columns.


**Code Example 2:  `tf.data` Pipeline with TFRecord Files:**

For even larger datasets and enhanced performance, utilizing TFRecord files is strongly recommended. TFRecords are binary file formats optimized for TensorFlow's data pipeline.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def input_fn(file_pattern, batch_size=32):
    dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(file_pattern)
    dataset = dataset.map(parse_tfrecord_example)  # custom parsing function (see below)
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    dataset = dataset.prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
    return dataset

def parse_tfrecord_example(example_proto):
    feature_description = {
        'feature1': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.float32),
        'feature2': tf.io.VarLenFeature(tf.int64),
        # ...add other features...
    }
    features = tf.io.parse_single_example(example_proto, feature_description)
    return features['feature1'], features['feature2']

# ...rest of your estimator definition...

estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: input_fn("path/to/tfrecords/*.tfrecord"), steps=10000)
```

This example requires a `parse_tfrecord_example` function tailored to your specific TFRecord structure.  This function extracts relevant features from the serialized protocol buffer.  The use of `VarLenFeature` handles variable-length features gracefully.

**Code Example 3: Handling Data from a Database:**

For datasets residing in a database, you'll need to leverage database connectors and interact with the database directly within your input function.  I've utilized this frequently for large genomic datasets stored in PostgreSQL.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import psycopg2 # Or other database connector

def input_fn(db_params, query, batch_size=32):
    def generator():
        with psycopg2.connect(**db_params) as conn:
            with conn.cursor() as cur:
                cur.execute(query)
                while True:
                    rows = cur.fetchmany(batch_size)
                    if not rows:
                        break
                    yield rows
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(generator, output_types=(tf.float32, tf.int32)) # Adjust types as needed
    return dataset

# ...rest of your estimator definition...

db_params = {'dbname': 'mydatabase', 'user': 'myuser', 'password': 'mypassword'}
estimator.train(input_fn=lambda: input_fn(db_params, "SELECT feature1, feature2 FROM mytable"), steps=10000)
```

This example reads data directly from a PostgreSQL database.  Replace `psycopg2` with the appropriate connector for your database system.  The `generator` function fetches data in batches, and `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` creates a dataset from this generator.  Remember to properly handle database connection pooling and error management in a production environment.


**2.  Resource Recommendations:**

*   **TensorFlow documentation:**  Thoroughly review the `tf.data` API documentation for advanced techniques like parallel processing and dataset transformations.
*   **Performance profiling tools:**  Utilize tools like TensorFlow Profiler to identify and address bottlenecks in your data pipeline.
*   **Database optimization:**  If using a database, consult database optimization guides for efficient querying and data retrieval.  Indexing strategies are paramount.
*   **Distributed training:**  For extremely large datasets, consider transitioning to distributed training strategies using tools like `tf.distribute.Strategy`.


By implementing these strategies, you can efficiently process datasets far exceeding the 2GB limit without resorting to impractical workarounds. Remember that effective data handling is critical for successful machine learning projects, especially when dealing with massive datasets. The key is not to try and load everything at once, but rather to design a system that efficiently manages data access and processing.  This architectural approach will solve the problem far more effectively than any attempt to bypass Python's memory limitations within the estimator itself.
