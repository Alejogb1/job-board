The core challenge in effectively utilizing `split`, `contains`, and `if` statements lies in understanding their distinct roles within a broader data manipulation workflow and recognizing the potential for cascading logic errors when combining them improperly.  My experience troubleshooting data pipelines in high-frequency trading environments has highlighted the importance of meticulous planning and error handling when dealing with these fundamental string and conditional operations.  Improper usage often results in unexpected behavior, especially with edge cases involving null or empty strings, inconsistent delimiters, and unintended type conversions.

**1.  Explanation:**

The three functions—`split`, `contains`, and `if`—represent distinct stages in a typical data processing pipeline.  `split` is a preprocessing step, transforming a single string into a collection of substrings based on a specified delimiter. `contains` functions as a filtering or conditional check, evaluating the presence of a substring within a given string.  Finally, the `if` statement governs the flow of execution, allowing selective processing based on the results of the previous steps. Their effective combination requires a clear understanding of data structure and a structured approach to error handling.

`split` accepts a string and a delimiter, returning an array (or list) of substrings.  The delimiter can be a single character, a string, or a regular expression, depending on the programming language.  Crucially, understanding how the function handles multiple occurrences of the delimiter, empty substrings, and edge cases like null input is vital.  For example, splitting "apple,banana,,orange" with "," as the delimiter may result in an array containing empty strings, a behavior that must be addressed in subsequent processing.

`contains` (or its equivalents like `indexOf` or `find`) checks for the existence of a substring within a larger string.  This operation typically returns a boolean value indicating the presence or absence of the target substring.  The efficiency of this operation varies significantly depending on the underlying implementation and the length of the strings involved.  The choice between different functions depends on whether you need the index of the substring or merely its existence.

The `if` statement is the control structure responsible for directing program flow based on the results of `split` and `contains`.  This usually involves checking conditions derived from those operations, potentially including null checks and boundary condition checks, to prevent runtime errors.  Nested `if` statements are often necessary to handle the complexity of multiple criteria and potential errors.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Simple String Parsing**

This example demonstrates a straightforward application parsing comma-separated values (CSV) data.

```python
data_string = "apple,banana,cherry"
fruits = data_string.split(",")

if len(fruits) > 0:
    if "apple" in fruits:
        print("Apple found!")
    else:
        print("Apple not found.")
else:
    print("Invalid data string.")

```

This code first splits the string into a list of fruits. The `if` statement checks for a valid list length before iterating or testing for "apple", ensuring robustness against empty input.


**Example 2:  Handling Multiple Delimiters and Empty Strings:**

This example tackles the complexity of multiple delimiters and empty strings that might arise in real-world scenarios.

```java
String data = "apple;banana,,cherry;date";
String[] fruits = data.split(";");

for (String fruit : fruits) {
    String[] parts = fruit.split(",");
    if (parts.length > 0 && !parts[0].isEmpty()){
        System.out.println("Fruit: " + parts[0]);
    }
    else{
        System.out.println("Empty or malformed entry encountered.");
    }
}

```

This Java code uses nested `split` operations to handle both semicolons and commas.  It incorporates explicit checks for empty strings and null values to prevent exceptions.


**Example 3:  Regular Expression-Based Splitting and Conditional Logic:**

This example demonstrates more sophisticated string manipulation with regular expressions for flexible delimiter handling.

```javascript
const data = "apple-123,banana_456,cherry.789";
const entries = data.split(/[-_,.]/); //Regular expression for multiple delimiters

let numbers = [];

for (let i = 1; i < entries.length; i += 2) {
    const num = parseInt(entries[i]);
    if (!isNaN(num)) {
        numbers.push(num);
    } else {
        console.error("Invalid number format encountered:", entries[i]);
    }
}

if (numbers.length > 0) {
    console.log("Extracted numbers:", numbers);
} else {
    console.error("No valid numbers found.");
}

```

This JavaScript code utilizes a regular expression to split the string based on multiple delimiters. It then parses the numerical parts, incorporating error handling for non-numeric strings.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further study, I recommend consulting the official documentation for your chosen programming language regarding string manipulation functions.  A comprehensive text on data structures and algorithms will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying complexities involved in string processing and efficient data manipulation.  Finally, a guide on software design principles, focusing on modularity and error handling, will be highly valuable for building robust and maintainable applications involving these operations. These resources will equip you to handle intricate scenarios and prevent common pitfalls.  Thorough testing and validation of your code are crucial, especially when working with potentially malformed or unexpected data.  The emphasis should always be on robust error handling and clear code structure.
