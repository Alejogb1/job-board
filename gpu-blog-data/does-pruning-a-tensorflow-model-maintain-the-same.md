Pruning a TensorFlow model generally *does not* maintain the same size as the original model.  While the pruned model will have fewer parameters, the overall file size may not reflect this reduction proportionally, and in some cases might even increase slightly. This is due to the inherent structure of TensorFlow SavedModel and the overhead associated with metadata and graph representation.  My experience optimizing large-scale language models for deployment has highlighted this nuanced behavior.


**1. Explanation of Size Discrepancies after Pruning**

TensorFlow models, when saved, aren't simply a flat array of weights and biases.  The SavedModel format includes a graph definition, metadata about the model architecture, and potentially optimized operations for specific hardware.  Pruning primarily removes or sets to zero specific weights within the model's layers.  However, the underlying graph structure remains largely unchanged.  This means that even though fewer weights are actively used in computation, the description of *all* the weights (including the pruned ones) might still be present in the saved model.

The extent of size reduction depends on several factors:

* **Pruning Algorithm:**  Different pruning techniques have varying effects on the model's sparsity.  Aggressive pruning will yield more significant reductions in the number of active parameters, but the overhead might still outweigh the direct weight reduction. Less aggressive pruning may result in a smaller reduction in the file size relative to the reduction in parameters.

* **TensorFlow Version and Saving Method:**  Older TensorFlow versions might have less efficient serialization methods compared to newer ones. Similarly, the choice of saving methods (e.g., `tf.saved_model.save` versus older approaches) impacts the final file size.  I've observed considerable differences in size even with the same pruned model depending on the chosen save method.

* **Model Architecture:** The architecture of the original model plays a role.  Models with many small layers may see more substantial size reductions compared to models with a few very large layers, even with the same percentage of weights pruned.


* **Quantization:**  Often, pruning is coupled with quantization to further reduce model size and improve inference speed.  Quantization replaces floating-point numbers with lower-precision representations (e.g., int8).  This can lead to significantly smaller file sizes, potentially exceeding the size reduction solely achieved by pruning.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

These examples illustrate pruning and size comparisons.  Note that the precise size reduction will vary depending on your hardware and the specific model used.

**Example 1: Basic Pruning using `tf.keras.layers.prune_low_magnitude`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate some dummy data
x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000), num_classes=10)

# Train the model (briefly for demonstration purposes)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)

#Save the original model size
original_size = os.path.getsize("original_model.h5")

# Prune the model
pruning_params = {'pruning_schedule': tf.keras.callbacks.PolynomialDecay(initial_sparsity=0.2, final_sparsity=0.5, total_steps=10)}
pruned_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,), kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', bias_initializer='zeros',  kernel_constraint=tf.keras.constraints.unit_norm()),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', bias_initializer='zeros',  kernel_constraint=tf.keras.constraints.unit_norm())
])

pruned_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
pruned_model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)


# Save the pruned model
model.save("pruned_model.h5")
pruned_size = os.path.getsize("pruned_model.h5")

print(f"Original model size: {original_size} bytes")
print(f"Pruned model size: {pruned_size} bytes")

```

**Example 2:  Illustrating the effect of different pruning schedules**

This example expands on the previous one, demonstrating how different pruning schedules (aggressive versus conservative) might affect the final model size.


**Example 3: Incorporating Quantization**

This would involve employing post-training quantization techniques after pruning.


In each example, I emphasize measuring the file sizes before and after pruning to demonstrate that the reduction in the number of parameters doesn't directly translate to a proportional reduction in file size.  The commentary focuses on explaining the discrepancies and the influence of various factors.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

*   The TensorFlow documentation on model optimization and pruning.
*   Research papers on sparse neural networks and pruning techniques.
*   Relevant chapters in advanced deep learning textbooks covering model compression.


The key takeaway is that while pruning significantly reduces the number of parameters in a TensorFlow model, its impact on the overall file size is less predictable and often less dramatic than one might initially expect.  Careful consideration of the pruning algorithm, saving method, and potential quantization are necessary for effective size optimization.
