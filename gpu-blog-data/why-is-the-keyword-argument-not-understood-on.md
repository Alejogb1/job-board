The issue of keyword arguments not being recognized on a Raspberry Pi often stems from a mismatch between the Python interpreter version used and the code's expectation.  My experience troubleshooting embedded systems, specifically on Raspberry Pi models ranging from the Model B+ to the 4, has repeatedly highlighted this discrepancy as the primary culprit.  It's less about the Pi's hardware limitations and more about the software environment's configuration.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Python's support for keyword arguments is a fundamental feature of its function definition syntax, enabling more readable and maintainable code.  A function accepting keyword arguments allows calling it with parameters specified by name, rather than solely by position. This flexibility is crucial for larger projects and reduces the likelihood of errors associated with positional argument ordering.  However, older Python versions (pre-3.0) have limitations compared to later iterations.  This difference is frequently overlooked when porting code or utilizing pre-built libraries compiled for earlier interpreters.

The Raspberry Pi's default Python installation, particularly on older OS images, might be an older version, for example, Python 2.7, which lacks the comprehensive keyword argument handling implemented in Python 3.x.  This discrepancy results in a `SyntaxError` or, more subtly, incorrect behavior if the code attempts to use keyword arguments within a function defined for a version where this is not fully supported.  Alternatively, the problem might manifest if a library or module compiled against a Python 2 interpreter is used within a Python 3 environment – the binary will still expect positional parameters, even if your main script is written using Python 3 syntax.

Correcting this often involves ensuring the Raspberry Pi uses a compatible Python interpreter version, either by updating the system's Python installation (if practical and supported by the OS image) or by creating a virtual environment specific to the project’s requirements. Using a virtual environment isolates the project's dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects or the system's default packages.

Another less common, but still plausible, scenario involves improperly defined functions. A function might inadvertently capture keyword arguments as positional arguments due to issues like incorrect parameter list ordering or the use of wildcard parameters (`*args`, `**kwargs`) without proper handling.  This leads to arguments being mis-interpreted, even in a compatible Python version.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Python 2.7 incompatibility:**

```python
# This code will fail in Python 2.7 due to the keyword argument 'name'
def greet(age, name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

greet(name="Alice", age=30)  # Keyword argument usage
```

In Python 2.7, this would likely result in a `SyntaxError` because it expects positional arguments unless explicitly utilizing `**kwargs` to pass the name/value pairs within the function.

**Example 2: Correct usage in Python 3.x:**

```python
# This code works correctly in Python 3.x and later
def greet(age, name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

greet(age=30, name="Alice") # Keyword arguments are correctly handled
greet(30, "Alice") #Positional arguments are also accepted.
```

This demonstrates the proper use of keyword arguments in a Python 3.x compatible environment, showcasing the flexibility of assigning values by name.

**Example 3:  Handling keyword arguments with `**kwargs`:**

```python
#Demonstrates explicitly handling keyword arguments within a function.

def process_data(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"Parameter: {key}, Value: {value}")

process_data(temperature=25, humidity=60, pressure=1012)
```

This example explicitly utilizes `**kwargs` to capture all keyword arguments passed to the `process_data` function.  This approach offers flexibility, allowing the function to handle an arbitrary number of keyword parameters without needing to explicitly define each parameter in the function's signature.  This is especially useful when working with libraries or situations where the exact set of keyword arguments might not be known beforehand.  However, rigorous error checking within the function body is crucial to ensure all passed keyword arguments are handled correctly and to prevent unexpected behavior.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Python documentation is invaluable for understanding function definitions and keyword argument handling.  Consult the Python language reference sections related to function definitions and argument passing.  Furthermore, reputable books on Python programming (look for ones covering both Python 2 and Python 3 differences) will provide detailed explanations and practical examples of argument handling.  Finally, exploring online tutorials focused specifically on Python 3 features, especially those comparing 2.x to 3.x, will clarify the key differences.  Focus on resources that emphasize best practices, error handling, and the importance of using virtual environments for dependency management.  This will not only aid in resolving the immediate keyword argument issue, but will also build a solid foundation for more robust Python development on embedded systems.
