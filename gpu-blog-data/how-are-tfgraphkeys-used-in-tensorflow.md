The primary function of `tf.GraphKeys` within TensorFlow is to provide standardized names for collections of graph elements, facilitating organized access and manipulation of those elements within a computational graph. This system allows different parts of a TensorFlow model, or different modules working with the same model, to locate specific tensors, variables, or operations based on established conventions, preventing the need for string-based lookups and promoting code maintainability. Over years of developing and debugging TensorFlow models, I've found `tf.GraphKeys` to be instrumental in ensuring a clear, manageable, and extensible structure, especially as project complexity grows.

A TensorFlow graph represents the entire computation, composed of nodes (operations) and edges (tensors). During model creation, one often needs to track specific components, such as trainable variables, losses, regularization terms, or optimizers. Rather than manually managing lists of these elements, TensorFlow provides `tf.GraphKeys`, an enumeration of pre-defined constants serving as keys for accessing these collections. I routinely use these to gather relevant tensors for various purposes, from applying regularizers to updating weights. For instance, when implementing a custom loss function or an adversarial network, I rely heavily on accessing specific outputs or intermediate layers via these keys.

The `tf.GraphKeys` constants, therefore, act as standardized labels. Operations like `tf.add_to_collection` add elements to the graph's collections identified by these keys. Later, functions like `tf.get_collection` retrieve lists of elements under a particular key. This enables modularity, allowing functions to focus on specific tasks without being aware of the complete architecture but with the certainty of accessing essential components through these established collections.

Consider these use cases: Firstly, trainable variables are crucial for model optimization. If I were to train a simple linear regression model, I'd need to access and update the weights and biases. TensorFlow automatically adds these variables to the `tf.GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` collection. Without it, I would have to manually track every variable which would become complex very fast for a typical neural network. This collection gives me a list of all the learnable parameters, enabling me to apply the optimization algorithm.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple linear model
X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1], name='input')
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1, 1]), name='weights')
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name='bias')
y = tf.matmul(X, W) + b

# Define the loss function
y_true = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1], name='labels')
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y-y_true))

# Optimizer
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01)
train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)

# Retrieving trainable variables
trainable_vars = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES)

print("Trainable Variables:", trainable_vars) # Output shows a list of W and b

# Output shows a list of W and b, the trainable variables of our model, as we might expect
```
This code snippet demonstrates the basic usage. We create trainable variables and an optimizer and through `tf.get_collection` we access the trainable variables to apply optimization algorithms to. Note that `tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer.minimize` automatically adds operations to update the variables using gradient descent into the graph, and by default includes all trainable variables in the model.

Secondly, consider the use of regularization. I find that in complex models, the incorporation of regularization terms is crucial to preventing overfitting. In TensorFlow, regularization terms are often added to a specific collection using `tf.add_to_collection`. Let's assume a basic L2 regularization applied to the weights in our example. We can add this term to the `tf.GraphKeys.REGULARIZATION_LOSSES` collection and then retrieve it during training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple linear model (Same as in example 1)
X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1], name='input')
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1, 1]), name='weights')
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name='bias')
y = tf.matmul(X, W) + b

# L2 Regularization
l2_reg = tf.nn.l2_loss(W)
tf.add_to_collection(tf.GraphKeys.REGULARIZATION_LOSSES, l2_reg)

# Define the loss function
y_true = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1], name='labels')
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y-y_true))

# Retrieve regularization losses
reg_losses = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.REGULARIZATION_LOSSES)

# Add regularization to the overall loss
total_loss = loss + tf.reduce_sum(reg_losses)

# Optimizer
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01)
train_op = optimizer.minimize(total_loss)

print("Regularization Losses:", reg_losses) # Output shows the L2 loss term.
```
In this example, the L2 regularization loss is explicitly added to the `tf.GraphKeys.REGULARIZATION_LOSSES` collection. During training, I can gather all regularization terms from the collection and sum them to incorporate them into the total loss. The optimizer will now minimize this new loss, ensuring the weights are not just fitted to the training data but also kept small, a useful property of L2 regularization.

Finally, consider a scenario involving summaries for tensorboard visualization. For tracking the model's behavior, I usually create summaries. Tensors that are useful for monitoring training progress can be added to `tf.GraphKeys.SUMMARIES`.  

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple linear model (Same as in example 1)
X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1], name='input')
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1, 1]), name='weights')
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name='bias')
y = tf.matmul(X, W) + b

# Define the loss function
y_true = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1], name='labels')
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y-y_true))

# Add summaries
tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss)
tf.summary.histogram('weights', W)
tf.summary.histogram('bias', b)

# Retrieve all summaries
summaries = tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.SUMMARIES)

# Merge summaries to create a single operation
summary_op = tf.summary.merge(summaries)

print("Summaries:", summaries) # Output will be a list of summary ops

# In a full training loop, one would typically run the summary_op
# and write the results to a file to be viewed in TensorBoard.

```
In this last example, I use `tf.summary` operations, which are automatically added to the summary collection. `tf.summary.merge` combines all of the summaries, allowing us to conveniently run a single operation to obtain all the required summary data. The output shows the list of summary ops which can be run in a full training loop and visualized in TensorBoard.

Without `tf.GraphKeys`, managing all of these aspects, including trainable variables, regularizers, and summaries would involve considerable manual effort. Each element would need to be tracked with explicit lists and passed around in a project. `tf.GraphKeys` promotes modular code because modules can use the well-defined collections to perform their duties without needing to know the implementation details of other modules. This facilitates a system of modular, reusable components that can interact with the overall model through pre-defined graph collections.

For a deep dive into TensorFlow's internals, I would highly recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections dedicated to graph management and variable handling. Additionally, the source code itself provides insights into how these collections are used. Studying examples of different TensorFlow model implementations, especially those in open-source repositories, often reveals real-world applications of `tf.GraphKeys` and best practices in their usage. Exploring community forums and discussions can offer varied perspectives and practical guidance for dealing with specific situations. Experimenting with small test cases helps solidify this knowledge, allowing one to witness the behavior firsthand, rather than relying solely on conceptual understanding.
