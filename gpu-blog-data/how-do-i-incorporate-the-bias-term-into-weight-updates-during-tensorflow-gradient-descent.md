The effective inclusion of a bias term in weight updates during TensorFlow gradient descent is achieved by treating it as another trainable parameter within the model, analogous to the weights connected to input features. This requires no fundamental alteration to the gradient descent algorithm itself; the magic is in how the model and its operations are defined. I've encountered this numerous times in building various image recognition and time-series models, and the misconception often arises that biases need special handling outside the standard gradient flow.

The core idea is this: the bias term, typically represented as 'b', is associated with each neuron and provides an activation threshold, allowing the neuron to fire even when input activations are zero. This offset needs to be adjusted iteratively, along with weights, to improve model accuracy. During forward propagation, the bias is added to the weighted sum of inputs before the activation function is applied. The backward pass, or backpropagation, computes the gradients of the loss with respect to all trainable parameters, including the bias, and then utilizes these gradients to update the respective parameters via an optimization algorithm like gradient descent.

To illustrate this, let's delve into a simplified example. I will be using TensorFlow 2, assuming the reader has a basic understanding of its API and concepts such as tensors, variables, and gradient calculation. Let’s imagine a single neuron with two inputs (x1, x2), corresponding weights (w1, w2), and a bias (b). The output is then calculated by z = w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + b.

The following code exemplifies a manual implementation of this update for illustrative purposes, despite TensorFlow handling this implicitly in its higher-level APIs.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initialize parameters as TensorFlow variables
w1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(1,)), name='weight1')
w2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(1,)), name='weight2')
b = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(1,)), name='bias')

# Input features
x1 = tf.constant(2.0, dtype=tf.float32)
x2 = tf.constant(3.0, dtype=tf.float32)

# Define the learning rate
learning_rate = 0.01

# Simple loss function (squared error)
def loss_function(z, target):
  return tf.square(z - target)

# Target value
target = tf.constant(10.0, dtype=tf.float32)

# Perform gradient descent step
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  z = w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + b
  loss = loss_function(z, target)

# Calculate gradients
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [w1, w2, b])

# Apply gradient descent update
w1.assign_sub(learning_rate * gradients[0])
w2.assign_sub(learning_rate * gradients[1])
b.assign_sub(learning_rate * gradients[2])

print("Updated w1:", w1.numpy())
print("Updated w2:", w2.numpy())
print("Updated b:", b.numpy())
```

In this first example, I created TensorFlow variables for `w1`, `w2`, and `b`. These variables, and not raw tensors, are the key to automatic differentiation. The code performs one update step for the given input. I explicitly compute the weighted sum `z`, and the loss, then use the `GradientTape` to compute the gradients for `loss` with respect to `w1`, `w2`, and `b`. Crucially, the bias gradient, `gradients[2]`, is computed just like the other weight gradients. Finally, the weights and bias are updated by subtracting the product of the learning rate and the respective gradients. In practice, you would iterate this process many times, passing in batches of examples.

While manually coding the updates is instructive, in actual applications, it is preferable to utilize TensorFlow’s high-level layers that seamlessly manage parameter handling, including the bias. The following demonstrates a fully connected layer using the Keras API.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Create the model
model = keras.Sequential([
  keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='linear', use_bias=True, input_shape=(2,))
])

# Define the optimizer and loss function
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_function = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

# Input data
X = tf.constant([[2.0, 3.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
Y = tf.constant([[10.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Perform optimization step
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  predictions = model(X)
  loss = loss_function(Y, predictions)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))


print("Updated weights:", model.layers[0].kernel.numpy())
print("Updated bias:", model.layers[0].bias.numpy())
```

In this example, the bias is handled entirely by Keras’ `Dense` layer. The parameter `use_bias=True` dictates whether a bias term will be included. By default, Keras initializes both the weights and the bias using appropriate initialization schemes. I define the Stochastic Gradient Descent (`SGD`) optimizer which, when applying gradients, inherently updates all trainable variables, including weights and the bias. The core of the example rests on using `model.trainable_variables` to access all the trainable parameters of the model. This method abstracts the manual process of the first example; the bias is automatically updated as part of the overall gradient descent process.

Finally, let's consider a case where you explicitly want to monitor the bias value during training. This might be useful for debugging purposes or for observing how the bias adapts.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define the Model with explicit naming
class CustomModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense_layer = keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='linear', use_bias=True, name='my_dense')

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense_layer(inputs)

# Create model
model = CustomModel()

# Define optimizer and loss
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_function = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()


X = tf.constant([[2.0, 3.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
Y = tf.constant([[10.0]], dtype=tf.float32)


with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  predictions = model(X)
  loss = loss_function(Y, predictions)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

# Access bias directly
bias_value = model.get_layer('my_dense').bias.numpy()


print("Updated weights:", model.get_layer('my_dense').kernel.numpy())
print("Updated bias:", bias_value)
```

This third example employs a custom model class for more direct access to a specific layer, which in this case is the dense layer. By giving the layer a name, “my_dense”, the bias can be explicitly retrieved after an update using `model.get_layer('my_dense').bias.numpy()`. This offers flexibility if custom logging or debugging of specific layer parameters is required, demonstrating how to interact with a layer beyond just a forward pass.

In conclusion, the bias term is integrated into gradient descent by being treated as a learnable parameter of the model. No special-purpose algorithm adjustments are needed. The crucial aspects are initializing the bias as a TensorFlow variable, ensuring it is included within the gradient calculation, and then applying standard optimization techniques. Higher-level APIs like Keras abstract away most of these low-level details, allowing developers to focus on model architecture and training strategies.

For further learning, I recommend focusing on the following areas:
- TensorFlow's official documentation on `tf.Variable`, gradient computation with `tf.GradientTape`, and the Keras API, particularly the `Dense` layer.
- Understanding the backpropagation algorithm, as it is the mechanism that determines how gradients are computed and used to update the parameters.
- Studying different optimizers available in TensorFlow, specifically `tf.keras.optimizers`, which implement various flavors of gradient descent and adaptive learning rate strategies.
- Consulting literature on the theoretical foundations of neural networks, particularly around activation functions and the role of biases.
- Practical experience, through constructing and training models with varying architectures, would prove invaluable for solidifying understanding.
