YOLO TensorFlow models, despite being computationally intensive and typically optimized for GPU execution, can exhibit a frustrating tendency to default to CPU usage. This behavior isn't a fault in the code itself but rather a consequence of several intertwined factors primarily related to the environment configuration and TensorFlow's device placement logic. Based on my experience troubleshooting numerous deep learning projects, this issue commonly stems from misconfigured or absent GPU drivers, TensorFlow version incompatibilities, insufficient video memory, or explicit CPU-only configurations.

The core of the problem rests within TensorFlow's device placement algorithm. Upon model instantiation and operation execution, TensorFlow attempts to allocate computational tasks to available devices, prioritizing GPUs for operations that benefit from their parallel processing capabilities. However, this automatic allocation can fail for several reasons. If TensorFlow cannot detect a properly configured GPU device, it will silently revert to CPU usage, often without explicit error messages that directly pinpoint the root cause. The first common reason for this failure is the lack or misconfiguration of NVIDIA drivers. TensorFlow relies on the CUDA toolkit and the associated cuDNN library for GPU acceleration. If these are not installed, correctly versioned, or accessible in the system's path, TensorFlow will be unable to utilize the GPU and will instead use the CPU. The precise CUDA and cuDNN versions needed are directly dictated by the TensorFlow version being employed. Mismatches will almost certainly result in the fallback to CPU.

Another significant consideration is the available GPU memory. Deep learning models, particularly those with complex architectures like YOLO, often require considerable amounts of video memory. If the model's memory footprint, including the weights, intermediate activations, and batch data, exceeds the available memory on the GPU, TensorFlow might be forced to shift computation to the CPU, a significantly slower alternative. Furthermore, the environment configuration might have specific parameters that force TensorFlow to use the CPU. The `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable, if set incorrectly (e.g., to an invalid or non-existent GPU ID or left empty), will prevent TensorFlow from detecting and using any available GPUs. TensorFlow also provides specific code instructions that allow a user to control device placement, and incorrectly using these can cause the issue. This is often seen when there is explicit device locking done during the creation of a tensor, or variable that forces operation placement on the CPU. Finally, in environments with multiple GPUs, improper selection of which GPU to use can also result in an unintentional CPU fallback.

Below are three code examples demonstrating common causes and solutions for this issue:

**Example 1: Explicit Device Placement**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Incorrect explicit device placement on CPU
with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
    b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)
    c = a + b
print(c) #Will be calculated on the CPU even if a GPU is available

#Correctly allowing TensorFlow to decide device allocation
a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)
c = a + b
print(c) #Will be calculated on the GPU if available, otherwise CPU
```

**Commentary:** The first block demonstrates a scenario where the device placement is explicitly set to the CPU using `tf.device('/CPU:0')`. This forces the computation of `c` to happen on the CPU irrespective of the GPU availability. The second block of code demonstrates the best practice that allows TensorFlow to make the decision on where to place the computation, which will use the GPU if it's available and the configuration is correct. This highlights the importance of allowing TensorFlow to manage the devices when possible. Explicitly placing operations on devices should be reserved for when there are specific requirements of a particular operation.

**Example 2: GPU Memory Management**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Simulated large tensor creation
try:
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        large_tensor = tf.random.normal([10000, 10000, 1000], dtype=tf.float32)
        print("Tensor created on GPU")
except tf.errors.ResourceExhaustedError as e:
        print(f"GPU out of memory: {e}")
        #Fallback to CPU if the tensor can not be stored on GPU

        large_tensor = tf.random.normal([10000, 10000, 1000], dtype=tf.float32)
        print("Tensor created on CPU due to memory constraints")

#Example of limiting GPU growth

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
       tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration(
           gpus[0],
            [tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=1024)])
            #Set memory limit to 1024 MB (adjust to actual video memory)
            logical_gpus=tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
            print (len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,",len(logical_gpus)," Logical GPUs")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e)
```

**Commentary:** In this example, I demonstrate how TensorFlow handles insufficient GPU memory. The first `try/except` block attempts to allocate a very large tensor on the GPU. If a `ResourceExhaustedError` occurs, it is caught, and a fallback is implemented to perform the operation on the CPU. The second block shows a technique to limit TensorFlow’s GPU memory usage. It sets a limit on a given GPU to only be able to use up to 1 GB of memory. When models are being tested and there is uncertainty of how much memory will be required, a limit can be set to avoid out of memory issues. These techniques are particularly useful in environments with limited resources, such as when there are shared GPU resources on a server. Note that you will have to adjust the `memory_limit` parameter based on how much total GPU memory you have.

**Example 3: Checking Device Availability**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Check if GPUs are available
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    print("GPUs available:")
    for gpu in gpus:
        print(gpu)
    #Test if a tensor can be allocated on GPU
    try:
        with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
          test_tensor = tf.constant([1.0], dtype=tf.float32)
        print("GPU tensor creation successful")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(f"GPU tensor creation failed with error {e}")

else:
    print("No GPUs available. Operations will run on CPU.")

#Confirming if the tensor is on the GPU (if it was successful)
if gpus:
    print(f"Tensor test_tensor is on device:{test_tensor.device}")
```

**Commentary:** This example provides a basic check for GPU availability. The first block lists all physical GPUs detected by TensorFlow. Then, it attempts to create a simple tensor explicitly on the first GPU. If successful, it prints a success message and the device of the tensor. If there's an error during tensor creation, it is caught, and an error message is printed indicating that the operations will be defaulted to CPU. The final block checks and prints the device that the tensor ended up on. This routine is particularly useful when initially starting development in a new environment, because it quickly clarifies whether any of the aforementioned environment issues are present.

For troubleshooting, I recommend verifying the installed versions of TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN are compatible. Consult the TensorFlow documentation for version-specific requirements. Also, ensure that the NVIDIA drivers are installed and up to date. System environment variables should be configured correctly, particularly `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, and the relevant CUDA and cuDNN paths should be added to the system's path. Monitoring GPU memory usage during model execution using system tools like `nvidia-smi` can help pinpoint memory-related issues. For further information on device configuration and memory management, I advise reading the official TensorFlow guides on GPU support and performance optimization. These documentation sources provide a comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow’s device handling and offer detailed guidance on how to effectively use GPUs.
