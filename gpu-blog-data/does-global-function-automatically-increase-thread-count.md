A common misconception in concurrent programming is that the declaration or utilization of a global function inherently forces an increase in the number of threads executed by a system. This is not the case. The existence of a global function, or any function for that matter, does not directly correlate to thread creation; rather, the specific mechanisms by which a program *calls* that function and manages execution context are what determine threading behavior. In essence, a global function is merely a piece of executable code available to all parts of a program. It does not possess any inherent property that dictates concurrency.

The core concept here lies in the distinction between code and execution. Global functions, like any functions, are defined in memory and accessible through their identifiers. However, the act of invoking the function, in itself, does not create a new execution pathway. A single thread can execute any number of functions sequentially. If a single-threaded program calls a global function multiple times, it will still execute within that single thread’s context, one function call after the other. No automatic thread creation occurs solely from function invocation. Thread management is a distinct responsibility of the programmer, achieved through operating system or library functionalities. The confusion often stems from misunderstandings about concurrent execution models and the mechanisms required for parallelism, rather than from any intrinsic property of globally defined functions. To execute parts of a program concurrently and utilize multiple threads, an application needs to explicitly create those threads and manage their workloads, including how and when a given function is executed within each thread’s context.

Consider a scenario I encountered during a previous project, an image processing pipeline. We had a global function, `processPixel(pixelData)`, responsible for transforming a single pixel's color values. This function was defined globally because multiple modules, responsible for different stages of processing (e.g., noise reduction, color correction), needed access to it. Initially, the application performed pixel-by-pixel processing sequentially within the main thread. Even though `processPixel()` was a global function, only one thread was active. We then refactored the code to use a thread pool, where multiple threads would process different subsets of the image concurrently, and this parallel processing made use of the same global function. The global function itself didn't change, but our manner of calling and managing it did. The key change was our use of explicit thread management constructs, not the mere existence of a global function.

To illustrate this, consider the following C++ code example. The first example demonstrates how a global function is executed sequentially within a single thread.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void globalFunction(int value) {
  std::cout << "Executing in thread: " << std::this_thread::get_id() << ", Value: " << value << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  std::cout << "Main thread ID: " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
      globalFunction(i);
  }
  return 0;
}

```
This example demonstrates a single thread executing multiple calls to a global function. The output will show that the function executes in the same thread across the different calls, demonstrating that no thread creation takes place by simply executing the function. The main thread ID and the thread IDs within `globalFunction` will be identical. The for loop executes each function call one after another, not concurrently.

Now, let’s explore how to achieve concurrent execution using threading in the next example.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>

void globalFunction(int value) {
  std::cout << "Executing in thread: " << std::this_thread::get_id() << ", Value: " << value << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  std::vector<std::thread> threads;
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    threads.emplace_back(globalFunction, i);
  }

  for (auto& thread : threads) {
    thread.join();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Here we now employ multiple threads. The critical difference is the explicit creation of `std::thread` objects in the main function. Each thread executes a call to `globalFunction` with a different argument. This demonstrates that concurrency requires an explicit action to create threads; the global function is just a callable piece of code. The output will now show differing thread IDs executing the `globalFunction` calls, indicating genuine concurrent processing. The `threads.join()` operation ensures the main thread waits for the worker threads to complete before terminating.

As a final example, let's consider a slightly more complex scenario where a function returns a result, and we want to execute this in multiple threads.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>
#include <future>

int globalFunction(int value) {
  return value * 2;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::future<int>> results;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        results.push_back(std::async(std::launch::async, globalFunction, i));
    }

    for (auto& result : results) {
        std::cout << "Result: " << result.get() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

```
In this example, the `std::async` function is used with `std::launch::async` which explicitly creates a new thread for each function call. Unlike the previous example where we were creating thread objects directly, `std::async` abstracts the thread creation process, while still allowing for concurrent execution. The `std::future<int>` object is used to retrieve the return value from the asynchronous task. The core concept remains consistent: concurrent execution is facilitated by explicit thread creation or through libraries that manage thread pools behind the scenes. The global function remains oblivious to the execution environment and does not cause the thread creation itself.

For further study into concurrent programming patterns and thread management, I'd suggest exploring texts on operating system principles, including thread scheduling and synchronization mechanisms. Additionally, books covering concurrency and parallelism in your particular programming language will provide the necessary tools and best practices for building concurrent applications. A solid understanding of these concepts allows for efficient and correct implementation of multi-threaded applications, avoiding misattributions of causality like automatically increased thread counts through global function declarations. Finally, resources on data structures for concurrent systems and associated algorithms are crucial for safe and scalable concurrent designs.
