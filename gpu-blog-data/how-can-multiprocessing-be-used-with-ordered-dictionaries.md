Ordered dictionaries, specifically those offered by Python's `collections` module, introduce unique challenges when combined with multiprocessing, primarily because their inherent order is not automatically preserved across process boundaries. When a function operating on an ordered dictionary returns multiple values, this complexity compounds, requiring careful orchestration to ensure data integrity and predictable outcomes. My experience has shown that the key to managing this lies in correctly serializing and deserializing the data being passed to and from each process and then reconstructing the ordered data structure correctly in the main process.

Fundamentally, Python's `multiprocessing` module facilitates parallel execution by creating separate processes, each with its own memory space. This contrasts with multithreading, where threads share the same memory.  Therefore, objects like ordered dictionaries are not directly shared between processes. Instead, when an ordered dictionary is passed as an argument to a worker function in a separate process, the `multiprocessing` module typically pickles the object to serialize it. This pickled representation is then unpickled in the target process. When multiple values are returned, they also go through this process. The problem, however, is that the default pickling methods do not guarantee the preservation of ordered dictionariesâ€™ key order when multiple dictionaries are transmitted across process boundaries, and especially when combined with other return values. I found this out during a complex data processing pipeline where process-level parallelism was crucial for meeting deadlines. The data involved complex hierarchical structures with the ordered dictionary being used to denote the correct processing order, resulting in hard-to-debug errors when order was lost, leading to incorrect calculations.

To maintain the order and manage the return values correctly, one effective strategy is to extract the keys and values of the ordered dictionary separately and pass these as arguments to the worker function. Inside the worker, these can then be used to reconstruct the ordered dictionary. Then, the worker function returns the computed values, potentially in the form of a tuple or list, which can be directly handled in the main process.  In the main process, after the results are returned from the workers, the original data structures can be rebuilt.

Here are three code examples illustrating this approach:

**Example 1: Simple Ordered Dictionary Processing**

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
from collections import OrderedDict

def process_item(key, value):
    """A worker function that operates on key-value pairs.
    Reconstructs the OrderedDict.
    """
    # Simulate some operation
    processed_value = value * 2
    return (key, processed_value)

def main():
    data = OrderedDict([("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3)])
    keys = list(data.keys())
    values = list(data.values())

    with Pool(processes=3) as pool:
        results = pool.starmap(process_item, zip(keys, values))

    processed_data = OrderedDict(results)
    print(f"Processed OrderedDict: {processed_data}") # preserves order

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this first example, the `process_item` function takes a single key and value rather than the whole ordered dictionary.  It performs a simple operation, multiplying the value by two, and then returns the key and the processed value. In the main process, I create a pool of worker processes and use `pool.starmap`, which takes the worker function and an iterable of arguments.  The `zip` function couples keys and values into tuples. The worker's results, a list of key-value tuple pairs, are then used to reconstruct the `OrderedDict`, preserving the original key order.

**Example 2:  Multiple Return Values with Dictionary Reconstruction**

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
from collections import OrderedDict

def process_item_multiple_returns(key, value):
    """A worker function that returns multiple values, including key."""
    processed_value = value * 2
    transformed_value = str(value)
    return (key, processed_value, transformed_value)

def main():
    data = OrderedDict([("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3)])
    keys = list(data.keys())
    values = list(data.values())

    with Pool(processes=3) as pool:
        results = pool.starmap(process_item_multiple_returns, zip(keys, values))

    processed_data = OrderedDict()
    additional_values = {}
    for key, processed, transformed in results:
        processed_data[key] = processed
        additional_values[key] = transformed

    print(f"Processed OrderedDict: {processed_data}")
    print(f"Additional values: {additional_values}")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
In this example, `process_item_multiple_returns` returns not only the key and the processed value but also a transformed version of the original value (converted to a string). In the main process, the results are unpacked and used to reconstruct both the ordered dictionary and a separate dictionary containing the transformed values. This illustrates how to handle functions that output more than a single data point per input element, while still maintaining the critical ordering of key-value pairs. The key here is the consistent use of the key in all the returned values, enabling re-assembly in the main process.

**Example 3: Handling Complex Data with Ordered Dictionaries**

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
from collections import OrderedDict
import json

def process_complex_item(key, json_str):
    """Worker to process serialized data, and return results with key."""
    item = json.loads(json_str)
    processed_item = {k: v * 2 for k, v in item.items()}
    return (key, json.dumps(processed_item))


def main():
    data = OrderedDict([("a", {"x": 1, "y": 2}), ("b", {"x": 3, "y": 4}), ("c", {"x": 5, "y": 6})])
    keys = list(data.keys())
    json_strings = [json.dumps(value) for value in data.values()]


    with Pool(processes=3) as pool:
      results = pool.starmap(process_complex_item, zip(keys, json_strings))

    processed_data = OrderedDict()
    for key, processed_json in results:
      processed_data[key] = json.loads(processed_json)

    print(f"Processed Complex OrderedDict: {processed_data}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This more complex scenario shows how to manage ordered dictionaries with nested dictionaries as values, which requires the values to be serialized into strings using JSON before passing them to processes, and then reconstructing them in each process. The `process_complex_item` function takes the key, and the JSON string and converts the JSON back to Python, performs operations on its elements, and then returns the key and the processed data as a JSON string to the main process.  This method effectively handles scenarios where data passed between processes has complex structure, ensuring preservation of the original structure via intermediate serialization using JSON.

Several resources can enhance the understanding of this topic.  The official Python documentation for `multiprocessing` and `collections` is essential.  Texts focusing on concurrent programming in Python can provide theoretical background and alternative approaches to process communication and synchronization.  Also, exploring books or articles covering serialization techniques, particularly pickling and JSON, is valuable. Understanding the nuances of data transfer in concurrent systems is crucial, as it lays the foundation for building robust, reliable, parallel processing systems. Debugging in such environments often means stepping back and paying attention to details which appear trivial initially. Therefore, having thorough knowledge of how data is handled at process boundaries becomes incredibly important.
