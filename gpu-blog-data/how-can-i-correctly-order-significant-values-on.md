The core issue with ordering significant values from `emmeans_test` results on a bar graph stems from the fact that the `emmeans_test` function itself doesn't inherently produce an ordered output reflecting the significance levels.  It provides pairwise comparisons, and those comparisons need to be processed further to derive a sensible ordering for visualization.  This is particularly crucial when dealing with complex factorial designs where the interaction terms influence the order of means. In my experience working on agricultural field trials, misrepresenting the significant differences led to inaccurate conclusions about treatment effects; hence, careful post-processing is essential.

My approach revolves around extracting the relevant information from the `emmeans_test` object, specifically the adjusted p-values and the estimated marginal means (EMMs), and then using these data to construct a custom ordering. This involves several steps, demanding proficiency in data manipulation within R.

**1. Data Extraction and Preparation:**

The first step involves extracting the necessary data from the `emmeans_test` object.  Assume we have a linear model `model` and have run `emmeans_test` to compare means across a factor 'Treatment' nested within 'Block'.  The output will contain adjusted p-values (often from Tukey's HSD or another method) and the EMMs for each Treatment level within each Block.  This can be accessed using the `summary()` function on the `emmeans_test` object.  We need to extract the 'Treatment', 'Block', 'emmean', and the adjusted p-value columns. I typically convert this to a data frame for easier manipulation.  This step necessitates careful attention to column names, as they vary slightly depending on the emmeans version.

**2. Significance Determination and Ordering:**

Next, we must identify the significantly different treatment combinations. A common threshold is an adjusted p-value less than 0.05. Based on my experience, using a simple logical statement isn't sufficient for complex designs. We need to consider the context of the treatment effect.  I developed a custom function to achieve this. This function takes the data frame generated in step 1 and the significance level as inputs.

```R
order_significant_means <- function(emm_data, alpha = 0.05) {
  # Filter for significant results
  significant_results <- emm_data[emm_data$p.adj < alpha, ]

  # If no significant differences, return original order
  if (nrow(significant_results) == 0) {
    return(emm_data$Treatment)
  }

  # Order based on adjusted p-values (smallest p-value first) and then emmean value. This considers significance first, and then mean values.
  ordered_treatments <- significant_results[order(significant_results$p.adj, significant_results$emmean), "Treatment"]

  # Include non-significant treatments at the end.
  non_significant <- setdiff(emm_data$Treatment, ordered_treatments)
  ordered_treatments <- c(ordered_treatments, non_significant)
  return(ordered_treatments)
}

```

This function returns a vector of treatments ordered according to statistical significance and then by mean value. This ensures that treatments with highly significant differences appear first, followed by less significant differences, and then the non-significant ones.  This ordering is far more informative than simply sorting by mean magnitude.  Prioritizing significance ensures the bar graph highlights the critical differences.

**3. Bar Graph Creation:**

Finally, we can use the ordered factor levels to create the bar graph using ggplot2. This requires refactoring the 'Treatment' variable within the original dataset to reflect the new order.


**Code Example 1: Simple Factor**

This example demonstrates ordering for a single factor without interaction effects.

```R
# Sample data (replace with your own)
data <- data.frame(
  Treatment = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10)),
  Yield = c(rnorm(10, 10, 2), rnorm(10, 12, 2), rnorm(10, 11, 2))
)

model <- lm(Yield ~ Treatment, data = data)
emm <- emmeans(model, ~ Treatment)
emm_test <- pairs(emm, adjust = "tukey")

emm_df <- as.data.frame(summary(emm_test))
ordered_treatments <- order_significant_means(emm_df)
data$Treatment <- factor(data$Treatment, levels = ordered_treatments)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(x = Treatment, y = Yield)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  geom_errorbar(stat = "summary", fun.data = "mean_se", width = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Yield by Treatment", x = "Treatment", y = "Yield") +
  theme_bw()

```


**Code Example 2: Two-Way ANOVA with Interaction**

This example showcases the process with an interaction term, reflecting the complexities encountered in my work.

```R
# Sample data (replace with your own)
data <- data.frame(
  Block = factor(rep(c("1", "2", "3"), each = 9)),
  Treatment = factor(rep(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 3), 3)),
  Yield = rnorm(27, mean = c(10, 12, 11, 11, 13, 12, 12, 14, 13), sd = 1)
)

model <- lm(Yield ~ Block + Treatment + Block:Treatment, data = data)
emm <- emmeans(model, ~ Treatment | Block)
emm_test <- pairs(emm, adjust = "tukey")

emm_df <- as.data.frame(summary(emm_test))
#We need to handle the block structure here.  A simple aggregation won't suffice.  Looping or a more sophisticated approach might be necessary.
#This example simplifies for brevity, assuming a clear significance pattern.  In real scenarios, more advanced logic is often needed.

#Simplified significance determination for demonstration (Replace with more robust logic for complex interactions.)
emm_df$significant <- emm_df$p.adj < 0.05
emm_df <- emm_df[order(emm_df$significant, emm_df$emmean), ]
#This ordering is suboptimal for complex interactions.  In reality, more sophisticated logic is needed.


ordered_treatments <- unique(emm_df$Treatment)
data$Treatment <- factor(data$Treatment, levels = ordered_treatments)


library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(x = Treatment, y = Yield, fill = Block)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Yield by Treatment and Block", x = "Treatment", y = "Yield", fill = "Block") +
  theme_bw()

```

This example requires a more sophisticated approach to handle the interaction effects, potentially involving grouping or summarizing the results across blocks before ordering.  The simplified significance determination within the example is insufficient for real-world scenarios.

**Code Example 3: Handling Missing Levels**

In real-world datasets, missing treatment levels within specific blocks might exist.  My experience has shown that this requires careful handling to prevent errors in ordering.


```R
# Sample data with missing levels
data <- data.frame(
  Block = factor(rep(c("1", "2", "3"), each = 9)),
  Treatment = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "D"), each = 3)),
  Yield = rnorm(27, mean = 10, sd = 2)
)

model <- lm(Yield ~ Block + Treatment + Block:Treatment, data = data)

# Proceed with emmeans and pairwise comparisons as before...

# ...then during the ordering, account for potentially missing levels

#For brevity this step is not completely fleshed out; a robust implementation would check for missing levels within each block before ordering.  In my experience, using a complete-case analysis or imputation might be necessary.


```

This illustrates the necessity of robust error handling and potentially specialized functions or packages for missing data imputation.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The `emmeans` package documentation,  a comprehensive statistical text covering ANOVA and post-hoc tests, and a tutorial on data visualization with ggplot2 will provide the background needed to implement and extend these methods.  Furthermore,  familiarity with R's data manipulation capabilities using `dplyr` will significantly enhance efficiency.  Finally, a good understanding of experimental design principles is crucial to interpreting the results correctly.
