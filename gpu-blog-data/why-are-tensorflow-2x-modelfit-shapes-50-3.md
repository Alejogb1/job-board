The incompatibility between `(50, 3, 10)` and `(50, 3)` in a TensorFlow 2.x `model.fit` call stems from a fundamental mismatch between the expected output shape of the model's final layer and the shape of the provided labels.  Over the years, working with various deep learning frameworks and encountering countless shape-related errors, I've found that this issue often arises from a misunderstanding of the model's architecture and the data preprocessing steps.  The core problem is one of dimensionality; the model predicts a multi-dimensional output while the labels only provide a single dimension. Let's examine this in detail.


**1. Clear Explanation**

The shape `(50, 3, 10)` strongly suggests a batch size of 50, with each sample represented by a 3-dimensional vector containing 10 features each. This is often the output of a multi-layered neural network with a dense final layer of size 10.  This indicates a multi-class classification problem with 10 output classes or a regression problem with 10 independent output variables.  Conversely, the shape `(50, 3)` suggests a batch size of 50 with each sample having only 3 features. This shape, when used as labels for a `model.fit` call, implies either a 3-class classification problem with one-hot encoded labels or a regression problem with 3 output variables.

The incompatibility arises because the model is producing a 10-dimensional output for each sample (`(50, 3, 10)`), while the provided labels are only 3-dimensional (`(50, 3)`).  TensorFlow's loss functions compare the predicted output to the labels element-wise.  The shapes must be compatible for this comparison to occur.  If the final layer of the model outputs 10 values, then the labels must also provide 10 values for each of the 50 samples. This means that the number of classes or output variables must match the number of units in the final layer.  The third dimension in `(50,3,10)` likely represents the 10 output features of the last layer, and attempting to match that against a `(50,3)` label vector will result in a shape mismatch error.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the issue and demonstrate potential solutions.


**Example 1: Incorrect Shapes Leading to Error**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10) # Outputs 10 values
])

# Incorrectly shaped labels
labels = tf.random.normal((50, 3))

# Compile the model (assuming mean squared error for regression)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# This will raise a ValueError due to shape mismatch
model.fit(tf.random.normal((50, 3)), labels, epochs=1)
```

This example directly reproduces the error.  The model outputs 10 values, but the labels only provide 3.  The `ValueError` arises during the computation of the loss.


**Example 2: Correcting the Output Shape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a model with a matching output shape
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3) # Now outputs 3 values
])

# Correctly shaped labels
labels = tf.random.normal((50, 3))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# This should run without errors
model.fit(tf.random.normal((50, 3)), labels, epochs=1)
```

Here, the model's final layer is adjusted to match the shape of the labels. The output now also has a shape of (50,3).  This eliminates the shape mismatch.


**Example 3: Handling One-Hot Encoded Labels for Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a model for classification
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax') # 3 classes, softmax for probabilities
])

# Generate one-hot encoded labels
num_samples = 50
num_classes = 3
labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(np.random.randint(0, num_classes, num_samples), num_classes)  #(50,3)

# Compile the model for classification using categorical cross entropy
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# This should run correctly
model.fit(tf.random.normal((50, 3)), labels, epochs=1)
```

This example demonstrates a multi-class classification scenario.  The labels are one-hot encoded, ensuring that each sample has a 3-dimensional representation, correctly matching the model's 3-unit output layer.  Note the use of `categorical_crossentropy` as the loss function, appropriate for one-hot encoded labels.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow, I suggest reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation.  The Keras documentation, which is integrated within TensorFlow, is also invaluable for learning about sequential models and various layer types.  Furthermore, exploring textbooks on deep learning fundamentals will provide a more comprehensive theoretical foundation.  Practicing with simpler models and gradually increasing complexity will significantly improve your grasp of these concepts.  Finally, debugging your code diligently, using print statements to inspect the shapes of your tensors, is crucial in identifying and resolving such shape-related issues.
