The discrepancy arises primarily from the fundamental differences in how `torch.mean` calculates an average and how `torch.sign` determines the sign of a tensor element. Specifically, `torch.mean` computes the arithmetic mean, while `torch.sign` returns a tensor indicating the sign of each element: -1 for negative, 0 for zero, and 1 for positive values. When dealing with tensors that contain both positive and negative numbers, the arithmetic mean, by definition, incorporates and potentially cancels out these opposing values, leading to results distinct from the element-wise sign representation.

Let's illustrate this with a detailed explanation. The `torch.mean` function operates by summing all elements in a tensor, then dividing that sum by the total number of elements. This process averages out the magnitudes, and importantly, the polarities of the numbers. Positive and negative numbers directly impact this sum, and thus, the resulting mean. Conversely, `torch.sign` completely disregards the magnitudes of the values. It only assesses whether each individual number is less than zero, equal to zero, or greater than zero. It then outputs a tensor of -1s, 0s, or 1s accordingly. This creates a discrete representation of the direction (or lack thereof) of each element. Because of this fundamental difference in operation – one dealing with averaged magnitudes and the other with individual polarities, the final outputs are typically quite distinct. The following example demonstrates a case where the results of these two functions are different, which is the norm. It showcases that `torch.mean` is susceptible to the magnitude of the inputs.

```python
import torch

# Example 1: Simple tensor with positive and negative numbers
tensor1 = torch.tensor([-2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0])

mean_result1 = torch.mean(tensor1)
sign_result1 = torch.sign(tensor1)

print("Tensor 1:", tensor1)
print("Mean result 1:", mean_result1)
print("Sign result 1:", sign_result1)

```

In Example 1, the input tensor contains both negative and positive numbers along with a zero. `torch.mean` computes the arithmetic average, which in this case is 0.0. However, `torch.sign` returns a tensor indicating the sign of each element: [-1, -1, 0, 1, 1]. Here, the mean and sign outputs are distinctly different because the mean attempts to capture the magnitude while sign captures the polarity only. The zero value has minimal effect on the mean but is clearly differentiated from other values by the sign function.

It's also essential to consider the influence of the number of positive and negative values and their magnitudes on the mean. If the magnitude of negative numbers is significantly greater than positive numbers, it can pull the mean toward negative values. Similarly, a larger number of either positive or negative values will influence the resulting mean, potentially resulting in an average with the opposite polarity to the average sign representation, assuming a sign operation was performed separately on each element.
The next example demonstrates how a subtle change in the tensor can substantially change the mean but not the sign results.

```python
# Example 2: Tensor with adjusted magnitudes, same sign pattern
tensor2 = torch.tensor([-10.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0])
mean_result2 = torch.mean(tensor2)
sign_result2 = torch.sign(tensor2)
print("Tensor 2:", tensor2)
print("Mean result 2:", mean_result2)
print("Sign result 2:", sign_result2)
```

In Example 2, I have altered the first element to have a larger magnitude. As shown, the mean has drastically changed towards a negative average. This shift is due to the nature of the calculation performed by `torch.mean` and highlights the influence of magnitudes on its result. On the other hand, `torch.sign` remains the same, illustrating that it’s solely concerned with the sign of each value and is unaffected by any change in magnitude.

Finally, a more practical example could involve working with image data, which is inherently a tensor. Suppose the tensor represents pixel intensity values relative to a baseline. The mean could reveal if there is an overall shift in intensity (whether it’s mostly brighter or darker), while the sign operation reveals pixels that are brighter (positive) or darker (negative).

```python
# Example 3: Image data representation
image_data = torch.tensor([[ -0.5,  0.2,  -0.3],
                         [ 0.8,  -0.1,  0.4],
                         [ -0.6,  0.9, -0.2]], dtype=torch.float32)
mean_image = torch.mean(image_data)
sign_image = torch.sign(image_data)

print("Image Data:", image_data)
print("Mean of Image Data:", mean_image)
print("Sign of Image Data:", sign_image)

```

In Example 3, `image_data` represents a simplified 3x3 image. The `torch.mean` output shows the average pixel offset, whereas `torch.sign` provides a map of which pixels are lighter (1), darker (-1) or at the reference value (0). This illustrates that, in a real-world scenario, the functions can provide very distinct, useful information. The `mean` condenses the entire matrix to a single value that can be used to ascertain some global information, while the `sign` function provides an overview of specific values. The `mean` is therefore much more susceptible to the number and magnitude of values, while the `sign` operator is much more resistant to the distribution of values.

In conclusion, the divergence in results between `torch.mean` and `torch.sign` stems from their fundamentally different operational characteristics. The mean calculates a statistical average influenced by all values in a tensor, magnitudes included, while the sign function maps each element to a discrete value depending on its polarity. Understanding this difference is essential to appropriately choosing the correct function for a given data processing task.

For further learning and comprehensive examples, I highly recommend consulting PyTorch's official documentation, specifically the sections covering mathematical operations and tensor manipulations. Additionally, exploring online tutorials and articles dedicated to understanding tensors and common tensor operations can prove beneficial. Lastly, implementing and experimenting with similar code examples under different conditions provides practical experience and deepens understanding.
