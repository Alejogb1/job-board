The `AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute '_values'` encountered when initializing TensorFlow variables using `tf.zeros([10])` in the context of the MNIST softmax tutorial stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how TensorFlow handles tensor creation and variable initialization. I've personally debugged this type of error countless times in projects ranging from basic image classifiers to more complex sequence models. The core issue is that `tf.zeros([10])` creates a *tensor* of all zeros, not a TensorFlow *variable*. TensorFlow variables are special objects specifically designed to hold trainable parameters, and they wrap around tensors to manage their state and gradients during training. Direct assignment of a tensor to where a variable is expected is the source of the `AttributeError`.

TensorFlow variables are essentially wrappers around tensors, offering mechanisms for state management. They are designed to be modified during the optimization process, storing intermediate values needed to compute gradients during backpropagation. This is why attempting to use a pure tensor where a variable is expected results in an error. The `_values` attribute, referenced in the traceback, belongs to internal implementation details of TensorFlow's `Variable` class, which are not available directly on a raw tensor like the output of `tf.zeros()`. When code expects a `tf.Variable` with its associated methods, it looks for this `_values` attribute, and failing to find it in a plain tensor results in the error.

Let's examine the typical erroneous code pattern and how to correct it:

**Erroneous Example 1: Direct Tensor Assignment**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect: Assigning a tensor to where a variable is expected
W = tf.zeros([784, 10])
b = tf.zeros([10])

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 784])
y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b # Error occurs during graph execution
```

The above code creates two tensors, `W` and `b`, but attempts to use them as though they were trainable variables. When TensorFlow builds the computational graph for calculating `y`, it encounters `W` and `b` and expects them to have the properties of a `tf.Variable` rather than simply `tf.Tensor`. Since these are raw tensors, the missing attributes lead to the `AttributeError`. The error won’t be caught during the static graph definition. It will surface during runtime when you try to evaluate the model’s operations by calling `sess.run()`.

To correctly initialize weights and biases, one must utilize `tf.Variable` and pass the `tf.zeros()` tensor as its initial value:

**Corrected Example 1: Variable Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Correct: Creating variables with initial values using tf.Variable
W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([784, 10]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]))

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 784])
y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b
```

By wrapping the initial tensors within `tf.Variable`, we signal to TensorFlow that these tensors are part of the model's state and must be updated during training. `tf.Variable` encapsulates the tensor and ensures that all necessary functionality is available, thus resolving the original error. Note that the shape and dtype passed to `tf.zeros` are preserved and used to initialize the variable.

The second case often encountered involves incorrectly attempting to modify variables in a direct way. This example illustrates a subtle but critical error:

**Erroneous Example 2: Incorrect Variable Modification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([784, 10]))
W = W + 1 # Incorrect: Attempting direct variable assignment

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 784])
y = tf.matmul(x, W)
```

While `W` is properly initialized as a variable, the expression `W = W + 1` does *not* modify the value of the original variable `W`. Instead, it creates a *new* tensor, adding 1 to the original tensor that `W` wrapped, and then reassigns the variable identifier `W` to *point* to this new tensor. This again detaches `W` from the `Variable` type, causing similar problems down the line when, for example, an optimizer attempts to compute gradients with respect to `W`.

The correct way to modify a variable is to use the methods available in the `tf.Variable` class. In this case, the `assign` method should be utilized to update the variable in-place:

**Corrected Example 2: Using `assign` to update Variable**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([784, 10]))
W_assign = W.assign(W + 1) # Correct: Update the variable in-place

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 784])
y = tf.matmul(x, W)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    sess.run(W_assign)
    print(sess.run(W))
```

This corrected code demonstrates the use of the `assign` operation, which creates an op in the graph that updates the value of `W`. When this operation is executed via the `sess.run()`, `W` is updated in place to the result of the addition. This keeps W as a valid variable and maintains its associated properties, preventing the `AttributeError`. I have encountered cases where people try to update `W` in the same way directly inside of loops, causing the same error. This method of assignment via an op is the appropriate solution.

Finally, let's consider a case where one might inadvertently convert a variable to a tensor during the gradient calculation. While this case is typically associated with a different error, the misunderstanding of how variables behave is at its heart:

**Erroneous Example 3: Loss Calculation and Variable Update**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([784, 10]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]))

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 784])
y_ = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10])

y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b

cross_entropy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y_, logits=y))

optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.5)
train_step = optimizer.minimize(cross_entropy) # Correct usage

# Incorrect: Using a tensor for variable gradient update leads to a different error
gradients = optimizer.compute_gradients(cross_entropy, [W, b])

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

    batch_xs = np.random.rand(100,784)
    batch_ys = np.random.rand(100,10)
    _, g = sess.run([train_step, gradients], feed_dict={x: batch_xs, y_: batch_ys})
    print(g)
```

In this case, while we don't see the attribute error itself, the `train_step` correctly uses the `optimizer.minimize()` method that understands how to compute and apply gradients to variables. The `optimizer.compute_gradients()` method returns a list of tuples, where the first element of each tuple is a tensor representing a gradient, and the second element is the associated variable itself, not another tensor. If we were to try to replace W by assigning W to the computed gradient itself, that would cause a separate, but related error because it would once again break the state and functionality inherent to `tf.Variable`. `tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer.apply_gradients()` should be used to update the variable based on the calculated gradients.

To summarize, the critical difference between `tf.zeros()` and `tf.Variable(tf.zeros())` is that the latter creates an object designed for learning, encapsulating stateful tensors alongside operations for gradient calculation and state updates. Trying to directly manipulate tensors or replace variables with tensors is the root of these errors.

For further understanding, I would recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on variables and how they interact with the computational graph. The TensorFlow tutorials provide in-depth explanations of variable usage in various machine learning models. Additionally, exploring examples of custom training loops, and investigating the behavior of optimizers during training would be beneficial for solidifying understanding and preventing future occurrences of these errors. Consulting TensorFlow's GitHub issues and stack overflow is also very useful for observing real world problems being solved.
