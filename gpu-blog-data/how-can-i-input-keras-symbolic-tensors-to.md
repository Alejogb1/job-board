The core challenge in feeding Keras symbolic tensors to a custom loss function operating within TensorFlow's eager execution mode lies in the inherent difference between eager execution's immediate computation and the symbolic nature of Keras tensors.  These tensors represent computations rather than concrete values until evaluated within a TensorFlow graph.  My experience developing a novel variational autoencoder for high-dimensional time-series data highlighted this precisely.  The custom loss function, incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence between latent distributions, required careful management of tensor types to avoid runtime errors.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras, particularly under TensorFlow's backend, relies on symbolic computation for building models. This means that tensor operations are defined as a computational graph, not executed immediately.  Eager execution, conversely, performs computations immediately, line by line. When a custom loss function is defined for use within eager execution, it expects concrete numerical values as input.  Therefore, to use Keras symbolic tensors (which are not yet evaluated numerical values), we need to explicitly trigger their evaluation within the loss function itself.  This is typically achieved by utilizing TensorFlow's `tf.function` decorator or by leveraging the `tf.GradientTape` context manager for automatic differentiation, which implicitly handles tensor evaluation within the gradient calculation.

The crucial point is that the symbolic tensor must be evaluated *inside* the loss function's scope using a mechanism that ensures compatibility with eager execution.  Simply passing the symbolic tensor directly will lead to a TypeError because the loss function expects numerical data.  The `tf.function` decorator effectively compiles the loss function into a graph, allowing for efficient execution and the correct handling of symbolic tensors.  Alternatively, using `tf.GradientTape` ensures the tensor's evaluation happens during the automatic differentiation process used for backpropagation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `tf.function`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def custom_loss_tf_function(y_true, y_pred):
  """Custom loss function using tf.function for eager execution."""
  @tf.function
  def loss_inner(y_true, y_pred):
    #  Assume y_true and y_pred are Keras symbolic tensors
    mse = K.mean(K.square(y_true - y_pred)) #Keras symbolic operations are fine within tf.function
    return mse

  return loss_inner(y_true, y_pred)

#Example usage:
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model.compile(loss=custom_loss_tf_function, optimizer='adam')
```

*Commentary:* This approach encapsulates the core loss calculation within a `tf.function`. This ensures the symbolic tensors (`y_true`, `y_pred`) are handled correctly during the graph execution triggered by `tf.function`. The Keras backend functions (`K.mean`, `K.square`) remain suitable as they are compatible with the graph context.  This is my preferred method for most situations due to its clarity and efficiency.


**Example 2: Using `tf.GradientTape`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def custom_loss_gradient_tape(y_true, y_pred):
  """Custom loss function using tf.GradientTape for eager execution."""
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    #Assume y_true and y_pred are Keras symbolic tensors
    mse = K.mean(K.square(y_true - y_pred)) #Evaluation happens implicitly within GradientTape
  loss_value = mse #Evaluated Tensor
  return loss_value


#Example usage
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model.compile(loss=custom_loss_gradient_tape, optimizer='adam')
```

*Commentary:* This example uses `tf.GradientTape` to manage the computational graph implicitly.  The `mse` calculation is performed within the `GradientTape` context, forcing the evaluation of the symbolic tensors.  The `loss_value` is then a concrete numerical value suitable for the optimizer.  While functional, this approach is less explicit than using `tf.function`. Itâ€™s particularly useful when dealing with complex loss functions requiring higher-order gradients.  I tend to use this approach when needing finer control over gradient calculations.


**Example 3:  Handling potential shape mismatches:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def custom_loss_shape_handling(y_true, y_pred):
  """Custom loss function handling potential shape mismatches."""
  @tf.function
  def loss_inner(y_true, y_pred):
    y_true = tf.reshape(y_true, shape=(-1,1)) #Ensure consistent shapes
    y_pred = tf.reshape(y_pred, shape=(-1,1))
    mse = K.mean(K.square(y_true - y_pred))
    return mse
  return loss_inner(y_true, y_pred)

#Example usage
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model.compile(loss=custom_loss_shape_handling, optimizer='adam')
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a best practice by explicitly handling potential shape inconsistencies between `y_true` and `y_pred`. In my experience, shape mismatch errors are a common source of frustration when integrating custom loss functions. Using `tf.reshape` to ensure compatibility before the loss computation is a robust approach.  This prevents errors at runtime and ensures cleaner code.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is the primary resource.  Familiarize yourself with the sections on eager execution, automatic differentiation, and the Keras API.  Furthermore, a strong grasp of fundamental TensorFlow concepts, particularly tensor manipulation and graph construction, is crucial for building robust custom loss functions.   Finally, reviewing the source code of existing Keras loss functions can provide insights into effective implementation strategies.
