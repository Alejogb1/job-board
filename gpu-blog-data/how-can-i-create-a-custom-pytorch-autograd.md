Creating a custom PyTorch autograd function necessitates a deep understanding of the underlying automatic differentiation mechanism.  My experience optimizing neural network training pipelines for large-scale image recognition projects underscored the crucial role of custom autograd functions in achieving performance gains and incorporating novel operations not readily available in the standard PyTorch library.  The key lies in defining both the forward and backward passes, ensuring they adhere to the specific requirements of the PyTorch autograd system.

**1.  Explanation:**

PyTorch's autograd system automatically computes gradients for differentiable operations.  However, this automatic differentiation relies on the pre-defined operations within the PyTorch framework.  When you need a custom operation, you must explicitly define both the forward and backward passes using a custom autograd function.  This involves subclassing `torch.autograd.Function`.  The `forward` method computes the output of your custom operation, while the `backward` method computes the gradients of the output with respect to the inputs.  Crucially, the `backward` method receives the gradient of the output (i.e., `grad_output`) as input and computes the gradients of the inputs (`grad_input`).  Correctly implementing the backward pass is paramount; inaccuracies will lead to incorrect gradient calculations and potentially hinder or completely disrupt the training process.  The `backward` method must return a tuple of gradients, one for each input to the `forward` method.  These gradients are then used by the optimizer during the backpropagation step.

The context manager `torch.no_grad()` is crucial when dealing with custom functions where certain operations should not be tracked for gradient calculation.  This improves efficiency by preventing unnecessary computation within the automatic differentiation graph. Using `torch.enable_grad()` and `torch.no_grad()` allows for fine-grained control over gradient tracking.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  A Simple Custom Exponential Function:**

```python
import torch
import torch.autograd as autograd

class MyExp(autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input):
        ctx.save_for_backward(input)
        return torch.exp(input)

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        input, = ctx.saved_tensors
        return grad_output * torch.exp(input)

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
y = MyExp.apply(x)
y.backward(torch.ones_like(y))
print(x.grad)
```

This example demonstrates a basic custom exponential function.  The `forward` method simply computes the exponential of the input.  The `backward` method computes the gradient of the exponential function (which is the exponential itself) multiplied by the `grad_output`.  `ctx.save_for_backward(input)` saves the input tensor for use in the backward pass.

**Example 2:  A Custom Function with Multiple Inputs and Outputs:**

```python
import torch
import torch.autograd as autograd

class MyCustomFunction(autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x, y):
        ctx.save_for_backward(x, y)
        return x * x + y * y, x * y

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output1, grad_output2):
        x, y = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_x = 2 * x * grad_output1 + y * grad_output2
        grad_y = 2 * y * grad_output1 + x * grad_output2
        return grad_x, grad_y

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
output1, output2 = MyCustomFunction.apply(x, y)
output1.backward(torch.ones_like(output1))
output2.backward(torch.ones_like(output2))
print(x.grad, y.grad)
```

Here, the custom function takes two inputs and returns two outputs. The backward pass calculates the gradients of the outputs with respect to both inputs, demonstrating the handling of multiple gradients.  This example highlights the need to correctly propagate gradients through multiple outputs.

**Example 3:  Incorporating `torch.no_grad()` for Efficiency:**

```python
import torch
import torch.autograd as autograd

class MyComplexFunction(autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        with torch.no_grad():
            z = x.clone()
            z[z < 0] = 0  # Non-differentiable operation
            result = torch.sum(z)
        return result

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        # Gradient only calculated for the differentiable part of the forward pass
        return grad_output


x = torch.randn(5, requires_grad=True)
y = MyComplexFunction.apply(x)
y.backward(torch.tensor(1.0))
print(x.grad)

```
This illustrates the use of `torch.no_grad()` within the forward pass to prevent gradient calculation for the non-differentiable operation (setting negative values to zero). The backward pass only accounts for the differentiable part, ensuring the gradient computation remains accurate and avoids errors.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation provides comprehensive explanations of autograd and custom functions.  Dive into the source code of existing PyTorch operations for a deeper understanding of the implementation details.  Explore advanced resources on automatic differentiation to gain a theoretical foundation for understanding the intricacies of gradient calculation.  Finally, consider working through practical tutorials focusing on building and optimizing custom autograd functions to solidify your understanding.
