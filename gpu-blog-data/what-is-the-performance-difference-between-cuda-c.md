The fundamental performance disparity between CUDA C++ (.cu) and standard C++ (.cpp) files stems from their inherent architectural targets.  Standard C++ code executes on the host CPU, leveraging its processing cores and memory hierarchy. CUDA C++, conversely, targets NVIDIA GPUs, harnessing their massively parallel architecture comprising thousands of cores and specialized memory structures.  This architectural distinction leads to significant performance variations, particularly for computationally intensive tasks.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing (HPC) applications across diverse scientific domains underscores this point consistently.

The primary factor influencing the performance difference is parallelism.  Standard C++ primarily relies on the CPU's multi-core capabilities, which are comparatively limited compared to the thousands of cores found in modern GPUs.  While multi-threading techniques in C++ can exploit this parallelism, they're inherently constrained by factors like thread synchronization overhead and memory access latency.  CUDA C++, on the other hand, is designed to explicitly leverage the inherent parallelism of the GPU.  This is achieved through the execution of numerous threads concurrently, each operating on different data elements.  This inherent parallel nature of GPU computation allows for a substantial speedup for algorithms that can be effectively parallelized.

Furthermore, the memory architecture plays a crucial role.  CPU memory access is comparatively slow compared to the speed at which GPU cores can process data.  CUDA programming models utilize specialized memory spaces within the GPU, such as global memory, shared memory, and registers, to minimize memory access latency and optimize data transfer.  Efficient utilization of these memory spaces, along with strategies like memory coalescing, is paramount to achieving optimal performance in CUDA C++.  Conversely, standard C++ programs rely on the system's main memory, incurring significant latency when dealing with large datasets.

Let's illustrate this through code examples.  Consider a simple matrix multiplication operation:


**Example 1: Standard C++ Matrix Multiplication**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  vector<vector<double>> A(n, vector<double>(n));
  vector<vector<double>> B(n, vector<double>(n));
  vector<vector<double>> C(n, vector<double>(n, 0.0));

  // Initialize matrices A and B
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      A[i][j] = i + j;
      B[i][j] = i - j;
    }
  }

  // Perform matrix multiplication
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
      for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
        C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
      }
    }
  }

  // Verification (optional)
  // ...

  return 0;
}
```

This C++ implementation utilizes nested loops, reflecting the inherently serial nature of the calculation within each loop iteration.  While multi-threading might improve performance to some extent, it remains fundamentally limited by the CPU's architecture and the inherent sequential nature of the nested loops.


**Example 2: CUDA C++ Matrix Multiplication (Simplified Kernel)**

```cpp
__global__ void matrixMulKernel(const double *A, const double *B, double *C, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  if (i < n && j < n) {
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
      sum += A[i * n + k] * B[k * n + j];
    }
    C[i * n + j] = sum;
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Data allocation and initialization on host and device) ...

  // Kernel launch configuration
  dim3 blockDim(16, 16);
  dim3 gridDim((n + blockDim.x - 1) / blockDim.x, (n + blockDim.y - 1) / blockDim.y);

  matrixMulKernel<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, n);

  // ... (Data transfer from device to host and verification) ...

  return 0;
}
```

This CUDA C++ kernel demonstrates the fundamental concept of parallel execution.  Each thread computes a single element of the resulting matrix C.  The `blockDim` and `gridDim` parameters control the number of threads and blocks launched on the GPU, allowing for fine-grained control over the parallel execution. The performance gain here directly correlates with the number of concurrently executing threads.


**Example 3: CUDA C++ Matrix Multiplication (Improved Memory Access)**

```cpp
__global__ void matrixMulKernelOptimized(const double *A, const double *B, double *C, int n) {
  __shared__ double sharedA[TILE_DIM][TILE_DIM];
  __shared__ double sharedB[TILE_DIM][TILE_DIM];

  int tx = threadIdx.x;
  int ty = threadIdx.y;
  int bx = blockIdx.x;
  int by = blockIdx.y;

  double sum = 0.0;
  for (int k = 0; k < n; k += TILE_DIM) {
    sharedA[ty][tx] = A[(by * TILE_DIM + ty) * n + k + tx];
    sharedB[ty][tx] = B[(k + ty) * n + bx * TILE_DIM + tx];
    __syncthreads();

    for (int i = 0; i < TILE_DIM; ++i) {
      sum += sharedA[ty][i] * sharedB[i][tx];
    }
    __syncthreads();
  }
  C[(by * TILE_DIM + ty) * n + bx * TILE_DIM + tx] = sum;
}

// ... (main function similar to Example 2, but with appropriate TILE_DIM definition) ...
```

This improved kernel utilizes shared memory (`__shared__`), a faster memory space on the GPU, to reduce memory access latency.  The use of tiling improves memory coalescing, ensuring efficient data transfer between global and shared memory.  This optimization further enhances performance by minimizing memory access bottlenecks, highlighting the importance of careful memory management in CUDA programming.  The choice of `TILE_DIM` is crucial for performance and depends on the GPU's architecture.


In conclusion, the performance difference between CUDA C++ and standard C++ is substantial for computationally intensive tasks, especially those easily parallelizable. CUDA C++ excels by harnessing the massive parallelism and specialized memory hierarchy of GPUs, significantly reducing computation time. However, the added complexity of CUDA programming requires careful consideration of memory management, kernel design, and thread synchronization to maximize performance.  Choosing between CUDA C++ and standard C++ hinges on the application's computational needs and the ability to effectively parallelize the algorithm.  For heavily parallel applications, CUDA C++ often offers orders of magnitude performance improvements.
