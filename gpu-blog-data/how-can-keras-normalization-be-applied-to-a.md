Normalization within a TensorFlow `ParallelMapDataset`, particularly without eager execution, presents a challenge due to the graph execution context and the need to ensure consistency during distributed training.  Direct application of Keras normalization layers within the `map_func` function of such a dataset will not function correctly. The problem lies in the fact that these normalization layers are stateful and expect to be built and updated based on data statistics, making them ill-suited to be directly embedded into a `tf.data` pipeline that executes in a separate graph.

The primary issue revolves around how Keras normalization layers compute and maintain their internal statistics (mean and variance for batch normalization, for example). Typically, during training, these layers process batches and update their internal parameters. However, within a `ParallelMapDataset` context, each worker operates independently, meaning that parameters initialized in the `map_func` will not be shared or correctly accumulated across workers. Consequently, each worker will independently compute and update parameters based only on its local slice of data, rendering normalization inconsistent and likely detrimental to model training. This creates a situation where what you thought would be a global, dataset-wide normalization is merely local to each parallel processing thread. This leads to statistical variance between each worker causing a form of data imbalance that will heavily degrade training results.

The proper approach necessitates calculating the normalization statistics beforehand using a representative dataset and then applying the computed parameters during the dataset creation. This involves a two-stage process: first, precompute the statistics; second, use those statistics to normalize the data during the `ParallelMapDataset` creation. I have encountered this problem previously while working with large-scale image datasets. Initially, I naively attempted to instantiate a batch normalization layer within the `map_func`. I observed inconsistent performance and model collapse. The solution I converged on involved explicitly computing the dataset statistics in a preliminary pass and using a different technique for applying them to the data.

**Precomputing Normalization Statistics:**

The initial stage involves creating a representative dataset (or a large enough sample from it) and using this to calculate the necessary statistics. Let's consider a simple case of image normalization where we want to calculate the mean and standard deviation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def compute_mean_std(dataset, batch_size=32):
    """Computes the mean and standard deviation of a dataset.

    Args:
      dataset: A tf.data.Dataset object.
      batch_size: The batch size.

    Returns:
      A tuple containing (mean, std).
    """
    means = []
    variances = []
    count = 0
    for images in dataset.batch(batch_size):
        images = tf.cast(images, tf.float32)
        mean_batch = tf.reduce_mean(images, axis=(0, 1, 2))
        var_batch = tf.math.reduce_variance(images, axis=(0, 1, 2))
        means.append(mean_batch)
        variances.append(var_batch)
        count += images.shape[0]
    
    mean_total = tf.reduce_mean(tf.stack(means), axis=0)
    variance_total = tf.reduce_mean(tf.stack(variances), axis=0)
    
    std_total = tf.math.sqrt(variance_total)
    return mean_total, std_total

# Example Usage:
# Create some dummy data for example
dummy_data = np.random.rand(1000, 32, 32, 3).astype(np.float32)
dummy_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(dummy_data)

mean, std = compute_mean_std(dummy_dataset)
print(f"Mean: {mean.numpy()}")
print(f"Std: {std.numpy()}")
```

In this code, the `compute_mean_std` function iterates through the input dataset, calculates the per-channel mean and variance for each batch, and then averages these values to obtain the global mean and standard deviation for the entire dataset. This is done using eager execution to avoid the issues previously explained. The important part here is to ensure that this process is done only *once*.

**Applying the Normalization in `ParallelMapDataset`:**

Having computed the statistics, the following step involves incorporating them into the `ParallelMapDataset`'s `map_func`. The `map_func` itself must not contain any trainable variables. Instead, it should apply the pre-computed mean and standard deviation to the data.

```python
def normalize_image(image, mean, std):
    """Normalizes an image using pre-computed mean and standard deviation.

    Args:
      image: A tf.Tensor representing the image.
      mean: A tf.Tensor representing the mean.
      std: A tf.Tensor representing the standard deviation.

    Returns:
      A normalized tf.Tensor representing the image.
    """
    image = tf.cast(image, tf.float32)
    normalized_image = (image - mean) / (std + 1e-8)  # Adding a small value for numerical stability
    return normalized_image

def build_dataset_with_normalization(data, mean, std, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE):
    """Builds a dataset with parallel mapping and normalization.

    Args:
      data: Input numpy data.
      mean: A tf.Tensor representing the mean.
      std: A tf.Tensor representing the standard deviation.
      num_parallel_calls: Number of parallel calls for dataset mapping.

    Returns:
      A tf.data.Dataset object.
    """

    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
    dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: normalize_image(x, mean, std),
                            num_parallel_calls=num_parallel_calls)
    return dataset


# Example Usage:
normalized_dataset = build_dataset_with_normalization(dummy_data, mean, std)


# Verify that the normalization has been applied (example)
for normalized_image in normalized_dataset.take(1):
    print(f"First normalized image: {normalized_image.numpy()}")

```

Here, the `normalize_image` function operates within the `map_func` but contains no trainable parameters. It accepts the image and the previously computed mean and standard deviation as parameters. The `build_dataset_with_normalization` method encapsulates the dataset creation and mapping. Using `tf.data.AUTOTUNE` allows TensorFlow to dynamically determine the optimal number of parallel calls based on hardware availability. Importantly, we now have an input pipeline that correctly processes data across multiple threads without creating statistical inconsistencies.

**Alternative: Using `tf.keras.layers.Normalization` Pre-Computed Weights:**

Another approach, if you still prefer using `tf.keras.layers.Normalization`, involves building the layer and setting its weights based on the precomputed statistics before incorporating it into the pipeline.

```python
def create_keras_norm_layer(mean, std):
  """Creates a Keras Normalization layer with precomputed mean and std.

  Args:
      mean: A tf.Tensor representing the mean.
      std: A tf.Tensor representing the standard deviation.

  Returns:
    A tf.keras.layers.Normalization object.
  """
  norm_layer = tf.keras.layers.Normalization(axis=-1, mean=mean, variance=std**2)
  norm_layer.adapt(tf.zeros((1, 32, 32, 3), dtype=tf.float32))
  return norm_layer

def normalize_image_keras(image, norm_layer):
    """Normalizes an image using a pre-initialized Keras normalization layer.

    Args:
      image: A tf.Tensor representing the image.
      norm_layer: A tf.keras.layers.Normalization object.

    Returns:
      A normalized tf.Tensor representing the image.
    """
    image = tf.cast(image, tf.float32)
    return norm_layer(image)

def build_dataset_keras_normalization(data, mean, std, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE):
    """Builds a dataset with parallel mapping and Keras normalization.

    Args:
      data: Input numpy data.
      mean: A tf.Tensor representing the mean.
      std: A tf.Tensor representing the standard deviation.
      num_parallel_calls: Number of parallel calls for dataset mapping.

    Returns:
      A tf.data.Dataset object.
    """

    norm_layer = create_keras_norm_layer(mean, std)
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
    dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: normalize_image_keras(x, norm_layer),
                          num_parallel_calls=num_parallel_calls)
    return dataset

# Example usage:
keras_normalized_dataset = build_dataset_keras_normalization(dummy_data, mean, std)
for normalized_image in keras_normalized_dataset.take(1):
    print(f"First Keras normalized image: {normalized_image.numpy()}")
```
This approach utilizes the Keras layer, but crucially, it ensures the layer is pre-initialized with the correct statistics. The `adapt` method forces the normalization layer to set its scale and offset using our previously calculated stats. This ensures that when it's used inside the map function, no training is conducted; only the pre-established normalization is applied. This method ensures the ease-of-use of Keras while avoiding errors related to inconsistent state management across parallel mapping workers.

**Recommendations:**
For effective usage, prioritize the following best practices: compute normalization statistics on a large, representative dataset to ensure the statistics are representative of the overall dataset. Always perform the computation of statistics only once, using a separate function outside the `tf.data` pipeline. When constructing the pipeline ensure that the `map_func` does not contain any trainable variables. When distributing your training to multiple GPUs or machines, ensure that all machines use the same, pre-computed parameters. Consider using `tf.data.AUTOTUNE` for optimal performance. Finally, during testing, it may be prudent to check the actual output from the pipeline to verify if the expected transformation has occurred. The methods described here will allow you to correctly apply normalization to your datasets without engaging eager execution and avoid the errors related to data pipeline inconsistencies.
