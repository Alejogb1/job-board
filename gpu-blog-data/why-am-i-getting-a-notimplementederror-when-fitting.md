The `NotImplementedError` during TensorFlow Keras model fitting typically stems from a mismatch between the model's expected input data format and the actual data provided.  Over my years working on large-scale machine learning projects, I've encountered this issue countless times, often tracing it back to subtle discrepancies in data preprocessing or layer configurations.  This error doesn't inherently signal a fatal flaw in your model architecture; rather, it highlights a crucial incompatibility between your data and the chosen training methodology.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The `NotImplementedError` in this context rarely arises from a fundamental coding error within TensorFlow itself.  TensorFlow's core functionality is rigorously tested.  Instead, the error usually indicates that a specific operation within the fitting process – such as calculating gradients or applying an optimizer – isn't supported for the given input type or model structure.  This often manifests when dealing with custom layers, unusual data types (e.g., non-numeric features directly fed into a dense layer), or improperly formatted input tensors.  The error doesn't provide explicit details about *where* the incompatibility lies; it only signifies that the requested operation is undefined within the current context.  Thorough examination of your data preprocessing pipeline, layer definitions, and the `fit` method's arguments is essential for diagnosis.

A frequent culprit is an inconsistency between the expected shape of input tensors and the shape of your training data.  Each layer in your Keras model expects a specific input shape.  Failure to adhere to this specification, even by a single dimension, can result in the `NotImplementedError`.  Another common cause is the use of custom layers or loss functions that haven't been properly implemented to handle the gradient calculations required during backpropagation.  Finally,  incompatible data types (e.g., attempting to feed string data to a layer expecting numerical data without appropriate preprocessing) frequently lead to this error.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Input Shape:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),  # Expecting 10 features
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Incorrect input shape: only 5 features instead of 10
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 5))  
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, 1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1) #Raises NotImplementedError
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates a common mistake: the `input_shape` parameter in the first `Dense` layer is set to `(10,)`, indicating that the model expects input tensors with 10 features.  However, `x_train` only provides 5 features per sample.  This mismatch leads to an internal error during the calculation of gradients, resulting in the `NotImplementedError`.  Correcting this requires ensuring that `x_train` has the appropriate shape:  `(100, 10)` in this case.

**Example 2:  Custom Layer without Gradient Calculation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.sin(inputs)  # No gradient information defined

model = keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, 1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1) #Raises NotImplementedError or similar error during backprop
```

**Commentary:** This code defines a custom layer (`MyCustomLayer`) that calculates the sine of the input. However, the `call` method doesn't provide any mechanism for calculating gradients.  Backpropagation requires gradient information for every layer, enabling the optimizer to update weights.  To rectify this, you must implement a custom gradient calculation using the `tf.custom_gradient` decorator or rely on TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities by using operations that TensorFlow can automatically differentiate.  Simple mathematical operations are usually automatically differentiable, complex custom logic may require explicit gradient definitions.


**Example 3:  Incompatible Data Type:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Incorrect data type: strings instead of numbers
x_train = np.array(['a', 'b', 'c'] * 33).reshape(100,1)
x_train = np.tile(x_train, (1,10)) # expand the array so it matches expected dims
y_train = tf.random.normal((100, 1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1) #Raises ValueError or TypeError, potentially masked by NotImplementedError
```

**Commentary:** This example attempts to feed string data (`x_train`) into a `Dense` layer. Numerical data is expected. This will lead to a `ValueError` or `TypeError` during tensor conversion; it may manifest as a `NotImplementedError` depending on TensorFlow's error handling.  Appropriate preprocessing is needed to convert the strings into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding or embedding).  Always ensure your data is in a format compatible with the chosen layers before feeding it to the model.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on Keras and custom layers, is invaluable.  A good understanding of linear algebra and calculus is crucial for debugging issues related to gradient calculations.  Consult reputable machine learning textbooks for a comprehensive grasp of the underlying principles.  Studying examples of custom Keras layers will illuminate how to correctly implement differentiable custom operations.  Mastering NumPy for efficient data manipulation is highly beneficial.  Debugging tools provided by TensorFlow can help pinpoint the source of errors.
