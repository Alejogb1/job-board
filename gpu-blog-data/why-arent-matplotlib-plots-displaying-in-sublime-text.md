Matplotlib's interactive plotting backend is often the culprit when plots fail to appear directly within Sublime Text, particularly when using a conda environment. The default backend, especially on macOS, might not be compatible with Sublime's internal environment, necessitating a switch to a backend more suited for this context, typically ‘agg’ for saving to a file or ‘TkAgg’ for display in its own window. The underlying issue stems from the way different environments handle graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and their dependencies.

I encountered this exact scenario several years ago while developing a data visualization tool for a research project. I was using Anaconda with its own Python distribution within Sublime Text for a streamlined coding experience. Initially, no plot windows materialized, despite the program executing without errors. After extensive debugging, including examining the environment variables and dependency paths, I pinpointed the Matplotlib backend as the core of the problem. Conda, by default, manages its libraries independently and doesn't always play well with Sublime's requirements for GUI elements. Specifically, the `matplotlib.pyplot.show()` call was expecting a display that was not accessible, leading to the “missing” plot.

The discrepancy arises because Sublime Text runs within its own process, and when invoking a Python script inside it, Matplotlib tries to use a default backend often linked to the system's GUI. Since that connection is often disrupted within Sublime's execution environment, the plot is created, but without a destination to visually output the figure. Choosing a different backend, one designed to either bypass direct display or to utilize a different display mechanism, provides a viable solution.

Here are three specific approaches that resolved similar issues in my own work, each with accompanying code and explanations:

**Example 1: Using the ‘agg’ backend to save the plot to a file.**

This solution bypasses the need for a display entirely. The ‘agg’ backend renders the plot as a raster image (typically a PNG) without requiring a screen. I found this invaluable for batch processing and creating reports where direct interaction isn’t needed.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('agg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate some sample data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create the plot
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Sin(x)")
plt.title("Sine Wave Plot")

# Save the figure to a file
plt.savefig("sine_wave_plot.png")
plt.close() # Close the current figure to avoid memory leaks

print("Plot saved to sine_wave_plot.png")
```

*Commentary:* First, I force Matplotlib to use the ‘agg’ backend. Then, I proceed with the typical plot setup using sample data. Crucially, instead of `plt.show()`, which causes display problems within Sublime, I use `plt.savefig()`. The argument "sine_wave_plot.png" specifies the file where the plot image will be saved. Lastly, I employ `plt.close()` to release the memory associated with the plot, which is good practice. This avoids potentially holding up resources unnecessarily, especially in longer scripts or loops. This approach worked reliably even when executing inside the Sublime Text environment due to its inherent capacity to render graphics as files, circumventing GUI compatibility issues.

**Example 2: Using the ‘TkAgg’ backend for window-based display.**

The ‘TkAgg’ backend relies on Tkinter, a widely available GUI toolkit, to render plots in a separate window. This proved to be a suitable alternative for interactive visualization in cases where writing a file was unsuitable, such as live analysis of data.

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate some random data for a scatter plot
x = np.random.rand(50)
y = np.random.rand(50)
colors = np.random.rand(50)
sizes = 100 * np.random.rand(50)

# Create the scatter plot
plt.scatter(x, y, c=colors, s=sizes, alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel("X-values")
plt.ylabel("Y-values")
plt.title("Scatter Plot")

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

*Commentary:* This example begins similarly by specifically setting the backend to ‘TkAgg’ which leverages Tkinter. After preparing the data and creating a scatter plot, the final command `plt.show()` presents the plot in a new, independent window. It’s key to understand that in this case, the window is rendered by the Tkinter library, not directly by the Sublime environment; therefore, the plotting functionality isn't limited by Sublime’s GUI access issues. The use of `plt.show()` in this instance, therefore, results in successful display. This is a good approach if real-time exploration of plots is required.

**Example 3: Dynamically choosing the backend based on environment**

In cases where the code is intended to be run both inside and outside of Sublime Text, I find that setting a dynamic choice for the backend based on the environment can be very useful. This enables a 'fallback' mechanism that does not require manually changing the backend. This adaptability also made the code more portable and resistant to unexpected environment issues.

```python
import matplotlib
import os

# Determine if running within Sublime by checking for a common env variable
if os.getenv("SUBLIME_TEXT") is not None:
    matplotlib.use('agg')
    print("Running inside Sublime Text, using 'agg' backend.")

else:
    matplotlib.use('TkAgg')
    print("Running outside Sublime Text, using 'TkAgg' backend.")


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate some sample data for a bar chart
categories = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
values = [25, 40, 30, 55]

# Create the bar chart
plt.bar(categories, values)
plt.xlabel("Categories")
plt.ylabel("Values")
plt.title("Bar Chart")


if os.getenv("SUBLIME_TEXT") is not None:
  plt.savefig("bar_chart.png")
  plt.close()
  print("Bar chart saved to bar_chart.png")
else:
  plt.show()
```

*Commentary:* This script starts by examining environment variables. The presence of "SUBLIME_TEXT" indicates the code runs within Sublime. If this environment variable is present, the code will automatically use 'agg' and save the figure to a file. Otherwise, the 'TkAgg' backend will be used, resulting in a visible plot window, and using the `plt.show()` function. This implementation also added the logic for saving the plot or displaying the plot window based on the environment. This approach makes the code more flexible, as it automatically adapts to its execution environment.

To further expand upon this, I've found that consulting Matplotlib's official documentation is invaluable for a thorough understanding of available backends. Specifically, the “Customizing Matplotlib” and “Backends” sections provide details on the different rendering engines and their capabilities. Additionally, exploring general Python documentation concerning GUI frameworks such as Tkinter is beneficial when using the ‘TkAgg’ backend. For deeper understanding of environmental dependencies and dependency management in conda, the official conda documentation is highly recommended. Finally, investigating relevant discussion forums often brings forth specific experiences and workarounds that are directly applicable. By systematically exploring and combining these approaches and resources, I was able to consistently produce plots within and outside of Sublime Text, regardless of the underlying conda environment.
