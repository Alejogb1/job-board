Directly leveraging a computer's integrated GPU for C program compilation is not a standard practice.  Compilers primarily utilize the CPU for their complex tasks, including parsing, optimization, and code generation.  The GPU, while excellent at parallel computation, lacks the instruction set architecture and control flow mechanisms necessary for the compilation process itself.  However, the GPU *can* be utilized for executing parts of the compiled program, particularly those exhibiting significant data parallelism.  This requires specific programming techniques and libraries.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects at a national laboratory extensively involved optimizing code for GPU acceleration, and I'll detail the approaches I found most effective.

1. **Understanding the Limitations and Opportunities:**

The core challenge lies in the fundamental difference between compilation and execution. Compilation transforms human-readable source code into machine-readable instructions for the CPU.  The GPU, being a specialized co-processor, has its own instruction set (e.g., CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs, OpenCL for a wider range of architectures).  Therefore, directly compiling a C program *onto* the GPU isn't feasible.  Instead, we can leverage the GPU to accelerate specific computationally intensive sections of a pre-compiled C program. This necessitates identifying those sections and rewriting them using a suitable parallel computing framework.

2. **Parallel Programming Frameworks for GPU Acceleration:**

The most common methods for GPU acceleration within a C program involve CUDA (NVIDIA GPUs) and OpenCL (cross-platform).  These frameworks provide APIs for managing data transfer between the CPU and GPU, launching kernels (functions executing on the GPU), and managing memory allocation on the GPU.  Choosing between CUDA and OpenCL depends on your hardware and portability requirements.  CUDA offers potentially better performance on NVIDIA hardware due to its tighter integration, but OpenCL's cross-platform compatibility can be beneficial for broader deployment.

3. **Code Examples and Commentary:**

The examples below illustrate how to leverage CUDA for GPU acceleration.  OpenCL examples would follow a similar structure, but with different API calls.  Assume a scenario requiring matrix multiplication, a highly parallelizable task.

**Example 1:  Basic CUDA Matrix Multiplication (Simplified):**

```c
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Kernel function to perform matrix multiplication on the GPU
__global__ void matrixMultiplyKernel(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int width) {
  int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

  if (row < width && col < width) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int k = 0; k < width; ++k) {
      sum += A[row * width + k] * B[k * width + col];
    }
    C[row * width + col] = sum;
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation, data initialization on CPU and GPU, kernel launch, result retrieval) ...
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:**  This example showcases the fundamental structure. The `__global__` keyword designates `matrixMultiplyKernel` as a kernel function to be executed on the GPU.  The code handles the calculation of a single element of the resulting matrix `C`. The `blockIdx`, `blockDim`, and `threadIdx` variables provide information about the thread's position within the GPU's execution grid.  Crucial steps (memory management, kernel launch parameters) are omitted for brevity but are essential for a functioning program.


**Example 2:  Improved CUDA Matrix Multiplication (with Shared Memory):**

```c
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void matrixMultiplyKernel(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int width) {
  // ... (Shared memory usage for faster access to data) ...
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation, data initialization, kernel launch with optimized parameters) ...
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This improved version utilizes shared memory, a faster memory space within the GPU.  Shared memory is crucial for optimizing performance, especially for smaller matrices where the overhead of global memory access becomes significant.  Efficient use of shared memory requires careful organization of thread execution and data access patterns.

**Example 3:  Error Handling and Advanced CUDA features:**

```c
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  cudaError_t err;
  // ... (Memory allocation and initialization) ...

  err = cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, size); // Allocate memory on GPU
  if(err != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    return 1;
  }

  // ... (Kernel launch and error checking after each CUDA API call) ...

  err = cudaFree(d_A); // Free GPU memory
  if(err != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** Robust error handling is vital in CUDA programming.  Each CUDA API call can return an error code; meticulously checking for errors is essential to avoid unexpected crashes or incorrect results.  This example shows how to use `cudaGetErrorString` for informative error messages.  More sophisticated error handling might involve retry mechanisms or alternative execution paths.


4. **Resource Recommendations:**

To delve deeper into GPU programming using CUDA or OpenCL, I strongly recommend consulting the official documentation provided by NVIDIA and the Khronos Group, respectively.  Furthermore, textbooks on parallel computing and high-performance computing are invaluable resources.  Finally, exploring online courses and tutorials focusing on CUDA and OpenCL programming will greatly enhance practical understanding.  Supplement this with practical exercises to solidify your grasp on the material. These resources offer detailed explanations of concepts, best practices, and advanced techniques beyond the scope of this response.  Remember that performance optimization often requires profiling and iterative refinement of your code.  Understanding the specifics of GPU architecture and memory hierarchy is critical for writing efficient GPU kernels.
