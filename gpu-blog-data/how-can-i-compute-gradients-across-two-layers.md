In TensorFlow, efficient gradient computation across multiple layers, particularly when leveraging pre-computed gradients from an earlier layer, requires understanding how the framework tracks operations within its computation graph. Specifically, we cannot directly access and reuse gradients calculated in a previous backward pass; TensorFlow does not store these. Instead, we work with the chain rule of calculus, where the gradient of an output with respect to a specific input is the product of gradients computed across sequential operations. To achieve our objective, we must manually orchestrate this gradient calculation, controlling where gradients are accumulated, and applying specific functions or losses at desired points.

The typical TensorFlow workflow involves defining a model using operations (layers, activation functions, etc.), defining a loss function, and then using an optimizer's `minimize()` method on this loss which triggers the backward pass. This automatic differentiation process populates the gradient tensors of every trainable variable, which we can then subsequently examine. However, for more intricate manipulations, especially scenarios where we wish to extract intermediate gradients (gradients with respect to outputs of a specific layer) and use them as inputs to further computation, we must employ TensorFlow's `tf.GradientTape`.

The `tf.GradientTape` records the operations we perform inside its context, and enables the calculation of gradients using the recorded operations. When we wish to compute gradients with respect to specific intermediary tensor outputs, we need to have these tensors within the tape's context. The critical aspect is the 'watch' mechanism: to compute the gradient of some variable ‘y’ with respect to another variable ‘x’, we must ensure that ‘x’ is “watched” by tape, allowing TensorFlow to track its interactions during forward pass and compute the derivative in backward pass. Without explicitly “watching” it, we cannot get the gradient with respect to that variable.

Let's explore how we can compute gradients across two layers, using the gradient of the first layer as input to calculate the gradient of the second. Here is the first illustrative example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume a simple two-layer model
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
layer1_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((2, 3)), dtype=tf.float32)
layer2_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((3, 2)), dtype=tf.float32)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(input_tensor) # Explicitly watch input_tensor

    # Layer 1 forward pass
    layer1_output = tf.matmul(input_tensor, layer1_weights)

    # Layer 2 forward pass
    layer2_output = tf.matmul(layer1_output, layer2_weights)
    
    # Define the loss
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(layer2_output) # Simple example loss, can be any valid loss

# Compute gradients of the loss with respect to the outputs of the first layer and also the weights of second layer
grads = tape.gradient(loss, [layer1_output, layer2_weights])
layer1_output_grad, layer2_weights_grad = grads


print("Gradient of Loss wrt Layer 1 output:", layer1_output_grad)
print("Gradient of Loss wrt Layer 2 weights:", layer2_weights_grad)
```

In this initial example, the crucial aspect is `tape.watch(input_tensor)`. We are interested in the gradient of layer 1 outputs, so it is imperative that the forward path to calculate them be recorded in tape and input tensor is watched, as the output is a result of the operations of the tape in which `input_tensor` is involved. Subsequently, using `tape.gradient()`, we obtain `layer1_output_grad` which represents the gradients of the loss with respect to the layer 1 outputs, and `layer2_weights_grad` which contains the gradients with respect to the weights of the second layer. Note that TensorFlow automatically calculates the gradient of the loss by applying the chain rule, by backpropagating the gradient.  The loss, in this simple case, is the sum of outputs of layer 2.

The next example demonstrates a scenario where we wish to use `layer1_output_grad` to influence subsequent gradient calculation, which emulates cases like having different training objectives for different layers, which is quite frequent during complex training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Reusing model from previous example.

input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
layer1_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((2, 3)), dtype=tf.float32)
layer2_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((3, 2)), dtype=tf.float32)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape1:
    tape1.watch(input_tensor) # explicitly watch input_tensor
    layer1_output = tf.matmul(input_tensor, layer1_weights)
    # Loss 1 could be a regularization loss on layer1_output for example
    loss1 = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(layer1_output))
layer1_output_grad = tape1.gradient(loss1, layer1_output)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape2:
    layer2_output = tf.matmul(layer1_output, layer2_weights)
    # Combine outputs with gradient of layer 1 output for a composite loss function
    loss2 = tf.reduce_sum(layer2_output) + tf.reduce_sum(layer1_output_grad * layer2_output)

# Calculate the gradients of loss2 with respect to layer2 weights 
layer2_weights_grad_2 = tape2.gradient(loss2, layer2_weights)
    
print("Gradient of Layer 1 output wrt loss1", layer1_output_grad)
print("Gradient of Layer 2 weights wrt modified loss2:", layer2_weights_grad_2)
```

Here, we compute `layer1_output_grad` using a specific loss function within `tape1`. Then, in `tape2`, we combine the output of layer 2 and the *gradient* from layer 1, resulting in a modified loss function `loss2`. This approach lets us utilize computed gradients and include them in the computation of gradients of the subsequent layer by including them inside the tape as inputs. This method gives us fine-grained control over how gradients across layers are calculated and how they affect each other in the calculation of gradients of following layers, effectively implementing techniques that are hard to achieve with standard, automated back-propagation.

Finally, let's consider an example where we use the gradient of the first layer’s output as input to a custom layer which further influences the second layer’s gradient:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Reusing model from previous examples.

input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
layer1_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((2, 3)), dtype=tf.float32)
layer2_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((3, 2)), dtype=tf.float32)

def custom_layer(layer1_grad_input, layer2_input):
    # custom function/layer which uses gradient of layer 1's output.
    #  For this example, we will just multiply it by layer 2 input
    return tf.matmul(layer1_grad_input, layer2_input)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape3:
    tape3.watch(input_tensor)
    layer1_output = tf.matmul(input_tensor, layer1_weights)
    # Use previous gradient to modify the calculation of layer2's output
with tf.GradientTape() as tape4:
    layer1_output_grad_3 = tape3.gradient(tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(layer1_output)), layer1_output)
    layer2_input = tf.matmul(layer1_output, layer2_weights)
    modified_layer2_output = custom_layer(layer1_output_grad_3, layer2_input)
    loss3 = tf.reduce_sum(modified_layer2_output)

# Compute the gradient of the modified output with respect to weights of layer2
layer2_weights_grad_3 = tape4.gradient(loss3, layer2_weights)

print("Gradient of Layer 1 output wrt loss1", layer1_output_grad_3)
print("Gradient of Layer 2 weights wrt modified loss3", layer2_weights_grad_3)
```

In this last case, we introduce a `custom_layer` that takes the gradient of layer 1's output, and combines it with layer 2's output through matrix multiplication. This gives us an intermediary, custom transformation for the calculation of the final loss function. By employing this architecture, we can implement a wide range of transformations using our calculated intermediary gradients.

In essence, these examples showcase that gradients computed during one pass are not directly reused in the automatic differentiation process of successive passes. Instead, they need to be calculated using the `tf.GradientTape`, watched properly and can be used as inputs during successive passes to modify, adjust, or influence the calculation of gradients of following layers, which offers substantial control in the manipulation of gradient signals.

For continued learning, I recommend exploring resources like the official TensorFlow documentation on automatic differentiation and GradientTape, which provides detailed explanations and further use cases. Also, studying research papers related to meta-learning, or techniques like gradient surgery and multi-objective learning, will offer real world context to this powerful capability of the framework. Finally, exploring tutorials and examples related to adversarial training will demonstrate effective use of the gradient manipulation techniques presented here. These resources collectively cover the foundational, practical, and advanced application aspects, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the gradient computation and its role in complex model architectures.
