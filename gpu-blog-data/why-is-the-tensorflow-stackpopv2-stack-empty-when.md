The observed behavior of `tf.raw_ops.StackPopV2` resulting in an empty stack despite previous pushes arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of how this low-level operation interacts with TensorFlow's execution model, specifically within graphs. It doesn't maintain a global, persistent stack across different executions but rather operates on a stack that’s scoped to the specific execution context it’s called within. The `StackV2` family of operations, in particular, is heavily tied to the idea of executing a single graph, and the stack itself is not a persistent, inter-session entity. Instead, it behaves more akin to a temporary workspace within a graph’s execution.

A `tf.raw_ops.Stack` operation constructs a stack that's explicitly meant to exist only within the scope of its defining graph execution. This means when `StackPushV2` and `StackPopV2` operations are executed, they're referencing and manipulating this particular execution context's stack. After that specific computation is finished, the created stack and its data are not preserved. Any subsequent graph execution that references the same stack tensor won't inherently inherit the previous state unless explicitly arranged, which typically involves feeding tensor data as inputs.

The issue likely isn’t that the *pop* operation is failing per se, but that the state the *pop* is expecting isn't being provided. When a new computation graph is created and run, the `StackPopV2` operation will access a newly created stack, implicitly, that will begin empty because its lifecycle is tied to the current graph's execution. The data previously stored on the stack by a prior graph execution does not persist. Therefore, any attempt to pop from this stack will invariably return an empty result because the stack itself is an ephemeral construct rather than a persistent, shared resource. This understanding is critical to using these low-level operations correctly. They are building blocks for higher-level abstractions, such as recurrent networks, and aren't designed to be directly manipulated without understanding their context within graph executions.

Let’s consider several scenarios using actual code to illustrate this principle.

**Example 1: Pop on a Newly Created Stack**

This example demonstrates the most common situation where the stack appears to be empty when a pop operation is performed.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a new stack tensor.
stack_tensor = tf.raw_ops.StackV2(max_size=10, elem_type=tf.int32)

# Attempt to pop from the stack.
pop_result = tf.raw_ops.StackPopV2(stack_tensor, elem_type=tf.int32)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  print(sess.run(pop_result))
```

In this code, I create a stack using `StackV2` and then immediately try to pop from it using `StackPopV2`. Because I never pushed any elements onto this newly initialized stack, the `pop_result` is undefined and will likely raise an error if attempting to access the result as if it had a value, even though the output tensor *itself* is valid. The important takeaway is, the stack exists *only* for the computation of that specific graph execution; it's neither persistent nor shared. If you were to add a push operation here, it would function as you expect. But each time you create a new stack tensor like this, it starts empty.

**Example 2: Push and Pop in the Same Graph Execution**

To illustrate how to use it correctly, this example will demonstrate a push followed by a pop, all within the same execution context.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a new stack tensor.
stack_tensor = tf.raw_ops.StackV2(max_size=10, elem_type=tf.int32)

# Push some data onto the stack.
push_result = tf.raw_ops.StackPushV2(stack_tensor, tf.constant(10, dtype=tf.int32))

# Pop the value from the stack.
pop_result = tf.raw_ops.StackPopV2(push_result, elem_type=tf.int32)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  popped_value = sess.run(pop_result)
  print(popped_value)
```

Here, `StackPushV2` operation pushes a `tf.constant(10)` onto the stack. Crucially, the *result* of this operation, which represents the *modified* stack, becomes the input to `StackPopV2`. This ensures that the `StackPopV2` operates on the stack *after* the data has been added. Notice how the intermediate tensor `push_result` is necessary, as `stack_tensor` itself has not been modified *in place*, and the push operation produces a copy of the original stack with the change applied. The output will be 10, demonstrating a proper push and pop within the same graph execution. This example clarifies the dependency on a graph execution's lifecycle. The stack is not modified in place but rather creates new tensors representing the modified stack after each operation.

**Example 3: Push in One Execution, Pop in Another**

This example demonstrates the situation most likely to cause confusion by attempting to utilize the stack outside the scope of its initial creation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a stack and push a value.
stack_tensor = tf.raw_ops.StackV2(max_size=10, elem_type=tf.int32)
push_result = tf.raw_ops.StackPushV2(stack_tensor, tf.constant(20, dtype=tf.int32))

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(push_result) # Push occurs during the execution of the first graph

# Create a new graph and attempt to pop from what *appears* to be the same stack.
pop_result = tf.raw_ops.StackPopV2(stack_tensor, elem_type=tf.int32)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess2:
  print(sess2.run(pop_result))
```

In this example, the stack is initialized and an integer pushed within the context of the first `tf.compat.v1.Session`. Critically, when a *new* session (and by extension, a new graph) is created, even though the `pop_result` refers to the `stack_tensor` created earlier, it’s treated as a *new* stack within that session's execution context. Therefore, when the second session executes the pop operation, it encounters a stack that was just initialized, hence its lack of content. The output would likely error because it is an attempted read from a tensor with no data, as the stack is implicitly empty. This is the root cause of the perceived "empty stack" issue when popping and highlights the limitation of stacks with regard to persistence outside of graph execution.

In conclusion, `tf.raw_ops.StackPopV2` returns what seems to be an empty stack when executed because the stacks are not persistent entities across different graph executions. The state of the stack is contained solely within the context of a particular graph execution. Each time a new graph is executed, new stack tensors are created and any data from previous executions will not be inherited. Consequently, data manipulation must occur within the same graph execution to function correctly. The `StackV2` family of operations is tightly coupled with the concept of a graph execution. It’s essential to structure TensorFlow computations so that all related `StackPushV2` and `StackPopV2` operations occur in the same execution, typically by chaining the tensor outputs.

For deeper exploration of how graph execution works and the intended use cases for the `StackV2` family, I recommend consulting the TensorFlow documentation on control flow and stateful operations. Specifically, resources focusing on graph execution and low-level primitives will illuminate this behavior. Detailed examinations of the TensorFlow implementation of recurrent layers are often helpful, as they typically are constructed using such primitives. Textbooks on deep learning that delve into implementation details of such operations may provide additional context. Understanding these finer points is crucial when building custom layers that rely on stateful behavior and when debugging code using low-level TensorFlow components.
