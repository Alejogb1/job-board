The core issue with Altair tooltip failures upon data point selection often stems from a mismatch between the data structure accessed by the visualization and the data structure expected by the tooltip configuration.  Over the years, while working on interactive data dashboards and exploratory data analysis tools, I've encountered this problem repeatedly. It usually manifests as either no tooltip appearing at all, a tooltip displaying incorrect values, or an outright error message.  The root cause invariably lies in how Altair handles data binding and the nuances of its selection mechanisms.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Altair's declarative nature is powerful but requires careful attention to data binding.  When you select data points, Altair essentially filters the underlying data based on the selection. The tooltip, however, needs to access the *original* data associated with the selected point, not just the filtered subset.  If the tooltip specification directly references fields that are absent in the filtered data – due to either aggregation or filtering – the tooltip will fail.  Furthermore, Altair's selection mechanism doesn't automatically propagate the original data context to the tooltip; you must explicitly ensure this mapping. This is often overlooked, especially when dealing with complex datasets or interactive selections.

Another common reason for failure is inconsistent data types. If your tooltip references a field expecting a numeric type, but the selection process inadvertently alters that field's type (e.g., through string concatenation within a transform), the tooltip will be unable to render correctly.  Finally, incorrect encoding of data within the original dataset can propagate into tooltip errors, even before any interaction. This might involve missing values, incorrect data types, or inconsistent formatting.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Binding Leading to Tooltip Failure:**

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], 'label': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']})

# Incorrect: Tooltip references 'label' which might be filtered out by selection
chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
    x='x:Q',
    y='y:Q',
    tooltip=['x', 'y', 'label']
).interactive()

chart.display() # This might show tooltips inconsistently or fail completely, especially with selections.
```

In this example, if a selection mechanism filters out certain data points, the `label` field might be absent in the filtered dataset.  The tooltip, attempting to access `label`, will fail.  To correct this, we need to explicitly bind the tooltip to the original data.


**Example 2: Correct Data Binding Using Selection and Transform:**

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], 'label': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']})

# Correct: Using selection and a data transform to maintain original data context
selection = alt.selection_single(on='mouseover', fields=['x'])

chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
    x='x:Q',
    y='y:Q',
    tooltip=['x', 'y', 'label']
).add_selection(selection).transform_filter(selection)

chart.display() # Tooltips should now work consistently.
```

This revised code uses `alt.selection_single` to select points on mouseover.  Crucially, the `transform_filter(selection)` ensures that only the selected data point is highlighted and passed to the tooltip. Because the tooltip references the original data columns, it functions even after selection.


**Example 3: Data Type Inconsistency Affecting Tooltips:**

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'y': ['10A', '20B', '30C', '40D', '50E']})

# Incorrect: 'y' is a string, tooltip expects a number
chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
    x='x:Q',
    y=alt.Y('y:Q',type='quantitative'), # Explicit type declaration, likely to fail.
    tooltip=['x', 'y']
).interactive()

chart.display()  # This will probably fail because 'y' isn't purely numeric.
```

Here, the `y` column in the original dataset is a string, not a number as implied by the chart and tooltip specification.  Altair's type inference might fail, leading to a tooltip error.  To resolve this, data cleaning and type conversion are necessary *before* creating the chart.  Proper data validation and pre-processing are essential to avoid these issues.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Altair's official documentation.  The Altair cookbook provides numerous worked examples.  Exploring various data manipulation libraries within Python, particularly pandas, will enhance your ability to prepare data for use with Altair.  Finally, reviewing the error messages carefully – Altair's error messages often pinpoint the exact nature of the issue.  Systematic debugging, incrementally testing your code, helps isolate problems.
