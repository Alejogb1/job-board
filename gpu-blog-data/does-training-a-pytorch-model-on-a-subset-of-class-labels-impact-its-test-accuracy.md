Training a PyTorch model on a restricted set of class labels, while seemingly innocuous, fundamentally alters the model's learned representations and subsequent test accuracy, particularly when evaluated against the full set of classes. This outcome arises from the model optimizing its parameters based on the information available during training; it learns to discriminate between only the provided classes, potentially overlooking features that are crucial for distinguishing unseen classes. I've observed this effect consistently throughout various projects involving fine-tuning image classification models, particularly when dealing with unbalanced datasets where a deliberate subset of dominant classes was used for initial training.

The core issue is that a neural network's weights are adjusted to minimize the loss function, which is calculated based on the provided training data and labels. When you exclude certain classes during training, the model never learns to differentiate these classes from the others. The features associated with the excluded labels are often not effectively separated or, in the worst cases, they may become embedded into the representations learned for the included classes. This leads to an underfitting for the excluded classes and potential overfitting on the included classes, manifested as a drop in generalization performance when evaluated on the complete set. The model essentially learns a decision boundary in a feature space that is not representative of the full problem, thereby affecting its predictive capabilities on unseen data. This discrepancy between the training and test domain is the primary driver behind the observed decrease in test accuracy.

Consider a scenario involving an image classification task with 100 classes. During training, you use only 20 classes. This drastically modifies the output layer of your neural network. Instead of having 100 output nodes (one for each class), you have 20. The backpropagation process then adjusts the weights to minimize error relative to these 20 categories. The layers prior to the output will still learn features, but will be biased toward the 20-class classification. When you introduce data from the remaining 80 classes during testing, the output layer is now misaligned with those novel labels. While a model can sometimes capture some of the general features, that is not its main objective. It is still ultimately optimized to differentiate between the 20 classes, not the 100.

Here are some practical examples using PyTorch:

**Example 1: Defining the model and criterion with mismatched class numbers.**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Assume 20 classes for training
num_training_classes = 20
# Assume 100 total classes for testing
num_total_classes = 100

# Example model (replace with your actual model)
class SimpleClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(SimpleClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(128, num_classes)  # Fixed input size for simplicity

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

# Model initialized for the reduced class set.
model_training = SimpleClassifier(num_training_classes)

# Loss Function (Cross Entropy for multi-class classification)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model_training.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Dummy data for training, note, only contains indices between 0 to 19
training_data = torch.randn(100,128)
training_labels = torch.randint(0, num_training_classes, (100,))

# Dummy testing data with labels from 0 to 99, covering the full class set
testing_data = torch.randn(50, 128)
testing_labels = torch.randint(0, num_total_classes, (50,))

#Training Step (not actually training, for demonstration only.)
optimizer.zero_grad()
outputs = model_training(training_data)
loss = criterion(outputs, training_labels)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

# Evaluation step. The shape of model output does not match the test labels
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model_training(testing_data)
    # This line will cause an error
    # test_loss = criterion(outputs, testing_labels)
    _, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)
    accuracy = (predicted == testing_labels).sum().item() / len(testing_labels)
    print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)


```
Here, the model is trained with a smaller output size and a limited selection of labels. The test labels contain indices for 100 classes, so directly passing the testing labels to the criterion after the training with limited labels will result in errors. While the final evaluation portion is commented out to avoid the error, it reveals that the model’s last linear layer and the test labels are incompatible. A model trained like this will not be able to correctly classify samples from the held-out 80 classes, resulting in significantly lower accuracy.

**Example 2:  Illustrating the need for modification for evaluation (but not a solution).**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

num_training_classes = 20
num_total_classes = 100

class SimpleClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(SimpleClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(128, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)


model_training = SimpleClassifier(num_training_classes)

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model_training.parameters(), lr=0.001)


training_data = torch.randn(100,128)
training_labels = torch.randint(0, num_training_classes, (100,))

testing_data = torch.randn(50, 128)
testing_labels = torch.randint(0, num_total_classes, (50,))

optimizer.zero_grad()
outputs = model_training(training_data)
loss = criterion(outputs, training_labels)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()


with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model_training(testing_data)
    _, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)
    # Here we artificially make a mapping by taking mod with the training classes
    # This is not correct, but will allow for evaluation on a set of classes.
    mapped_labels = testing_labels % num_training_classes
    accuracy = (predicted == mapped_labels).sum().item() / len(testing_labels)
    print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)
```
This example attempts to perform an evaluation by mapping the test labels onto the trained labels via the modulo operation. While it avoids an error and gives a score, the accuracy metric here is fundamentally flawed. The model is still unable to predict the actual test labels since those aren't within its predicted range. This manipulation masks the core problem of the model learning limited class distinctions during training, therefore not offering a proper assessment of its performance. The score is meaningless due to the label mapping.

**Example 3: Demonstrating an alternative approach with a new model, though inefficient.**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

num_training_classes = 20
num_total_classes = 100

class SimpleClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(SimpleClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(128, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model_training = SimpleClassifier(num_training_classes)
model_testing = SimpleClassifier(num_total_classes)
# Note this is not the correct way, it is for demonstration purposes.

model_testing.load_state_dict(model_training.state_dict())

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model_training.parameters(), lr=0.001)


training_data = torch.randn(100,128)
training_labels = torch.randint(0, num_training_classes, (100,))

testing_data = torch.randn(50, 128)
testing_labels = torch.randint(0, num_total_classes, (50,))

optimizer.zero_grad()
outputs = model_training(training_data)
loss = criterion(outputs, training_labels)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()


with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model_testing(testing_data)
    _, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)
    accuracy = (predicted == testing_labels).sum().item() / len(testing_labels)
    print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

Here, we try to address the compatibility issue by creating a new model with an output layer matching the total number of classes and loading the weights of the training model. It does allow for evaluation without error. This approach, however, is not ideal. It bypasses the core training limitation and only copies the learned features to a different model. This is not the desired outcome since the final layer of the new model has not been trained on new data or labels. This again emphasizes the issue that model is not trained with sufficient labels.

Based on my experience, a more appropriate course of action would involve using a consistent class label set for both training and evaluation, or considering more sophisticated techniques like transfer learning or fine-tuning with a broader set of classes. If limited class labels are desired in training, then either that must also be the focus of the evaluation, or there must be an additional transfer learning/fine-tuning phase with a full set of labels. Strategies like few-shot learning, where models are trained to quickly generalize to new classes with limited examples, can also be utilized when dealing with problems where the full set of classes are unavailable during training.

For further reading, resources covering concepts like “transfer learning,” "fine-tuning,” "domain adaptation," and "multi-class classification" are highly recommended. Additionally, materials on “model evaluation” and "dataset bias" are essential for understanding the implications of these scenarios. Books on deep learning and practical applications, as well as documentation for specific libraries in PyTorch, will also be beneficial in understanding the effects of limiting class labels during model training.
