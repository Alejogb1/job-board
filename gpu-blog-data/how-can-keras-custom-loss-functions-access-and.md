Custom loss functions in Keras require careful handling of tensor manipulation to leverage intermediate computation results effectively.  My experience optimizing a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) for medical image synthesis highlighted the crucial role of direct tensor access within custom loss functions to achieve stable training and improved performance metrics.  Specifically, understanding the tensor structure and leveraging Keras's backend functionalities is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras custom loss functions are defined as Python functions that accept two arguments: `y_true` (the ground truth tensor) and `y_pred` (the predicted tensor).  These tensors are typically multi-dimensional arrays representing the target and output values, respectively.  Direct access and manipulation within the loss function allow for computations beyond simple element-wise comparisons. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex loss landscapes or when incorporating additional regularization terms dependent on intermediate layer activations or gradients.  Crucially, operations within the custom loss function must be compatible with TensorFlow or Theano (depending on Keras's backend), ensuring automatic differentiation for gradient calculations during backpropagation. This necessitates using functions from the Keras backend (e.g., `K.mean`, `K.sum`, `K.square`) rather than native NumPy functions.  Failure to do so will lead to errors during the training process, as the automatic differentiation process will not correctly calculate gradients.

Accessing specific elements or slices of the tensors involves standard tensor indexing.  However, broadcasting rules must be carefully considered to avoid shape mismatches.  Similarly, operations like element-wise multiplication (`*`), addition (`+`), and subtraction (`-`) are readily available, but dimension compatibility needs to be verified.  More sophisticated manipulations might involve reshaping, transposing, or applying custom functions element-wise.  Remember that  the final output of the custom loss function must be a single scalar value representing the loss for a single batch.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Weighted Mean Squared Error with Tensor-Based Weighting:**

This example demonstrates assigning different weights to different parts of the output based on a separate weighting tensor.

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def weighted_mse(y_true, y_pred):
  """
  Weighted Mean Squared Error.  Weights are provided as a separate tensor.

  Args:
    y_true: Ground truth tensor.
    y_pred: Predicted tensor.  Assumes y_true and y_pred have the same shape.
    weights: Tensor of weights, same shape as y_true and y_pred.

  Returns:
    Weighted MSE scalar value.
  """
  weights = K.variable([[1.0, 0.5], [0.5, 1.0]]) # Example weights, replace with your logic
  diff = y_true - y_pred
  weighted_diff = diff * weights
  squared_diff = K.square(weighted_diff)
  return K.mean(squared_diff)

model.compile(loss=weighted_mse, optimizer='adam')
```

This code leverages `K.variable` to create a weight tensor within the loss function, demonstrating direct tensor manipulation and incorporating it into the MSE calculation. The weights tensor is directly multiplied element-wise with the difference between the true and predicted values before squaring and averaging.  Note that the weights tensor shape needs to match the other tensors for proper element-wise multiplication.



**Example 2:  Loss Incorporating Intermediate Layer Activations:**

This exemplifies incorporating activations from a specific layer to influence the loss function.  This would require access to the internal workings of the model.  This is generally discouraged for complex models as it breaks modularity and might be harder to debug.  For simpler models, this can provide advantages.

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Assuming 'intermediate_layer' is a layer in your model
intermediate_output = Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=model.get_layer('intermediate_layer').output)

def custom_loss_with_intermediate(y_true, y_pred):
  """
  Loss incorporating activations from an intermediate layer.

  Args:
    y_true: Ground truth tensor.
    y_pred: Predicted tensor.

  Returns:
    Custom loss scalar value.
  """
  intermediate_activations = intermediate_output(model.input)  #Access intermediate activations
  mse = K.mean(K.square(y_true - y_pred))
  activation_regularization = K.mean(K.abs(intermediate_activations)) #Example regularization, customize
  return mse + 0.1 * activation_regularization # weighting the regularization term.


model.compile(loss=custom_loss_with_intermediate, optimizer='adam')
```

Here, we explicitly extract the output from an intermediate layer using a functional API approach.  The loss function then combines the standard MSE with an L1 regularization term applied to the intermediate activations. The strength of the regularization is controlled by the weighting factor (0.1 in this case).  This method requires careful consideration of the layer's output shape and its relevance to the overall loss.


**Example 3:  Per-Pixel Loss with Contextual Information:**

This example demonstrates a loss function that varies its weighting based on context derived from the input image itself.

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K

def contextual_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Per-pixel loss with context-dependent weighting.

    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth tensor (shape: [batch_size, height, width, channels]).
        y_pred: Predicted tensor (same shape as y_true).

    Returns:
        Contextual loss scalar value.
    """
    # Example: Weighting based on the magnitude of y_true (adjust as needed)
    weights = K.abs(y_true)  
    diff = y_true - y_pred
    weighted_diff = diff * weights
    return K.mean(K.square(weighted_diff))

model.compile(loss=contextual_loss, optimizer='adam')

```

This example dynamically generates weights based on the absolute values of the ground truth tensor. Areas with larger magnitudes in `y_true` will have a stronger influence on the final loss calculation. This allows for prioritizing certain regions of the image during training.  This showcases how contextual information, directly extracted from the input, can refine loss computation at a fine-grained level.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation provides comprehensive details on custom loss functions and backend functionalities.  Study the TensorFlow or Theano documentation (depending on your Keras backend) for a deeper understanding of tensor operations and automatic differentiation.  Finally, exploring research papers focusing on advanced loss functions in deep learning can provide valuable insights and innovative approaches.


These examples and explanations should provide a solid foundation for effectively utilizing tensor values within Keras custom loss functions. Remember that proper understanding of tensor shapes, broadcasting rules, and the Keras backend is crucial for success.  Always thoroughly test and validate custom loss functions to ensure correctness and stability during training.  Careful consideration of computational complexity is also essential, especially when dealing with large tensors or complex operations.
