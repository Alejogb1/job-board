The core challenge in computing the gradient of a tensor element indirectly involved in another element's calculation lies in PyTorch's automatic differentiation mechanism and its reliance on the computational graph.  Directly accessing the gradient of an intermediate element isn't always straightforward; we need to leverage techniques that explicitly track the dependency chain.  My experience working on large-scale neural network optimization for image segmentation highlighted this precisely.  Specifically, I encountered this issue when optimizing a network where the output of one layer, influencing a subsequent loss calculation, depended on a specific, internal element of an intermediate activation tensor.

The solution hinges on understanding how PyTorch constructs the computational graph and utilizing techniques for gradient tracking during the forward and backward passes.  We cannot simply index into the `grad` attribute after a backward pass; this only provides the gradient with respect to the *leaf* tensorsâ€”those directly created and not computed from other tensors within the graph.  The intermediate element's gradient requires a more nuanced approach.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The process involves three critical steps:

* **Explicit Dependency Creation:**  We must ensure the target element's contribution to the final loss is explicitly represented within the computational graph.  Implicit dependencies, often arising from vectorized operations, are not directly tracked for individual element gradients.  This often necessitates restructuring the computation to highlight the individual element's role.

* **Gradient Accumulation:** Standard backpropagation only computes gradients for leaf nodes. To retrieve the gradient of the specific tensor element, we need to accumulate the gradient through a suitable mechanism (e.g., using intermediate variables or custom functions) such that its contribution to the overall gradient is preserved and accessible.

* **Targeted Gradient Extraction:**  Once the backward pass is complete, we can extract the accumulated gradient of the specific element, usually held within a separate tensor or variable established during the gradient accumulation step.  This might involve indexing into a temporary tensor holding the gradients of the intermediate elements or directly accessing the gradient stored through a custom autograd function.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Using Intermediate Variables**

```python
import torch

# Define a sample tensor
x = torch.randn(5, requires_grad=True)

# Target element index
target_index = 2

# Explicit dependency creation through an intermediate variable
intermediate_value = x[target_index]
y = intermediate_value * 2 + torch.sum(x)  # y depends on x[target_index]

# Loss function
loss = y.mean()

# Backward pass
loss.backward()

# Gradient extraction - the gradient of x[target_index] contributes to y's gradient, stored in x.grad[target_index]
print(f"Gradient of x[{target_index}]: {x.grad[target_index]}")
```

This example uses `intermediate_value` to explicitly highlight the dependency of `y` on `x[target_index]`.  The backpropagation correctly propagates the gradient back to `x`, and we can directly access the gradient of the specific element via indexing into `x.grad`.

**Example 2:  Custom Autograd Function**

```python
import torch

class GradientExtractor(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input_tensor, index):
        ctx.save_for_backward(input_tensor, index)
        return input_tensor[index]

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        input_tensor, index = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_input = torch.zeros_like(input_tensor)
        grad_input[index] = grad_output
        return grad_input, None

# Sample tensor
x = torch.randn(5, requires_grad=True)

# Target index
target_index = 2

# Custom function application
extractor = GradientExtractor.apply
intermediate_value = extractor(x, target_index)
y = intermediate_value * 3 + torch.sum(x) # y now depends on our custom function

loss = y.mean()
loss.backward()

print(f"Gradient using custom function: {x.grad[target_index]}")

```

This illustrates a more advanced approach using a custom autograd function. This provides greater control over gradient computation and accumulation, especially useful when dealing with complex dependencies or non-standard operations. The `backward` method specifically directs the gradient to the target element.


**Example 3:  Handling Vectorized Operations**

Let's consider a situation where the dependency isn't as explicit due to vectorization.

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(5, requires_grad=True)
weights = torch.randn(5, requires_grad=True)
target_index = 2

# Vectorized operation masking the direct dependency
weighted_sum = torch.sum(x * weights)  #  x[target_index] implicitly contributes

loss = weighted_sum.mean()
loss.backward()

#Directly accessing x.grad[target_index]  doesn't give the correct gradient.

# To find the gradient, isolate the dependency:
intermediate_value = x[target_index] * weights[target_index]
loss2 = intermediate_value.mean()
loss2.backward(retain_graph=True) #retain graph for the second backward pass


loss = torch.sum(x * weights).mean()
loss.backward()
print(f"Gradient with isolated contribution: {x.grad[target_index]}")

```

In this example, the dependency of `weighted_sum` on `x[target_index]` is masked by the vectorized operation. To correctly compute the gradient, we must explicitly isolate the contribution of `x[target_index]` as shown above.  This highlights the need for meticulous attention to how dependencies are structured within the computational graph.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The PyTorch documentation, specifically sections on automatic differentiation and custom autograd functions, are essential.  Thorough understanding of computational graphs and backpropagation is crucial.  Relevant textbooks on deep learning and optimization algorithms are also beneficial, providing the foundational mathematical context for these techniques.  Finally, actively debugging and visualizing the computational graph using PyTorch's debugging tools can significantly aid understanding in more intricate scenarios.
