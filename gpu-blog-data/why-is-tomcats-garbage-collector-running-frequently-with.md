Tomcat's frequent garbage collection cycles in the absence of user activity typically indicate memory leaks or inefficient resource management within the application deployed on the server.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous production environments points to several potential root causes, often overlooked despite seemingly straightforward application logic.  The key is to differentiate between normal garbage collection activity and pathological behavior symptomatic of underlying problems.

**1.  Memory Leaks:**  This is the most common culprit.  Memory leaks arise when objects are no longer needed by the application but remain referenced, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming their memory. This progressively consumes available heap space, triggering more frequent garbage collection cycles to mitigate the increasing pressure.  The frequency increases as the available memory shrinks, leading to longer garbage collection pauses and ultimately impacting performance.  These leaks can stem from various sources:

* **Unclosed Resources:**  Failure to close database connections, file handles, network sockets, or input streams are prevalent sources of leaks.  Even a single unclosed connection in a frequently called method can exponentially exacerbate the problem over time.

* **Static Collections:**  Improperly managed static collections, particularly `HashMaps` or other large data structures holding references to long-lived objects, can prevent garbage collection.  If objects are added to these collections without a corresponding removal mechanism, they persist indefinitely.

* **Circular References:**  Two or more objects holding references to each other, forming a cycle, can prevent the garbage collector from recognizing them as garbage, even when they are no longer reachable from the application's main thread.  This is a subtle but potentially severe issue, often requiring careful code review to identify.

* **Third-Party Libraries:**  Bugs or inefficiencies within third-party libraries can also introduce memory leaks.  This necessitates careful scrutiny of dependencies and potentially replacing suspect components with better-maintained alternatives.

**2. Inefficient Resource Management:** While not strictly memory leaks, inadequate resource management can simulate the effects.  For example, excessive creation and destruction of short-lived objects can increase the load on the garbage collector.  This is particularly problematic if these objects consume significant memory, even briefly.  Similarly, holding onto larger-than-necessary objects in the application's active memory pool will increase the garbage collector's workload.

**3.  Improper Tomcat Configuration:**  While less frequent, incorrect Tomcat configuration, specifically concerning heap size allocation, can also induce this behavior.  If the initial heap size is too small, the garbage collector will run more frequently to compensate for insufficient space.  Conversely, excessively large heap sizes, while seemingly a solution, can lead to longer garbage collection pauses.  Finding the optimal balance is crucial and depends on the application's memory footprint and resource demands.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Unclosed Database Connection:**

```java
public void processData(Connection connection, String data) {
    try {
        // ... process data using connection ...
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        // Handle exception, but critically, do not close the connection here!
    }
    // Correct approach: always close resources in a finally block
    try {
        if (connection != null) {
            connection.close();
        }
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        // Log the exception appropriately
        System.err.println("Failed to close database connection: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
```

This example highlights the importance of using `finally` blocks to ensure resources are closed regardless of exceptions.  Failure to do so directly leads to connection leaks, ultimately increasing GC activity.


**Example 2: Inefficient String Manipulation:**

```java
public String processString(String input) {
    String result = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
        result += input.charAt(i); // Inefficient string concatenation
    }
    return result;
}

// Improved Version: using StringBuilder
public String processStringEfficiently(String input) {
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
        sb.append(input.charAt(i));
    }
    return sb.toString();
}
```

This demonstrates the inefficiency of repeated string concatenation using the `+` operator.  This creates numerous temporary String objects, unnecessarily burdening the garbage collector.  `StringBuilder` offers a far more efficient alternative for string manipulation within loops.


**Example 3:  Memory Leak due to Static Collection:**

```java
public class DataHolder {
    private static final List<LargeObject> data = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addData(LargeObject obj) {
        data.add(obj); // No removal mechanism; potential memory leak!
    }
}

// Improved Version: WeakHashMap
import java.util.WeakHashMap;

public class DataHolderImproved {
    private static final WeakHashMap<Object, LargeObject> data = new WeakHashMap<>();

    public void addData(LargeObject obj) {
        data.put(new Object(), obj); // Key will be garbage collected if no other reference exists
    }
}

class LargeObject { //Represents a memory-intensive object
    private byte[] largeArray = new byte[1024 * 1024]; // 1MB
}
```

This example shows a potential memory leak introduced by a static `ArrayList`.  Without a mechanism to remove elements from the list, it will grow indefinitely.  The improved version uses `WeakHashMap`, where entries are removed automatically if the key is garbage collected, providing a more controlled approach.


**Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend consulting the official Tomcat documentation for detailed information on tuning its garbage collector.  Furthermore, thorough investigation of JVM memory management concepts and tools like JConsole or VisualVM for monitoring memory usage and identifying potential leaks will prove invaluable. Finally, a comprehensive understanding of memory profiling techniques is crucial for pinpointing the specific source of memory leaks within your application. Utilizing these resources, coupled with systematic code review, will greatly improve your ability to diagnose and resolve such issues.
