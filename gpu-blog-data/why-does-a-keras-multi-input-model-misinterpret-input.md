The core issue with Keras multi-input models misinterpreting data from generators frequently stems from inconsistencies between the generator's output structure and the model's expected input shapes.  My experience debugging similar problems across numerous projects, particularly those involving time-series analysis and multimodal data fusion, highlights the critical need for meticulous data structuring and shape verification.  Failure to match these precisely leads to silent data corruption and unpredictable model behavior.  The problem isn't inherent to Keras's multi-input functionality, but rather a consequence of improperly handling NumPy arrays and tensors within the generator's yield statements.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A Keras multi-input model anticipates receiving input data as a list or a dictionary, where each element corresponds to a specific input branch.  The length and shape of each element within this list or dictionary must precisely match the input layer's expected dimensions.  A generator, in contrast, simply yields data batches sequentially.  If the generator's output structure deviates – even slightly – from what the model expects, the model will interpret the input incorrectly, often silently.  This is because Keras generally performs minimal data validation beyond checking the basic dimensionality of the initial batch, leading to insidious bugs that may manifest only after significant training.


Consider a model with two input branches: one for image data (shape (128, 128, 3)) and another for numerical features (shape (10,)).  The generator *must* yield data as a list `[image_batch, numerical_features_batch]`, where `image_batch.shape` is (batch_size, 128, 128, 3) and `numerical_features_batch.shape` is (batch_size, 10).  Any deviation, such as yielding a tuple instead of a list, or incorrectly shaped arrays, will lead to the model misinterpreting the input.  The consequences vary; the model may produce nonsensical predictions, experience training instability, or even throw an exception during runtime.  Furthermore, the precise error message often lacks clarity, making debugging challenging.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Implementation:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

def data_generator(batch_size):
    while True:
        image_batch = np.random.rand(batch_size, 128, 128, 3)
        numerical_features_batch = np.random.rand(batch_size, 10)
        yield [image_batch, numerical_features_batch]

# Model definition (simplified for brevity)
input_image = keras.Input(shape=(128, 128, 3))
input_numerical = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
# ... layers processing image and numerical inputs ...
merged = keras.layers.concatenate([processed_image, processed_numerical])
# ... remaining layers ...
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_image, input_numerical], outputs=output)

model.fit(data_generator(32), steps_per_epoch=100, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates the correct structure.  The generator yields a list containing correctly shaped image and numerical data.  Crucially, the `model.fit` function correctly uses this list structure to feed the inputs to the respective input layers.


**Example 2: Incorrect Output Structure (Tuple instead of List):**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

def data_generator_incorrect(batch_size):
    while True:
        image_batch = np.random.rand(batch_size, 128, 128, 3)
        numerical_features_batch = np.random.rand(batch_size, 10)
        yield (image_batch, numerical_features_batch) # Incorrect: Tuple instead of List

# ... (Rest of the model definition remains the same as Example 1) ...

model.fit(data_generator_incorrect(32), steps_per_epoch=100, epochs=10) # This will likely fail silently or produce incorrect results.
```

Here, the generator yields a tuple instead of a list.  While seemingly minor, this structural difference will cause the model to misinterpret the input, potentially leading to subtle errors or unexpected model behavior.  In my experience, debugging this type of error requires careful examination of both the generator output and the model's input layers during execution using a debugger.


**Example 3: Incorrect Data Shape:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

def data_generator_incorrect_shape(batch_size):
    while True:
        image_batch = np.random.rand(batch_size, 64, 64, 3) # Incorrect shape
        numerical_features_batch = np.random.rand(batch_size, 10)
        yield [image_batch, numerical_features_batch]

# ... (Rest of the model definition remains the same as Example 1) ...

model.fit(data_generator_incorrect_shape(32), steps_per_epoch=100, epochs=10) # This will lead to shape mismatch error, or unexpected results.
```

This example demonstrates an incorrect image shape.  The generator provides images of size (64, 64, 3), which conflicts with the model's expectation of (128, 128, 3). This mismatch can lead to either a clear error during model training or, more insidiously, silently incorrect results.  The model might silently reshape the data, introducing distortions that severely impact the model’s performance.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Keras model building and data handling, I recommend consulting the official Keras documentation and the TensorFlow documentation.  Further, explore resources focused on NumPy array manipulation and efficient data preprocessing techniques for deep learning.  Understanding the intricacies of NumPy array broadcasting and reshaping is crucial for avoiding these types of issues.  Finally, proficient use of debugging tools within your chosen IDE is invaluable for diagnosing these subtle errors.  Careful attention to type checking and shape verification within the generator itself, through manual inspection or assertions, can prevent these issues from occurring.
