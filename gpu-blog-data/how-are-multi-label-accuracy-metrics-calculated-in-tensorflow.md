TensorFlow's handling of multi-label classification accuracy isn't a monolithic function; rather, it necessitates a nuanced approach depending on the specific needs of the task.  My experience working on large-scale image annotation projects highlighted the critical distinction between micro-averaged, macro-averaged, and weighted-averaged metrics.  Simply using a standard accuracy score will be misleading as it ignores the inherent imbalance often present in multi-label datasets.

**1. Clear Explanation of Multi-Label Accuracy Metrics in TensorFlow**

Multi-label classification differs significantly from multi-class classification.  In multi-class, each data point belongs to exactly one class.  In multi-label, each data point can belong to multiple classes simultaneously.  Consequently, standard accuracy metrics are inadequate.  We need to consider the performance across all labels individually and then aggregate them in a meaningful way.  This leads to the three primary averaging strategies: micro, macro, and weighted averaging.

* **Micro-averaged Accuracy:** This approach treats all predictions as a single pool of predictions and targets.  It counts the total number of correctly predicted labels across all data points and divides it by the total number of labels predicted.  This method is less sensitive to class imbalance since the influence of each label is proportional to its frequency. It's particularly useful when there are large differences in label prevalence.  It is best understood as considering the true positives, false positives and false negatives across all labels as a single set.

* **Macro-averaged Accuracy:** This method calculates the accuracy for each label individually and then averages these individual accuracies.  Each label receives equal weight, irrespective of its prevalence in the dataset.  This method is advantageous when all labels are equally important and class imbalance is a concern; it gives a fair representation of the model's performance on less frequent labels. However, it can be dominated by the performance on labels with fewer data points.

* **Weighted-averaged Accuracy:** This approach combines the benefits of both micro and macro averaging by weighing each label's accuracy by its support (number of occurrences). This balances the influence of frequent and infrequent labels.  It provides a more balanced view than macro averaging while being less susceptible to the dominance of frequent labels compared to micro-averaging.

TensorFlow doesn't offer built-in functions for these specific averaged accuracies.  Instead, we must implement them using TensorFlow's core operations along with standard metrics like `tf.metrics.Accuracy`. The key is calculating the confusion matrix or relevant metrics per label, then performing the averaging operation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

These examples use a simplified binary multi-label problem for illustrative purposes.  Adaptation to multi-class problems is straightforward with proper encoding.

**Example 1: Micro-averaged Accuracy**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def micro_f1(y_true, y_pred):
  """Calculates micro-averaged F1 score.  Accuracy can be derived similarly."""
  true_positives = tf.reduce_sum(y_true * y_pred, axis=0)
  false_positives = tf.reduce_sum((1 - y_true) * y_pred, axis=0)
  false_negatives = tf.reduce_sum(y_true * (1 - y_pred), axis=0)

  precision = tf.reduce_sum(true_positives) / tf.reduce_sum(true_positives + false_positives + 1e-7) #1e-7 for numerical stability
  recall = tf.reduce_sum(true_positives) / tf.reduce_sum(true_positives + false_negatives + 1e-7)
  f1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall + 1e-7)
  return f1

# Example Usage (assuming y_true and y_pred are tensors)
y_true = tf.constant([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]])

micro_f1_score = micro_f1(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Micro-averaged F1: {micro_f1_score.numpy()}")

#Accuracy can be derived in a very similar manner replacing f1 calculations with accuracy calculation.
```

This code efficiently calculates the micro-averaged F1 score (Accuracy's calculation is analogous).  The `1e-7` addition prevents division by zero errors.  Note that F1 is used here as it often provides a more balanced view than accuracy in imbalanced scenarios.

**Example 2: Macro-averaged Accuracy**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def macro_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
  """Calculates macro-averaged accuracy."""
  per_label_accuracy = tf.metrics.Accuracy()(y_true, y_pred) #This needs to be done on each label.
  return tf.reduce_mean(per_label_accuracy)


#Example Usage (requiring per-label accuracy calculation)
#This example is simplified; the core logic is to iterate through labels and calculate accuracy for each.

y_true = tf.constant([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]])

label_accuracies = []
for i in range(3): #assuming 3 labels
  label_true = tf.gather(y_true, indices=[i], axis=1)
  label_pred = tf.gather(y_pred, indices=[i], axis=1)
  label_accuracy = tf.metrics.Accuracy()(label_true, label_pred)
  label_accuracies.append(label_accuracy)

macro_avg = tf.reduce_mean(tf.stack(label_accuracies))
print(f"Macro-averaged Accuracy: {macro_avg.numpy()}")
```

This example demonstrates the macro-averaging strategy by calculating accuracy per label and then averaging.  You would adapt this code to loop over all labels in your specific dataset.

**Example 3: Weighted-averaged Accuracy**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def weighted_accuracy(y_true, y_pred):
  """Calculates weighted-averaged accuracy."""
  per_label_accuracy = tf.metrics.Accuracy()(y_true, y_pred)
  label_counts = tf.reduce_sum(y_true, axis=0)
  total_samples = tf.reduce_sum(label_counts)

  weights = label_counts / total_samples
  return tf.reduce_sum(per_label_accuracy * weights)

#Example Usage (similar structure to Example 2)
y_true = tf.constant([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]])

label_accuracies = []
for i in range(3):  #assuming 3 labels
  label_true = tf.gather(y_true, indices=[i], axis=1)
  label_pred = tf.gather(y_pred, indices=[i], axis=1)
  label_accuracy = tf.metrics.Accuracy()(label_true, label_pred)
  label_accuracies.append(label_accuracy)

label_counts = np.sum(y_true.numpy(), axis=0)
weights = label_counts / np.sum(label_counts)
weighted_avg = np.sum(np.array(label_accuracies)*weights)

print(f"Weighted-averaged Accuracy: {weighted_avg}")
```

This example showcases weighted averaging, where each label's accuracy is weighted by its frequency.  The weights are normalized to sum to 1. Note that this implementation uses NumPy for the weighted averaging for simplicity; it's feasible to perform this entirely in TensorFlow.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on metrics and the broader literature on multi-label classification evaluation.  Pay close attention to the nuances of confusion matrix interpretation in the multi-label context.  Exploring research papers on evaluating imbalanced datasets would further enhance your understanding of the trade-offs between these averaging methods.  Finally, studying examples in established machine learning repositories will illuminate practical application of these methods.
