The omission of object detection bounding box visualizations in TensorBoard when using the TensorFlow Object Detection API in TF2 frequently stems from improper configuration of the data pipeline and summary writing process within the training loop. I've encountered this issue multiple times while developing custom detection models, and it's rarely a problem with TensorBoard itself. The core problem isn't that TensorBoard can’t display these visualizations; instead, it is usually the incorrect formatting of image summaries or their absence from the training procedures.

The API relies on specific formats and data types for visualization, differing from the standard scalar or histogram summaries. Namely, it requires images with bounding box annotations to be rendered as an image summary. This implies two key aspects: first, the training loop must properly extract and format prediction images and bounding boxes and second, these images with their bounding box overlays must be converted to a format that TensorBoard understands - generally, a tensor representing a single image with overlayed bounding boxes. If either of these steps fail or are missing, no bounding box visualizations will appear.

The first step is often the source of the issue. When creating the dataset pipeline, particularly when using `tf.data.Dataset` objects, the data must be structured such that the model outputs both the raw image and the corresponding detection results. The object detection pipeline commonly includes a component for augmenting data which might also contribute to the issue, requiring careful adjustment to preserve the bounding box information along with the augmented image.

Secondly, proper utilization of the `tf.summary.image` function is critical. This is not an arbitrary image summary but one with additional input parameters to explicitly draw the bounding boxes on the input image. If this isn’t done properly, the output to TensorBoard will not include the bounding boxes and will be limited to the raw images themselves.

Consider this situation: an object detection model is trained, but the detection boxes are not displayed in TensorBoard, although the training loss is. The core problem, after troubleshooting, was determined to be the inadequate handling of image and bounding box tensors in the training loop, specifically when writing out summaries. Here are a few illustrative examples:

**Example 1: Incorrect Summary Writing**

This code shows an incorrect method of writing image summaries, focusing only on raw images:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def train_step(images, labels, model, optimizer, summary_writer):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(images, training=True)
    loss = compute_loss(predictions, labels) # Placeholder for loss calc.
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

  with summary_writer.as_default():
      tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=optimizer.iterations)
      tf.summary.image('training_images', images, step=optimizer.iterations) # Incorrect
  return loss

# Placeholder dataset and model
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((tf.random.normal((10, 64, 64, 3)), tf.random.normal((10, 4)))).batch(2)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3)), tf.keras.layers.Flatten(), tf.keras.layers.Dense(4)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs')
for images, labels in dataset:
    train_step(images, labels, model, optimizer, summary_writer)

```

Here, while the loss is logged, the images are being added as a standard image summary. The bounding box information in ‘labels’ are not used during the summary call, hence missing from TensorBoard. This example highlights the failure to leverage the bounding box data for visualization purposes. The `labels` tensor is assumed here to contain bounding box information, typically as a tensor with the shape of [batch_size, num_boxes, 4] or equivalent. The function `tf.summary.image` can only display raw pixel data and does not know how to interpret these bounding boxes.

**Example 2: Correct Summary Writing with Bounding Boxes**

The corrected example incorporates the proper utilization of `tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes` before passing it to `tf.summary.image`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def train_step(images, labels, model, optimizer, summary_writer):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(images, training=True)
        loss = compute_loss(predictions, labels) # Placeholder for loss calc.
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    with summary_writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=optimizer.iterations)
        # Draw bounding boxes:
        drawn_boxes = tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes(images, labels)
        tf.summary.image('training_images_with_boxes', drawn_boxes, step=optimizer.iterations)
    return loss

# Placeholder dataset and model
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((tf.random.normal((10, 64, 64, 3)), tf.random.uniform((10, 10, 4)))).batch(2)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3)), tf.keras.layers.Flatten(), tf.keras.layers.Dense(4)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs_2')
for images, labels in dataset:
    train_step(images, labels, model, optimizer, summary_writer)

```

Here, the raw images are overlaid with bounding boxes before being displayed in TensorBoard.  `tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes` takes the raw image tensors and bounding box coordinates, then draws them as overlays on the image. These augmented images are then sent to the TensorBoard summary. Crucially, the bounding box data within the `labels` tensor is correctly used. This addresses the missing visualization issue. The shape of the label tensor here is assumed to be `[batch_size, num_boxes, 4]`, where the last dimension represents `[y1, x1, y2, x2]` coordinates. It's important to check the specific output format of your dataset against the expected input to this function.

**Example 3: Adjusting Bounding Box Format (if necessary)**

Sometimes, the bounding box format from your data pipeline might not exactly match the format expected by `tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes`. In these cases, you may need to preprocess them before drawing. For example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def train_step(images, labels, model, optimizer, summary_writer):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(images, training=True)
        loss = compute_loss(predictions, labels)  # Placeholder for loss calc.
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    with summary_writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=optimizer.iterations)
        # Adjust bounding box format if necessary:
        labels_normalized = labels/tf.cast(tf.shape(images)[1], tf.float32)
        drawn_boxes = tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes(images, labels_normalized)
        tf.summary.image('training_images_with_boxes', drawn_boxes, step=optimizer.iterations)
    return loss

# Placeholder dataset and model
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((tf.random.normal((10, 64, 64, 3)), tf.random.uniform((10, 10, 4), maxval=64))).batch(2)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3)), tf.keras.layers.Flatten(), tf.keras.layers.Dense(4)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs_3')
for images, labels in dataset:
    train_step(images, labels, model, optimizer, summary_writer)
```

Here, it is assumed the bounding box coordinates are pixel values between 0 and the image width and height rather than being normalized values between 0 and 1. The label tensor is divided by the image dimension. If your bounding boxes are already normalized, this step should not be included. This step highlights the flexibility you may need to adjust your data to fit the API requirements.

In summary, the absence of bounding box visualizations in TensorBoard is rarely a fundamental problem with the API itself, but rather a result of improper handling of the image and bounding box data within the training pipeline. The core solutions center around ensuring that bounding boxes are properly drawn onto images using `tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes` before passing to `tf.summary.image`. Furthermore, careful attention to the specific bounding box format your pipeline provides and how it matches the expected inputs to `tf.image.draw_bounding_boxes` is important. Correcting these steps should lead to the appearance of these visuals within TensorBoard.

For further learning and deeper understanding, I'd recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the guides on `tf.data.Dataset` for input pipelines and the `tf.summary` API for generating TensorBoard summaries. The official object detection model repository on GitHub can also be useful by examining model training code examples there. Additionally, exploring online tutorials covering custom object detection training loops in TensorFlow can provide various practical implementations and approaches.
