The observed spike in RAM usage at the start of each epoch during machine learning training, particularly with complex models and large datasets, is often attributable to a combination of pre-processing steps and the resource demands of initializing new training iterations. I've seen this pattern repeatedly in my experience developing deep learning models for image recognition and natural language processing, and several core mechanisms tend to consistently contribute.

First, consider the loading and preparation of training data. In most scenarios, the entire dataset does not reside in RAM at once due to size constraints. Instead, data is loaded in batches from storage, frequently requiring some transformation or augmentation. This process, occurring at the beginning of each epoch, necessitates the allocation of new memory regions to hold the current batch. These regions might not be the same size or have the same memory addresses as those used in previous epochs. If, for example, the augmentation strategy involves dynamic resizing or rotation, the memory needed may vary even for equivalent batches, leading to fluctuations in memory consumption. Additionally, pre-processing pipelines that include operations like tokenization, embedding lookups, or data normalization all demand temporary memory buffers to perform these calculations. When a new epoch starts, all these operations are executed anew, causing an immediate demand on RAM. This explains why the spike is generally sharper at the start of each epoch and tapers off as data flows into the model during the training phase.

Furthermore, model initialization processes contribute significantly to this memory increase. While the model's parameters are loaded into memory when training begins, the gradient calculations often require more RAM to store intermediate values and gradients for each layer during the backpropagation phase of training. This gradient calculation isn’t generally something done once and kept in memory. It’s usually recalculated in each batch and especially if using optimizers like Adam that have internal tracking states. Consequently, when a new epoch begins, optimizers and the backpropagation process associated with the first batch initialization cause this spike as they begin from scratch, allocating space for each variable. The previous epoch's gradients are normally no longer used and discarded and space is allocated for the new epoch’s values.

Finally, depending on the framework being used, other background or worker processes may contribute to memory utilization spikes. For example, PyTorch's data loaders use multiple workers to load data in parallel. This can improve the data feeding speed but can also lead to temporary spikes in RAM utilization when the workers start processing the first batches of each epoch. Similarly, garbage collection routines might be triggered after an epoch and during the start of the new epoch to free memory resources, but this process itself can lead to a memory allocation and usage spike. Even when memory has been freed, the time it takes for this to show as available often lags behind the actual deallocation.

Let's illustrate these points with code snippets using Python, PyTorch and examples based on typical training procedures.

**Example 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing**

This first example focuses on the initial data loading phase. The code uses a simple dataset simulation and highlights the memory allocation during transformations.

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
import random
import psutil
import time

def monitor_memory():
  return psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024) # RSS is Resident Set Size in MB

def create_dummy_data(num_samples, shape=(3, 64, 64)):
  return [torch.rand(shape) for _ in range(num_samples)]

def augment_data(batch, augmentation_rate=0.2):
    if random.random() < augmentation_rate:
        new_size = (int(batch.shape[1] * (1 + random.uniform(-0.2, 0.2))),
                    int(batch.shape[2] * (1 + random.uniform(-0.2, 0.2))))
        return torch.nn.functional.interpolate(batch.unsqueeze(0), size=new_size, mode='bilinear', align_corners=False).squeeze(0)
    return batch

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_samples = 1000
    batch_size = 32
    num_epochs = 2

    dataset = create_dummy_data(num_samples)
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
      print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}:")
      for i in range(0, num_samples, batch_size):
        start_memory = monitor_memory()
        batch = dataset[i:i + batch_size]
        batch_stack = torch.stack(batch)
        
        augmented_batch = [augment_data(item) for item in batch_stack]
        augmented_batch_stack = torch.stack(augmented_batch)
        
        end_memory = monitor_memory()
        print(f"  Batch {i//batch_size + 1}: Mem Usage Change = {(end_memory - start_memory):.2f} MB")
        time.sleep(0.1) # Slow down to see changes
```

The `monitor_memory()` function returns the current resident set size of the process. `create_dummy_data()` generates random tensors that represent our dataset. The critical part is the augmentation logic in `augment_data()`, which adds randomness to each batch of data, causing changes in memory use based on the transformations that need to be carried out. You'll observe that memory usage increases significantly at the start of each epoch as the first few batches are processed, confirming the initial hypothesis of loading data causing memory spikes.

**Example 2: Model Initialization and Gradient Allocation**

The following snippet demonstrates memory allocation during forward and backward passes, which is especially noticeable during the first batch of each epoch.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import psutil
import time

def monitor_memory():
    return psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024)

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(100, 50)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(50, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_size = 100
    batch_size = 32
    num_epochs = 2
    
    model = SimpleModel()
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
      print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}:")
      for i in range(0, 1000, batch_size):
        start_memory = monitor_memory()
        inputs = torch.randn(batch_size, input_size)
        labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (batch_size,))

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        end_memory = monitor_memory()
        print(f" Batch {i//batch_size + 1}: Mem Usage Change = {(end_memory - start_memory):.2f} MB")
        time.sleep(0.1)
```

This code sets up a simple neural network and performs a basic training loop. The `optimizer.zero_grad()` clears previously calculated gradients, and `loss.backward()` calculates the gradients for the current batch. The difference in memory usage before and after the forward/backward passes will highlight the memory allocation needed for gradient computations. As with the data augmentation example, you can observe that the first batch of each epoch tends to cause a relatively large jump in memory usage as it initializes the optimizers state as well as the gradient calculation.

**Example 3: Impact of Data Loader Workers**

This example demonstrates the usage of PyTorch's DataLoader to load batches in parallel. This can sometimes increase memory use, especially at epoch start because all the workers have to start afresh.

```python
import torch
import torch.utils.data as data
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import psutil
import time


def monitor_memory():
    return psutil.Process().memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024)

class DummyDataset(data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, num_samples, shape=(3, 64, 64)):
        self.data = [torch.rand(shape) for _ in range(num_samples)]
        self.labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (num_samples,))

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.data[index], self.labels[index]


class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(3*64*64, 50)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(50, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
      x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
      x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
      x = self.fc2(x)
      return x

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_samples = 1000
    batch_size = 32
    num_epochs = 2
    num_workers = 4

    dataset = DummyDataset(num_samples)
    data_loader = data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, num_workers=num_workers)

    model = SimpleModel()
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()


    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
      print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}:")
      for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(data_loader):
        start_memory = monitor_memory()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        end_memory = monitor_memory()
        print(f" Batch {i+1}: Mem Usage Change = {(end_memory - start_memory):.2f} MB")
        time.sleep(0.1)

```

This code demonstrates the use of `DataLoader` with multiple worker processes. While the parallelization can speed up data loading, it might result in higher initial memory allocation at the start of the epoch as these processes load and prepare batches concurrently. This provides context on how data loaders with multiple workers might contribute to the memory spikes observed at epoch start.

In summary, RAM spikes at the start of each epoch are common in machine learning training and are usually due to initial data preparation, re-initialization of optimizer states, gradient calculation during backward passes, and the overhead from the use of data loaders, especially with multiple workers.

For further study on this topic, I would recommend researching memory management in deep learning frameworks, focusing on concepts like data batching, gradient calculation, garbage collection, and the design of data loading pipelines. Papers and articles about PyTorch data loading and memory efficiency are often a good source. Additionally, studying profiling tools, both built-in and third-party, specific to the framework in use can greatly help diagnose memory issues.
