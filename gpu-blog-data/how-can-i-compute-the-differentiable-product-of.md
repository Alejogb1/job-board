The crux of computing a differentiable product of tensors in TensorFlow lies in understanding that the standard multiplication operator (`*`) performs element-wise multiplication, which isn't directly differentiable in the context of needing gradients for backpropagation.  We require an operation that correctly propagates gradients through the multiplication process, considering the tensor structure and allowing for the computation of Jacobian matrices.  This is readily achievable by leveraging the built-in TensorFlow operations designed for automatic differentiation. My experience working on large-scale neural network training extensively utilizes this capability, especially when dealing with complex loss functions incorporating multiple tensor interactions.

The solution centers around employing TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities, specifically utilizing the `tf.matmul` function for matrix multiplications and handling element-wise multiplication carefully, depending on the desired outcome.  Direct element-wise multiplication, while convenient, necessitates a different approach for gradient calculation within the broader context of a computational graph.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow's automatic differentiation system relies on building a computational graph, where operations are nodes and tensors are edges. When calculating gradients, TensorFlow traverses this graph backward, applying the chain rule to compute derivatives.  Element-wise multiplication (`*`) is straightforwardly differentiable, but its gradient propagation might not be what is expected for tensor products in higher dimensions.  For example, if we have two tensors, A and B, where A is of shape (m, n) and B is (n, p), element-wise multiplication doesn't yield a meaningful result in the context of a matrix product (or equivalent higher-dimensional tensor operation).  What we usually need is a true matrix product, which is differentiable through `tf.matmul`.

If the goal is an element-wise product followed by a reduction (summation, for example), this can be expressed using `tf.reduce_sum(tf.multiply(A,B))`, which is also differentiable.  The crucial point is to be precise about the type of product desired, as it significantly impacts how gradients are computed.  Using `tf.matmul` ensures the correct gradient calculation for matrix multiplication or equivalent tensor operations, whereas relying solely on element-wise multiplication will give gradients appropriate only to an element-wise product, potentially leading to incorrect results in the larger computational graph.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Matrix Multiplication (Differentiable Tensor Product)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define tensors
A = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
B = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Perform matrix multiplication
C = tf.matmul(A, B)

# Compute gradients (requires a loss function)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch([A, B])
  loss = tf.reduce_sum(C) # Example loss function

dA, dB = tape.gradient(loss, [A, B])

print("Tensor A:\n", A.numpy())
print("Tensor B:\n", B.numpy())
print("Matrix Product C:\n", C.numpy())
print("Gradient dA:\n", dA.numpy())
print("Gradient dB:\n", dB.numpy())
```

This example demonstrates the proper way to compute the differentiable product of two matrices.  `tf.matmul` provides the correct matrix product, and `tf.GradientTape` computes the gradients accurately, considering the matrix multiplication operation within the computational graph.  The loss function is a placeholder and could be replaced with any differentiable loss relevant to the specific application.


**Example 2: Element-wise Multiplication with Reduction (Differentiable)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

A = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
B = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch([A, B])
  element_wise_product = tf.multiply(A, B)
  loss = tf.reduce_sum(element_wise_product) # Example loss function

dA, dB = tape.gradient(loss, [A,B])

print("Tensor A:\n", A.numpy())
print("Tensor B:\n", B.numpy())
print("Element-wise product:\n", element_wise_product.numpy())
print("Gradient dA:\n", dA.numpy())
print("Gradient dB:\n", dB.numpy())
```

Here, element-wise multiplication is used, but the result is immediately summed using `tf.reduce_sum`. This ensures differentiability, as the final result is a scalar value, allowing for straightforward gradient computation.  The gradients reflect the contribution of each element in A and B to the final sum.

**Example 3: Handling Higher-Dimensional Tensors**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

A = tf.random.normal((3, 2, 4))
B = tf.random.normal((3, 4, 5))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch([A, B])
    C = tf.einsum('ijk,ikl->ijl', A, B) #Efficient contraction
    loss = tf.reduce_sum(C)

dA, dB = tape.gradient(loss, [A, B])

print("Shape of A:", A.shape)
print("Shape of B:", B.shape)
print("Shape of C:", C.shape)
print("Shape of dA:", dA.shape)
print("Shape of dB:", dB.shape)
```

This example expands upon the previous ones by using higher-dimensional tensors.  `tf.einsum` offers a flexible way to perform tensor contractions and is particularly useful for expressing various types of tensor products.  The `'ijk,ikl->ijl'` specification defines the contraction pattern, resulting in a differentiable operation.  The gradients are calculated accordingly, demonstrating the adaptability of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation to various tensor shapes and operations.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on automatic differentiation and tensor operations, offers comprehensive information.  Furthermore,  a good understanding of linear algebra, especially matrix multiplication and tensor contractions, is invaluable.  Finally, exploring resources dedicated to implementing and training neural networks in TensorFlow is highly beneficial for gaining practical experience with these concepts in relevant contexts.  Working through tutorials and examples focusing on custom loss functions and backpropagation mechanisms will solidify this understanding.
