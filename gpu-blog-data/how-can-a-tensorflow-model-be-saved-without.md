The specific requirements for saving a TensorFlow model without labels and variables stem from deployment scenarios where the model structure and its learned weights are needed, but not the training-specific data or optimizers. I've frequently encountered this when distributing models for inference, where label information is irrelevant, or when employing transfer learning where optimizer states are not intended to be shared. A successful approach necessitates a clear understanding of TensorFlow's saving mechanisms and an ability to selectively save specific components.

TensorFlow offers several mechanisms for model persistence, primarily via SavedModel format, HDF5 files (using `tf.keras.models.save_model`), and checkpoints. The SavedModel format is the preferred choice for robust deployment, as it preserves the complete model architecture and weights in a platform-agnostic format. However, it defaults to storing all associated variables, including those related to the optimizer and possibly label information if part of a custom model or data pipeline. Therefore, directly utilizing the standard saving functions will not achieve the desired outcome.

The key lies in selectively preserving only the parts of the model needed for inference: the model's computation graph and its learned parameters. To achieve this, the direct saving of the model as a SavedModel, using `tf.saved_model.save`, while avoiding any variables or optimizer artifacts, is the suitable approach, but we need to ensure we are not passing the training-related information. The core concept here is to create an independent, purely inference-ready model prior to saving. We achieve this by building an inference-specific model, which is essentially a clone of the trained model with the input tensor, output tensor, and any intermediate layers needed for passing the data correctly through the network. The training variables are not directly linked to this inference-specific model, hence, we will not be saving the labels and the optimizer variables, while saving the weights.

Here’s a more concrete explanation. Consider a simple classification model created with TensorFlow’s Keras API, which would normally have labels associated with the output. When we wish to save this model for inference purposes alone, we need to perform the following steps. First, we instantiate our trained model. Next, we extract the structure of this model by defining input and output tensors for our inference model. We then initialize an inference model with the same structure as the trained model and copy the trained weights over to the inference model. Finally, we save the inference model as a SavedModel. The crucial distinction is that the inference model we're saving is entirely devoid of any label information or optimizer states; it is simply the network graph and the trained weights, suitable for performing forward passes for inference.

Below are three code examples demonstrating different scenarios:

**Example 1: Saving a Keras Sequential Model for Inference**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# 1. Define and train a simple sequential model (example only, training not important here)
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#Dummy Input and labels
x = tf.random.normal((10, 784))
y = tf.random.uniform((10,), minval = 0, maxval = 10, dtype = tf.int32)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x,y,epochs = 5)


# 2. Create an inference model by instantiating and cloning from trained model
inference_model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()
for layer in model.layers:
   inference_model.add(layer)


# 3. Copy weights from the trained model to the inference model
inference_model.set_weights(model.get_weights())

# 4. Save the inference model using SavedModel format
tf.saved_model.save(inference_model, 'inference_model_folder')

# Print for confirmation
print("Model saved to inference_model_folder")
```

In this first example, the comments detail each step of the process. The trained model is constructed using the Keras Sequential API. We then clone the architecture by adding the trained model's layers to an empty Keras Sequential model instance. Crucially, we explicitly transfer the trained weights to the inference model using `set_weights`. Because the cloned inference model is initialized separately from the training process and we've not added labels during inference, only the weights and the graph structure are saved. The output confirms where the model is saved.

**Example 2: Saving a Functional API Model for Inference**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# 1. Define and train a Functional API model (example only, training not important here)
inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(inputs)
x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2))(x)
x = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(x)
outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

#Dummy Input and labels
x = tf.random.normal((10, 28, 28, 1))
y = tf.random.uniform((10,), minval = 0, maxval = 10, dtype = tf.int32)


model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x,y,epochs = 5)


# 2. Build an inference model using input/output tensor
input_tensor = model.input
output_tensor = model.output

inference_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs = input_tensor, outputs = output_tensor)

# 3. Copy weights from the trained model to the inference model
inference_model.set_weights(model.get_weights())

# 4. Save the inference model using SavedModel format
tf.saved_model.save(inference_model, 'functional_inference_model_folder')

# Print for confirmation
print("Model saved to functional_inference_model_folder")
```

This example demonstrates a slightly more complex scenario using the Functional API. Instead of cloning each layer, we create a new model by explicitly feeding in the input and output tensor. The weights are then transferred similarly and the resulting model is saved without any label or optimizer-specific information.

**Example 3: Saving a Subclassed Model for Inference**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# 1. Define and train a custom subclassed model (example only, training not important here)
class CustomModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)

model = CustomModel()

#Dummy Input and labels
x = tf.random.normal((10, 784))
y = tf.random.uniform((10,), minval = 0, maxval = 10, dtype = tf.int32)


model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x,y,epochs = 5)

# 2. Create an inference model by instantiating and cloning from trained model
inference_model = CustomModel()

# 3. Copy weights from the trained model to the inference model
inference_model.set_weights(model.get_weights())

# 4. Save the inference model using SavedModel format
tf.saved_model.save(inference_model, 'subclassed_inference_model_folder')

# Print for confirmation
print("Model saved to subclassed_inference_model_folder")
```

This final example illustrates saving a custom model created using subclassing. The process is similar: instantiate a new instance, transfer the weights from the trained model, and save using SavedModel format. This method again, only saves the structure and the weights without the labels or the optimizer variables.

These examples provide a clear strategy that can be adapted to save models of varying complexity without the unwanted baggage of labels or optimizer states. It’s crucial to realize that the weights are only applied to the new instance of our inference model after it has been instantiated. This ensures that the connection of the trained model to the optimizer and the labels during training are completely avoided.

For further information on model saving and loading within TensorFlow, consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.saved_model` is paramount. The Keras documentation regarding model building and saving is also indispensable, particularly for understanding Functional and Sequential API differences. Examining tutorials on practical model deployment can further illuminate the rationale behind these techniques. Finally, books specializing in advanced TensorFlow techniques often include detailed sections on model management and deployment. These resources offer a comprehensive view of the available tools and methodologies for effective model saving.
