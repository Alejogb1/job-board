TensorFlow's reliance on NVIDIA CUDA libraries for GPU acceleration often manifests as errors when the correct `cudart64_*.dll` is either missing, incompatible, or not accessible in the system’s PATH. Specifically, the `cudart64_110.dll` error indicates an issue with the CUDA runtime library version 11.0, usually encountered during TensorFlow initialization. Having troubleshot similar issues across diverse hardware setups, I've found that a systematic approach focusing on compatibility and environmental variables is generally effective.

The root cause typically stems from a mismatch between the CUDA toolkit version TensorFlow expects and the version installed on the machine. TensorFlow is compiled against specific CUDA and cuDNN versions, and deviations often lead to these "missing DLL" errors or similar runtime failures. This isn't just about having *a* CUDA installation; it's about having the *correct* version that TensorFlow expects. The problem isn't usually that the file is completely absent, but that the version of the file found in the system PATH is either too old, too new, or doesn't match the requirements of the TensorFlow build. This can occur due to multiple CUDA toolkit installations or an incomplete or incorrect setup of environment variables. Consequently, even with a seemingly installed NVIDIA driver, the TensorFlow runtime environment can be unable to locate the precise library it requires.

To address this, a methodical approach is crucial. First, determine the exact TensorFlow version you're using; this is fundamental because the necessary CUDA version changes between TensorFlow releases. This information can be obtained by inspecting the installed TensorFlow package via `pip show tensorflow`. Once you have the TensorFlow version, consult the TensorFlow documentation or release notes to identify the corresponding compatible CUDA and cuDNN versions. Note the specific CUDA and cuDNN version; for example, TensorFlow 2.6 might require CUDA 11.2 and cuDNN 8.1. While newer versions may appear backward-compatible, TensorFlow is often built against a specific version to guarantee optimal performance and stability.

Once the version requirements are established, verifying the current system setup is the next key step. Check the installed NVIDIA driver version; it should be compatible with the CUDA version your TensorFlow requires. NVIDIA provides detailed compatibility charts, and it is vital to consult these. Confirm that the NVIDIA driver installation itself is not damaged. You can do this by checking device manager to ensure that the GPU is visible, and there are no error codes.

After validating the driver, focus on the CUDA toolkit. If the required CUDA toolkit isn't installed, download the appropriate version from NVIDIA’s developer site. When installing the CUDA toolkit, follow the installation instructions carefully, paying close attention to the installation path, and ensure that the toolkit is fully installed. Typically, CUDA installs its libraries in a directory like `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.0`. It is imperative that this path is added to the system's PATH environment variable. Critically, if you have multiple CUDA toolkits installed, be mindful of the order in your PATH environment variable; it can dictate which `cudart64_*.dll` is being loaded.

Finally, verify the cuDNN installation. cuDNN libraries need to be extracted into the CUDA Toolkit folder. Again ensure you are using the correct version from the NVIDIA site based on the CUDA and TensorFlow version you identified earlier. Correct placement is required; cuDNN files must exist in the correct CUDA directory. Ensure that the cuDNN `.dll` files end up in the CUDA bin directory e.g. `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.0\bin`.

Here are three illustrative scenarios with code examples:

**Scenario 1: Incorrect CUDA Version in Path**

The system has CUDA 11.8 installed, but TensorFlow needs CUDA 11.0. The system PATH points to the `bin` directory of CUDA 11.8.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
try:
    gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    if gpus:
        print("GPU devices:", gpus)
    else:
        print("No GPUs detected.")
except tf.errors.NotFoundError as e:
    print(f"TensorFlow encountered an error: {e}")
```

**Commentary:** This Python snippet attempts to initialize TensorFlow and detect available GPUs. If the wrong CUDA version is loaded, this will likely result in a `NotFoundError` referencing `cudart64_110.dll`. The path environment variable is pointing to `CUDA/v11.8/bin` instead of the required `CUDA/v11.0/bin`.  The `print(f"TensorFlow encountered an error: {e}")` statement will print the full TensorFlow error message including the missing DLL error. Resolving this involves either installing CUDA 11.0 (and its associated cuDNN version) or reconfiguring the path. You may also need to rename or delete folders in the `Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA` directory if you wish to remove old versions.

**Scenario 2: Missing cuDNN Libraries**

The correct CUDA toolkit (v11.0) is installed, and its path is in the system’s PATH, however the required cuDNN libraries have not been copied into the `CUDA/v11.0/bin` directory.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
try:
  with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], shape=[1, 3], name='a')
    b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 1], name='b')
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)
    print(f"Result: {c}")
except tf.errors.NotFoundError as e:
    print(f"TensorFlow GPU test failed: {e}")
```

**Commentary:** This code attempts to run a simple matrix multiplication operation on the GPU. If cuDNN is missing, even if the correct CUDA and cuDNN versions are installed, TensorFlow fails. The error will likely reference `cudnn64_8.dll` or a similar cuDNN component, or potentially `cudart64_110.dll` if the GPU cannot initialize at all. The solution is to download the corresponding version of cuDNN and copy its `.dll` files into the CUDA Toolkit bin folder.

**Scenario 3: Multiple CUDA Toolkits in Path with Conflicting Order**

Both CUDA 11.0 and CUDA 11.8 are installed and their respective paths exist within the system PATH environment variable. However the path to CUDA 11.8 comes before 11.0. Even though the system has the required CUDA runtime library, because the path to CUDA 11.8 occurs first the wrong version is loaded.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os
try:
    print(f"CUDA PATH: {os.environ['PATH']}")
    print(f"Is GPU Available? {tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')}")
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], shape=[1, 3], name='a')
    b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 1], name='b')
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        c = tf.matmul(a, b)
    print(f"Result: {c}")
except tf.errors.NotFoundError as e:
    print(f"TensorFlow Failed: {e}")
```

**Commentary:** This scenario shows how the ordering of paths in the system environment variables matters. The script first prints the `PATH` variable to expose the order of `bin` folders associated with the various CUDA installations. When CUDA 11.8 is earlier in the path than 11.0, TensorFlow can fail as it is loading `cudart64` from the incorrect CUDA version. Even though the required `cudart64_110.dll` may exist, TensorFlow may still not be able to utilize the GPU as the correct version is not loaded. Resolving this requires moving the CUDA 11.0 path to be earlier in the `PATH` variable.

In summary, resolving this issue requires a systematic approach of understanding the required versions of CUDA and cuDNN, ensuring they are properly installed, verifying their presence in the correct directory and verifying the path to these directories is defined in the `PATH` environment variable. Correctly sequencing the paths in the PATH environment variable to ensure the correct version is loaded is also paramount.
