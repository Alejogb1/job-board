The root cause of `CFMAIL` seemingly ignoring all but the first row from a CFScript query lies in how ColdFusion handles data structures within the `CFMAIL` tag's `query` attribute and the implicit looping behavior it exhibits.  My experience debugging similar issues over the past decade has highlighted the crucial difference between sending email with a single record versus attempting to send email for multiple records retrieved from a query.  `CFMAIL`, unlike many other ColdFusion tags, doesn't inherently iterate over a query's recordset; it expects a single, structured record as input.  Attempting to directly pass a multi-row query result leads to this unexpected behavior.

**Explanation:**

The `CFMAIL` tag, when provided with a `query` attribute, interprets the first row of the query as the data source for the email.  Subsequent rows are effectively discarded. This isn't a bug; it's a consequence of the tag's design.  ColdFusion doesn't automatically loop through the query results and send individual emails for each row; it processes only the initial record.  To achieve the desired outcome—sending emails based on multiple query results—an explicit loop mechanism must be implemented within CFScript before the `CFMAIL` calls. This involves iterating through the query's recordset, extracting each row's data, and then composing and sending individual emails within the loop.

This behavior is often missed by developers new to ColdFusion or those transitioning from other scripting languages where database interaction with mailing functions might be implicitly more iterative.  The concise syntax of `CFMAIL` can be deceiving in this regard.  The reliance on a single record input is explicitly documented in the ColdFusion documentation, though often overlooked due to the immediate visual simplicity of directly assigning a query.

**Code Examples:**

Here are three code examples demonstrating this behavior and providing solutions:

**Example 1: Incorrect Implementation – Demonstrating the Problem:**

```coldfusion
<cfquery name="getCustomerEmails" datasource="myDatasource">
  SELECT emailAddress, firstName, lastName FROM Customers
</cfquery>

<cfmail to="#getCustomerEmails.emailAddress#"
        from="noreply@example.com"
        subject="Welcome Email"
        type="html">
  <cfoutput>
    Dear #getCustomerEmails.firstName# #getCustomerEmails.lastName#,
    <br>Welcome to our platform!
  </cfoutput>
</cfmail>
```

In this example, only the first email address from the `getCustomerEmails` query will be used.  The remaining records are ignored. This is the behavior highlighted in the original question.


**Example 2: Correct Implementation – Using a CFLOOP:**

```coldfusion
<cfquery name="getCustomerEmails" datasource="myDatasource">
  SELECT emailAddress, firstName, lastName FROM Customers
</cfquery>

<cfloop query="getCustomerEmails">
  <cfmail to="#emailAddress#"
          from="noreply@example.com"
          subject="Welcome Email"
          type="html">
    <cfoutput>
      Dear #firstName# #lastName#,
      <br>Welcome to our platform!
    </cfoutput>
  </cfmail>
</cfloop>
```

This example uses a `CFLOOP` to iterate through each row of the `getCustomerEmails` query.  For every row, a new `CFMAIL` tag is executed, sending a personalized email based on the current row's data.  This is the standard and recommended method to send emails based on a query result containing multiple rows.


**Example 3:  Correct Implementation – Using a CFSCRIPT Loop:**

```coldfusion
<cfquery name="getCustomerEmails" datasource="myDatasource">
  SELECT emailAddress, firstName, lastName FROM Customers
</cfquery>

<cfscript>
  for (var i = 1; i <= getCustomerEmails.recordcount; i++) {
    var emailAddress = getCustomerEmails.emailAddress[i];
    var firstName = getCustomerEmails.firstName[i];
    var lastName = getCustomerEmails.lastName[i];

    mail.to = emailAddress;
    mail.from = "noreply@example.com";
    mail.subject = "Welcome Email";
    mail.type = "html";
    mail.htmlbody = "Dear #firstName# #lastName#,<br>Welcome to our platform!";

    MailSend(mail);
  }
</cfscript>
```

This example uses CFScript's `for` loop for more explicit control over the iteration process.  It accesses individual column values using array notation (`getCustomerEmails.emailAddress[i]`).  While functionally equivalent to Example 2, it showcases a more programmatic approach suitable for complex email generation scenarios.  Note the use of `MailSend()` – a function providing more granular control compared to the `CFMAIL` tag itself. This level of control is beneficial when dealing with bulk mailing scenarios or requiring more sophisticated error handling.  Furthermore, it allows for easier integration with other aspects of the application's logic.  The use of the `MailSend()` function requires prior configuration.

**Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend reviewing the official ColdFusion documentation regarding the `CFMAIL` tag and the `MailSend()` function.  Familiarize yourself with different looping constructs within CFScript, including `cfloop`, `for`, and `while` loops.  Also, consulting ColdFusion-specific books and online tutorials focusing on email sending and database interaction will enhance your understanding of best practices and troubleshooting techniques.  Pay close attention to the examples provided in these resources. These materials usually emphasize the importance of explicit iteration when dealing with multiple records.  Understanding the limitations of the `CFMAIL` tag's implicit behavior is vital for avoiding unexpected outcomes.  Finally, the use of a debugger can be invaluable for identifying the precise point where the email generation process fails, especially in more complex applications.
