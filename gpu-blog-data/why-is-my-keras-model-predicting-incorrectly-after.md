The discrepancy between a Keras model's performance during training and after loading from a saved state often stems from inconsistencies in the model's input preprocessing pipeline.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects highlighted this repeatedly:  a seemingly minor difference in data normalization or augmentation applied during prediction, absent from the training loop, can dramatically impact accuracy.  Let's examine the potential causes and solutions.


**1.  Data Preprocessing Discrepancies:**

This is the most frequent culprit.  During training, we typically apply various transformations to our input data â€“ normalization, standardization, resizing, data augmentation, etc.  If the exact same transformations aren't meticulously applied during prediction using the loaded model, the model will receive input data fundamentally different from what it learned to process. The model's internal weights are optimized for a specific data distribution; deviating from this distribution throws off its predictions.

For instance, if your training data undergoes mean subtraction and division by standard deviation, ensuring that the same process is applied to the prediction data is crucial.  Forgetting a single step, or using different parameters (e.g., calculating the mean and standard deviation from a different dataset), can lead to significant prediction errors.  Similarly, any data augmentation strategies employed during training (random cropping, flipping, etc.) must be consistently applied or disabled during the prediction phase to maintain consistency.

**2.  Incorrect Model Loading:**

While less common than data preprocessing issues, improper loading of the model weights can also result in incorrect predictions.  Keras offers several ways to save and load models, including saving the model architecture and weights separately or using the `model.save()` method, which bundles them together.  The latter is generally preferred for simplicity, but mistakes can still occur.

Errors can arise from loading a model trained with a different backend (TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK), or even different versions of the Keras API.  Incompatibility issues here can manifest as incorrect weight loading, leading to unpredictable results.  Moreover, it is crucial to verify the exact model architecture matches the one used during training.

**3.  Missing Custom Layers or Functions:**

If your model employs custom layers or functions (defined outside the Keras core API), these must be properly defined and available during the prediction phase.  If these custom components are absent or defined differently, the model's structure will be incomplete, effectively rendering the loaded weights unusable.  This frequently happens when moving projects between different environments or when collaborating on code. The model loading process might succeed, but the internal structure will not be correctly established for inference.

**4.  Incorrect Input Shape:**

The input shape expected by the model should precisely match the shape of the data being provided during prediction.  A mismatch in dimensions, even by a single element, will prevent the model from correctly processing the input, leading to inaccurate or nonsensical predictions.  This often manifests as a `ValueError` or similar exception, but sometimes, less obvious errors are observed.  Thorough inspection of the model's `input_shape` attribute and validation of the prediction data's shape is crucial.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are three examples showcasing potential issues and their solutions.


**Example 1: Data Normalization Inconsistency:**


```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Training
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.astype("float32") / 255
x_test = x_test.astype("float32") / 255
mean = np.mean(x_train)
std = np.std(x_train)
x_train = (x_train - mean) / std
model = keras.models.Sequential([keras.layers.Flatten(), keras.layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax")])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)
model.save('my_model.h5')


# Prediction (Incorrect)
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
x_new = x_test[0:10]  #For brevity
predictions = loaded_model.predict(x_new) #Prediction will be inaccurate because normalization is missing

# Prediction (Correct)
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
x_new = x_test[0:10]
x_new = (x_new.astype("float32") - mean) / std  #Normalize before prediction
predictions = loaded_model.predict(x_new)
```

This example demonstrates a missing normalization step during prediction.  The corrected section applies the same mean subtraction and standardization used during training.


**Example 2:  Missing Custom Layer:**


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Custom Layer Definition (during training)
class MyLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__()

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.sqrt(inputs)

# Training
model = keras.models.Sequential([MyLayer(), keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)  #x_train, y_train defined as in Example 1
model.save('custom_layer_model.h5')

# Prediction (Incorrect - Missing Custom Layer)
try:
    loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('custom_layer_model.h5')
    predictions = loaded_model.predict(x_test) #Will raise an error
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")

# Prediction (Correct)
from my_custom_layer import MyLayer #Assuming MyLayer is in my_custom_layer.py
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('custom_layer_model.h5', custom_objects={'MyLayer': MyLayer})
predictions = loaded_model.predict(x_test)
```

This example shows that if `MyLayer` isn't available during model loading, it will fail.  The solution involves explicitly defining the custom layer using `custom_objects` during loading.


**Example 3: Incorrect Input Shape:**


```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Training
model = keras.models.Sequential([keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)), keras.layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax")])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)  #x_train, y_train defined as in Example 1
model.save('shape_mismatch_model.h5')

# Prediction (Incorrect - Wrong Input Shape)
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('shape_mismatch_model.h5')
x_new = np.reshape(x_test[0:10],(10,784)) #Incorrect shape
try:
    predictions = loaded_model.predict(x_new)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Prediction error: {e}")

# Prediction (Correct)
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('shape_mismatch_model.h5')
x_new = x_test[0:10] #Correct shape
predictions = loaded_model.predict(x_new)
```

This example highlights how a mismatch in the input tensor's shape leads to a `ValueError`.  Ensuring the input data matches the expected shape defined during model creation is essential.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding of Keras model saving and loading, consult the official Keras documentation.  Furthermore,  review the TensorFlow documentation for details on saving and restoring TensorFlow models, as Keras models inherently rely on the TensorFlow backend.  Finally, a deep dive into the NumPy library's array manipulation capabilities will enhance your ability to handle data preprocessing effectively.
