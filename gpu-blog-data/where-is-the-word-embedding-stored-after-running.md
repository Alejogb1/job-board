The core data representing word embeddings generated by `word2vec.py` in TensorFlow is not stored as a standalone file in the typical sense. It exists as a variable within the TensorFlow computational graph, specifically within the model's weights. This variable, often named something like `embedding` or `embeddings`, holds the learned vector representations for each vocabulary item after training. The `word2vec.py` script doesn't, by default, export these embeddings to an external format. Understanding this requires a grasp of how TensorFlow models operate and persist their parameters.

The TensorFlow model in `word2vec.py` is constructed to learn the relationships between words based on their context within a given text corpus. The training process involves updating these vector representations through an optimization algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient descent). The actual embeddings are therefore embedded within the neural network’s parameters, not independent artifacts. This is crucial to remember when attempting to access them later; we aren’t looking for a simple `.txt` file holding our vectors. They are instead a tensor stored in a checkpoint file, the same way that other model parameters (e.g. weights and biases) are.

To elaborate, the process typically involves the following steps within `word2vec.py` (or similar custom implementation)

1.  **Vocabulary Creation**: A vocabulary is built from the training data, mapping each unique word to an integer ID. This forms the basis for indexing into the embedding matrix.
2.  **Embedding Layer Definition**: An embedding layer is defined as a TensorFlow variable, initialized randomly, having a shape of `[vocabulary_size, embedding_size]`. This embedding size corresponds to the length of each embedding vector and is a hyperparameter.
3.  **Training the Model**: During training, the network is trained to predict the surrounding context words, and it refines the embedding vectors iteratively. Each vector essentially represents a unique word's semantics, and the distances between these vectors reflect relationships between the words.
4.  **Persistence (optional)**: The script may or may not include a specific function to export the weights to a more usable format. Typically, if you intend to retrieve these weights later, you would save the whole graph and the trained parameters.

The lack of direct storage arises from TensorFlow’s architecture. The graph itself and any trainable variables, including the embedding vectors, are often saved using checkpoint files. These files are the standard mechanism to persist TensorFlow models and typically are composed of multiple files (`.index`, `.meta` and `.data` files), that collectively represent the complete set of parameters of a trained model.

The following examples demonstrate how you might extract and manipulate embeddings using various means, since the built-in `word2vec.py` doesn't provide this directly.

**Example 1: Accessing Embeddings Post Training (General approach)**

This code demonstrates the general structure needed to access the embedding layer. Assuming you have a trained model saved, this is a common way of retrieving the embedding matrix directly using TensorFlow mechanisms.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'checkpoint_path' points to the folder with your trained model.
checkpoint_path = './model_checkpoints' # Replace with the actual path

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Load the saved graph.
    saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph(checkpoint_path + '.meta')
    saver.restore(sess, tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_path))

    # Get the operations that correspond to your embedding matrix and vocabulary
    graph = tf.get_default_graph()
    embeddings_variable = graph.get_tensor_by_name("embedding_matrix:0")
    # Replace 'vocabulary_mapping' with how you've stored your vocabulary indices
    # (e.g., a Python dictionary, or a separate .npy file).
    vocab = {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 3}

    # Get embeddings for words "apple" and "banana".
    embedding_matrix = sess.run(embeddings_variable)
    apple_id = vocab.get('apple')
    banana_id = vocab.get('banana')

    apple_embedding = embedding_matrix[apple_id]
    banana_embedding = embedding_matrix[banana_id]
    
    print("Apple embedding:", apple_embedding)
    print("Banana embedding:", banana_embedding)

```

**Explanation:** This script does the following: Loads the TensorFlow graph from a previously saved checkpoint. It then accesses the tensor that holds the embeddings by the name, typically `embedding_matrix:0` (although name varies based on script). Subsequently, for demonstration purposes, we fetch the embeddings for words "apple" and "banana" by looking them up in a pre-defined dictionary which contains an integer based vocabulary mapping. Finally, we print the embedding vector to the console.

**Example 2: Saving Embeddings to a .txt (User defined output)**

This code shows how you might export the learned embeddings from the model to a simple text file, so you can use them later for other purposes without necessarily requiring TensorFlow. This code block assumes that the variables and graph have been loaded similar to the first code block.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume the saved checkpoint and session exist like in example 1
checkpoint_path = './model_checkpoints' # Replace with the actual path

with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Load the saved graph.
    saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph(checkpoint_path + '.meta')
    saver.restore(sess, tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_path))

    # Get the operations that correspond to your embedding matrix and vocabulary
    graph = tf.get_default_graph()
    embeddings_variable = graph.get_tensor_by_name("embedding_matrix:0")
    # Replace 'vocabulary_mapping' with how you've stored your vocabulary indices
    # (e.g., a Python dictionary, or a separate .npy file).
    vocab = {1: 'apple', 2: 'banana', 3: 'orange'}

    # Get embeddings for words "apple" and "banana".
    embedding_matrix = sess.run(embeddings_variable)

    output_path = 'word_embeddings.txt' # Choose file path
    with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
        for word_id, word in vocab.items():
            embedding = embedding_matrix[word_id]
            embedding_str = ' '.join(str(x) for x in embedding) # Convert to string representation
            f.write(f"{word} {embedding_str}\n")
    print(f"Embeddings saved to {output_path}")


```

**Explanation:**  This snippet extends the first example by adding a mechanism for saving to disk. After fetching the embedding matrix, it iterates through the vocabulary and retrieves the embeddings of the words. Each embedding is then converted to a string, space-separated, and then written to a text file along with the corresponding word. This text file can then be used for tasks that do not require TensorFlow's graph.

**Example 3: Using `tf.train.Saver` to store the whole model**

This final example demonstrates how you should typically save and reload your models, using the Saver class. Rather than saving the model's weights in some other format like the above, this code showcases a common practice in TensorFlow, where you store the model as checkpoint files.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define an embedding matrix - a toy example for demonstration purposes
embedding_size = 128
vocabulary_size = 1000
with tf.variable_scope("embedding_scope"):
    embedding_matrix = tf.get_variable(
        name="embedding_matrix",
        shape=[vocabulary_size, embedding_size],
        initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer()
    )

# Other model variables can be defined here
# ...

# Define a saver object
saver = tf.train.Saver()

# Train the model as needed.
# ...

checkpoint_path = './model_checkpoints' # Replace with actual path
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    # Save checkpoint
    saver.save(sess, checkpoint_path)
    print(f"Model saved to {checkpoint_path}")

#  Later, restoring from this checkpoint.
with tf.Session() as sess_restore:
    # Restore the graph
    saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph(checkpoint_path + '.meta')
    saver.restore(sess_restore, tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_path))

    graph_restore = tf.get_default_graph()
    loaded_embedding_matrix = graph_restore.get_tensor_by_name("embedding_scope/embedding_matrix:0")

    # Optionally access specific vectors from the loaded matrix, similarly to example 1
    vocab = {1: 'apple', 2: 'banana', 3: 'orange'}
    loaded_embedding_matrix = sess_restore.run(loaded_embedding_matrix)
    apple_id = 1
    apple_embedding = loaded_embedding_matrix[apple_id]
    print("Apple embedding:", apple_embedding)

```

**Explanation:** Here we see the process of defining a model, in this case just including the embedding layer, saving it to a checkpoint, and then restoring it. We create a Saver object, and use that object to save the whole model into a file using the save method. In a later session we re-load it using `tf.train.import_meta_graph` and retrieve the embedding matrix from the loaded graph.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a detailed comprehension, consult the TensorFlow documentation on variables, saving and restoring models, and how to work with the computational graph. Online courses focused on deep learning or natural language processing with TensorFlow will offer practical insights into the entire model creation and deployment process. The code repositories for existing text-based models may also be valuable since these often incorporate embeddings. Look for repositories that use TensorFlow, and examine their model creation and storage pipelines.
