TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) models, primarily designed for efficient inference on resource-constrained devices, traditionally operate on a single, monolithic computation graph. However, integrating subgraphs from Keras models allows for more flexible deployment strategies, often enabling selective execution or model partitioning for specialized hardware. I've personally encountered this when optimizing a complex image processing pipeline for an edge device where certain feature extraction layers needed hardware acceleration unavailable to the entire model.

The core challenge lies in the fact that TFLite's flatbuffer representation does not natively support arbitrary subgraph definitions as they appear in Keras' functional API or Sequential models. These Keras subgraphs are conceptual units that, when the full model is converted to TFLite, are resolved into the single, flattened operation sequence. The key to using 'subgraphs' with TFLite involves extracting and converting them to independent TFLite models which then can be composed using custom logic at deployment time, rather than at the conversion stage. This approach utilizes TFLite as a container for smaller, specialized computational units.

Here’s a breakdown of how one would approach this, drawing from my experience:

**1. Identifying and Isolating Subgraphs:**

The process begins with identifying the Keras model's computational sections you wish to isolate. These might be pre-processing layers, feature extractors, or specific branches within a more complex architecture. I recommend structuring your Keras model with the intent of subgraph extraction from the design phase. Using Keras' functional API makes this easier, as you can directly reference intermediate layer outputs to define new models. This avoids the need for messy slicing operations on a sequential model's structure.

**2. Extracting Subgraphs as Independent Keras Models:**

Once subgraphs are identified, they must be converted into distinct, self-contained Keras models. This is accomplished by using the Keras functional API to define new model instances, using specific inputs and outputs from the original model. The new model encapsulates exactly the computation required for the subgraph, allowing for individual conversion to TFLite.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Example: Original Keras Model
input_tensor = keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_tensor)
x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
intermediate_output = x  # Intermediate layer output for subgraph 1
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(x)
x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = keras.layers.Flatten()(x)
x = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
full_model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=x)


# Example: Subgraph 1 extraction. Feature Extraction Part
subgraph1_model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=intermediate_output)
# Output of the model is the intermediate output from the original model.

# Print the summary to verify the architecture.
subgraph1_model.summary()
```
**Commentary on Example 1:** This initial code segment shows how a Keras model is constructed and then how a specific section of the model is extracted and re-defined as a model, named `subgraph1_model`. The key here is the use of the intermediate tensor `intermediate_output`. This tensor is the output of a layer within the original `full_model` which we re-define as the output of `subgraph1_model`. This results in `subgraph1_model` encompassing only the first few layers of the `full_model`’s architecture.

**3. Conversion to Independent TFLite Models:**

Following subgraph extraction, each Keras model must be converted to its own TFLite representation. This is done via the TensorFlow Lite converter, specifying the Keras model as the source and setting the target type to TFLite. Care must be taken with quantization settings and data type conversion if needed to maintain numerical accuracy of each isolated subgraph. When doing this I often encountered small deviations in output values so ensuring I used the same conversion settings on every subgraph was critical.

```python
# Example: Converting Keras subgraphs to TFLite models
converter1 = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(subgraph1_model)
tflite_model1 = converter1.convert()

with open("subgraph1.tflite", 'wb') as f:
  f.write(tflite_model1)
```

**Commentary on Example 2:** Here we observe how an instance of the `TFLiteConverter` is created with the extracted `subgraph1_model` and converted to its TFLite counterpart, saving the resulting binary data to disk.  Crucially, we convert each subgraph to TFLite separately, resulting in several TFLite models. The same process must be done for any remaining isolated subgraphs.

**4. Custom Inference Logic and Composition:**

Once all subgraphs are converted into independent TFLite models, application-specific inference logic is required to link the outputs of one model to the inputs of another. The TFLite interpreter API is used to load these individual models and perform computations, forwarding outputs from one TFLite inference to the next in a specific sequence. In this way, we can reconstruct the complete computation flow across the subgraphs of the original Keras model. Often, specific optimization methods, like offloading computationally demanding subgraphs to specialized accelerator hardware, can be added to the inference logic.

```python
import numpy as np
# Example: Inference with TFLite subgraphs

#Loading the tflite model
interpreter1 = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="subgraph1.tflite")
interpreter1.allocate_tensors()

# Fetch input and output tensors
input_details1 = interpreter1.get_input_details()
output_details1 = interpreter1.get_output_details()


# Creating dummy input. It must have the same shape as the model's input.
input_data1 = np.random.rand(1,28, 28, 1).astype(np.float32)

# Running the first model with our dummy input.
interpreter1.set_tensor(input_details1[0]['index'], input_data1)
interpreter1.invoke()
output_data1 = interpreter1.get_tensor(output_details1[0]['index'])

# Output of subgraph 1 becomes input to a hypothetical subgraph 2. The following is not included in full but illustrates the general idea.
# In real implementations, several operations for shaping and handling data can occur here.
# This is the place to add specialized processing for each subgraph or use external functions that work with the output from each subgraph

print("Output shape of subgraph 1:", output_data1.shape)
# Example of next step in the process.
# Interpreter2 = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="subgraph2.tflite")
# Interpreter2.allocate_tensors()
# input_details2 = interpreter2.get_input_details()
# interpreter2.set_tensor(input_details2[0]['index'], output_data1)
# interpreter2.invoke()
# output_data2 = interpreter2.get_tensor(output_details2[0]['index'])
```

**Commentary on Example 3:** This example illustrates the inference process of the first TFLite subgraph. First, the TFLite model is loaded. Next, an input tensor is constructed which conforms to the input specifications of the model. Then, the inference process is launched. The output tensor, after the model has run, is printed to display its shape, before being forwarded to a hypothetic `subgraph 2` interpreter. This showcases the iterative nature of subgraph inference.  I can add preprocessing, postprocessing and other arbitrary operations before and after each subgraph execution, enhancing flexibility.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding and practical application, consulting several sources is highly recommended. Begin with the official TensorFlow documentation, focusing on the TFLite conversion API and the interpreter usage guide. Also, researching papers on model partitioning and edge computing will provide the necessary context for understanding the applications of these methods. Finally, studying code examples from community projects will offer specific implementation strategies, and you should prioritize examples that are actively maintained. These resources combined will enable efficient design and implementation of TFLite based model infrastructures using Keras subgraphs. The approach I’ve outlined here offers not just modularity but opens up avenues for heterogeneous deployment on specialized hardware by selective TFLite model application.
