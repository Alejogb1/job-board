The reduction of array dimensionality from 3 to 2 in Batch Normalization (BN) is not inherent to the algorithm itself, but rather a consequence of how it's often implemented and the input data's structure.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects has highlighted this frequently.  BN operates on a per-feature basis, normalizing activations within each feature map across the batch dimension.  The apparent dimensionality reduction arises from a misunderstanding of the operation's scope and the representation of the data.

**1. Clarification of Batch Normalization and Dimensionality**

Batch Normalization normalizes the activations of a layer for each feature map individually. Consider a convolutional layer's output: a tensor with dimensions (N, C, H, W), where N represents the batch size, C the number of channels (or feature maps), and H and W the height and width of each feature map, respectively.  The normalization process operates independently on each channel. For a specific channel *c*, it computes the mean and variance across the batch dimension N, normalizing each activation (h, w) within that channel.  This normalization step does not reduce the spatial dimensions (H, W); it transforms the values within each (H, W) grid.

The apparent dimensionality reduction from 3 to 2 often stems from a simplified illustration or a specific application where the spatial dimensions (H, W) are collapsed or implicitly handled.  For instance, if you're processing data where H and W are 1 (e.g., a fully connected layer's output viewed as a 2D tensor), then the normalization would seemingly operate on a (N, C) tensor, yielding a (N, C) normalized tensor.  This creates the illusion of a dimensionality reduction. However, the core BN operation remains unchanged; it simply normalizes individual features across the batch.

The key misunderstanding is viewing BN as a dimensionality reduction technique rather than a normalization technique.  It's a transformation applied within existing dimensions, not a reduction of those dimensions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate Batch Normalization's behavior in various scenarios, highlighting the preservation of spatial dimensions.  I have deliberately used a simplified approach to clarify the fundamental mechanics.

**Example 1:  Convolutional Layer Output**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate a convolutional layer output
input_tensor = np.random.rand(64, 3, 28, 28)  # (N, C, H, W) = (64, 3, 28, 28)

# Batch Normalization (simplified, without momentum or learning parameters)
def batch_norm(x):
    axis = (0) # Normalize across batch dimension
    mean = np.mean(x, axis=axis, keepdims=True)
    var = np.var(x, axis=axis, keepdims=True) + 1e-5 # Adding a small constant for numerical stability
    normalized_x = (x - mean) / np.sqrt(var)
    return normalized_x

output_tensor = np.zeros_like(input_tensor)
for c in range(input_tensor.shape[1]): #Iterate through channels
    output_tensor[:,c,:,:] = batch_norm(input_tensor[:,c,:,:])


print("Input shape:", input_tensor.shape)    #(64, 3, 28, 28)
print("Output shape:", output_tensor.shape)   #(64, 3, 28, 28)

```

This example shows that even with a convolutional layer output, the shape remains unchanged. The normalization happens per-channel.

**Example 2: Fully Connected Layer (Flattened)**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate a fully connected layer output
input_tensor = np.random.rand(64, 1024) # (N, F) = (64, 1024)

# Batch Normalization (simplified)
def batch_norm(x):
    axis = (0)
    mean = np.mean(x, axis=axis, keepdims=True)
    var = np.var(x, axis=axis, keepdims=True) + 1e-5
    normalized_x = (x - mean) / np.sqrt(var)
    return normalized_x

output_tensor = batch_norm(input_tensor)

print("Input shape:", input_tensor.shape)     #(64, 1024)
print("Output shape:", output_tensor.shape)    #(64, 1024)
```

Here, the input is already 2D, representing a flattened fully connected layer.  BN still operates along the batch dimension, maintaining the dimensionality.  No reduction occurs.


**Example 3:  Handling potential reshape scenarios**

This example demonstrates a scenario that *might* lead to the misconception of dimensionality reduction.  However, it's a user-defined data manipulation, not inherent to BN.

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate data that might lead to the misconception
input_tensor = np.random.rand(64, 3, 28, 28) # (N, C, H, W)

#Incorrectly reshaping before normalization
reshaped_input = np.reshape(input_tensor, (64, 3*28*28))

# Batch Normalization (simplified)
def batch_norm(x):
    axis = (0)
    mean = np.mean(x, axis=axis, keepdims=True)
    var = np.var(x, axis=axis, keepdims=True) + 1e-5
    normalized_x = (x - mean) / np.sqrt(var)
    return normalized_x

normalized_data = batch_norm(reshaped_input)

print("Reshaped input shape:", reshaped_input.shape)  #(64, 2352)
print("Normalized data shape:", normalized_data.shape) #(64, 2352)

```

In this case, the user explicitly reshapes the data *before* applying BN. The resulting dimensionality appears reduced because the spatial information is lost due to flattening.  The actual BN operation, however, is still 2D.  The dimensionality reduction is a pre-processing step, not an inherent aspect of BN.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

I recommend reviewing  "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville;  "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron; and research papers on Batch Normalization for a comprehensive understanding of its mathematical formulation and applications.  Consult the documentation of deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch for implementation details.  These resources offer a more rigorous treatment of the underlying mathematics and various implementations.
