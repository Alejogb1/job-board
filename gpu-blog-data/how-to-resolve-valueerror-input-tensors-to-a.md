The `ValueError: Input tensors to a Functional must come from `tf.keras.Input` error in TensorFlow/Keras arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of how functional models are constructed.  In essence, the error indicates that you're attempting to use a tensor created outside the `tf.keras.Input` layer as an input to your functional model. This violates the directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure that defines the functional API, resulting in this specific exception.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image recognition projects has highlighted the importance of meticulously tracing the origin and flow of tensors within a functional model.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Keras functional API provides a flexible way to build complex neural networks by defining layers and their connections explicitly. Unlike the sequential API, which stacks layers linearly, the functional API allows for arbitrary connections, branching, and merging of layers.  This flexibility requires a stricter approach to input definition.  Every tensor used as an input to any layer *within* the functional model *must* be generated by a `tf.keras.Input` layer.  This `tf.keras.Input` layer serves as the formal entry point for data into the model's computational graph.  Attempting to feed a tensor created elsewhere (e.g., through intermediate computations or loaded from a file) directly into a layer will trigger the `ValueError`.  The reason for this restriction is to maintain the model's structural integrity and enable proper tracking of dependencies for operations like backpropagation during training.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Usage**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect: Tensor 'x' not created by tf.keras.Input
x = tf.random.normal((10, 10))
dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64)(x)
dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(dense1)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=x, outputs=dense2) #Error occurs here
```

This code will generate the error. The tensor `x` is created directly using `tf.random.normal()`, not through `tf.keras.Input`.  The `tf.keras.Model` constructor attempts to use this externally generated tensor as the input, violating the functional API's rules.


**Example 2: Correct Usage**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_layer = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))  # Correct: Input tensor from tf.keras.Input
dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_layer)
dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(dense1)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense2)

# This model is correctly defined.
```

This corrected version starts with `tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))`, which defines the input tensor's shape.  All subsequent layers receive tensors originating from this `tf.keras.Input` layer, directly or indirectly.  The `tf.keras.Model` constructor correctly identifies the input and output tensors.


**Example 3: Handling Multiple Inputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_a = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,), name='input_a')
input_b = tf.keras.Input(shape=(20,), name='input_b')

dense_a = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(input_a)
dense_b = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(input_b)

merged = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([dense_a, dense_b])
dense_merged = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(merged)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=dense_merged)
```

This example demonstrates how to handle multiple inputs in a functional model.  Both `input_a` and `input_b` are explicitly defined using `tf.keras.Input`.  The `concatenate` layer merges their outputs before feeding the result to the final dense layer. The model's input is a list containing both input layers.  This highlights the flexibility of the functional API in handling complex network architectures.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on the Keras functional API provides comprehensive details on its usage and capabilities.  Reviewing the section on creating models using the functional API is crucial.  Furthermore,  referencing a good introductory text or online course focusing on deep learning fundamentals will solidify your understanding of the underlying principles of neural network architectures and graph construction.  Finally, exploring advanced Keras examples, potentially from reputable research papers or online repositories, can greatly expand your practical knowledge and expose you to sophisticated model designs.  Working through the examples in these resources will reinforce your understanding of the `tf.keras.Input` layer's role. This practical approach, coupled with a solid theoretical foundation, is invaluable for avoiding this and other common TensorFlow errors.
