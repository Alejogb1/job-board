Executable formats like ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) and PE (Portable Executable) primarily focus on describing the structure of code and data intended for execution on the central processing unit (CPU). They do not inherently possess standardized, universally recognized mechanisms for directly specifying GPU-specific sections or loading instructions targeted towards a graphics processing unit's specific architecture. My experience over the past decade working with low-level systems, particularly on embedded platforms utilizing heterogeneous processing, has consistently reinforced this. This separation arises because GPUs, unlike CPUs, operate under a diverse range of architectures and driver models, making a one-size-fits-all approach within the standard ELF or PE format exceptionally complex.

The primary function of ELF and PE loaders, as implemented by operating systems, is to map memory regions for CPU execution, establish initial execution contexts, and resolve symbols. These actions typically involve the interpretation of standard section headers, segment definitions, relocation records, and import tables. Crucially, these mechanisms do not include specifications that can explicitly describe or prepare code or data sections meant to be dispatched and executed by a GPU. This lack of GPU specificity is not an accidental omission; it’s a consequence of the fundamentally different paradigms between CPU and GPU computation, particularly in areas like memory management and kernel execution models.

While ELF and PE formats, in their base specifications, are not GPU-aware, I have, over time, encountered several practical approaches that systems and runtime environments utilize to bridge this gap. These techniques do not involve modifications to the core ELF or PE specifications, but rather utilize existing sections and mechanisms in creative ways, coupled with custom runtime environments that manage GPU interaction.

One common method involves the packaging of GPU kernels within standard data sections. For example, a ‘.data’ or similar section might be used to store compiled OpenCL or CUDA kernels as binary blobs. The operating system loader simply loads this section as ordinary data into process memory. It is then up to the application's runtime environment or a device driver to identify this section as a GPU kernel, copy it to the GPU’s memory, and launch the kernel.

Another technique involves using specialized sections, not directly interpreted by the standard loader, but rather by custom loaders implemented in userspace or in driver space. This typically involves extending the ‘.note’ sections in ELF (or similar mechanisms within PE) to embed additional meta-data that informs the runtime how to treat specific sections. This meta-data may include the type of GPU target (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, etc.), the compute language (CUDA, OpenCL, Vulkan compute), or other relevant specifics. The OS loader, in this case, remains completely oblivious to these sections, simply loading them into memory as ‘uninterpreted’ data. I have observed that this approach gives the developers the flexibility required by rapidly evolving GPU technologies and programming models.

A third technique is to utilize separate executable or binary files specifically targeting the GPU. These files are not standard ELF or PE files, and might be formats entirely specific to the GPU vendor, like NVIDIA's PTX format or AMD's ISA format. The main application, which would be loaded as a standard ELF or PE, would load and manage these separate binaries using its own custom code or GPU vendor APIs. I've seen this pattern used frequently in high-performance computing applications using specialized accelerators.

Here are three illustrative code examples that exemplify these approaches (using pseudo-code for brevity):

**Example 1: Data Section Storage of GPU Kernel**

```c
// Pseudo-code representing application loading a kernel stored in a data section
// Assume the kernel_data is loaded from the .data section of an ELF or PE file
unsigned char *kernel_data;  // Pointer to the loaded kernel binary data
size_t kernel_size;           // Size of the kernel data

// Assume some system-specific API to load the kernel onto the GPU
int load_kernel_onto_gpu(unsigned char *data, size_t size, void* gpu_device);

void execute_gpu_kernel() {

   // Assume 'my_gpu' represents a specific GPU handle
   void *my_gpu = find_gpu();

   // Load the kernel data onto the GPU
   int status = load_kernel_onto_gpu(kernel_data, kernel_size, my_gpu);

   if (status == 0) {
      // Kernel loaded successfully, proceed to execute
       // ... Perform kernel invocation specific to the API

   } else {
      // Handle kernel loading error.
   }
}
```

In this example, the `kernel_data` and `kernel_size` variables are assumed to be loaded as part of the main executable's data section. The `load_kernel_onto_gpu` function is specific to the platform and graphics API. The OS loader only reads the data segment, while this code then interprets the specific data as a GPU kernel.

**Example 2: Using `.note` Section for GPU Meta-Data**

```c
// Pseudo-code assuming '.note' section contains special metadata
typedef struct {
   uint32_t type;   // GPU vendor type
   uint32_t language;  // compute language
   uint64_t kernel_data_offset; // Offset to the kernel in memory.
   uint64_t kernel_data_size;    // Size of the kernel in memory.

} gpu_metadata_t;

// Assume get_note_section returns a pointer to the start of the notes and their length
void* get_note_section(size_t* length);

void* load_gpu_kernel_from_note()
{
  size_t notes_len;
  void* note_section = get_note_section(&notes_len);

  if (note_section == NULL) return NULL;

  // Search through the notes for the custom GPU metadata block (assuming some known ID/type)
  gpu_metadata_t* metadata = NULL; // Find our custom metadata, details omitted

  if (metadata != NULL)
  {
    // Use the meta-data to find the binary kernel data, likely in a data section.
    void* gpu_kernel_start_address = ((char*)note_section + metadata->kernel_data_offset);
    size_t gpu_kernel_size = metadata->kernel_data_size;

    // Further logic to load on the specific GPU based on metadata->type and meta-data->language

    return gpu_kernel_start_address;
  }
  return NULL;

}
```
This example demonstrates how a custom runtime would parse the notes sections to gather meta data about GPU kernels locations and types. The OS loader itself still loads this section as opaque data. This technique grants a separation of concerns.

**Example 3: Handling separate GPU Binary Files**

```c
// Pseudo code to load a dedicated GPU file.
// Assume that GPU binary file paths are known at application runtime.

// Some platform-specific GPU library API call
int load_gpu_binary(const char* path, void* gpu_device);

void execute_gpu_with_binary(const char* binary_path) {

    void* my_gpu = find_gpu(); //Obtain handle to the GPU device

    if(load_gpu_binary(binary_path, my_gpu) == 0){
        // Kernel loaded successfully, proceed to execute
          // ...  Execute the loaded kernel
    } else {
         // Handle errors.
    }
}

int main(int argc, char** argv){

    // ...
    const char* my_gpu_binary = "my_gpu_kernel.ptx";

    execute_gpu_with_binary(my_gpu_binary);

  return 0;
}
```

Here, the main executable, loaded using a standard ELF or PE loader, is responsible for locating and loading separate files containing the GPU-specific code. The OS loader does not handle these additional binary files.

In my experience, operating systems do not currently have concrete, universally adopted plans to standardize the inclusion of GPU-specific sections within ELF or PE. The variety of GPU architectures, associated driver models, and high rate of innovation in GPU computing makes establishing such standards difficult. Instead, various techniques involving custom runtimes and driver extensions prevail.

For further exploration, I recommend studying the ELF format specifications (especially regarding the .note section), examining the Portable Executable file format, and investigating relevant documentation for GPU programming APIs such as CUDA, OpenCL, and Vulkan. Furthermore, consider examining the architecture and driver interfaces for specific GPU hardware. These resources will provide a comprehensive foundation for understanding the current interplay between operating systems and GPUs regarding code loading and execution.
