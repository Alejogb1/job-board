GPUs, while integral to modern computing, are not immune to the effects of malicious software.  My experience troubleshooting high-performance computing clusters over the past decade has revealed that while GPUs themselves don't contract viruses in the same way a CPU might, they are vulnerable through indirect attack vectors.  The threat model is not centered on the GPU's inherent architecture, but rather its interaction with the host system and associated software.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

A computer virus, broadly defined, requires executable code capable of self-replication and potentially harmful actions.  GPUs, lacking an independent operating system and relying entirely on instructions from the CPU and associated software drivers, cannot independently execute arbitrary code.  Therefore, a GPU cannot be infected in the traditional sense of a virus residing and replicating *within* its memory.  However, malicious code running on the host CPU can leverage the GPU for malicious purposes. This is achieved through several avenues.  Firstly, the driver software that manages the GPU's interaction with the CPU is a potential vulnerability.  A compromised driver can potentially issue commands to the GPU that perform unauthorized computations, leading to data theft or other harmful effects.  Secondly, the memory allocated to the GPU by the host system, whether system RAM or dedicated GPU memory, is subject to the same access control mechanisms as the rest of the system's memory.  Malicious code with sufficient privileges can corrupt or manipulate data within this memory, affecting GPU operations. Finally,  malware can exploit vulnerabilities in the applications utilizing the GPU, indirectly influencing GPU behavior.  For example, a compromised game client might inject malicious code into the GPUâ€™s shaders, potentially leading to data exfiltration.

The key is understanding the indirect nature of the threat. The GPU is a component; the vulnerability lies within the software ecosystem managing and utilizing it.  This necessitates a layered security approach, focusing on the host system, drivers, and applications, rather than the GPU itself.


2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential scenarios of malicious GPU exploitation, focusing on conceptual representations rather than specific malware implementations.  Note that reproducing these examples for malicious purposes is unethical and illegal.

**Example 1: Driver-level Manipulation (Conceptual Python):**

```python
# Conceptual representation - NOT functional malware
import ctypes  # Assume a hypothetical vulnerable driver interface

# ... (Code to obtain driver handle and exploit a vulnerability)...

# Malicious command sent to GPU via driver interface
malicious_command = ctypes.c_void_p(0xDEADBEEF) # Replace with actual exploit code
result = driver_interface.send_command(malicious_command)

if result == 0:
    print("Malicious command successfully executed on GPU")
else:
    print("Command execution failed")
```

This example highlights how a compromised driver (represented by `driver_interface`) can be leveraged to send arbitrary commands (`malicious_command`) to the GPU.  In reality, such an exploit would be significantly more complex, requiring knowledge of specific driver vulnerabilities and low-level programming techniques.


**Example 2: Memory Corruption (Conceptual C):**

```c
// Conceptual representation - NOT functional malware
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  // Assume GPU memory is mapped to a system address space
  void* gpu_memory = (void*)0x10000000; // Hypothetical GPU memory address

  // Overwrite a section of GPU memory with malicious data
  char* malicious_data = "MALICIOUS DATA";
  memcpy(gpu_memory, malicious_data, strlen(malicious_data));

  printf("GPU memory overwritten\n");
  return 0;
}
```

This simplistic illustration shows how direct manipulation of GPU memory (represented by `gpu_memory`), which is possible only with elevated privileges, could introduce malicious data. This data, depending on the application, could alter computation, potentially leading to data manipulation or denial-of-service scenarios.


**Example 3: Shader Injection (Conceptual GLSL):**

```glsl
// Conceptual representation - NOT functional malware
#version 330 core

out vec4 FragColor;

void main() {
    // Normal fragment shader code...

    // Malicious data exfiltration attempt (conceptual)
    if (some_condition) {
        // Attempt to send data to a compromised network location
        // ... (Code to exfiltrate data from GPU memory)...
    }

    // ... rest of fragment shader code...
}
```

This example demonstrates a compromised shader program.  Through a vulnerability in the application rendering this shader, malicious code could be injected, potentially accessing and exfiltrating data from the GPU memory, hidden within seemingly benign shader operations.  The `some_condition` represents a trigger for initiating the malicious action.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of GPU architecture and security, I recommend consulting the official documentation provided by GPU vendors.  Thorough study of operating system security principles, particularly memory management and driver security, is crucial.  Furthermore, resources on software security, focusing on code injection and exploitation techniques, offer invaluable insight into the potential attack vectors.  Exploring publications on high-performance computing security will provide a broader context for understanding the challenges related to securing GPU-accelerated systems.  Finally, understanding low-level programming concepts, including assembly language programming and operating system internals, is beneficial for in-depth analysis of potential exploits.
