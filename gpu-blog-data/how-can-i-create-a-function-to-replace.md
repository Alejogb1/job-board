The core issue stems from the fact that scikit-learn's `StandardScaler`, while designed to operate on NumPy arrays, internally uses operations optimized for its pipeline and assumes a specific data structure during transformation. When directly interfacing with frameworks like TensorFlow, which might be triggered indirectly via subsequent steps, a type mismatch can occur because the raw NumPy array isn't immediately convertible to a TensorFlow tensor, manifesting as that specific `ValueError`. I've encountered this repeatedly when building custom preprocessing layers within machine learning pipelines, especially when moving away from scikit-learn's estimator pattern for more granular control.

The solution is to construct a custom standardization function that relies solely on NumPy's capabilities for mean and standard deviation calculation. This bypasses scikit-learn's internal structures, guaranteeing compatibility with any downstream framework that expects numerical arrays, including TensorFlow. The function, essentially, is a manual implementation of the standardization process (subtracting the mean, dividing by the standard deviation).

First, the function will accept a NumPy array as its primary input. Second, for robust operation, especially with small datasets or segments, it must manage cases with a zero standard deviation, usually by providing a default (e.g., setting standard deviation to 1). Lastly, for consistent use within larger pipelines, it should accept optional mean and standard deviation parameters for cases where standardization needs to be applied with precomputed values (for instance, when applying transformations on a test set using mean and standard deviations from the training set). I’ve found this feature crucial for preventing data leakage in real-world machine learning projects.

Here are the code examples, illustrating different use cases:

**Example 1: Basic Standardization**

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_standardize(data, mean=None, std=None):
    """
    Standardizes a NumPy array using mean and standard deviation.

    Args:
        data (np.ndarray): The input NumPy array.
        mean (float, optional): The mean value. If None, calculated from data.
        std (float, optional): The standard deviation. If None, calculated from data.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: The standardized NumPy array.
    """
    data = np.asarray(data)  # Ensures input is a NumPy array.

    if mean is None:
        mean = np.mean(data)
    if std is None:
        std = np.std(data)

    # Handle case of zero standard deviation
    if std == 0:
      std = 1

    standardized_data = (data - mean) / std
    return standardized_data

# Example usage:
data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
standardized_data = custom_standardize(data)
print(f"Original data: {data}")
print(f"Standardized data: {standardized_data}")
```

In this first example, the function `custom_standardize` is invoked without providing pre-calculated mean or standard deviation. The function computes these values directly from the supplied NumPy array. The function also includes a guard against cases when the std is 0, which causes a divide-by-zero error if not accounted for. This is frequently encountered during pre-processing in my projects when individual features have zero variability in a specific subset of data. The output is the standardized NumPy array, ready for use in any context where NumPy arrays are accepted. I typically include an explicit `np.asarray()` conversion at the beginning of my functions that take a numpy array as input for type-safety.

**Example 2: Standardization with Precomputed Statistics**

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_standardize(data, mean=None, std=None):
    """
    Standardizes a NumPy array using mean and standard deviation.

    Args:
        data (np.ndarray): The input NumPy array.
        mean (float, optional): The mean value. If None, calculated from data.
        std (float, optional): The standard deviation. If None, calculated from data.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: The standardized NumPy array.
    """
    data = np.asarray(data)  # Ensures input is a NumPy array.

    if mean is None:
        mean = np.mean(data)
    if std is None:
        std = np.std(data)
    # Handle case of zero standard deviation
    if std == 0:
      std = 1

    standardized_data = (data - mean) / std
    return standardized_data

# Example usage:
training_data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
training_mean = np.mean(training_data)
training_std = np.std(training_data)
test_data = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
standardized_test_data = custom_standardize(test_data, mean=training_mean, std=training_std)
print(f"Test data: {test_data}")
print(f"Standardized test data: {standardized_test_data}")
```

Here, we first compute the mean and standard deviation from a separate "training" dataset. Subsequently, when we want to apply standardization to a new "test" dataset, we reuse the mean and standard deviation computed from the training data. This scenario is very common in real-world machine learning, where you must avoid introducing bias during testing by using the training data parameters for scaling. The output is, again, the scaled NumPy array. I've used this strategy in production systems to avoid data leakage when standardizing input features.

**Example 3: Standardization of Multi-dimensional Array**

```python
import numpy as np

def custom_standardize(data, mean=None, std=None):
    """
    Standardizes a NumPy array using mean and standard deviation.
    Handles multi-dimensional arrays by standardizing each column separately.

    Args:
        data (np.ndarray): The input NumPy array.
        mean (np.ndarray, optional): The mean vector. If None, calculated from data.
        std (np.ndarray, optional): The standard deviation vector. If None, calculated from data.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: The standardized NumPy array.
    """

    data = np.asarray(data)

    if data.ndim == 1:
      if mean is None:
          mean = np.mean(data)
      if std is None:
          std = np.std(data)
      # Handle case of zero standard deviation
      if std == 0:
        std = 1
      standardized_data = (data - mean) / std
      return standardized_data

    if mean is None:
        mean = np.mean(data, axis=0)
    if std is None:
        std = np.std(data, axis=0)

    std[std == 0] = 1  #Handles case where individual feature has 0 std

    standardized_data = (data - mean) / std
    return standardized_data

# Example usage with multi-dimensional array
multi_dim_data = np.array([[1, 5, 9],
                          [2, 6, 10],
                          [3, 7, 11],
                          [4, 8, 12]])
standardized_multi_dim_data = custom_standardize(multi_dim_data)
print(f"Original multi-dimensional data:\n{multi_dim_data}")
print(f"Standardized multi-dimensional data:\n{standardized_multi_dim_data}")
```

This last example extends the functionality to handle multi-dimensional arrays. Now, the `custom_standardize` function will standardize each column (or feature) independently, which is the typical operation required for data preprocessing in most machine learning workflows. It checks if the `mean` and `std` inputs are provided, and if not, it calculates them column-wise using the `axis=0` argument in `np.mean` and `np.std`. It also handles the zero-standard deviation case on a per-feature level. I have found this function essential when working with image datasets or tabular data with multiple columns. This flexibility is necessary for practical application.

For further understanding of numerical computation with NumPy, I recommend exploring resources that delve into array manipulation and linear algebra in the context of scientific computation. In particular, materials that detail NumPy’s broadcasting rules will be quite useful. Additionally, resources focused on statistical concepts such as mean, standard deviation, and how they apply to data preprocessing in machine learning pipelines would provide valuable theoretical background. Lastly, a deeper understanding of the typical data preprocessing and feature scaling requirements in machine learning can inform better code. These resources tend to be more accessible and more directly applicable than deep dives into the source code of libraries like scikit-learn.
