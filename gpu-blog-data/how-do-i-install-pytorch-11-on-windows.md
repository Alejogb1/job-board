PyTorch 1.1's Windows support relied heavily on specific CUDA toolkit and cuDNN versions, a constraint absent in more recent releases.  Successfully installing PyTorch 1.1 on a 64-bit Windows system requires meticulous attention to these dependencies and careful adherence to the then-current installation guidelines.  My experience troubleshooting this for a legacy project involved navigating several compatibility issues, highlighting the importance of precise version matching.  Failure to do so would often result in runtime errors related to missing DLLs or CUDA-related incompatibilities.


**1.  Explanation:**

The installation process for PyTorch 1.1 on Windows 64-bit diverged significantly from later versions.  Direct pip installation wasn't reliably supported. The primary method involved utilizing the official PyTorch website's installer generator.  This involved selecting the correct options for your system:  specifically, Windows, 64-bit, the appropriate Python version (note that PyTorch 1.1 had compatibility limitations; Python 3.6 or 3.7 were generally preferred), CUDA version (if using a CUDA-enabled GPU), and cuDNN version.  Selecting the incorrect CUDA or cuDNN version, or even a mismatch between these two, would predictably cause the installation to fail or result in an unstable system.  If you lacked a compatible NVIDIA GPU, the CPU-only option was available, though it limited performance significantly.  After selecting the correct options, the website generated a command-line instruction to install PyTorch using pip, incorporating the chosen CUDA and cuDNN versions implicitly.  This pre-built wheel file was optimized for the selected environment, directly addressing the compatibility issues often encountered when installing from source.


The importance of correctly identifying your hardware specifications cannot be overstated.  Determining the exact CUDA version supported by your graphics card (obtained via the NVIDIA website or the NVIDIA System Management Interface) is paramount.  Incorrectly selecting a CUDA version that either predates or exceeds your GPUâ€™s capabilities would lead to installation failures or runtime errors.  Similarly, the cuDNN version had to be compatible with both the chosen CUDA toolkit and PyTorch 1.1.  The documentation for PyTorch 1.1 provided specific version compatibility tables, essential for successful installation.  Failing to refer to this documentation was a frequent source of error for me and other developers I assisted.  Once the correct pip command was generated, execution would download and install the pre-compiled wheel, adding the PyTorch package to the Python environment.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples reflect the process based on different scenarios:  CPU-only installation, CUDA 9.0 installation, and troubleshooting a common error.  Note that these commands reflect the structure generated by the PyTorch 1.1 installer and aren't directly usable now, given the outdated nature of the version.

**Example 1: CPU-only Installation**

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu101
```

*Commentary:*  This command would have been generated by the installer if the user chose the CPU-only option. The `--index-url` might point to a specific archive for PyTorch 1.1.  The absence of any CUDA-related parameters explicitly indicates the lack of GPU support.  This installation was generally simpler, as it bypassed CUDA and cuDNN compatibility concerns.  However, it resulted in a significantly slower execution for computationally intensive tasks.


**Example 2: CUDA 9.0 Installation (Hypothetical)**

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu90/torch_stable.html
```

*Commentary:*  This illustrates the command for installing PyTorch 1.1 with CUDA 9.0 support. The `-f` flag points to a specific wheel archive (again, hypothetical given the age of PyTorch 1.1). The URL structure would have been dynamically generated by the PyTorch website installer based on the user's selection of CUDA 9.0 and other parameters.  This command was the most common source of installation issues.  The wheel archive contained a pre-built version of PyTorch tailored for the specified CUDA version.  Any discrepancies between the CUDA toolkit installed separately and the one implied by the wheel archive would result in problems.


**Example 3: Troubleshooting Missing DLL Error**

```bash
# Hypothetical error message: ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
# Solution: Verify CUDA and cuDNN installations are correctly configured and in PATH.

# Add CUDA and cuDNN paths to the system environment variables.
# Verify CUDA version matches the PyTorch wheel used for installation.
# Reinstall CUDA, cuDNN, and PyTorch in sequence.

```

*Commentary:* This section exemplifies a common error, where missing DLL files related to CUDA prevent PyTorch from loading correctly.  The solution involves confirming that both the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN were correctly installed and that their respective directories were added to the system's `PATH` environment variable, enabling Windows to locate the necessary DLLs.  Verifying that the CUDA version selected during PyTorch installation matched the actual installed version was critical.  Sometimes, a clean reinstallation of CUDA, cuDNN, and PyTorch in that order was necessary to address subtle installation inconsistencies.  This highlights the tight coupling of these three components in PyTorch 1.1.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation (archived versions relevant to PyTorch 1.1),  the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit documentation,  and the cuDNN library documentation were invaluable resources during this process.  Furthermore, the NVIDIA Developer forums provided a platform to find solutions for specific hardware/software compatibility problems, particularly relating to issues encountered with older versions of the CUDA toolkit.


In conclusion, installing PyTorch 1.1 on Windows 64-bit successfully required careful attention to dependencies, precise version matching, and potentially a significant amount of troubleshooting if errors arose.  Unlike later releases with simplified installation mechanisms, PyTorch 1.1 demanded a deeper understanding of underlying CUDA and cuDNN compatibility.  The use of the official installer and rigorous checking of system configurations were indispensable for achieving a stable and functional PyTorch environment.
