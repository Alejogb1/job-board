TensorFlow 2's memory management, while significantly improved over previous versions, can still present challenges, particularly during the loading of large models.  My experience troubleshooting this within the context of large-scale image recognition projects, involving models exceeding 10GB, highlighted the crucial role of proper device placement and the careful handling of TensorFlow objects.  The core issue often stems from not explicitly releasing resources after model loading or improperly managing the execution context.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The perceived memory leak during model loading in TensorFlow 2 isn't always a true leak in the traditional sense (unreleased allocated memory). Instead, it's frequently a manifestation of TensorFlow's eager execution behavior and its internal caching mechanisms.  When a large model is loaded, TensorFlow allocates substantial GPU memory to hold the model's weights, biases, and associated computational graphs.  This memory remains allocated even after the loading process seemingly completes.  The key is to understand that this memory is often temporarily held for efficient subsequent operations; however, improper usage can lead to seemingly persistent high memory consumption.  The problem exacerbates when multiple models are loaded and manipulated sequentially without proper cleanup.

Addressing this requires a multi-pronged approach: explicit memory deallocation where possible (though limited in TensorFlow 2's eager execution), careful management of TensorFlow's execution context, and strategic use of the `tf.config` API for device placement and memory growth. Furthermore, understanding how TensorFlow interacts with the underlying CUDA memory management is crucial. While TensorFlow handles much of this automatically, manual intervention becomes necessary with exceptionally large models.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Explicit Deletion (Limited Effectiveness):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
  model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_large_model.h5')
  # ... perform model operations ...
  del model  # Attempt to explicitly delete the model
  tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph() # Less effective in TF2, but included for completeness
except Exception as e:
  print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Observe memory usage after this block.  Note: The effect of 'del model' might be limited 
# in eager execution, as TensorFlow's internal caches may retain some information.
```

**Commentary:**  While `del model` attempts to release the model's objects from Python's memory management,  TensorFlow's internal caching mechanisms might retain parts of the model's data, particularly if the model was loaded onto the GPU.  `tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph()` is largely ineffective in TensorFlow 2's eager execution.  This example serves primarily to illustrate the intention, not a robust solution.


**Example 2:  Using `tf.function` for Controlled Execution:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def process_model(model, input_data):
  # ... perform model operations on input_data using the model ...
  return output_data

model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_large_model.h5')
input_data = ... # Your input data

output_data = process_model(model, input_data)

# After the function completes, TensorFlow's internal mechanisms should 
# more effectively manage memory associated with the model within the graph.
```

**Commentary:** Encapsulating model operations within a `tf.function` creates a TensorFlow graph.  This allows TensorFlow's graph optimization to better manage memory allocation and deallocation, compared to pure eager execution.  The memory associated with the model and intermediate computations within the function is more likely to be released after the function's execution completes. This approach is far more effective than simply using `del`.


**Example 3:  Memory Growth and Device Placement:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  try:
    # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
    for gpu in gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
    logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
  except RuntimeError as e:
    # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
    print(e)

# Restrict model loading to a specific GPU if needed
with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Replace '0' with your desired GPU index.
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_large_model.h5')

# ... perform model operations ...
```

**Commentary:**  This example addresses the issue proactively.  `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)` allows TensorFlow to allocate GPU memory dynamically as needed, rather than reserving a large block upfront. This prevents memory exhaustion when multiple large models or processes compete for resources.  Explicit `tf.device` placement ensures the model is loaded onto the specified GPU, preventing potential memory conflicts between the CPU and GPU.  Carefully monitoring GPU memory usage during this process is crucial to fine-tune the allocation strategy.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on memory management and GPU usage, are invaluable.  Explore materials on CUDA memory management and the underlying workings of TensorFlow's GPU support.  A deep understanding of TensorFlow's eager and graph execution modes will also be highly beneficial. Finally, studying advanced TensorFlow techniques like model quantization and pruning for reducing model size can prove crucial when dealing with memory constraints.  Profiling tools, integrated into TensorFlow or standalone, will allow you to identify memory bottlenecks during model loading and operations.  Thorough examination of error logs generated by CUDA and TensorFlow are also essential for troubleshooting.
