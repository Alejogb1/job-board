On a modern x86-64 architecture, specifically when targeting compute-intensive kernels, performance differences between compiler-generated vector code utilizing 128-bit and 512-bit registers often contradict the intuition that wider is always faster.  My experience optimizing a physics simulation engine revealed this, consistently showing that smaller vector widths (specifically with the flag `-mprefer-vector-width=128`) sometimes yield superior performance to seemingly larger, more efficient register sets (flag `-mprefer-vector-width=512`). This is primarily due to the nuanced relationship between instruction throughput, register pressure, and memory access patterns which the compiler has to navigate.

The fundamental difference lies in how the processor manages these wider vector operations, and how instruction scheduling is affected at a microarchitectural level. Larger registers, while capable of processing more data in a single instruction, are not universally beneficial. The underlying CPU executes instructions in a pipeline; each stage needs to execute within a set of constraints. While a 512-bit vector instruction could theoretically perform four times more operations than a 128-bit equivalent, it is often associated with increased pressure on other CPU resources, such as register file space and execution ports.

Specifically, consider the execution of a loop where we are adding two arrays. The compiler, given `-mprefer-vector-width=512`, will attempt to generate code using ZMM registers, which are 512 bits in width. This could lead to an apparent increase in throughput in terms of data processed per cycle. However, these wider instructions typically have a higher latency and may require specific execution units. If the processor's pipeline lacks enough reservation station entries for these wider instructions or they create dependencies that stall the pipeline, this perceived benefit is diminished. Furthermore, loading and storing larger chunks of data can create a greater memory bottleneck if the data isn't in cache.

Conversely, when using `-mprefer-vector-width=128`, the compiler utilizes XMM registers which are 128 bits wide. These instructions usually have lower latency and less demanding requirements on execution ports. Though seemingly less efficient, the increased throughput achieved through shorter pipelines and lower demands on CPU resources can often result in a higher number of instructions executed per unit of time. The key is instruction parallelism.

I've repeatedly observed that even on processors that can execute 512-bit instructions perfectly well, code generated with 128-bit registers offers better performance due to a more balanced usage of CPU resources and optimal instruction scheduling. The reduced register pressure from 128-bit registers can allow the compiler more flexibility in instruction scheduling, especially with regard to out-of-order execution. This is a critical aspect, enabling the CPU to minimize stalls by having more instructions ready to execute. Wider vectorization can also induce higher chances of register spilling, leading to frequent load/store operations from memory, further impacting performance.

Let's illustrate this with three code examples that highlight the performance differences. First, consider a simple dot product calculation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

float dot_product(float *a, float *b, int size) {
    float result = 0.0f;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        result += a[i] * b[i];
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
  const int size = 1024 * 1024;
  float *a = (float*) malloc(size * sizeof(float));
  float *b = (float*) malloc(size * sizeof(float));

  srand(time(NULL));
  for(int i = 0; i < size; ++i){
    a[i] = (float)rand() / RAND_MAX;
    b[i] = (float)rand() / RAND_MAX;
  }

  float result = dot_product(a, b, size);
  printf("Result: %f\n", result);

  free(a);
  free(b);
  return 0;
}
```

This first example is a basic, non-vectorized implementation. When compiled without any vectorization flags, the compiler would generate scalar code. When compiled with `-mprefer-vector-width=128` the loop would likely be vectorized into 128-bit operations, processing four floats at a time.

Here is the same code, but optimized for the SIMD intrinsic version:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <immintrin.h>

float dot_product_simd(float *a, float *b, int size) {
    __m128 sum_v = _mm_setzero_ps();
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i+=4){
      __m128 a_v = _mm_loadu_ps(&a[i]);
      __m128 b_v = _mm_loadu_ps(&b[i]);
      sum_v = _mm_add_ps(sum_v, _mm_mul_ps(a_v, b_v));
    }

    float result[4];
    _mm_storeu_ps(result, sum_v);

    return result[0] + result[1] + result[2] + result[3];
}


int main() {
    const int size = 1024 * 1024;
    float *a = (float*) malloc(size * sizeof(float));
    float *b = (float*) malloc(size * sizeof(float));

    srand(time(NULL));
    for(int i = 0; i < size; ++i){
      a[i] = (float)rand() / RAND_MAX;
      b[i] = (float)rand() / RAND_MAX;
    }

    float result = dot_product_simd(a, b, size);
    printf("Result: %f\n", result);

    free(a);
    free(b);
    return 0;
}
```

This second example uses Intel's SIMD intrinsics explicitly using 128 bit `__m128` registers. When compiled with `-mavx`, the compiler will use AVX instruction set to work on the 128-bit vector operations. If instead we specify `-mprefer-vector-width=512`, the compiler will still keep the `__m128` registers and use AVX instructions, which would lead to 128-bit operations and not take any advantage of 512-bit register size. The performance of this code should be similar to compilation with `-mprefer-vector-width=128`. It is important to note that intrinsic usage always specifies the size of the vector, and the compiler's `-mprefer-vector-width` flag cannot override that.

Now consider this explicit SIMD example utilizing 512-bit registers:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <immintrin.h>

float dot_product_simd_512(float *a, float *b, int size) {
    __m512 sum_v = _mm512_setzero_ps();
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i+=16){
      __m512 a_v = _mm512_loadu_ps(&a[i]);
      __m512 b_v = _mm512_loadu_ps(&b[i]);
      sum_v = _mm512_add_ps(sum_v, _mm512_mul_ps(a_v, b_v));
    }

    float result[16];
    _mm512_storeu_ps(result, sum_v);

    float total = 0.0f;
    for(int i = 0; i < 16; ++i){
      total += result[i];
    }

    return total;
}

int main() {
    const int size = 1024 * 1024;
    float *a = (float*) malloc(size * sizeof(float));
    float *b = (float*) malloc(size * sizeof(float));

    srand(time(NULL));
    for(int i = 0; i < size; ++i){
      a[i] = (float)rand() / RAND_MAX;
      b[i] = (float)rand() / RAND_MAX;
    }

    float result = dot_product_simd_512(a, b, size);
    printf("Result: %f\n", result);

    free(a);
    free(b);
    return 0;
}
```

This third example uses 512-bit registers (`__m512`) and operations. This code, when compiled with `-mprefer-vector-width=512`, should be able to make use of the full 512-bit vector width. However, even when the program is compiled with `-mprefer-vector-width=128`, the usage of `__m512` cannot be overridden, and compiler must still use AVX512 instructions.

In my experience, especially in loops involving complex computations and less-than-ideal memory access patterns, I've observed that the performance difference between compiling the first example with `-mprefer-vector-width=128` versus compiling it with `-mprefer-vector-width=512` is often significant, with the 128-bit implementation often winning.  The 512-bit version suffers due to increased register pressure, higher latency, and potentially slower memory access (especially for L1 cache misses). While the third example uses 512-bit registers explicitly, the fact that it needs to execute on 512-bit execution units means that the CPU can stall in the case of misprediction and data hazard. The 128-bit version, on the other hand, exhibits much better throughput overall when the data fits well in cache and if the compiler can utilize out-of-order execution effectively.

It's critical to emphasize that the "optimal" vector width can be heavily application-specific and workload-dependent. Microbenchmarks, such as the above, can be useful to see how to compiler performs in a very specific cases, but it's always best to experiment with different compiler flags and measure in realistic scenarios.

For further in-depth learning, I would recommend researching the architecture of modern CPUs, especially topics like instruction pipelining, out-of-order execution, and cache hierarchies. Understanding the relationship between the CPU front-end and back-end will provide a much better intuition on how these compiler flags can affect performance. Studying Intel's or AMD's optimization manuals can also offer valuable insights into the specific performance characteristics of vector instructions. Furthermore, analyzing the assembly code generated by different compilation options is highly educational.
