The inherent inefficiency of repeatedly copying data when constructing PyTorch tensors from raw C/C++ arrays motivated me to explore alternative approaches beyond `from_blob()`.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing workloads within the context of large-scale image processing revealed that circumventing unnecessary data duplication is paramount for maintaining optimal throughput.  Direct memory allocation and tensor construction from existing memory buffers offer a significant performance advantage, especially when dealing with substantial datasets.  This response details several strategies to achieve this, focusing on leveraging PyTorch's underlying memory management capabilities.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The `from_blob()` method, while convenient, entails creating a copy of the source array's data. For large arrays, this incurs a significant performance penalty.  The preferred alternative is to directly allocate the tensor using the dimensions and data type of the C/C++ array, then populate it with the array's contents.  This process leverages PyTorch's internal memory management, ensuring that the created tensor shares the underlying memory with the source array.  Crucially, this requires careful attention to memory ownership and lifetime management to prevent issues such as dangling pointers or memory leaks.  The lifetime of the C/C++ array must exceed that of the PyTorch tensor.  Failure to observe this precaution can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `torch::Tensor::reshape()` for contiguous memory:**

This example demonstrates creating a tensor from a contiguous array using `torch::Tensor::reshape()`.  Contiguous memory is vital for efficient tensor operations.

```cpp
#include <torch/torch.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // Sample C++ array; ensure it's allocated on the heap for the example's lifetime.
  float data[] = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f};
  int64_t dims[] = {2, 3};  // Dimensions of the tensor

  // Create a tensor from the data without copying.  Note: We use the total number of elements here.
  auto tensor = torch::from_blob(data, {sizeof(data)/sizeof(data[0])}); 

  //Reshape to the desired dimensions.  Error handling omitted for brevity.
  auto reshaped_tensor = tensor.reshape(dims);

  // Verify the tensor's contents.
  std::cout << reshaped_tensor << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:**  This method first creates a 1D tensor from the raw data using `from_blob` (minimal copy here, as we will overwrite it soon).  Then `reshape` creates a view of the underlying data, arranged as a 2x3 matrix.  While this technically uses `from_blob`, the copy operation is extremely small and the subsequent reshape avoids a full copy to create the final 2D tensor. The crucial part is recognizing that we're primarily leveraging the existing memory with minimal data manipulation.


**Example 2:  Manual Allocation with `torch::empty()`:**

This illustrates manual memory allocation and data copying.  It's less efficient than methods relying on direct memory sharing but provides more control.

```cpp
#include <torch/torch.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector<float> data = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f};
  int64_t dims[] = {2, 3};

  // Allocate a tensor with the specified dimensions and data type.
  auto tensor = torch::empty({2, 3}, torch::kFloat32);

  // Copy data from the C++ array to the tensor.
  auto tensor_accessor = tensor.accessor<float, 2>();
  for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {
      tensor_accessor[i][j] = data[i * 3 + j];
    }
  }

  std::cout << tensor << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:**  This approach uses `torch::empty()` to allocate the tensor's memory. The data is then copied element by element from the C++ vector to the tensor using an accessor. This method is less efficient than direct memory sharing but offers explicit control over data transfer.  It's suitable when data might not be contiguous in memory.


**Example 3:  Using `torch::Storage` for advanced control:**

This example demonstrates utilizing `torch::Storage` for finer-grained memory management. This is the most efficient approach for large datasets, but also requires the deepest understanding of PyTorch's memory model.

```cpp
#include <torch/torch.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  float data[] = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f};
  int64_t dims[] = {2, 3};

  // Create a Storage object from the raw data.
  auto storage = torch::Storage(data, sizeof(data) / sizeof(data[0]), torch::kFloat32);

  // Create a tensor using the storage.  This will manage the storage and reference to the underlying memory.
  auto tensor = torch::Tensor(storage).reshape(dims);


  std::cout << tensor << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This approach uses a `torch::Storage` object to directly manage the underlying memory. The tensor is then created using this storage, ensuring it points to the pre-allocated memory. This method is the most efficient but requires a profound understanding of PyTorch's memory model.  It is crucial to understand that the lifetime of the `data` array must encompass the lifetime of the `storage` and the `tensor`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation, especially sections focusing on tensor creation and memory management, is invaluable.  Furthermore, I'd strongly recommend consulting advanced C++ programming texts covering memory management and data structures.  A comprehensive guide on linear algebra and matrix operations will also be beneficial to understanding the underlying mathematical operations PyTorch performs.  Finally, exploring example code within the PyTorch repository and engaging with the PyTorch community forums would significantly contribute to your understanding.
