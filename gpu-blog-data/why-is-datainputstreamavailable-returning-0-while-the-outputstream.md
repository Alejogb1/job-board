The primary reason `DataInputStream.available()` often returns 0 despite an `OutputStream` actively writing data is the inherent behavior of streams in Java, particularly with respect to how buffering and blocking interact. The `available()` method specifically indicates the number of bytes that can be read from the input stream *without blocking*. It does *not* signal the presence of data that might eventually be available. This seemingly subtle difference in meaning is crucial for understanding the issue.

Let’s consider my experience working on a distributed data processing application several years ago. We were transmitting serialized objects over TCP using `ObjectOutputStream` and `ObjectInputStream`. Frequently, the receiving side would stall, showing `available()` as perpetually zero, despite the sending side having successfully flushed the output stream. The misconception was that `available()` would reflect the total pending data on the underlying socket. This is incorrect; it only reports immediately readable data held within the stream’s internal buffer, and it's subject to the underlying I/O mechanism.

The core problem often stems from buffering in several places along the transmission path. `OutputStream` implementations frequently buffer data internally before writing to the underlying socket or resource. Likewise, `InputStream` implementations often buffer data as well.  Additionally, the operating system itself buffers network I/O.  This multi-layered buffering creates a situation where data can be written but not instantly available at the other end. The `available()` method will only report data present in the `InputStream`'s buffer. If that buffer is empty, `available()` returns zero, even if data is en route.

Furthermore, network I/O is inherently blocking.  A read operation will block until data is available *or* until the stream is closed. Conversely, the `available()` method is designed to be non-blocking. This is precisely why it can report zero even when data is pending. The `available()` method’s purpose is to allow non-blocking reads, enabling more complex asynchronous I/O patterns. If we were to rely on `available()` as a general indicator of available data, we would introduce very fragile and error-prone logic into our application, often leading to busy loops and inefficient resource utilization.

Let’s illustrate this with a few code examples. First, consider a situation where we are sending a single `int` using a `DataOutputStream` and trying to read it with a `DataInputStream`.

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;

public class DataStreamExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {

        // Server side
        new Thread(() -> {
            try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);
                 Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
                 DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream())) {

                System.out.println("Server: Sending data...");
                dos.writeInt(42);
                dos.flush();
                System.out.println("Server: Data flushed.");

            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }).start();

        //Client side
        Thread.sleep(1000); // Give the server some time to start.

        try(Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 8080);
            DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream())){


             System.out.println("Client: available() at start: " + dis.available());
             Thread.sleep(500);
             System.out.println("Client: available() after delay: " + dis.available());

            if (dis.available() > 0){
                 int received = dis.readInt();
                 System.out.println("Client: Received: " + received);
            }else {
                System.out.println("Client: No data available to read.");
            }

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the server sends an integer and flushes the stream. The client pauses briefly, then checks `available()`. It is quite possible for the client to report `available()` as 0 even after the server has flushed, as the data may still be en route through TCP buffers, not yet in `dis`'s buffer. The crucial part here is that while data is being transmitted, the receiving end might not have it in the readable buffer *immediately*. The sleep gives some time for data to arrive.

Now, let’s examine an example demonstrating the correct way to read from an `InputStream` by explicitly performing a blocking read.

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;

public class BlockingReadExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {

        // Server side
        new Thread(() -> {
            try (ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8081);
                 Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
                 DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream())) {
                 System.out.println("Server: Sending data...");
                dos.writeInt(123);
                dos.flush();
                System.out.println("Server: Data flushed.");

            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }).start();


        // Client side
        Thread.sleep(1000); // Give server time

        try(Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 8081);
            DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream())){
                System.out.println("Client: Attempting blocking read...");
                int received = dis.readInt();
                System.out.println("Client: Received: " + received);
        }
         catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

```

Here, the client uses the blocking `readInt()` operation. The thread blocks until the integer is received, regardless of the value of `available()`. This is how we correctly read from an `InputStream` when we know data is coming. Blocking reads are typically how I/O operations should be handled unless more advanced asynchronous logic is required, such as that provided by non-blocking I/O mechanisms. This approach ensures correct data reception.

Finally, consider an example where we *do* use `available()` for a more appropriate purpose: reading a fixed number of bytes when available. This example highlights a valid usage scenario, though not in the core context of the original question's issue.

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Random;


public class ValidAvailableUsage {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        byte[] data = new byte[1024];
        new Random().nextBytes(data);

        try (ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(data);
             DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(bais)){
            while (bais.available() > 0){
                int len = Math.min(dis.available(),100); //read at most 100 bytes

                byte[] buffer = new byte[len];
                int bytesRead = dis.read(buffer);

                System.out.println("Read " + bytesRead + " bytes. Available: " + bais.available());
                //do something with buffer
            }
            System.out.println("Done reading.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this snippet, we are using a `ByteArrayInputStream` to mock an input stream that holds data already readily available and buffered. Here, we use `available()` to check if more data can be read, but within a single, fully buffered stream. This is a valid use case since the data is immediately available in memory and not dependent on network buffering. `available()` correctly reports how much data can be read without blocking from memory in this scenario. Notice that it’s not a substitute for a proper blocking read from a network socket or similar context.

In summary, `DataInputStream.available()` returning 0 when an `OutputStream` is actively writing is due to buffering at multiple levels and the non-blocking nature of `available()`. The method does not indicate whether data has been *sent*, only if it is *immediately readable* within the input stream's buffer. The correct approach involves either blocking reads, or more complex non-blocking I/O mechanisms if asynchronous behavior is needed, and only using `available` in appropriate contexts like the third example above.

For further information, explore resources that detail Java I/O streams, socket programming, and the concepts of blocking and non-blocking I/O.  Specifically, consult the Java API documentation for `java.io.InputStream`, `java.io.OutputStream`, `java.io.DataInputStream`, `java.io.DataOutputStream` as well as `java.net.Socket` and `java.net.ServerSocket`.  Understanding stream concepts and buffering is critical for building robust applications. Texts on concurrent programming in Java will also provide context for understanding when non-blocking I/O, and by extension, appropriate use cases for `available()`, are necessary.
