The failure to create a view primitive descriptor in TensorFlow's MKL slice operation typically stems from an incompatibility between the input tensor's data layout and the MKL library's expectation.  Over the years, working extensively with high-performance computing and TensorFlow optimizations, I've encountered this issue numerous times, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets and custom tensor layouts.  The root cause often lies in a mismatch between the expected memory ordering (e.g., row-major, column-major) and the actual ordering of the input tensor.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's MKL (Math Kernel Library) integration significantly accelerates numerical computations.  The MKL slice operation utilizes optimized routines for efficient data access and manipulation.  A crucial component of these optimized routines is the "view primitive descriptor." This descriptor essentially acts as a blueprint, informing the MKL library about the shape, data type, and importantly, the memory layout of the input tensor being sliced.  If this descriptor cannot be successfully created, it indicates a fundamental incompatibility between the tensor's properties and the MKL's assumptions.

This incompatibility can manifest in several ways:

* **Incorrect Data Layout:** The most common cause is a mismatch between the expected row-major (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) layout and the actual layout of the input tensor. If the tensor is stored in a non-standard format (e.g., due to custom memory allocation or data transfer from another library), the MKL may not be able to interpret the memory correctly, leading to failure in descriptor creation.

* **Unsupported Data Types:** While less frequent, the MKL may not support the specific data type of the input tensor.  This usually arises when using less common or custom-defined TensorFlow data types that haven't been adequately integrated with the MKL.

* **Tensor Shape Issues:**  While rare, unusual tensor shapes or dimensions, particularly those involving very high-dimensionality or zero-sized dimensions, can sometimes trigger errors during descriptor creation.  These often indicate a problem with the upstream tensor generation process.

* **Memory Allocation Errors:**  Issues with the underlying memory allocation for the input tensor can indirectly cause the descriptor creation to fail.  Memory corruption or insufficient memory can lead to unpredictable behavior and errors.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential scenarios leading to the failure and strategies to mitigate them.

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Layout**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Incorrect layout - assuming column-major, but data is actually row-major
data = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], order='C')  # Row-major
tensor = tf.constant(data)

try:
    sliced_tensor = tf.slice(tensor, [0, 0], [1, 2])  # Attempting to slice
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  #This will likely print an error related to descriptor creation

#Corrected Layout
data_corrected = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], order='F') #Column-major
tensor_corrected = tf.constant(data_corrected)
sliced_tensor_corrected = tf.slice(tensor_corrected, [0, 0], [1, 2])
print(sliced_tensor_corrected.numpy())
```

This example highlights the importance of matching the NumPy array's `order` parameter (`'C'` for row-major, `'F'` for column-major) with the MKL's expectations.  Failure to do so will likely result in an `InvalidArgumentError` during the descriptor creation phase.  The corrected version ensures the data layout is compatible.

**Example 2: Unsupported Data Type**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a custom data type (hypothetical scenario)
dtype = tf.DType('CUSTOM_TYPE')

try:
    tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=dtype)
    sliced_tensor = tf.slice(tensor, [0, 0], [1, 2])
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #Likely an error indicating unsupported data type
```

This showcases a scenario where an unsupported data type leads to an error. The MKL might not have built-in support for the `CUSTOM_TYPE`.  In real-world applications, this could occur if you are using a less common TensorFlow data type or one not fully integrated with the MKL.

**Example 3: Memory Allocation Check**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate a memory allocation issue (hypothetical)
data = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor = tf.constant(data)

try:
    # Simulate a memory error (replace with actual memory management error handling)
    # ... Code that might cause memory errors ...
    sliced_tensor = tf.slice(tensor, [0, 0], [1, 2])
except RuntimeError as e: #RuntimeError captures generic memory errors
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This illustrates how underlying memory problems, not directly related to the slice operation itself, can cause indirect failures.  The comments indicate places where one might encounter memory-related errors.  Robust error handling, including checks for memory allocation success, is crucial for preventing these issues.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's internals and the MKL integration, I strongly advise consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on performance optimization and the use of the MKL-DNN library.  Furthermore, thorough examination of the TensorFlow source code related to the `tf.slice` operation and its interaction with the MKL would be highly beneficial.  Finally, studying performance profiling tools such as those built into TensorFlow itself, or external profilers, allows for more in-depth analysis of the cause of errors.  This deeper investigation is critical for troubleshooting highly performance-critical code.
