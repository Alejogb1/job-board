The unexpected output shape from `tf.squared_difference` in TensorFlow often stems from a misunderstanding of its broadcasting behavior, particularly when dealing with tensors of differing ranks or incompatible dimensions.  My experience troubleshooting this in large-scale image processing pipelines for autonomous vehicle navigation highlighted this issue repeatedly.  The function, while seemingly straightforward, exhibits nuanced behavior governed by TensorFlow's broadcasting rules which can lead to surprising results if not explicitly accounted for.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`tf.squared_difference` calculates the element-wise squared difference between two tensors.  The core principle is simple: for corresponding elements `a` and `b` in the input tensors, it computes `(a - b)²`.  However, the function's ability to handle tensors of different shapes introduces complexity.  TensorFlow's broadcasting mechanism automatically expands the dimensions of the smaller tensor to match the larger one, provided certain compatibility conditions are met.  These conditions dictate that the dimensions must either be equal or one of them must be 1.  If these conditions are not met, a `ValueError` regarding shape incompatibility is raised.  But even when broadcasting *is* successful, the resulting shape might not be immediately intuitive.  The output tensor inherits the shape of the *broader* tensor – the one whose shape dictates the final dimensions after broadcasting.

Consider tensors `A` and `B`.  Broadcasting rules state that if `A` has shape (x, y, z) and `B` has shape (z),  TensorFlow will implicitly expand `B` to (x, y, z) before performing the element-wise operation. The resulting shape will be (x, y, z). Conversely, if `A` has shape (x, y) and `B` has shape (y, z), broadcasting will *fail* because the y-dimensions don't align perfectly (one is not 1).


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Broadcasting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

A = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # Shape (2, 2)
B = tf.constant([10, 20])         # Shape (2,)

result = tf.squared_difference(A, B)

print(f"Tensor A shape: {A.shape}")
print(f"Tensor B shape: {B.shape}")
print(f"Result shape: {result.shape}")  # Output: (2, 2)
print(f"Result: \n{result.numpy()}")  # [[81, 324], [49, 196]]

```

Here, `B` is broadcast to `(2, 2)` before the operation. The output retains the shape of `A`. This is a standard and expected outcome for compatible broadcasting.


**Example 2:  Broadcasting with Rank Mismatch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

A = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]) # Shape (2, 2, 2)
B = tf.constant([[10, 20], [30, 40]])                  # Shape (2, 2)

result = tf.squared_difference(A, B)

print(f"Tensor A shape: {A.shape}")
print(f"Tensor B shape: {B.shape}")
print(f"Result shape: {result.shape}") # Output: (2, 2, 2)
print(f"Result: \n{result.numpy()}")
```

In this case, `B` is broadcast along the first axis to match `A`. The resulting shape reflects the shape of `A`.  Note the careful consideration of axes; if the shapes were (2, 2, 2) and (2, 2), broadcasting would not work. It requires at least one dimension to be 1 or match.

**Example 3:  Incompatible Shapes Leading to Error**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

A = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # Shape (2, 2)
B = tf.constant([[[10], [20]], [[30], [40]]]) # Shape (2, 2, 1)

try:
    result = tf.squared_difference(A, B)
    print(result)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Output: Error: Shapes (2, 2) and (2, 2, 1) are incompatible.
```

This demonstrates a crucial point.  The inner most dimensions must align for broadcasting to work. While `A` has shape (2,2) and `B` has shape (2,2,1), the inner most dimensions (2 and 1) do not align causing a `ValueError`.  Understanding this is paramount in avoiding unexpected behavior.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To further solidify your understanding, I suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation regarding tensor manipulation and broadcasting.  Review examples demonstrating various broadcasting scenarios with different tensor ranks and dimensions.  Furthermore, studying the TensorFlow API reference for `tf.squared_difference` and related functions will help clarify the operational details.  Finally, I recommend working through a series of progressively complex examples, starting with simple cases and gradually increasing the complexity of tensor shapes and dimensions.  This hands-on approach, combined with careful examination of the output shapes, will solidify your grasp on this often overlooked aspect of TensorFlow.  This methodical approach was vital in my own troubleshooting experience.  Through diligent practice and experimentation I was able to efficiently debug similar shape-related issues.
