The root cause of divergent outputs from seemingly identical machines operating within the same environment often stems from subtle variations in their initial state, compounded by the inherent probabilistic nature of computational processes. Even with meticulously replicated hardware and controlled inputs, these minute differences, which I've observed over years of system administration and distributed computing projects, cascade through iterative computations, leading to significant outcome discrepancies.

Fundamentally, 'identical' in the practical sense is a carefully engineered approximation, not an absolute. Consider three server racks, each populated with the same motherboard, CPU, RAM modules, and storage devices from the same manufacturing batch. While component specifications match, the underlying physical properties may differ. For example, slight variations in the silicon doping of microchips result in minute differences in gate switching speeds and thermal conductivity. These variations, in turn, influence the precise timing of data operations, leading to variable execution paths within the CPU. Additionally, despite stringent quality control, RAM modules may have slight differences in access latency, contributing to non-deterministic timing for data retrieval and storage. Furthermore, the thermal profiles, even within the same ambient temperature, will vary slightly due to the density and location within the server rack, which impacts the performance of each device.

Operating systems, too, introduce non-determinism. The precise scheduling of processes by the kernel is affected by the dynamic behavior of the system, including interrupt handling and background tasks. Even with identical operating system images, the timing of context switches and resource allocation will vary slightly due to the differences outlined above, as well as external events like network traffic and disk I/O. The same software running across the three machines might thus find itself executing slightly different instruction sequences depending on the resources available to it at any given moment. These timing differences, though initially minute, can quickly compound in complex computation or iterative procedures.

Beyond hardware and operating system considerations, the software layer introduces another level of non-determinism. Random number generators, a staple in simulations and machine learning, are almost always pseudo-random. They rely on an initial seed value to generate a seemingly random sequence of numbers. If each machine starts with a different seed value, even if it is only by a nanosecond difference in timing that the system calls for a seed, the subsequent random sequences will diverge, leading to dramatically different outcomes in iterative computations that use those numbers extensively. Further, floating point arithmetic, a common occurrence in many numerical calculations, is inherently imprecise due to the binary representation of decimal numbers. The specific rounding errors that occur with floating point calculations can vary across machines even if the same algorithm is used, leading to divergent results over many iterations.

These factors accumulate to produce divergent outcomes. It is not a case of one machine malfunctioning; rather it is the accumulation of probabilistic processes within a tightly coupled system that lead to different results. This is particularly prevalent in highly parallel algorithms or simulations, where a small difference on a single core could quickly cascade through the system. Even seemingly deterministic processes like file system writes can have non-deterministic behavior, where write operations can be delayed, leading to differences in task flow. Therefore, designing processes that tolerate and accommodate these differences is crucial in large-scale systems, and understanding these factors is paramount for accurate scientific modelling.

Here are some code examples that demonstrate how minor variations can lead to different outcomes:

**Example 1: Seeded Random Number Generation**

```python
import random

def simulate_process(seed):
    random.seed(seed)
    total = 0
    for _ in range(1000):
        total += random.random()
    return total

# Run on three machines with different seed values.
machine1_result = simulate_process(1)
machine2_result = simulate_process(2)
machine3_result = simulate_process(3)

print(f"Machine 1: {machine1_result}")
print(f"Machine 2: {machine2_result}")
print(f"Machine 3: {machine3_result}")

```

*Commentary:* This script demonstrates how different seed values lead to vastly different results in the seemingly deterministic calculation of random numbers. Even though each machine is running the exact same code, the `random.seed()` call sets up different initial states for the random number generator, resulting in different sequences of numbers being added up. This principle applies to any process relying on seeded pseudo-random number generators, showing how an apparently insignificant difference in a seeding process can lead to dramatically different numerical outcomes when this process is incorporated into the program’s main loop.

**Example 2: Iterative Floating-Point Calculations**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

double iterative_calculation() {
    double result = 0.1;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
       result = (result * 3.0) / 3.0;
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    double machine1_result = iterative_calculation();
    double machine2_result = iterative_calculation();
    double machine3_result = iterative_calculation();

    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(20);
    std::cout << "Machine 1 Result: " << machine1_result << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Machine 2 Result: " << machine2_result << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Machine 3 Result: " << machine3_result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* This C++ code illustrates the cumulative effect of tiny floating-point errors. While the math appears trivial, repeated operations involving non-exact representations of decimal numbers lead to slight variations in the result across different runs. These can be due to the internal precision of the CPU’s Floating-Point Unit or the compiler optimization techniques, resulting in differing numbers when compiled with various versions or under different operating conditions. In a short program, the differences might seem irrelevant; in an extremely complex iterative model, these small variations can lead to different conclusions. The precision here is set to demonstrate how much of a divergence can happen, and it is often more subtle in normal program usage.

**Example 3: Concurrent Process Timing**

```java
public class ConcurrentProcessTiming {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        int counter = 0;
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
                incrementCounter(counter);
            }
            System.out.println("Thread 1 finished.");
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
                incrementCounter(counter);
            }
            System.out.println("Thread 2 finished.");
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        thread1.join();
        thread2.join();
         System.out.println("Counter value is: " + counter);

    }

    private static void incrementCounter(int counter) {
        counter = counter+ 1;
    }
}
```

*Commentary:* This Java example shows how concurrent access to a shared resource (the counter) without proper synchronization can result in a different final value with each run. Because the operation is not atomic, threads may read the counter value at almost the same time, increment it locally, and write back the result; sometimes the counter will be updated more frequently, and sometimes less. It demonstrates the non-deterministic behavior caused by race conditions that are exacerbated by the inherent variability in timing of process scheduling and context switching. This particular example does not synchronize on the shared counter, so the race condition will almost always cause a different result.

For further understanding, I would recommend exploring the literature on several areas of computing: computer architecture (particularly CPU microarchitecture), operating systems (process scheduling and resource management), numerical analysis (floating-point arithmetic and error propagation), and distributed systems (consensus and fault tolerance). A deep dive into each of these areas will explain why achieving absolute determinism in complex systems is difficult, if not impossible. Detailed textbooks covering these areas, such as the textbook "Computer Organization and Design" for computer architecture and “Modern Operating Systems” for operating systems, will greatly improve one's understanding of these concepts. While specific research papers are also available in each of these domains, these textbooks give a good general overview.
