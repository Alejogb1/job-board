Optimizing model performance in TensorFlow 2 Keras involves a multifaceted approach, and the interplay between the number of units in a layer and the choice of activation function significantly impacts the model's ability to learn complex patterns and generalize to unseen data.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects highlighted the crucial role of this interplay; suboptimal choices consistently led to either underfitting (high bias) or overfitting (high variance).  A systematic approach, involving experimentation and careful analysis, is essential for achieving optimal performance.

**1.  Understanding the Interdependence of Units and Activation Functions:**

The number of units in a dense layer directly relates to the model's representational capacity.  More units allow the layer to learn more complex features from the input data. However, this increased capacity comes at a cost.  Too many units can lead to overfitting, where the model memorizes the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns.  Conversely, too few units may result in underfitting, where the model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data.

The activation function determines the non-linearity introduced by each neuron. The choice of activation function profoundly influences the model's learning dynamics.  For example, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) introduces sparsity by setting negative values to zero, potentially mitigating gradient vanishing problems but potentially leading to "dying ReLU" issues.  Sigmoid and tanh functions, while smoother, can suffer from vanishing gradients, particularly in deep networks.  Different activation functions exhibit different properties concerning gradient saturation, computational cost, and their effect on feature representation. The interaction between the number of units and the activation function becomes critically important in achieving a suitable balance between model capacity and generalization ability.

A model with a high number of units and a highly non-linear activation function, such as ReLU, might achieve high training accuracy but poor generalization. Conversely, a model with few units and a less expressive activation function like sigmoid could lead to underfitting.  Therefore, a systematic approach to tuning both parameters is essential.


**2. Code Examples illustrating different scenarios:**

The following examples demonstrate the impact of varying units and activation functions within a simple sequential model for a binary classification task.  These examples assume a pre-processed dataset `(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test)`.


**Example 1:  Baseline Model (ReLU, 64 units):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model_relu_64 = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_relu_64.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model_relu_64.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

This serves as a baseline. The ReLU activation is a common choice, and 64 units provide a reasonable starting point.  The performance will serve as a benchmark against other configurations.


**Example 2: Increasing Units (ReLU, 256 units):**

```python
model_relu_256 = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_relu_256.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model_relu_256.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

By increasing the number of units to 256, we test the model's capacity to learn more complex features.  We anticipate an increase in training accuracy, but potentially an increase in overfitting if the validation accuracy does not improve proportionally.


**Example 3: Changing Activation Function (tanh, 64 units):**

```python
model_tanh_64 = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='tanh', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_tanh_64.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model_tanh_64.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

This example changes the activation function to 'tanh' while keeping the number of units at 64.  Comparing the results with the ReLU baseline helps assess the impact of the activation function on the model's performance. The 'tanh' function, while still capable, might lead to different optimization dynamics than ReLU.


**3.  Systematic Optimization and Resource Recommendations:**

A systematic approach involves iteratively tuning the number of units and activation function based on the observed performance metrics.  Start with a baseline model using a standard activation function like ReLU and a reasonable number of units.  Then, systematically vary one parameter at a time, comparing the training and validation accuracy, loss, and potentially other relevant metrics.  Techniques like k-fold cross-validation can improve the robustness of the evaluation.

Consider exploring different optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, SGD) and learning rate schedules to further refine performance. Experimenting with different regularization techniques like dropout and weight decay is also crucial for controlling overfitting.  Regularization is particularly important when dealing with larger models with more units.  Furthermore, detailed analysis of the learning curves (training and validation loss/accuracy over epochs) provides valuable insights into model behavior and helps identify issues like overfitting or underfitting.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of activation functions, consult relevant machine learning textbooks and research papers.  The official TensorFlow documentation and Keras guides provide detailed explanations of model building and optimization techniques.  Explore resources on hyperparameter tuning and optimization strategies; grid search and random search are good starting points.  Understanding the underlying principles of neural networks and gradient-based optimization is essential for effective model tuning.  Furthermore, visualizing the model's architecture and learning curves is beneficial in understanding its behavior.
