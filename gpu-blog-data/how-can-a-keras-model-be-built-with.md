The inherent challenge in using a multiply dense layer as direct input to a Keras model stems from the expected input shape.  Keras layers, particularly Dense layers, anticipate a tensor of a specific rank and shape; a "multiply dense layer," implying multiple dense layers concatenated, doesn't conform to this expectation without explicit pre-processing.  My experience building and optimizing recommendation systems heavily involved this issue, leading to the development of several strategies I'll detail below.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

A Keras model, at its core, requires a structured input tensor.  A single dense layer outputs a vector (a 1D tensor).  If you intend to use multiple dense layers as input—effectively creating a feature vector from their combined outputs—simple concatenation is insufficient unless each contributing dense layer produces an output vector of identical dimension.  Directly feeding multiple dense layer outputs, each with differing dimensions, will result in a `ValueError` indicating a shape mismatch.  The solution involves either pre-processing the outputs of these individual dense layers to a uniform dimension or employing a layer capable of handling variable-length inputs.

The most robust approach involves explicitly reshaping and concatenating the output tensors.  This ensures the final input to the main Keras model is a well-defined tensor.  Alternatively, if the nature of the data allows, one might consider using a layer like `Flatten` to collapse the outputs of the multiple dense layers before combining them. The optimal approach depends heavily on the dimensionality of the individual dense layer outputs and the underlying data's characteristics.  For instance, if the individual outputs represent different feature sets, concatenation directly after appropriate reshaping is likely superior to flattening, which would obscure potentially crucial structural information.

Furthermore, it's critical to understand the context.  If these "multiply dense layers" are intended to be part of a larger model—perhaps processing different aspects of the input before merging—the most effective solution involves building a sub-model incorporating these layers and using its output as input for the main model.  This maintains modularity and allows for easier debugging and modification.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Concatenation after Reshaping**

This example assumes three dense layers, each producing outputs of varying dimensions, which are then reshaped and concatenated before feeding to the main model.  I've encountered this scenario when handling multi-modal data where each modality required a separate processing pathway.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Reshape, Concatenate

# Define three separate dense layers
dense1 = Dense(units=10, activation='relu')(input_tensor) #input_tensor needs to be defined appropriately for the overall model
dense2 = Dense(units=5, activation='relu')(dense1)
dense3 = Dense(units=7, activation='relu')(dense1) #dense3 is another path, independent of dense2

# Reshape to ensure compatibility before concatenation. For example:
reshape1 = Reshape((10,1))(dense2)
reshape2 = Reshape((7,1))(dense3)

# Concatenate the reshaped outputs
merged = Concatenate(axis=1)([reshape1, reshape2])

# Flatten the concatenated tensor and feed to the main model
flatten = keras.layers.Flatten()(merged)
main_model = Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')(flatten) # Example main model

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=main_model)
model.compile(...) # Compile the model as per your requirements
```

**Example 2: Using a Sub-Model**

This demonstrates a more organized approach, particularly beneficial for complex models.  During my work on a large-scale fraud detection system, using sub-models significantly improved the overall maintainability and clarity of the codebase.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input

# Define the sub-model
input_layer = Input(shape=(input_dim,)) #input_dim needs appropriate definition
dense_layer1 = Dense(units=10, activation='relu')(input_layer)
dense_layer2 = Dense(units=5, activation='relu')(dense_layer1)
dense_layer3 = Dense(units=7, activation='relu')(dense_layer1) #Independent processing
sub_model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=[dense_layer2, dense_layer3])

# Concatenate the sub-model outputs
merged = keras.layers.concatenate([sub_model.output[0], sub_model.output[1]])

# Add the main model layers
main_model_input = keras.layers.Input(shape=(12,)) # 5 + 7 from submodel outputs
main_model_dense1 = Dense(units=20, activation='relu')(main_model_input)
main_model_output = Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')(main_model_dense1)

# Create the final model
final_model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=main_model_output)
final_model.compile(...) #Compile as required.
```


**Example 3: Flatten and Concatenate (Simpler Case)**

This approach is suitable only when the dimensions of individual dense layers' outputs are not crucial.  During my early projects, I used this approach for less complex models where preserving the spatial relationships between the features wasn't critical.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Concatenate

# Define multiple dense layers
dense1 = Dense(units=10, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
dense2 = Dense(units=5, activation='relu')(input_tensor)  # Processing in parallel
dense3 = Dense(units=2, activation='relu')(input_tensor)

# Flatten the outputs
flatten1 = Flatten()(dense1)
flatten2 = Flatten()(dense2)
flatten3 = Flatten()(dense3)

# Concatenate the flattened outputs
merged = Concatenate()([flatten1, flatten2, flatten3])

# Add a final dense layer
main_model = Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')(merged)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=main_model)
model.compile(...)  #Compile accordingly.
```

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation on Keras.  This is an indispensable resource for understanding Keras's functionalities and best practices.
*   A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, focusing on practical applications and implementation details.  This will provide a broader theoretical understanding.
*   Specialized literature on model building and optimization in Keras, concentrating on techniques for handling complex inputs and architectures. This will help you to handle complex architectures.


Remember that the most effective method depends entirely on the specific context, the dimensionality of your dense layers' outputs, and the relationships between the features they represent. Careful consideration of these factors is crucial for building a robust and efficient Keras model.  Always prioritize modularity and clarity in your code for easier debugging and maintenance.
