Reindexing a tensor axis in Keras/TensorFlow, while not a direct operation like sorting, requires manipulating the tensor's data through indexing operations or reshaping combined with gather-like operations.  I've encountered situations requiring this frequently during work on sequence-to-sequence models and custom data augmentation pipelines, where input data order sometimes needed re-arrangement mid-pipeline. The core challenge stems from tensors being immutable; you don’t directly change the order within the tensor structure itself, but rather construct a new tensor with the desired reordering.

The fundamental concept involves creating a new tensor based on a specified indexing scheme. This scheme takes the form of another tensor containing the desired indices for the axis you wish to reorder. We don't modify the original tensor in place. The process primarily leverages TensorFlow's tensor indexing capabilities which can be seen as an advanced form of array slicing, particularly the `tf.gather` and `tf.gather_nd` functions combined with the manipulation of index tensors. The key idea is to generate this index tensor appropriately.

For example, consider a tensor representing the temporal sequence of data from a sensor. You might have an initial ordering [0,1,2,3,4] that corresponds to the time indices. If you want to process these time steps in reverse order or perform a random permutation you would need to construct an index tensor like [4,3,2,1,0] or [2,0,3,1,4] respectively. Then, by using this index tensor, you can reorganize the data accordingly.

Here are the primary methods I've employed, along with illustrative code examples:

**1. Reindexing a Single Axis with `tf.gather`:**

This method is most applicable when you're dealing with a 1D indexing schema and want to apply that to one of the axis. Suppose you have a tensor with the shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, feature_dimension)` and you wish to reverse the sequence dimension. The batch size and the feature dimension need to remain unchanged.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def reverse_sequence_axis(tensor):
    """Reverses the sequence axis (axis 1) of a 3D tensor.

    Args:
      tensor: A 3D tensor with shape (batch_size, sequence_length, feature_dimension).

    Returns:
      A new 3D tensor with the sequence axis reversed.
    """

    sequence_length = tf.shape(tensor)[1]
    reversed_indices = tf.range(sequence_length - 1, -1, -1)
    
    # Construct the indices to pass into tf.gather
    new_tensor = tf.gather(tensor, reversed_indices, axis=1)
    return new_tensor


#Example Usage:

example_tensor = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]],
                               [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]], dtype=tf.int32) # Shape: (2,3,2)

reversed_tensor = reverse_sequence_axis(example_tensor)

print("Original Tensor:")
print(example_tensor.numpy())
print("\nReversed Tensor:")
print(reversed_tensor.numpy())

```
In this example,  `tf.range(sequence_length - 1, -1, -1)` creates the reversing sequence of indices which acts as the indices argument to `tf.gather`.  The function `tf.gather` then uses the index tensor to select from the tensor using `axis=1` effectively reversing the sequence. Note that the shapes of the batch and the feature dimensions stay consistent. This is a frequent operation when preparing data for models which might expect a reversed input, such as certain forms of recurrent neural networks.

**2. Reindexing Multiple Axes with `tf.gather_nd`:**

When reindexing becomes more complex, specifically involving multiple axes, `tf.gather_nd` provides the necessary flexibility. This usually involves generating a multi-dimensional index tensor.  For example, I had to implement this when dealing with 3D medical scans to reorder the slice planes for processing by specific neural network architectures.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def permute_axes(tensor, permutation):
    """Permutes the axes of a tensor.

    Args:
      tensor: A tensor with a variable number of dimensions.
      permutation: A list of integers representing the desired axis order.
                   e.g. [2, 0, 1]

    Returns:
      A new tensor with the axes permuted.
    """
    rank = len(permutation)
    new_shape = tf.shape(tensor)
    
    index_tensor_list = []
    for i in range(rank):
      index_tensor_list.append(tf.range(new_shape[permutation[i]]))
    
    mesh = tf.meshgrid(*index_tensor_list, indexing = 'ij')
    index_tensor = tf.stack(mesh, axis = -1)

    new_tensor = tf.gather_nd(tensor, index_tensor)
    return new_tensor

# Example Usage:
example_tensor = tf.reshape(tf.range(24), (2, 3, 4))

permuted_tensor = permute_axes(example_tensor, [1, 2, 0]) # Swap 0th axis with 1st, and 2nd axis with 0th
print("Original tensor:")
print(example_tensor.numpy())
print("\nPermuted Tensor:")
print(permuted_tensor.numpy())


permuted_tensor = permute_axes(example_tensor, [2, 0, 1]) # Swap 0th with 2nd, 1st with 1st.
print("\nPermuted Tensor [2,0,1]:")
print(permuted_tensor.numpy())
```

Here, the code dynamically creates the index tensor using `tf.meshgrid` with `indexing='ij'` which creates a cartesian product of indices.  `tf.stack` then combines these into a tensor containing the coordinates for the `tf.gather_nd` call. The key element is to ensure that the rank and the permutations are consistent with the original tensor. This allows for the reorganization of the axes based on the given permutation order and is a flexible solution for scenarios where you need to restructure a tensor with multiple dimensions.

**3. Reindexing with Boolean Masks and `tf.boolean_mask`:**

While `tf.boolean_mask` is primarily used to filter elements, it can be adapted for reindexing in certain limited scenarios, especially when the reindexing operation can be expressed through a selection mask. Though, direct re-ordering in arbitrary order is difficult using this method; it can often be adapted if the end goal is to remove certain portions of the data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def mask_reindex(tensor, mask_tensor, axis):
    """Filters out elements on a specified axis using a boolean mask

    Args:
        tensor: Input tensor
        mask_tensor: A boolean tensor of the same size as dimension to be masked
        axis: int, the axis to filter from
    
    Returns:
        A new tensor with elements selected using the boolean mask
    """
    new_tensor = tf.boolean_mask(tensor, mask_tensor, axis = axis)
    return new_tensor

# Example Usage:
example_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]) # Shape (3,3)

mask = tf.constant([True, False, True], dtype = tf.bool)
masked_tensor = mask_reindex(example_tensor, mask, axis = 0)
print("Original Tensor:")
print(example_tensor.numpy())
print("\nMasked Tensor")
print(masked_tensor.numpy())

mask = tf.constant([True, False, True], dtype = tf.bool)
masked_tensor = mask_reindex(example_tensor, mask, axis = 1)
print("\nMasked Tensor Axis 1")
print(masked_tensor.numpy())
```
In this scenario, if the mask on the specific axis to reindex is of a lesser length than the original, the result will be reindexing by simply removing the axes where `mask_tensor` is `False`. This could for example be useful in filtering out certain sequences or features.  This is not a general method to reorder the axes; but more of a method to selectively retain data based on your need. It’s critical to remember that `tf.boolean_mask` removes data, not reorders it in an arbitrary fashion, so it has limited applicability.

In summary, these three methods, using `tf.gather`, `tf.gather_nd` and `tf.boolean_mask`, form the primary toolkit for reindexing tensor axes within Keras/TensorFlow based on index manipulation. The choice between them depends on the nature of the reindexing operation needed: whether it is simple reordering within a single axis, a more complex permutation of multiple axes, or a specific scenario where data removal can also be an acceptable outcome.

For a deeper dive, TensorFlow's documentation on tensor slicing, indexing, `tf.gather` and `tf.gather_nd` is invaluable. Examining examples that use these operations for more complex data manipulations can further illuminate implementation strategies. Textbooks covering deep learning often dedicate chapters to tensor manipulation, providing theoretical underpinnings of these operations.
