The `tf.compat.v1.train` module's lack of a `write_graph` attribute in TensorFlow 2.x stems directly from the fundamental shift in the framework's architecture and its approach to graph construction and execution.  My experience migrating large-scale production models from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x highlighted this transition's core impact.  TensorFlow 1.x relied heavily on static computation graphs, defined explicitly and then executed.  The `write_graph` function facilitated this process, enabling the serialization of the graph definition for visualization, debugging, or deployment to specialized hardware.  TensorFlow 2.x, however, embraces eager execution by default, significantly altering the graph definition and management paradigm.

**1. Explanation of the Architectural Shift:**

TensorFlow 1.x's static graph execution demanded a clear separation between graph construction and execution.  The `write_graph` function was integral to this paradigm, offering a means to inspect and save the constructed graph before execution.  The graph itself was a central object, meticulously defined and optimized.  Conversely, TensorFlow 2.x introduces eager execution, where operations are executed immediately upon evaluation, eliminating the need for explicit graph construction in many common scenarios.  While TensorFlow 2.x still supports graph construction through `tf.function`, it's employed more selectively, primarily for performance optimization and deployment to environments requiring graph-based execution (like mobile devices or TPUs).

The shift from a static graph to a more dynamic, eager execution environment renders the `write_graph` function largely redundant.  In eager execution, the graph is implicitly defined through the sequence of operations, and its representation isn't as readily available or necessary in the same manner as in TensorFlow 1.x.  The emphasis shifts towards tracing execution and potentially creating a graph representation from the recorded trace, rather than explicitly defining and writing a graph beforehand.

This change isn't simply a matter of renaming or relocating a function; it reflects a core philosophical difference in how TensorFlow manages computation.  The capabilities formerly provided by `write_graph` are now addressed through different mechanisms, as elaborated in the following examples.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: TensorFlow 1.x (Illustrative - `write_graph` usage):**

```python
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
tf.disable_v2_behavior()

# Define a simple computation graph
a = tf.constant(10)
b = tf.constant(20)
c = tf.add(a, b)

# Write the graph to a file
tf.train.write_graph(tf.get_default_graph(), './', 'graph.pbtxt', as_text=True)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(c)
    print(result) #Output: 30
```

This exemplifies the TensorFlow 1.x approach.  The graph is explicitly defined, and `write_graph` directly serializes it.  Note the use of `tf.compat.v1` and `tf.disable_v2_behavior()` to simulate the 1.x environment.


**Example 2: TensorFlow 2.x (Eager Execution):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the computation directly (eager execution)
a = tf.constant(10)
b = tf.constant(20)
c = a + b

print(c) # Output: tf.Tensor(30, shape=(), dtype=int32)

# No explicit graph writing needed.  The graph is implicitly defined.
```

Here, the computation happens immediately. The concept of a separately-written graph is absent. The output is a tensor, directly computed.


**Example 3: TensorFlow 2.x (Graph-Mode with `tf.function` and SavedModel):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_model(x):
    return x * 2

# Create a SavedModel
tf.saved_model.save(my_model, './my_model')

# The graph is implicitly saved within the SavedModel.
#  Tools can be used to inspect the graph within the saved model.
```

In this example, `tf.function` allows for graph construction within the context of eager execution.  This created graph is saved within a SavedModel, which serves as the primary mechanism for saving and deploying models in TensorFlow 2.x.  Tools like TensorBoard can be used to visualize the graph contained within the SavedModel.  This approach replaces the need for `write_graph`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides detailed information on the differences between TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x.  Specifically, sections on eager execution, `tf.function`, and SavedModels are highly relevant.  Furthermore, exploring resources on model deployment strategies in TensorFlow 2.x will illuminate the evolution from the `write_graph` approach to the SavedModel mechanism.  Consult the TensorFlow API documentation for detailed explanations of the various functions and classes used in graph building and saving models in TensorFlow 2.x.  Study materials that cover the transition from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x offer crucial context for understanding these architectural changes.  Finally, tutorials showcasing best practices for model saving and deployment within the TensorFlow 2.x ecosystem will be invaluable.
