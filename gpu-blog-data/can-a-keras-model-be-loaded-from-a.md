The core issue lies in the fundamental incompatibility between Keras's native model serialization format (typically HDF5, `.h5`) and the TensorFlow Protocol Buffer format (`*.pb`).  My experience working on large-scale deep learning deployments at a previous firm underscored this limitation.  Keras, while offering a high-level API for building models, relies on a backend – often TensorFlow – for actual computation.  The `.pb` file represents a serialized TensorFlow graph, encompassing the model's architecture and weights, but lacks the crucial metadata necessary for Keras to reconstruct the model object.  Therefore, directly loading a `.pb` file into a Keras environment is not feasible without intermediary steps.


**Explanation:**

Keras models, when saved using `model.save('my_model.h5')`, store not only the network architecture but also auxiliary information like optimizer state, training configurations, and layer-specific details. This rich metadata allows Keras to reinstantiate the model precisely as it was during training.  A `.pb` file, on the other hand, focuses solely on the computational graph. It's a more compact representation, suitable for deployment in environments where the Keras API might not be available, but lacks the richness required for Keras's object-oriented approach.


The process of utilizing a `.pb` file with Keras requires converting the TensorFlow graph contained within into a format Keras can understand.  This typically involves recreating the model architecture in Keras and then loading the weights from the `.pb` file into this newly constructed model.  This requires a deep understanding of the model architecture represented in the `.pb` file, often demanding access to the original model definition.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Basic Model Reconstruction (Assuming Known Architecture)**

This example assumes you know the architecture of the model represented in `model.pb`.  This is the most straightforward approach when the original code that generated the `.pb` is available.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Recreate the model architecture in Keras.  This requires knowledge of the original model.
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Load the weights from the .pb file. This requires careful matching of layers.
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    saver = tf.compat.v1.train.import_meta_graph('model.pb.meta')  # Load meta graph
    saver.restore(sess, 'model.pb') # Restore weights

    # Access weights and biases from the graph.  This part is highly dependent on the graph structure.
    weights1 = sess.run(tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph().get_tensor_by_name('dense/kernel:0'))
    biases1 = sess.run(tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph().get_tensor_by_name('dense/bias:0'))
    weights2 = sess.run(tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph().get_tensor_by_name('dense_1/kernel:0'))
    biases2 = sess.run(tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph().get_tensor_by_name('dense_1/bias:0'))


    # Assign weights to the Keras model
    model.layers[0].set_weights([weights1, biases1])
    model.layers[1].set_weights([weights2, biases2])

# Verify weights have been loaded correctly.
print(model.layers[0].get_weights())
```


**Example 2: Utilizing TensorFlow SavedModel format:**

The TensorFlow SavedModel format offers a more structured and manageable alternative to raw `.pb` files.  It often contains additional metadata making weight assignment easier.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Load the SavedModel
loaded = tf.saved_model.load('saved_model')

#  Inspect the loaded model
print(loaded.signatures)

#  Recreate a Keras model based on the structure revealed by the SavedModel's signature.
#   This is still architecture-dependent, but often less error-prone than dealing directly with .pb.
# ...(Keras model recreation code)...


# Assign weights from the SavedModel to the Keras model.
# ...(Weight assignment code, specific to the model architecture)...
```

**Example 3: Using TensorFlow Hub (for pre-trained models):**

If the `.pb` file represents a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub, leveraging the Hub's API simplifies the process.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

# Load the model from TensorFlow Hub (assuming it's available there)
module = hub.load("path/to/your/hub/module")

# Create a Keras model using the loaded module
model = keras.Sequential([
    module,
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') #add your classification layer
])

# The model is now ready for use.  Note: This assumes the hub module is compatible with the downstream task.
```



**Resource Recommendations:**

*  TensorFlow documentation on SavedModel format.
*  TensorFlow documentation on graph manipulation.
*  Keras documentation on model saving and loading.
*  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning frameworks.
*  Relevant research papers on model portability and deployment.



In summary, while Keras cannot directly load a `.pb` file,  the process involves reconstructing the model architecture within Keras and then loading the weights from the `.pb` file, often necessitating considerable understanding of the underlying TensorFlow graph.  Using the TensorFlow SavedModel format offers a more manageable solution.  For pre-trained models, TensorFlow Hub provides a streamlined approach.  Careful attention to layer mapping and weight assignment is crucial for successful model reconstruction.  Always prioritize utilizing the `.h5` format for Keras model persistence to avoid this complexity.
