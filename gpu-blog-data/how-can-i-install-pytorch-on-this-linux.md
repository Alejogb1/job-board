PyTorch installation on a Linux system outside of the Conda environment necessitates a careful consideration of system dependencies and build configurations. My experience, stemming from years of deploying high-performance computing applications, highlights the crucial role of correctly identifying and satisfying these prerequisites.  Failure to do so frequently results in compilation errors or runtime issues stemming from version mismatches or missing libraries.

**1. Explanation of the PyTorch Installation Process (Non-Conda):**

Installing PyTorch without Conda involves using the official PyTorch installation instructions, which leverage pip, the Python package installer.  This method requires a pre-existing Python installation, ideally version 3.8 or later (though specific requirements vary depending on PyTorch version).  Crucially, PyTorch relies heavily on underlying libraries like CUDA (for GPU acceleration) and other linear algebra libraries like BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage). The presence and correct configuration of these are paramount.

The installation process broadly consists of these steps:

* **Checking System Requirements:**  Verify the Linux distribution's compatibility.  I've personally encountered situations where older kernel versions caused significant problems.  The PyTorch website provides clear compatibility matrices; consult these meticulously.  This step also entails checking for the presence of essential development tools like `gcc`, `g++`, and potentially CMake, depending on whether you're building from source or using pre-built binaries.  Use your distribution's package manager (apt, yum, dnf, etc.) to ensure these are installed and up-to-date.

* **CUDA (Optional but Recommended):** If you intend to utilize a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU, you'll need the CUDA toolkit installed. This involves downloading the appropriate version from the NVIDIA website, carefully matching the CUDA version with the PyTorch version you aim to install. The installation process for CUDA itself usually involves accepting license agreements and running specific installers.  Pay close attention to the environment variables CUDA sets; these are frequently needed for PyTorch to detect and utilize the GPU.  Incorrectly configured environment variables have been a frequent source of headaches in my own deployments.

* **cuDNN (Optional but Recommended if using CUDA):**  cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) further optimizes deep learning operations on NVIDIA GPUs.  Its installation is similar to CUDA, again requiring careful version matching with PyTorch and CUDA.

* **Choosing the Right PyTorch Wheel:**  Instead of building PyTorch from source (which is generally more involved), using pre-built wheels significantly simplifies the process.  The PyTorch website provides commands tailored to different systems, Python versions, CUDA versions (if applicable), and other configurations.  Selecting the incorrect wheel is a frequent cause of errors.  Carefully examine your system specifications and select the precisely matching wheel.

* **Installation using pip:** Once the correct wheel is identified, the installation is straightforward using `pip`.  This usually involves a command like `pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118` (adjusting the URL and flags as necessary depending on your specific setup).  Using `pip3` ensures that the installation occurs within your Python 3 environment.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Installing PyTorch without CUDA (CPU-only):**

```bash
sudo apt update  # Update the package list (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev python3-pip  # Install necessary dependencies

pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

This example assumes a Debian/Ubuntu-based system. The `build-essential` package provides fundamental compilation tools.  The `python3-dev` package provides header files necessary for certain Python extensions.  The final line installs PyTorch, torchvision (for computer vision), and torchaudio (for audio processing) for CPU usage.


**Example 2: Installing PyTorch with CUDA 11.8:**

```bash
# Assuming CUDA 11.8 and cuDNN are already installed and environment variables are set.
# Verify CUDA installation by running `nvcc --version`

pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

This snippet demonstrates the installation with CUDA support. The `--index-url` flag directs pip to the PyTorch wheel repository containing pre-built packages compiled for CUDA 11.8.  Before running this command, ensure the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN are correctly installed and that the necessary environment variables like `CUDA_HOME` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` are set to point to the appropriate directories.  Improperly setting these variables is a common pitfall.


**Example 3:  Handling potential dependency conflicts:**

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip  # Upgrade pip to the latest version

pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 --no-cache-dir
```

This example demonstrates handling potential dependency conflicts. Upgrading pip resolves many version conflicts.  The `--no-cache-dir` flag prevents pip from using a potentially outdated cache, forcing it to download fresh packages.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official PyTorch website's installation instructions.
* The documentation for your specific Linux distribution's package manager.
* The CUDA Toolkit documentation from NVIDIA.
* The cuDNN documentation from NVIDIA.
* A comprehensive guide to Python packaging and virtual environments.


By meticulously following these steps and carefully consulting the recommended resources, you can successfully install PyTorch on your Linux system without relying on Conda.  Remember that version compatibility between PyTorch, CUDA, cuDNN, and your system's libraries is critical for a smooth installation and functional deployment.  Thorough verification of these components before installation significantly minimizes the likelihood of encountering issues.  My past experience emphasizes the value of rigorous pre-installation checks as a crucial step in mitigating potential problems.
