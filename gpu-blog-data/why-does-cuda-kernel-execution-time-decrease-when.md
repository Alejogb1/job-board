The seemingly paradoxical decrease in CUDA kernel execution time when exceeding the maximum threads per block, especially when comparing scenarios like 1024 threads/block versus 2048 threads/block, often stems from how the GPU's hardware architecture manages thread execution and its implications for memory access patterns. Specifically, it's not about the raw computational power, but rather, the efficiency of *work distribution* and the associated cost of global memory operations. I've encountered this behavior numerous times while optimizing rendering pipelines and high-performance numerical simulations.

The crucial element to understand is that the hardware, while capable of supporting numerous threads, executes them in groups called *warps* (typically 32 threads). CUDA doesn’t execute threads individually; it executes them in warps. A block of threads is assigned to a Streaming Multiprocessor (SM), the core compute unit on a CUDA GPU. An SM will process all of a block's threads and will handle threads from multiple blocks simultaneously when possible. If you launch a kernel with a large number of threads, especially exceeding the maximum per block, the driver does not magically create larger blocks. Instead, the GPU handles more *blocks* on more SMs, which implies a different memory access pattern.

The performance decrease at a block size of 1024, compared to a seemingly 'excessive' 2048 threads spread across multiple smaller blocks, is linked to several factors. First, consider that each block of threads has access to a limited amount of fast shared memory within the SM. This shared memory is far quicker to access compared to global memory, the main DRAM on the GPU. With fewer, larger blocks, each thread might have a larger work domain, potentially resulting in increased dependency on slower global memory. Furthermore, using too many threads inside a single block may cause resource contention and decreased occupancy on the SM as the available resources such as registers are rapidly exhausted. Fewer blocks can lead to under-utilization of the GPU’s SMs and therefore decreased hardware utilization. The occupancy percentage decreases which can lead to performance degradation despite having a very high total number of threads, as each block can’t utilize as many hardware resources.

When you launch with an "excessive" number of threads per block, the CUDA runtime does not directly launch a single block of that size. Instead, the grid and block dimensions are reshaped. For example, asking for 2048 threads/block when the limit is 1024, will result in two 1024 threads blocks being launched. Now, the work is distributed across more blocks, and by implication, more SMs. These additional blocks introduce finer granularity of work. With a more distributed approach, threads within smaller blocks are more likely to fit entirely within the SM with enough registers and shared memory available, facilitating better performance.

Another pivotal aspect is coalesced memory access. Global memory access is most efficient when threads within a warp access consecutive memory locations. This "coalescing" reduces the number of memory transactions needed to fetch data. When using large blocks that attempt to do a large number of read/write operations, we often see increased contention at the memory controller, meaning that a large block has significantly more opportunities to request conflicting memory resources. When we execute with more blocks, and therefore more SMs, each block is performing fewer operations and is less likely to conflict with others at the memory controller which reduces latency, in addition to the increased hardware utilization mentioned earlier.

Here are three code examples to illustrate these concepts and the impact of block size on performance. Assume these are simplified sections of a larger kernel, meant only for illustration:

**Example 1: Simple Vector Addition with Large Block:**

```c++
__global__ void vectorAdd_largeBlock(float* a, float* b, float* c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

// Launch with 1024 threads per block, many blocks
dim3 blockDim(1024);
dim3 gridDim((n + blockDim.x - 1) / blockDim.x); // Ensure all 'n' elements are covered
vectorAdd_largeBlock<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

```

This code performs a basic vector addition. With 1024 threads per block, a fewer number of blocks are used. While the operation itself is very simple, a large block with 1024 threads will quickly cause shared memory and register pressure, along with potential memory contention as mentioned before. It may perform more poorly than smaller blocks due to reduced hardware utilization and increased memory contention.

**Example 2: Vector Addition with Multiple Blocks (small):**

```c++
__global__ void vectorAdd_smallBlocks(float* a, float* b, float* c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

// Launch with 256 threads per block, more blocks
dim3 blockDim(256);
dim3 gridDim((n + blockDim.x - 1) / blockDim.x);
vectorAdd_smallBlocks<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

```

This example shows the same vector addition using smaller blocks. This increases the amount of blocks launched, but each block is also smaller, using fewer registers and less shared memory within the SM. This allows the GPU to take advantage of higher occupancy, and less memory contention, potentially resulting in faster execution time for larger vectors when compared to example 1.

**Example 3: Local Memory Optimization within Blocks:**

```c++
__global__ void vectorAdd_localMemory(float* a, float* b, float* c, int n) {
    __shared__ float local_a[256];
    __shared__ float local_b[256];

    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int localIdx = threadIdx.x;

    if (i < n) {
       local_a[localIdx] = a[i];
       local_b[localIdx] = b[i];
       __syncthreads(); // Ensure all threads have loaded data into shared memory

       c[i] = local_a[localIdx] + local_b[localIdx];
   }
}
//Launch with 256 threads/block, more blocks
dim3 blockDim(256);
dim3 gridDim((n + blockDim.x - 1) / blockDim.x);
vectorAdd_localMemory<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);
```

In this third example, I've introduced the usage of shared memory, making this significantly faster. Data is read into shared memory once, and then re-used within the threads, rather than accessing global memory multiple times. This demonstrates how optimizing data access patterns *within* a block can also dramatically improve performance. Note that if we were to perform this same strategy with 1024 threads per block, we will exhaust the available shared memory resource, and encounter the same issues as example 1.

In my experience, the ideal block size depends heavily on the specific kernel’s workload, the GPU architecture, the available registers and shared memory, and the nature of memory access patterns. There isn't a single magic number; it requires empirical evaluation. Generally, smaller blocks (256-512 threads) often perform best, or at least better, compared to very large blocks (1024 or more).

For further study, I recommend exploring the official CUDA programming guide, the CUDA toolkit documentation (specifically, the sections on hardware architecture and memory management), and resources that delve into CUDA occupancy calculations. Publications related to GPU architectures from Nvidia are also beneficial, as they provide insight into hardware-level details. These resources will provide a far more comprehensive understanding beyond the scope of this explanation.
