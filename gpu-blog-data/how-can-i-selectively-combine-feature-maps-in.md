Implementing selective combination of feature maps within a Keras LeNet convolutional layer requires a nuanced understanding of how convolutional layers operate and how their output tensors can be manipulated. The core idea revolves around modifying the default behavior of these layers, which usually pass all output feature maps to the subsequent layer. The goal, in this context, is to exercise control over which feature maps from the convolutional layer will be considered as inputs in the next stage of the network. This process isn't directly supported by standard Keras layers; therefore, one must leverage custom logic using Kerasâ€™ functional API and its tensor manipulation capabilities.

The standard convolutional layer, `Conv2D`, produces a tensor with the dimensions (batch\_size, height, width, channels), where 'channels' represents the feature maps. To achieve selective combination, one essentially needs to apply a mask or selection mechanism at the channel dimension. This involves a multi-stage process: extracting the initial feature maps, defining a selection method (e.g., direct indexing, logical operations), applying the selection, and then passing the results to the next layer.

Here are three practical implementations demonstrating different ways to accomplish selective feature map combination:

**Example 1: Static Indexing**

This method uses pre-defined indices to select specific feature maps. This is suitable when the feature map combination pattern remains constant throughout training and inference.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def selective_conv(input_tensor, filters, kernel_size, strides, padding, selection_indices):
    conv_layer = layers.Conv2D(filters=filters, kernel_size=kernel_size, strides=strides, padding=padding)(input_tensor)
    selected_features = tf.gather(conv_layer, indices=selection_indices, axis=-1)
    return selected_features

# Example usage
input_shape = (28, 28, 1)
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
conv_1_output = selective_conv(input_layer, filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same', selection_indices=[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14])
conv_2_output = layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same')(conv_1_output)
# Further layers would be added

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=conv_2_output)
model.summary()
```

In this example, the `selective_conv` function encapsulates the convolution and the selection logic. `tf.gather` is used to extract feature maps from the convolutional layer output, specified by `selection_indices`. Here, only features located at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 from the original 32 feature maps are retained. The function is then inserted into the model graph during its definition. Using a list as `selection_indices` is feasible for static selection. The resulting `conv_1_output` has fewer feature maps (8) than the standard convolution would output (32) before being fed to the next convolutional layer. This allows for creating specialized subnetworks or to reduce the number of parameters.

**Example 2: Dynamic Masking Based on Input Features**

In some scenarios, the feature map selection should adapt to input characteristics. This can be implemented by learning the selection criteria using another neural network branch. The implementation involves generating a mask, followed by application of the mask to the convolution outputs.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def dynamic_selective_conv(input_tensor, filters, kernel_size, strides, padding):

    conv_layer = layers.Conv2D(filters=filters, kernel_size=kernel_size, strides=strides, padding=padding)(input_tensor)

    mask_layer = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(input_tensor)
    mask_layer = layers.Dense(filters=filters, activation='sigmoid')(mask_layer)
    mask_layer = tf.reshape(mask_layer, shape=(1, 1, 1, filters))
    masked_features = conv_layer * mask_layer

    return masked_features

# Example Usage
input_shape = (28, 28, 1)
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
conv_1_output = dynamic_selective_conv(input_layer, filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same')
conv_2_output = layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same')(conv_1_output)
# Further layers would be added

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=conv_2_output)
model.summary()
```

In this example, `dynamic_selective_conv` includes a pathway to generate a feature map specific mask. Input tensors are globally pooled and then passed to a dense layer whose output has the same number of filters as the convolutional output. A sigmoid activation ensures that each mask output ranges between 0 and 1.  The mask is then reshaped so that it can be broadcast across height and width dimensions, and is finally multiplied with the original convolutional layer's feature maps. This effectively scales each feature map, allowing to learn which are useful by learning the appropriate mask value. While this method uses multiplication for masking, it offers a degree of soft selection allowing the model to learn to prioritize specific features during training. It allows the model to dynamically adapt which feature maps are considered in response to the input data.

**Example 3: Learnable Gating Mechanism**

This method introduces a learnable 'gate' parameter for each feature map, allowing the model to dynamically choose which feature maps are more relevant. It is akin to an attention mechanism applied to feature map channels.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def gated_selective_conv(input_tensor, filters, kernel_size, strides, padding):
    conv_layer = layers.Conv2D(filters=filters, kernel_size=kernel_size, strides=strides, padding=padding)(input_tensor)

    gate_parameters = tf.Variable(tf.ones(shape=(1, 1, 1, filters), dtype=tf.float32), trainable=True)
    gated_features = conv_layer * gate_parameters
    return gated_features

# Example Usage
input_shape = (28, 28, 1)
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
conv_1_output = gated_selective_conv(input_layer, filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same')
conv_2_output = layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(1, 1), padding='same')(conv_1_output)
# Further layers would be added

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=conv_2_output)
model.summary()
```

In this implementation, `gated_selective_conv` creates a learnable parameter tensor, initialized to ones. This tensor is multiplied with the convolutional layer's feature maps, effectively scaling each feature map by its corresponding learnable parameter.  The initial value of one ensures that no feature map is initially excluded or reduced. Training the model adjusts these parameters, allowing certain feature maps to be gated or prioritized over others. This method offers a simple and efficient way to implement feature map selection by training a linear scaling factor and is typically faster to train than the more complex dynamic masking approach.

These examples showcase three ways that feature maps from a LeNet Convolutional layer can be selectively combined. All require some level of custom logic and manipulation of tensors. The selection of one strategy over another depends on the requirements of the task and the desired level of adaptivity.

For deeper understanding of Keras layers, the Keras documentation on core layers, convolutional layers, and the functional API would be beneficial. Research papers on attention mechanisms and feature selection in deep learning would provide the theoretical background necessary for developing bespoke solutions. Additionally, examining TensorFlow's API regarding tensor manipulation operations like `tf.gather`, `tf.reshape`, and broadcasting can allow for designing more sophisticated custom layers.
