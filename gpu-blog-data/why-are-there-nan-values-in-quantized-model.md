Quantized models, while offering significant performance advantages in terms of reduced memory footprint and faster inference speeds, often introduce complexities in evaluation.  One particularly frustrating issue is the appearance of NaN (Not a Number) values in computed metrics.  This stems primarily from the inherent limitations of quantization and the subsequent impact on numerical stability during the evaluation process.  My experience troubleshooting this across numerous embedded vision projects highlights a crucial point:  NaNs in quantized model evaluations are rarely a singular problem, but rather a symptom of underlying issues in either the quantization process itself or the metrics calculation.

**1. Explanation: The Root Causes of NaN in Quantized Model Evaluation**

The appearance of NaN values in metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC often traces back to two main sources:  (a) numerical instability during calculations involving extremely small or zero values, and (b) inconsistencies between the data types used for ground truth and the quantized model's output.

**(a) Numerical Instability:**  Quantization inherently introduces approximation errors.  Rounding floating-point values to lower precision (e.g., int8) can lead to zero values where small non-zero values previously existed. This can dramatically affect calculations involving divisions and logarithms.  For example, consider the calculation of precision: `true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)`. If both `true_positives` and `false_positives` are quantized to zero, the result is division by zero, leading to NaN.  Similarly, metrics relying on logarithmic functions (like some variations of cross-entropy loss) can produce NaNs if the input falls outside the valid domain (e.g., taking the logarithm of zero).

**(b) Data Type Mismatches:** Discrepancies between the data types of the ground truth labels and the quantized modelâ€™s predictions are a frequent culprit.  If your ground truth labels are stored as floats and the quantized model outputs integers, direct comparison and metric calculation can lead to errors.  The subtle differences introduced by quantization can cause discrepancies that propagate through the evaluation process, resulting in NaN values. For instance, a predicted probability of 0.49 might be quantized to 0, resulting in a false negative when compared against a floating-point ground truth value.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate potential sources of NaN values and demonstrate how to mitigate them.  These are simplified for clarity and assume a binary classification scenario.

**Example 1: Division by Zero**

```python
import numpy as np

true_positives = np.array([0, 0], dtype=np.int8)  # Quantized to zero
false_positives = np.array([0, 0], dtype=np.int8)  # Quantized to zero

precision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)

print(precision)  # Output: [nan nan]
```

**Commentary:** This example clearly shows division by zero error arising from quantization. The solution involves careful handling of potential zero values during the metric calculation.  A robust implementation should include checks and appropriate fallback mechanisms.

**Example 2: Handling Zero Values in Metric Calculation**

```python
import numpy as np

true_positives = np.array([0, 2], dtype=np.int8)
false_positives = np.array([0, 1], dtype=np.int8)

precision = np.divide(true_positives, true_positives + false_positives, out=np.zeros_like(true_positives), where=(true_positives + false_positives) != 0)

print(precision)  # Output: [0. 0.66666667]
```

**Commentary:** This improved version uses `np.divide` with `out` and `where` parameters to handle potential division by zero.  `out` pre-allocates an array filled with zeros to replace NaN results and `where` specifies the condition for the division. This approach is generally preferred for efficiency and handling edge cases.


**Example 3: Data Type Mismatch**

```python
import numpy as np

ground_truth = np.array([0.1, 0.9, 0.2, 0.8], dtype=np.float32) # Floating point ground truth
predictions = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1], dtype=np.int8)  # Integer predictions

# Direct comparison leads to inaccurate results and potential issues
# Incorrect: binary_predictions = (predictions > 0.5)

# Thresholding the continuous output before quantization is preferable
quantized_predictions_float = np.where(predictions > 0.5, 1.0, 0.0)
binary_predictions = quantized_predictions_float.astype(np.int8)

accuracy = np.sum(binary_predictions == ground_truth.astype(np.int8)) / len(ground_truth)
print(accuracy) # Output:  0.5, a less noisy result.
```

**Commentary:** This example highlights the importance of consistent data types and demonstrating the concept of thresholding the predictions prior to quantization.  Direct comparison between floats and integers is prone to error. By explicitly quantizing the continuous model outputs, we can mitigate this risk and improve evaluation accuracy.  Converting ground truth to integers for comparison aids in the numerical stability of the accuracy calculation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding of quantization techniques, I recommend exploring standard machine learning textbooks that cover quantization strategies.  For numerical stability in scientific computing, consult resources on numerical analysis and linear algebra.  Finally, in-depth knowledge of the specific libraries used (e.g., TensorFlow Lite Micro, PyTorch Mobile) is critical for effective troubleshooting.  Familiarize yourself with the documentation and available tools for debugging quantized models within those frameworks. The use of rigorous unit tests with boundary condition checks is crucial in avoiding this issue entirely.
