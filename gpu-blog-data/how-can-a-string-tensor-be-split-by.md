The core challenge in splitting a string tensor by whitespace while preserving whitespace characters lies in the inherent nature of `split` operations, which typically discard delimiters.  Over the years, working on large-scale natural language processing tasks, I've encountered this frequently.  The solution necessitates a more nuanced approach, moving beyond simple `split` functions and leveraging more powerful regular expression-based techniques. This allows for the capture and preservation of the delimiting whitespace.


**1. Clear Explanation**

The most straightforward method involves using regular expressions to identify and capture whitespace sequences within the string tensor.  Regular expressions provide the flexibility to define patterns for various whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) and include them in the resulting splits. This contrasts with standard string splitting which typically treats the delimiter as an invisible separator.  The key here is to utilize a capture group in the regular expression to explicitly include the whitespace in the output.

We leverage the power of capturing groups within a regular expression to achieve this.  A capture group is defined by parentheses `()` in the regular expression pattern. Anything matched within the parentheses is captured and made available as a separate element in the output.

Consider the input string "This is a  test string.\tWith multiple\nwhitespace characters."  A naive `split()` would yield ["This", "is", "a", "test", "string.", "With", "multiple", "whitespace", "characters."].  However, using a regular expression with a capture group, we can retain information about where the whitespace occurred. The resultant array will include the whitespace itself as individual elements, ensuring that the original string structure is faithfully represented.  The choice of the regex pattern depends on the specific type of whitespace to preserve.  For instance, `\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters.  More specific patterns can be used to handle only specific whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, or newlines if required.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate the approach in Python using NumPy (for tensor manipulation), and illustrate different levels of whitespace handling.  These examples assume the input string tensor is already loaded into a NumPy array, a typical scenario in my experience with NLP pipelines.

**Example 1: Preserving all whitespace characters**

```python
import numpy as np
import re

strings = np.array(["This is a test string.", "Another example\twith tabs.", "Multiple\nnewlines here."])

def split_preserve_whitespace(string):
    return re.findall(r'(\s+)|(\S+)', string)

split_strings = np.apply_along_axis(split_preserve_whitespace, 0, strings)

#The resulting array will contain alternating whitespace and non-whitespace elements.
print(split_strings)

#Post-processing may be needed to flatten or restructure as required depending on downstream processes.

```

This example utilizes `re.findall()` to find all occurrences of either one or more whitespace characters (`\s+`) or one or more non-whitespace characters (`\S+`).  The use of capture groups ensures that both are captured separately and then arranged in the output as separate components. `np.apply_along_axis` applies this function along the axis of the numpy array.

**Example 2:  Preserving only spaces**

```python
import numpy as np
import re

strings = np.array(["This is a test string.", "Another example with spaces."])

def split_preserve_spaces(string):
    return re.findall(r'([ ]+)|(\S+)', string)

split_strings = np.apply_along_axis(split_preserve_spaces, 0, strings)
print(split_strings)
```

This example demonstrates a more targeted approach. By modifying the regular expression to `([ ]+)|(\S+)`, only spaces (`[ ]+`) are captured and included in the output.  This is useful when you wish to maintain space information, excluding other types of whitespace like tabs or newlines.

**Example 3: Handling different whitespace characters separately**

```python
import numpy as np
import re

strings = np.array(["This is a test string.\tWith tabs and\nnewlines."])

def split_by_whitespace_type(string):
    return re.findall(r'(\s+)|(\S+)', string)

split_strings = np.apply_along_axis(split_by_whitespace_type, 0, strings)

#Post processing to handle separate whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines)
processed_strings = []
for string_array in split_strings:
  temp_list = []
  for item in string_array:
    if item:
      if item.isspace():
          if '\t' in item:
              temp_list.append('\t') # Handle tabs
          elif '\n' in item:
              temp_list.append('\n') # Handle newlines
          else:
              temp_list.append(' ') # Handle spaces
      else:
          temp_list.append(item)
  processed_strings.append(temp_list)
print(processed_strings)
```

This example builds upon the previous ones but adds post-processing to categorise and treat different whitespace types differently, providing finer control.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deep understanding of regular expressions, I recommend consulting a comprehensive guide to regular expressions. A thorough grasp of NumPy array manipulation techniques is also essential for handling tensor operations effectively. Finally, familiarization with the specifics of the chosen programming language's string manipulation capabilities is crucial for efficient implementation.  These resources will provide the foundational knowledge for efficient and correct implementation of this solution, addressing edge cases and optimizing performance for large datasets.
