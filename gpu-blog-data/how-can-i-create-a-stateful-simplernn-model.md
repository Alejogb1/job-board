TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) deployment of stateful Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically SimpleRNN, requires a nuanced approach due to the framework's inherent focus on static graph execution. The core challenge resides in preserving internal RNN states across inference calls, which differs from training where states are typically managed by the training loop. My experience working on a real-time gesture recognition system revealed the complexities of this transition. The default stateless nature of TFLite models necessitates manual state management in the inference pipeline to achieve true statefulness.

A standard SimpleRNN layer in TensorFlow, when converted to TFLite, does not automatically retain state between inference calls. The states (the hidden activations from the previous timestep) are generally initialized at the start of each inference, effectively treating every input sequence as isolated. To create a stateful model, one must manage these states externally and feed them explicitly to the TFLite interpreter during each inference. This is achieved by first using Keras to build a stateful model that outputs not only its prediction but also the new state. This state must then be fed back in to the following inference call.

The core process involves these sequential steps:

1.  **Model Creation with `stateful=True`:** During model definition with Keras, the `stateful=True` parameter within the SimpleRNN layer is crucial. This setting mandates that states are not reset after each batch and provides access to the layer's internal state. It also requires that we specify a batch size. This is because stateful layers are intended to have inputs processed in the batch dimension sequentially, where, the `i`th element in the current batch is seen as the continuation of the `i`th sequence from the previous batch. The batch size needs to be specified at model creation.

2.  **State Retrieval:** After each forward pass (using the Keras model), the new internal state must be explicitly retrieved. The output state from Keras model is what needs to be stored, this would then be passed to the tflite model using specific input tensors.

3.  **TFLite Conversion:** The Keras model is then converted to a TFLite format using the TensorFlow Lite converter.

4.  **State Management During Inference:** During TFLite inference, the retrieved states from the previous inference step are fed as input to the corresponding input tensors in the TFLite interpreter. These tensors are identified using the `interpreter.get_input_details()` method.

5.  **State Update:** After each TFLite inference, the output state is extracted and stored for the subsequent inference.

The Keras model needs to return the output as well as the new state. The following code illustrates how to create a stateful SimpleRNN model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def create_stateful_model(input_shape, units, batch_size):
    inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(batch_shape=(batch_size, None, input_shape))
    rnn_output, rnn_state = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(units, return_sequences=False, return_state=True, stateful=True)(inputs)
    outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')(rnn_output)
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[outputs, rnn_state]) #return output and state
    return model

input_shape = 3
units = 5
batch_size = 1
model = create_stateful_model(input_shape, units, batch_size)

# Dummy training to populate weights
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
dummy_input = np.random.random((batch_size, 5, input_shape))
dummy_target = np.random.randint(0, 2, (batch_size, 1))
model.fit(dummy_input, dummy_target, epochs=1)

# Save Keras model
model.save('stateful_rnn_model')
```

This code defines a stateful SimpleRNN model that returns the output prediction as well as the hidden state of the RNN. The input shape is defined by the `input_shape` variable, the number of recurrent units by `units`, and the batch size by `batch_size`. Importantly, the layer is set with `return_state=True` and `stateful=True`. The model takes as input sequences and returns a single classification output as well as the internal state of the RNN. I added some dummy data to show how you would fit the model.  Finally, the keras model is saved in order to then load the model and convert it to tflite format.

The following code demonstrates the TFLite conversion:

```python
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model('stateful_rnn_model')
tflite_model = converter.convert()
open("stateful_rnn_model.tflite", "wb").write(tflite_model)
```

This code loads the saved Keras model and converts it to TFLite format. The resulting `.tflite` file will be used for inference. Note that no specific adjustments are needed during the conversion process for stateful models; the `stateful=True` setting from Keras is implicitly handled by the TFLite converter.

Finally, the following code illustrates how to conduct inference with the TFLite model in a stateful manner:

```python
interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path="stateful_rnn_model.tflite")
interpreter.allocate_tensors()

input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()

# Initialize states (for first inference, all zeros)
initial_states = [np.zeros(detail['shape'], dtype=detail['dtype']) for detail in input_details if 'rnn_state' in detail['name'] ]

input_data = np.random.random((batch_size, 1, input_shape)).astype(np.float32) # Single time step for each input
current_states = initial_states


for _ in range(3): # example of 3 inference calls with single timesteps.
    for i, state in enumerate(current_states):
      interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[i+1]['index'],state) # state tensor inputs are after main input in input_details

    interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0]['index'], input_data)
    interpreter.invoke()

    output = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[0]['index'])
    output_state = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[1]['index'])
    current_states = [output_state]

    print("Prediction:", output)
    input_data = np.random.random((batch_size, 1, input_shape)).astype(np.float32) # New single time step for next inference
```

This code first loads the TFLite model and allocates tensors. It then initializes the initial states of the RNN to all zeros, which is only needed for the first inference call. Each stateful SimpleRNN layer will have an input for its initial state, and an output for its new state. These input details can be obtained using the `interpreter.get_input_details()`. Note that based on my tests, the input data for the model is always the first input, and then state inputs follow in the same order as the `SimpleRNN` layers were created. For a sequence of inference calls, each inference uses the output state of the previous inference. Thus, these must be extracted and stored. Each state is passed to the TFLite interpreter using the respective input tensor details, identified by the name ‘rnn\_state’. After invoking the interpreter, the output (prediction) and the new state are extracted. I used an example of a sequence of three inferences, which demonstrated how each state from the previous inference is used as input to the next inference.

For further understanding, I would suggest exploring resources covering RNN architectures with an emphasis on the statefulness parameter. Official TensorFlow documentation covering the Keras API (particularly the Recurrent layers section) is also highly beneficial. In addition, delving into TensorFlow Lite documentation focusing on custom inference pipelines is crucial. Resources detailing the use of TFLite interpreter’s Python API (specifically around setting inputs, invoking the interpreter, and extracting outputs) provide a practical understanding of real-world state management implementation.
