Disabling specific Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) units, typically referred to as SMX units on NVIDIA GPUs, is not a direct, user-accessible configuration option exposed by typical graphics driver APIs or consumer-grade tools. The hardware architecture and driver software are designed for abstracted management of processing resources, including SMs. While you cannot flip a switch to deactivate individual SMs, there are scenarios and indirect methods where the practical effect of disabling them can be observed, primarily during development and testing rather than for general system use. My experience, especially when working on GPU performance analysis and customized compute kernels, highlights several nuances of this topic.

The primary reason we cannot arbitrarily disable SMs stems from how the GPU's architecture and scheduler handle workload distribution. The hardware scheduler is responsible for assigning work to available SMs, often dynamically, based on load and data dependencies. Lower-level interaction, below the CUDA API or other similar compute frameworks, is usually the realm of the driver and firmware. Attempts to directly manipulate the hardware execution units below this abstracted level could result in system instability or unexpected behavior. However, a deeper understanding of how GPU resources are used, along with specific toolchains, reveals alternative means to indirectly influence which SMs become active or idle during execution.

One indirect method for limiting SM utilization involves controlling the thread block size of CUDA kernels. When a kernel launches, the number of thread blocks launched directly influences the occupancy of the GPU’s streaming multiprocessors. If the number of thread blocks is less than what is required to saturate all SMs, then some SMs will be left idle. While not a direct disabling, this method effectively prevents work from being dispatched on specific SMs. For example, consider a GPU with 20 SMs. If a CUDA kernel is launched with only 10 thread blocks, at maximum, only 10 SMs will be utilized, assuming one block per SM. This behavior is a result of the GPU’s work scheduling algorithms. There isn't a one-to-one mapping guarantee but the thread block count provides a ceiling on utilization. This method is typically used in testing and profiling to isolate performance to a subset of the available SMs.

Let's examine some code to illustrate this indirect control. This first example shows a basic CUDA kernel.
```cpp
__global__ void simpleKernel(float *output, int size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
        output[i] = static_cast<float>(i) * 2.0f;
    }
}

int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    float *output_h = new float[size];
    float *output_d;
    cudaMalloc(&output_d, size * sizeof(float));

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock; // Ceiling division

    simpleKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(output_d, size);
    cudaMemcpy(output_h, output_d, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // ... Further code to verify output
    cudaFree(output_d);
    delete[] output_h;
    return 0;
}
```
In the above example, the number of `blocksPerGrid` will dictate how many SMs are actively used. If the number of SMs on the target device is greater than the `blocksPerGrid`, we will observe that not all SMs are processing. This method is the simplest way to influence which SMs are in use. For the above, if `size` is equal to 1024 and `threadsPerBlock` is equal to 256, then we have a total of four blocks. This will result in some SMs being idle on most modern GPUs.

Another method of influencing the SMs utilization is by modifying the launch configuration and the resource utilization per thread block. Suppose we require more control over the compute resources and want to use as many SMs as possible, but with smaller workloads per thread block.  This may help expose a particular bottleneck if, for example, thread block size is not the constraint. Here's an example of how we can do that.
```cpp
__global__ void computeKernel(float *input, float *output, int size) {
   int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size){
        float localSum = 0.0f;
        for(int j = 0; j < 100; j++){
             localSum += static_cast<float>(j)*input[i]; //Dummy workload
        }
        output[i] = localSum;
    }
}

int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    float *input_h = new float[size];
    float *output_h = new float[size];
    float *input_d, *output_d;
    cudaMalloc(&input_d, size * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc(&output_d, size * sizeof(float));

    //Initialize Input
    for(int i = 0; i<size; i++) input_h[i] = static_cast<float>(i);
    cudaMemcpy(input_d, input_h, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    int threadsPerBlock = 16;
    int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    computeKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(input_d, output_d, size);
    cudaMemcpy(output_h, output_d, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // ... Further code to verify output
    cudaFree(input_d);
    cudaFree(output_d);
    delete[] input_h;
    delete[] output_h;
    return 0;
}
```
Here, we reduced the number of threads per block (`threadsPerBlock` is now 16) resulting in a higher number of blocks. Thus, increasing the chance of more SMs being active. The dummy workload is added to keep the kernel active for longer and allow profiling tools to get a good reading. This is another indirect method which influences which SMs are being used. Note that the performance and utilization is dependent on the specifics of the hardware and the CUDA Compute Capability of the target hardware.

Finally, more advanced hardware-specific tools and lower-level libraries, which are not usually part of the general CUDA distribution, may give deeper insight. While direct control is not typically possible, these methods allow more specialized debugging. These types of tools involve access to hardware performance counters. The use of this methodology often involves reading raw performance data and is outside the standard tools provided by most GPU libraries. To illustrate, here is an example of a hypothetical tool call that queries hardware performance counters. This code is not executable, it is purely for illustrative purposes.
```cpp
//This code snippet is for illustrative purposes only and is NOT executable.
//It represents an abstraction of a complex library call.
void queryHardwareCounters(int startSM, int endSM){
    HardwareCounterQuery counterQuery;
    counterQuery.setDevice(0);
    counterQuery.setStartSM(startSM);
    counterQuery.setEndSM(endSM);
    counterQuery.addCounter("sm__active_cycles_avg");
    counterQuery.addCounter("sm__inst_executed_per_cycle_active");

    std::vector<std::map<std::string,double>> results = counterQuery.execute();

    for(auto& smResult : results){
        std::cout << "SM Data: " << std::endl;
        for(auto const&[name, val] : smResult){
            std::cout << name << ": " << val << std::endl;
        }
    }

}

int main(){
    //Observe the SM activity when specific ranges of SMs are being used.
    //The implementation of 'queryHardwareCounters' is not defined, it is for illustrative purposes.
    queryHardwareCounters(0,4); // Observe activity on first 4 SMs
    //Execute a Kernel here.
    queryHardwareCounters(16,20); // Observe activity on SM 16 to 20.

    return 0;
}
```

Here, if we run a kernel after we perform the first hardware query, we can see the activity on the specified SMs via the performance counters. We could then, by running more specific tests, see the performance differences on a subset of the available SMs. Using these hypothetical tools, we could narrow down performance bottlenecks by focusing on the activities of individual SM units. The important aspect is, these queries do not *disable* the SMs, but they allow performance introspection to identify potential issues.

In summary, while directly disabling specific SM units is not possible with standard tools and drivers, careful manipulation of launch parameters like thread block size and resource allocation can indirectly influence which SMs become active. Further, hardware-specific performance analysis tools can give a user an idea of how and which SMs are utilized. These methods are mostly employed for development, profiling, and hardware debugging purposes, rather than general-purpose user configurations. Resources to deepen this knowledge include NVIDIA's CUDA programming guides and documentation, as well as academic publications on GPU microarchitecture and performance analysis.
