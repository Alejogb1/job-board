The premature termination of Keras training with `fit_generator` after a single epoch often stems from an incorrect understanding or misconfiguration of the data generator's `__len__` method and its interaction with the `steps_per_epoch` argument in `fit_generator`.  In my experience troubleshooting model training across diverse projects – including a recent large-scale image classification task involving millions of samples – I've consistently observed this issue arising from a mismatch between the generator's output and the training loop's expectations.

The core problem lies in how Keras interprets the number of training steps.  `fit_generator` requires knowing the number of batches per epoch to schedule the training process correctly.  If `steps_per_epoch` is improperly defined, or if the generator's `__len__` method doesn't accurately reflect the number of batches it will yield, the training loop assumes the epoch is complete after processing the batches it receives, regardless of whether all data has been seen. This leads to the observed premature termination.

**Explanation:**

The `fit_generator` function relies on the provided generator to produce batches of data.  The `steps_per_epoch` argument informs `fit_generator` how many batches should be processed before considering an epoch finished. The generator's `__len__` method, if implemented, returns the number of batches the generator will produce in one epoch. If `steps_per_epoch` is not specified, Keras uses the value returned by `__len__`  as the default.  If this value is inaccurate or `__len__` is not implemented, the training stops prematurely.  Further, if `steps_per_epoch` is explicitly provided and is smaller than the actual number of batches required to exhaust the dataset, the training will stop early, believing the epoch is complete.

Failure to properly define either `steps_per_epoch` or the generator's `__len__` method are the most common sources of this problem.  Inconsistencies between the specified `steps_per_epoch` and the number of batches actually generated by the `fit_generator` lead to abrupt termination.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Incorrect `__len__` Implementation:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

class MyGenerator(keras.utils.Sequence):
    def __init__(self, x, y, batch_size):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.batch_size = batch_size

    def __len__(self):  # Incorrect: Returns number of samples, not batches
        return len(self.x)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        batch_x = self.x[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) * self.batch_size]
        batch_y = self.y[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) * self.batch_size]
        return batch_x, batch_y

# Sample data
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
batch_size = 10

generator = MyGenerator(x_train, y_train, batch_size)
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Training will stop after one batch (or one epoch if steps_per_epoch is not specified)!
model.fit_generator(generator, epochs=10)
```
This example demonstrates an inaccurate `__len__` implementation.  It returns the number of samples, not batches, leading to the training halting prematurely.


**Example 2: Missing `__len__` and Incorrect `steps_per_epoch`:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

class MyGenerator(keras.utils.Sequence):
    def __init__(self, x, y, batch_size):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.batch_size = batch_size

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        batch_x = self.x[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) * self.batch_size]
        batch_y = self.y[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) * self.batch_size]
        return batch_x, batch_y

# Sample data
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
batch_size = 10

generator = MyGenerator(x_train, y_train, batch_size)
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Training might stop prematurely due to the incorrect steps_per_epoch
model.fit_generator(generator, steps_per_epoch=1, epochs=10)

```
Here, the `__len__` method is missing, and `steps_per_epoch` is set to 1, forcing the training to complete only one batch per epoch.



**Example 3: Correct Implementation:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

class MyGenerator(keras.utils.Sequence):
    def __init__(self, x, y, batch_size):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.batch_size = batch_size

    def __len__(self):
        return int(np.ceil(len(self.x) / float(self.batch_size)))

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        batch_x = self.x[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) * self.batch_size]
        batch_y = self.y[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) * self.batch_size]
        return batch_x, batch_y

# Sample data
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
batch_size = 10

generator = MyGenerator(x_train, y_train, batch_size)
model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Training will complete correctly
model.fit_generator(generator, epochs=10)

```
This example shows the correct implementation of `__len__`, accurately calculating the number of batches.  This ensures that `fit_generator` processes the entire dataset per epoch.  Note that even without specifying `steps_per_epoch`, the training will run correctly because the `__len__` method provides the necessary information.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation on data handling and `fit_generator` (and its successor `fit`),  a comprehensive textbook on deep learning such as "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet, and official TensorFlow documentation on data input pipelines are valuable resources for a deeper understanding.  Furthermore, reviewing examples of custom data generators in various Keras tutorials can provide practical insights. Remember to carefully examine the error messages generated during training, as these often pinpoint the root cause of the problem.  Debugging your data generator with print statements to monitor the output at each step is an effective debugging technique.
