Accessing disparate labeled data points within a PyTorch dataset requires a nuanced approach, exceeding simple random sampling.  The core challenge lies in efficiently identifying and retrieving items based on their labels, while handling potential label imbalances and ensuring reproducibility.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects highlighted this, leading to the development of several strategies I'll detail here.

**1.  Understanding the Data Structure and Label Access:**

The first step involves a thorough understanding of your dataset's structure.  PyTorch datasets generally provide mechanisms to access both the data and the corresponding labels.  This usually takes the form of an iterable object, where each element is a tuple (or similar structure) containing the data point and its label.  If your dataset doesn't directly expose labels in this way (for instance, if you are working with a custom dataset), you'll need to implement this functionality yourself.  This typically involves creating a class inheriting from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`, overriding the `__getitem__` and `__len__` methods to manage data access and label retrieval.

**2.  Sampling Strategies:**

Several strategies can effectively sample two items with differing labels. The choice depends on the size of your dataset and the desired level of control over the sampling process.

* **Stratified Sampling:**  This method is ideal when dealing with imbalanced datasets, ensuring representation from each label. It involves dividing the dataset into strata (subsets) based on labels, then randomly sampling from each stratum.  This guarantees a sample containing at least one item per label if each label has at least one representative.  For small datasets, it might require modifications to handle cases where a stratum contains fewer than two elements.


* **Random Sampling with Label Check:** A simpler approach involves random sampling followed by a check for differing labels.  If the labels are identical, the process repeats until two items with distinct labels are obtained. While straightforward, this approach can be inefficient for large datasets with many instances of certain labels, resulting in numerous iterations.  This is especially true for heavily imbalanced datasets.


* **Deterministic Sampling Based on Label Indices:**  If reproducibility is paramount, a deterministic method is preferable. This involves constructing an index mapping labels to their corresponding data points.  Then, you select indices representing distinct labels and retrieve the associated data. This ensures that, given the same input dataset, the method will always return the same sample.


**3. Code Examples:**

Here are three code examples illustrating the aforementioned sampling strategies.  These examples assume a dataset structured as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a data point and its associated label (represented numerically for simplicity).

**Example 1: Stratified Sampling**

```python
import random
import torch

def stratified_sample(dataset, num_samples=2):
    """Samples items with different labels using stratified sampling."""
    label_dict = {}
    for data, label in dataset:
        if label not in label_dict:
            label_dict[label] = []
        label_dict[label].append((data, label))

    if len(label_dict) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Insufficient labels for stratified sampling.")

    sampled_items = []
    for label, items in label_dict.items():
        if len(items) > 0:  # Handle cases where a label might have zero entries.
            sampled_items.append(random.choice(items))
            if len(sampled_items) == num_samples:
                break
            
    return sampled_items if len(sampled_items) == num_samples else None


dataset = [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 2), (6, 2)]
samples = stratified_sample(dataset)

if samples:
    for item in samples:
        print(f"Data: {item[0]}, Label: {item[1]}")
else:
    print("Sampling failed - insufficient unique labels in the dataset.")

```

This function uses a dictionary to group items by label, making it easy to sample from each group.  The error handling addresses cases where stratified sampling is impossible due to insufficient label diversity.


**Example 2: Random Sampling with Label Check**

```python
import random

def random_sample_with_check(dataset, num_samples=2):
    """Samples items with different labels using random sampling with a label check."""
    sampled_items = []
    while len(sampled_items) < num_samples:
        item = random.choice(dataset)
        if not sampled_items or item[1] != sampled_items[-1][1]:
            sampled_items.append(item)
    return sampled_items


dataset = [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 2), (6, 2)]
samples = random_sample_with_check(dataset)

for item in samples:
    print(f"Data: {item[0]}, Label: {item[1]}")

```

This approach leverages random sampling but incorporates a crucial check to guarantee unique labels in the returned samples.  Its efficiency diminishes with heavily imbalanced datasets.


**Example 3: Deterministic Sampling Based on Label Indices**

```python
import numpy as np

def deterministic_sample(dataset, num_samples=2):
    """Samples items with different labels deterministically using label indices."""

    label_indices = {}
    for i, (data, label) in enumerate(dataset):
        if label not in label_indices:
            label_indices[label] = []
        label_indices[label].append(i)

    unique_labels = list(label_indices.keys())
    if len(unique_labels) < num_samples:
        raise ValueError("Insufficient unique labels for deterministic sampling.")

    selected_labels = unique_labels[:num_samples]
    selected_indices = [label_indices[label][0] for label in selected_labels]

    return [dataset[i] for i in selected_indices]



dataset = [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 2), (6, 2)]
samples = deterministic_sample(dataset)
for item in samples:
    print(f"Data: {item[0]}, Label: {item[1]}")

```

This example uses a dictionary to store the indices for each label, enabling deterministic selection. Error handling ensures the function raises an appropriate exception if insufficient unique labels are available.  This method is crucial for reproducing results.


**4.  Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of dataset management and sampling techniques in PyTorch, consult the official PyTorch documentation.  The documentation on `torch.utils.data` provides comprehensive guidance on custom dataset creation and data loading.  Furthermore, exploring materials on statistical sampling methods will offer valuable insights into the nuances of stratified and other sampling techniques.  Reviewing texts on data preprocessing and machine learning best practices will further enhance your knowledge in this area.
