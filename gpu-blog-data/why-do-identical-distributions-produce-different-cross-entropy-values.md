The difference in cross-entropy values when using identical probability distributions to evaluate different vectors stems from the vector-specific nature of the calculation combined with the fact that cross-entropy measures the divergence between two probability distributions – one being the predicted distribution and the other being the ground truth or target distribution. It isn’t a measure of distribution similarity in the abstract; it is an evaluation of how well the *predictions* align with their *specific targets*. I encountered this directly when developing a named-entity recognition model for customer support tickets. Initial experiments, aiming for a simplified baseline, generated unexpected variations in cross-entropy despite feeding the same output distribution into the loss function with different one-hot encoded target vectors.

At its core, cross-entropy quantifies the average number of bits needed to encode outcomes from a target distribution using a coding scheme optimized for a predicted distribution. Specifically, given a predicted probability distribution, *p*, and a true probability distribution, *q*, the cross-entropy *H(q,p)* is computed as:

*H(q,p) = - Σ qᵢ log(pᵢ)*

where the sum is taken across all outcomes. Notice the asymmetry here; the true distribution *q*’s probabilities are used as weights in the summation, while the predicted probabilities, *p*, are what are logarithmically transformed. This asymmetry highlights the directional nature of cross-entropy: it assesses how well *p* approximates *q*, not the other way around.

When we consider how this is applied to vector data, specifically in classification problems, the true distribution *q* is often a one-hot encoded vector representing the correct class label, having a value of 1 for the target class and 0 for all others. In this scenario, the cross-entropy calculation simplifies considerably since *qᵢ* is zero for most terms, leaving only one non-zero term (where *qᵢ* is 1 for the correct class) in the summation. Thus, only the predicted probability *pᵢ* that corresponds to the correct class (represented by the non-zero *qᵢ*) contributes to the loss. The remaining values from the *p* vector, even if they were generated from the same underlying distribution for each prediction, are ignored by the calculation, because their corresponding *qᵢ* values are zero. Thus, identical *p* distributions used with different target labels yield unique cross-entropy values.

Let’s examine three code examples using Python and the NumPy library to clarify.

**Example 1: Identical Predicted Distribution, Different Target Vectors**

```python
import numpy as np

predicted_distribution = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.7])  # Probability distribution for 3 classes
target_vector_1 = np.array([1, 0, 0]) # Correct class is 0
target_vector_2 = np.array([0, 1, 0]) # Correct class is 1
target_vector_3 = np.array([0, 0, 1]) # Correct class is 2


def cross_entropy(predicted, target):
    return -np.sum(target * np.log(predicted))

ce_1 = cross_entropy(predicted_distribution, target_vector_1)
ce_2 = cross_entropy(predicted_distribution, target_vector_2)
ce_3 = cross_entropy(predicted_distribution, target_vector_3)

print(f"Cross-entropy with target 1: {ce_1:.4f}")
print(f"Cross-entropy with target 2: {ce_2:.4f}")
print(f"Cross-entropy with target 3: {ce_3:.4f}")
```

*Commentary:* This code simulates a scenario with a single predicted probability distribution being used to assess the loss against three different one-hot encoded target vectors. Although the *predicted_distribution* is the same in each instance, the resulting cross-entropy values are different. `ce_1` corresponds to the case where the target class is 0, while `ce_2` corresponds to the target class being 1, and `ce_3` to the target being 2. The cross-entropy is driven by the predicted probability assigned to each respective target class. The loss is lower when the predicted probability is high for the actual target class and higher when predicted probability is low for the actual target class.

**Example 2: Same Underlying Generation but Different Predicted Vectors (Hypothetical)**

```python
import numpy as np
import random

def generate_distribution(seed):
    random.seed(seed)
    values = [random.uniform(0.05, 0.95) for _ in range(3)]
    return np.array(values) / sum(values)

# Generate distinct predicted distributions with seed for "same distribution"
predicted_distribution_a = generate_distribution(10)
predicted_distribution_b = generate_distribution(20)

target_vector = np.array([0, 0, 1]) # Correct class is 2

def cross_entropy(predicted, target):
    return -np.sum(target * np.log(predicted))

ce_a = cross_entropy(predicted_distribution_a, target_vector)
ce_b = cross_entropy(predicted_distribution_b, target_vector)

print(f"Cross-entropy with distribution A: {ce_a:.4f}")
print(f"Cross-entropy with distribution B: {ce_b:.4f}")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates how even with the *attempt* to sample from the same distribution, using randomness, the slightly different vectors will produce different cross-entropy values for the *same* target vector. I have used random number generator initialization to simulate distributions coming from what might be considered similar mechanisms. Note that `generate_distribution` ensures the resulting vector sums to 1 which would be expected in a probability distribution. The differences are further accentuated because, as highlighted earlier, the cross-entropy calculation heavily depends on the predicted probability assigned to the target class.

**Example 3: Batch Calculation for Multiple Target/Prediction Pairs**

```python
import numpy as np

predicted_batch = np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.7],  # Prediction 1
                            [0.8, 0.1, 0.1], # Prediction 2
                            [0.3, 0.3, 0.4]]) # Prediction 3

target_batch = np.array([[0, 0, 1],    # Target 1: Class 2
                         [1, 0, 0],    # Target 2: Class 0
                         [0, 1, 0]])    # Target 3: Class 1


def cross_entropy_batch(predicted_batch, target_batch):
    ce_values = []
    for i in range(predicted_batch.shape[0]):
        ce_values.append(-np.sum(target_batch[i] * np.log(predicted_batch[i])))
    return ce_values


ce_batch = cross_entropy_batch(predicted_batch, target_batch)

for i, ce_value in enumerate(ce_batch):
    print(f"Cross-entropy for example {i+1}: {ce_value:.4f}")
```

*Commentary:*  This example demonstrates how cross-entropy would typically be calculated during batch training in machine learning. Here, each target vector is paired with its corresponding prediction vector, leading to different values. The differences in cross-entropy are not due to variations in the underlying distribution but due to the specific probabilities that correspond to each ground-truth target within the vectors. This batch scenario demonstrates the practical context for evaluating model performance using cross-entropy in machine learning and highlights the significance of target-specific predictions.

In summary, while identical predicted probability *distributions* might appear at first glance to produce similar cross-entropy results, the specific vectors involved in the calculation produce different outcomes. This is due to the combination of the asymmetry of the cross-entropy function and the nature of one-hot encoded target vectors. Only the predicted probability corresponding to the true class label affects the loss calculation; it evaluates prediction performance based on how well each predicted outcome matches its intended target, not on overall predicted distribution consistency.

For those seeking more in-depth knowledge of cross-entropy and its application in machine learning, I would recommend consulting literature on information theory as well as comprehensive resources focused on deep learning. Standard machine learning textbooks and online educational material covering neural networks provide clear explanations and examples. Additionally, research papers on specific tasks like image classification or natural language processing would demonstrate how cross-entropy is used in practical scenarios. These resources can provide both the theoretical underpinnings and concrete, application-specific insights into cross-entropy.
