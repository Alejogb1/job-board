TensorFlow's session management, particularly concerning model launching within the context of a nearing session's end, necessitates careful consideration of resource allocation and asynchronous operation.  My experience developing high-throughput image processing pipelines highlighted the need for precisely timed model deployment to avoid performance bottlenecks and abrupt termination errors.  The key to smoothly launching a TensorFlow model as a session nears completion lies in proactive monitoring and leveraging asynchronous execution capabilities.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The challenge stems from the inherent sequential nature of standard TensorFlow session execution. A long-running session might be processing a large dataset, and initiating a new model launch within this session risks resource contention and potential deadlocks.  Furthermore, abruptly ending a session without proper cleanup could lead to data corruption or resource leaks. The solution involves a multi-pronged approach:

* **Asynchronous Model Loading:**  Pre-load the model graph and weights asynchronously.  This prevents blocking the main session's execution while the new model becomes ready for deployment.  Using TensorFlow's multi-threading capabilities allows for parallel processing, where one thread handles the main session's operations, and another prepares the new model.

* **Session Monitoring and Trigger:** Implement a robust mechanism to monitor the primary session's progress.  This typically involves tracking the completion percentage of the current task, the remaining processing time, or the number of processed items.  Once a predefined threshold is reached (indicating the session is nearing completion), trigger the launch of the new model.  This threshold needs to be carefully calibrated to avoid premature launches or excessively delayed transitions.

* **Graceful Session Shutdown:** Employ a mechanism for graceful session shutdown.  This ensures any in-progress operations are completed and resources are released appropriately before the new model takes over. This could involve a queuing mechanism to handle pending requests, or carefully managed checkpoints to preserve intermediate results.

* **Resource Management:**  Careful consideration of GPU memory allocation is paramount. TensorFlow allows for allocating and releasing GPU memory dynamically. Launching the next model only after sufficient memory has been freed by the expiring session minimizes the risk of out-of-memory errors.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Asynchronous Model Loading**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import threading

# ... (Model definition and weight loading functions) ...

def load_model_async(model_path):
    """Loads a TensorFlow model asynchronously."""
    with tf.device('/CPU:0'): # Prefer CPU for loading to avoid GPU contention
        try:
            model = tf.saved_model.load(model_path)
            print("Model loaded asynchronously.")
            return model
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
            return None

# ... (Main session code) ...

model_path = "path/to/new_model"
thread = threading.Thread(target=load_model_async, args=(model_path,))
thread.start()

# ... (Continue processing in the main session) ...

thread.join() # Wait for the asynchronous load to complete before proceeding
new_model = thread.result()
if new_model:
    # Use new_model
    pass
```

This example demonstrates asynchronous model loading using a separate thread.  The `load_model_async` function handles loading the model without blocking the main thread.  The `thread.join()` call ensures the main thread waits for the model to be loaded before using it, preventing race conditions.  Using `/CPU:0` minimizes contention with the primary GPU.

**Example 2: Session Progress Monitoring and Trigger**

```python
import time

# ... (Main session code) ...

progress = 0
total_items = 10000

start_time = time.time()
for i in range(total_items):
    # ... (Process each item) ...
    progress += 1
    if progress % 1000 == 0:
        elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
        remaining_time = (total_items - progress) * (elapsed_time / progress)
        print(f"Progress: {progress}/{total_items}, Estimated time remaining: {remaining_time:.2f} seconds")
        if remaining_time < 60: # Trigger model launch when less than 60 seconds remain
            print("Triggering new model launch...")
            # ... (Launch new model using the asynchronously loaded model from Example 1) ...
            break

```

This example uses a simple progress counter to estimate the remaining processing time.  A threshold (60 seconds in this case) triggers the launch of the new model.  This allows for a graceful transition as the session nears completion. More sophisticated monitoring mechanisms, such as those leveraging TensorFlow's profiling tools, could provide more accurate time estimations.


**Example 3: Graceful Session Shutdown**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Main session code) ...

try:
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        # ... (Session operations) ...
        sess.close() # Explicitly close the session
        print("Session closed gracefully.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during session execution: {e}")
finally:
    # Perform cleanup tasks here, such as releasing resources.
    pass

# Launch the new model here


```

This showcases the importance of explicitly closing the session using `sess.close()`.  The `try...except...finally` block ensures that cleanup actions, such as releasing resources or saving checkpoints, are performed regardless of whether errors occur during session execution.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of TensorFlow's session management, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation and exploring advanced topics such as distributed TensorFlow and TensorFlow Serving for large-scale deployments.  Furthermore, examining TensorFlow's profiling tools and performance analysis techniques will be invaluable in optimizing your session management strategy.  Finally, familiarizing oneself with concurrent programming paradigms in Python is crucial for effective asynchronous model loading and resource management.
