Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are fundamental tools for structuring complex SQL queries in SQL Server, offering distinct advantages depending on the query's complexity and desired readability.  My experience working on large-scale data warehousing projects has solidified my understanding of their nuanced applications and performance implications.  While both achieve similar goals—breaking down complex queries into smaller, more manageable units—their syntax and execution differ significantly.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Subqueries, nested within the main query, are executed independently for each row processed by the outer query. This can lead to performance bottlenecks, particularly with large datasets, as the subquery is repeatedly evaluated.  Consider a scenario where you need to retrieve customers who have placed orders exceeding a certain threshold. A subquery might retrieve the total order value for each customer, which is then used by the outer query to filter customers based on that total. This approach, while functional, can become inefficient for a substantial customer base.  The repeated execution of the subquery impacts performance significantly.

CTEs, conversely, are temporary, named result sets defined within the scope of a single query.  They are materialized only once, effectively pre-calculating intermediate results. This one-time evaluation greatly improves performance compared to repeatedly executed subqueries, especially when the same intermediate results are required in multiple parts of the main query.  Returning to our customer order example, a CTE could pre-calculate the total order value for each customer, and the main query could then simply reference the CTE to filter based on that pre-computed value. This leads to a more efficient execution plan.

The choice between subqueries and CTEs often hinges on factors like query complexity, readability, and performance requirements.  For simple queries, a well-written subquery might suffice. However, for intricate queries involving multiple levels of nesting or repeated calculations, CTEs provide a much more elegant and efficient solution.  Furthermore, CTEs enhance readability by breaking down a complex query into logical blocks, making it easier to understand, debug, and maintain. Their recursive capabilities, unavailable with subqueries, extend their usefulness to hierarchical data processing.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Subquery for Simple Customer Order Filtering:**

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders WHERE OrderTotal > 1000);
```

This query uses a subquery to identify `CustomerID`s with `OrderTotal` exceeding 1000. The outer query then filters customers based on this subset.  While functional for smaller datasets, the performance degrades as the number of orders and customers increases due to the repeated execution of the inner query.


**Example 2: CTE for Enhanced Customer Order Filtering:**

```sql
WITH CustomerOrderTotals AS (
    SELECT CustomerID, SUM(OrderTotal) AS TotalSpent
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY CustomerID
)
SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers c
JOIN CustomerOrderTotals cot ON c.CustomerID = cot.CustomerID
WHERE cot.TotalSpent > 1000;
```

This query uses a CTE (`CustomerOrderTotals`) to pre-calculate the total spending for each customer.  The main query then joins this CTE with the `Customers` table, resulting in a more efficient and readable query. The CTE's single execution significantly improves performance over the repeated execution of the subquery in the previous example.  Note the improved readability afforded by the named CTE.


**Example 3: Recursive CTE for Hierarchical Data:**

```sql
WITH EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID, EmployeeName, 0 AS Level
    FROM Employees
    WHERE ManagerID IS NULL  -- Start with top-level employees
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.ManagerID, e.EmployeeName, eh.Level + 1
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.ManagerID = eh.EmployeeID
)
SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID, EmployeeName, Level
FROM EmployeeHierarchy
ORDER BY Level, EmployeeName;
```

This example demonstrates the power of recursive CTEs.  It traverses a hierarchical employee structure to determine the level of each employee in the organization.  The `UNION ALL` combines the initial set of top-level employees with subsequent levels, recursively building the hierarchy.  This type of query is impossible to achieve efficiently using only subqueries.  The CTE's recursive nature cleanly and efficiently handles the hierarchical data traversal.  Note the clarity afforded by naming the CTE and clearly defining the recursive step.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper dive into SQL Server query optimization, I recommend consulting the official SQL Server documentation.  Furthermore, books focusing on advanced SQL techniques and query performance tuning are invaluable.  Exploring the execution plans generated by the SQL Server query analyzer is crucial for understanding query performance and identifying areas for optimization.  Finally, studying different indexing strategies and their impact on query performance is critical for enhancing efficiency.  These resources provide a robust foundation for mastering these fundamental aspects of SQL Server query development.
