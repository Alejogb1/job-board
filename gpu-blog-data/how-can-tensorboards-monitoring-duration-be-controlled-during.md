Monitoring model training with TensorBoard across multiple datasets presents a practical challenge: uncontrolled logging can lead to excessively large log files, slowing down the training process and making visualization unwieldy. I've encountered this issue directly while working on a large-scale image classification task, necessitating a precise method for managing TensorBoard's logging activity. The crux of the problem lies in the accumulation of scalar data, histograms, and images generated at each training step, which, when applied across diverse datasets or extended training schedules, quickly grows to unmanageable proportions. Therefore, effective duration control involves implementing strategies to log data selectively, based on both the training phase and the frequency of logging, ultimately maintaining the utility of TensorBoard without incurring performance penalties.

The first crucial aspect is *granularity control* over when and how often data is logged. Rather than simply writing TensorBoard summaries on every batch or epoch, we can implement a conditional logging mechanism. This is usually managed through an event-based approach, where an event, such as an epoch completing or a certain number of steps passing, triggers a summary write. This approach significantly reduces the data written to disk, particularly in the early stages of training where frequent logging doesnâ€™t usually offer significant insights.

The second aspect concerns *data aggregation*. When processing multiple datasets, we must decide how we want to visualize the data in TensorBoard. We could track the metrics separately for each dataset or aggregate them into a single view. Separated views are helpful for understanding dataset-specific performance and identifying potential imbalances or outliers, while aggregated metrics provide an overall view of the training progress. The decision of whether to keep separate logs or not is context-dependent. If the datasets have distinctly different distributions or tasks, then separate logging makes sense. Conversely, if they are similar and one intends to average performance across them for a general overview, then aggregated logs suffice.

The third, and perhaps most significant, is the *use of a configurable logging schedule*. This enables the user to specify what metrics to log, the frequency at which they should be logged, and during which training phase these logs should be produced. This strategy is best implemented by utilizing a system of boolean flags or counters linked to training loops and other relevant phases, coupled with the TensorBoard API. It enables a dynamically controlled log output that adjusts to the specific need of the moment and ultimately prevents wasteful logging when it is not needed.

To illustrate these concepts, let's examine three distinct code examples using TensorFlow and its Keras API. Note that, while the following examples use Keras, the approach is general and is also applicable using the TensorFlow core API.

**Example 1: Conditional logging based on epochs**

This example illustrates epoch-based logging, where summaries are only written at the end of each epoch. This minimizes the number of log writes when compared to a batch-based approach.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Dummy model for illustration
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

# Dummy training data
train_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
train_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100, 1))
train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_data, train_labels)).batch(32)

log_dir = "logs/epoch_logging/"
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

epochs = 10
for epoch in range(epochs):
    epoch_loss = 0
    for step, (x_batch_train, y_batch_train) in enumerate(train_dataset):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            logits = model(x_batch_train)
            loss_value = loss_fn(y_batch_train, logits)
        grads = tape.gradient(loss_value, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
        epoch_loss += loss_value
    epoch_loss /= len(train_dataset)
    # Log at the end of the epoch
    with summary_writer.as_default():
      tf.summary.scalar('loss', epoch_loss, step=epoch)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {epoch_loss.numpy()}")

summary_writer.close()

```

Here, the `tf.summary.scalar('loss', epoch_loss, step=epoch)` is placed *outside* the batch training loop but inside the epoch training loop, writing the loss value to TensorBoard only after an entire epoch has passed. The step is set to the epoch number ensuring that the scalar graph shows one point per epoch.

**Example 2: Conditional Logging Based on Steps with Dataset Specific Tags**

This example demonstrates step-based logging with dataset-specific tags. Assuming two datasets are available, we use a conditional logging logic based on a step counter and also tag the specific dataset of the logs so that we can easily distinguish their performance.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Dummy model for illustration
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

# Dummy dataset 1
train_data1 = np.random.rand(100, 10)
train_labels1 = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100, 1))
dataset1 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_data1, train_labels1)).batch(32)

# Dummy dataset 2
train_data2 = np.random.rand(120, 10)
train_labels2 = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(120, 1))
dataset2 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_data2, train_labels2)).batch(32)

log_dir = "logs/dataset_logging/"
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

steps_per_log = 2
step = 0
epochs = 5

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for dataset, tag in zip([dataset1, dataset2], ['dataset1', 'dataset2']):
        for x_batch_train, y_batch_train in dataset:
            with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
                logits = model(x_batch_train)
                loss_value = loss_fn(y_batch_train, logits)
            grads = tape.gradient(loss_value, model.trainable_variables)
            optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))

            step += 1
            # Log based on steps and tag dataset
            if step % steps_per_log == 0:
                with summary_writer.as_default():
                    tf.summary.scalar(f'{tag}_loss', loss_value, step=step)
                print(f"Step {step}, {tag} Loss: {loss_value.numpy()}")

summary_writer.close()

```

In this example, each loss is tagged with the specific dataset from which it originated. The log is written every `steps_per_log` steps and the current step is used to set the x-axis of the TensorBoard plot. This allows comparison between datasets.

**Example 3: Configuring Logging Schedule based on Training Phase**

This final example implements a more complex logging configuration based on a user defined training phase. For example, during the first few epochs, the user may only want a few scalar log entries, and only after the initial training phase would the user want more complete log entries with images and histograms, assuming these features become more relevant for training monitoring after that phase.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Dummy model for illustration
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

# Dummy training data
train_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
train_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100, 1))
train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_data, train_labels)).batch(32)


log_dir = "logs/phase_logging/"
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

epochs = 10
detailed_logging_start_epoch = 5

for epoch in range(epochs):
    epoch_loss = 0
    for step, (x_batch_train, y_batch_train) in enumerate(train_dataset):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            logits = model(x_batch_train)
            loss_value = loss_fn(y_batch_train, logits)
        grads = tape.gradient(loss_value, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
        epoch_loss += loss_value

    epoch_loss /= len(train_dataset)
    
    with summary_writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss', epoch_loss, step=epoch)

        if epoch >= detailed_logging_start_epoch:
          # More detailed logging starts here
          tf.summary.histogram("weights", model.layers[0].kernel, step = epoch)
          tf.summary.image("input_images", tf.reshape(x_batch_train[:4, :], [4,1,10,1]), step = epoch)

    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {epoch_loss.numpy()}")

summary_writer.close()
```

This example showcases how logging can be dynamically changed during different training phases using the `detailed_logging_start_epoch` as a threshold to introduce more log data (i.e., histograms and images), thus providing a flexible mechanism to generate logs only when needed, thereby saving disk space and improve the efficiency of the process.

In summary, controlling TensorBoard monitoring duration involves a multifaceted approach encompassing logging granularity, data aggregation, and the implementation of flexible logging schedules. The examples provided, while straightforward, demonstrate the key concepts one should implement to efficiently and intelligently make use of this debugging tool. Finally, while TensorFlow is used, the same principles can be extended to any framework providing logging functionality. For further resources, consult guides on TensorFlow data processing, TensorBoard API references, and model development tutorials that cover advanced logging practices. Specifically, the TensorFlow documentation provides detailed usage of summary operations and data pipeline setup. Further, research papers on large scale training may provide insights into best practices.
