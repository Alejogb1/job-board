Optimizing functions with one discrete and one continuous parameter requires careful consideration of the function's behavior across both parameter spaces.  My experience developing high-performance computational fluid dynamics solvers has shown that a naive approach often leads to significant performance bottlenecks. The key insight lies in exploiting the inherent structure of the discrete parameter to pre-compute or otherwise reduce computational complexity for each discrete value. This drastically reduces runtime, particularly when the continuous parameter requires iterative solutions or extensive calculations.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core strategy revolves around separating the computations dependent on the discrete parameter from those involving the continuous parameter.  If the function can be expressed as  `f(x, y)`, where `x` is the discrete parameter and `y` is the continuous parameter, we aim to restructure the calculation such that the parts solely dependent on `x` are computed only once for each value of `x`.  This pre-computation dramatically reduces redundancy if the function is called multiple times with the same discrete parameter but different continuous ones.

Consider the scenario where `x` represents a material property (e.g., chosen from a list of pre-defined materials) and `y` represents a geometric parameter (e.g., a length or angle). The material properties might dictate specific material constants used in a complex calculation. Calculating these constants repeatedly for every variation of `y` is inefficient. Instead, we can pre-compute these constants for each material and store them in a lookup table (or a dictionary in Python) accessible during the function's execution.

Further optimization can be achieved through the choice of numerical methods for handling the continuous parameter.  For instance, if `f(x, y)` involves solving a differential equation, techniques like adaptive step size control or choosing an appropriate numerical scheme tailored to the problem's characteristics can significantly improve performance. These methods are crucial for achieving accuracy within acceptable computation time.   Furthermore, leveraging vectorization or parallelization for the continuous parameter's calculations can offer significant speedups, particularly when dealing with large datasets or computationally intensive calculations for each `y`.  Finally, profiling the code is essential to pinpoint the performance bottlenecks and direct optimization efforts strategically.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Lookup Table for Discrete Parameter Pre-computation**

```python
import numpy as np

def optimized_function(x, y):
    """
    Calculates f(x, y) with pre-computed values for the discrete parameter x.
    """
    # Pre-computed lookup table (populated once)
    material_constants = {
        "materialA": {"constant1": 1.0, "constant2": 2.0},
        "materialB": {"constant1": 3.0, "constant2": 4.0},
    }

    # Access pre-computed constants based on discrete parameter x
    constants = material_constants[x]
    
    # Calculation using pre-computed constants and continuous parameter y
    result = constants["constant1"] * y**2 + constants["constant2"] * y
    return result

# Example Usage
x_values = ["materialA", "materialB"]
y_values = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)

for x in x_values:
    for y in y_values:
        result = optimized_function(x, y)
        # ...further processing...
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the efficient use of a dictionary to store pre-computed constants for different materials.  Accessing these constants directly avoids redundant calculations within the main loop.


**Example 2:  Numerical Optimization for Continuous Parameter**

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar

def f(y, x):
    """
    The function to minimize. Note that 'x' is the discrete parameter.
    """
    # ... complex calculation involving x and y ...
    return y**2 - x*y + 5

def optimized_function(x, initial_guess=1.0):
    """
    Finds the minimum of f(y, x) for given x using numerical optimization.
    """
    result = minimize_scalar(lambda y: f(y, x), method='bounded', bounds=(0,10), x0=initial_guess)
    return result.x, result.fun #return optimized y and the function value

#Example Usage
x_values = [1,2,3]

for x in x_values:
    optimized_y, min_value = optimized_function(x)
    print(f"For x = {x}, optimized y = {optimized_y}, f(x,y) = {min_value}")

```

*Commentary:* This showcases how `scipy.optimize` can be employed to efficiently find the minimum of a function for the continuous parameter `y` for each discrete value of `x`.  This avoids brute-force searching or grid-based approaches which can be extremely inefficient. The `method` and `bounds` parameters are chosen based on problem characteristics; for instance, if the parameter has physical boundaries they must be respected.


**Example 3: Vectorization with NumPy**

```python
import numpy as np

def optimized_function(x, y_array):
    """
    Vectorized computation for the continuous parameter.
    """
    # Assuming x is a scalar and y_array is a NumPy array
    if x == 1:
        result = np.sin(y_array)
    elif x == 2:
        result = np.exp(y_array)
    else:
        result = np.zeros_like(y_array) #Default

    return result

# Example Usage
x_values = [1, 2, 3]
y_values = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)

for x in x_values:
    results = optimized_function(x, y_values)
    # ... further processing ...
```

*Commentary:* This example leverages NumPy's vectorization capabilities.  Instead of looping through individual `y` values, it operates on the entire array at once, significantly improving performance, especially for large arrays. The use of `np.zeros_like` is crucial for avoiding unexpected behavior when invalid `x` values are provided.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of numerical optimization techniques, consult standard numerical analysis textbooks.  For efficient coding practices in Python (especially for numerical computation), refer to the official NumPy and SciPy documentation and tutorials focusing on vectorization and performance optimization.  Finally, explore literature on algorithm design and complexity analysis to develop a strong theoretical foundation for optimizing your specific problem.  A thorough understanding of profiling tools is essential for guiding optimization efforts.
