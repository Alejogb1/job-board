BatchDataset models, common in TensorFlow and Keras, inherently process data in batches, which presents a unique challenge when needing to modify inputs *after* the dataset has been defined and potentially cached. Direct manipulation of the `BatchDataset` object’s internal structure is not recommended, as it can lead to unexpected behaviors and errors. Instead, the recommended approach involves remapping, preprocessing, or augmenting your data using methods that work within the TensorFlow data pipeline paradigm.

Let's break down how I typically handle this situation, drawing from my experience building image recognition systems and handling time-series analysis. Often, the need arises because either the training data becomes slightly outdated, or a new feature is required. We don't want to retrain the entire model or rebuild the dataset from scratch, so modifying existing `BatchDatasets` dynamically becomes paramount.

The fundamental principle revolves around using the `map()` function inherent to the `tf.data.Dataset` object (which `BatchDataset` derives from). The `map()` function accepts a callable (usually a Python function or a lambda) that applies a transformation to each individual element (or batch) within the dataset. This allows for alteration of features, labels, or both. This is a lazy operation, meaning the modifications are not applied until you iterate through the dataset.

The key to success here is understanding that a `BatchDataset` produces tensors representing multiple elements at once. Consequently, the function you provide to `map` must also accept a tensor representing an entire batch. When modifying inputs, you’re usually working on the feature component, which usually resides in the first output of the dataset tuples.

The simplest modification often needed is normalization or rescaling of input data. Assume we are dealing with image data initially represented by RGB pixel values, 0-255, and we need to rescale them to be floats in the range 0-1 for a more optimal learning process.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


# Dummy dataset for illustration: (image, label)
def generate_dummy_dataset(num_samples=100, batch_size=32):
    images = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(num_samples, 32, 32, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
    labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(num_samples), dtype=np.int32)
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((images, labels))
    return dataset.batch(batch_size)


dummy_dataset = generate_dummy_dataset()

def rescale_images(images, labels):
    rescaled_images = tf.cast(images, tf.float32) / 255.0
    return rescaled_images, labels

rescaled_dataset = dummy_dataset.map(rescale_images)

# Verify a batch has been rescaled
for images, _ in rescaled_dataset.take(1):
  print(f"Data type of images: {images.dtype}")
  print(f"Min pixel value: {tf.reduce_min(images)}")
  print(f"Max pixel value: {tf.reduce_max(images)}")
```

In this example, we first create a dummy dataset of random uint8 images and labels using `generate_dummy_dataset()`. The crucial step is the `rescale_images` function. It receives a batch of images (as a tensor) and corresponding labels, then converts the image tensor to float32 before dividing it by 255.0. The output is a modified images tensor along with the original labels tensor. We then apply this function using the `map()` method. The final part of the example shows a basic way to access the modified dataset and verify that the rescaling has indeed happened.

Let’s consider a more nuanced modification. Assume the data consists of time series data represented as sequences. Suppose the training dataset was originally prepared using a sliding window, but we now need a more tailored approach, where individual windows are variable lengths. We'll define a function that adds a padding mechanism so it can be easily processed by our model. This is a common requirement when handling sequence data with varying lengths.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


def generate_dummy_sequence_dataset(num_samples=100, batch_size=32):
    max_sequence_length = 20
    sequences = [np.random.rand(np.random.randint(5, max_sequence_length))
                 for _ in range(num_samples)]
    labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(num_samples), dtype=np.int32)

    # Convert to tensor for dataset creation and use of padded_batch
    sequences_tensor = [tf.convert_to_tensor(seq, dtype=tf.float32) for seq in sequences]
    labels_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(labels, dtype=tf.int32)
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((sequences_tensor, labels_tensor))
    return dataset.padded_batch(batch_size, padded_shapes=([None], []))


dummy_sequence_dataset = generate_dummy_sequence_dataset()


def pad_sequence_data(sequences, labels):
    # Determine maximum sequence length of the batch to pad to.
    max_seq_len = tf.reduce_max([tf.shape(seq)[0] for seq in sequences])

    # Pad each sequence in the batch to have a uniform length
    padded_sequences = tf.stack([tf.pad(seq, [[0, max_seq_len - tf.shape(seq)[0]]]) for seq in sequences])
    return padded_sequences, labels

padded_sequence_dataset = dummy_sequence_dataset.map(pad_sequence_data)

# Verify padding. 
for sequences, _ in padded_sequence_dataset.take(1):
    print(f"Shape of sequence batch: {sequences.shape}")

```
Here, the `generate_dummy_sequence_dataset` creates a set of variable length sequences. We use `padded_batch` rather than `batch` to initially handle the differing lengths by padding them in batch. Then, to demonstrate the modification, `pad_sequence_data` determines the maximum sequence length in each batch and pads them to that length, thus ensuring uniformity.  The `map` function then applies the function to every batch in the dataset. This function is a bit more complex than the previous one because it operates on variable length tensors. You have to determine the max length within each batch to pad appropriately. The output of the program indicates the result of this padding.

Lastly, it's important to consider modifications that require more context or are based on conditional logic, based on some external data or parameter. Consider a scenario where each example in the dataset also contains a 'region' string, and we want to modify input images differently based on their region. This could be the case if, for example, images from different regions are captured using different cameras and require different adjustments.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


def generate_regional_dataset(num_samples=100, batch_size=32):
    images = np.random.randint(0, 256, size=(num_samples, 32, 32, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
    regions = np.random.choice(["RegionA", "RegionB", "RegionC"], size=(num_samples)).astype(str)
    labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(num_samples), dtype=np.int32)
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((images, regions, labels))
    return dataset.batch(batch_size)


regional_dataset = generate_regional_dataset()


def modify_by_region(images, regions, labels):
    modified_images = []
    for i in range(tf.shape(images)[0]):  # Iterate through batch
        image = images[i]
        region = regions[i]

        if region == "RegionA":
            image = tf.image.adjust_brightness(tf.cast(image, tf.float32) / 255.0, delta=0.2)
        elif region == "RegionB":
            image = tf.image.adjust_contrast(tf.cast(image, tf.float32) / 255.0, contrast_factor=1.3)
        else: # Region C
            image = tf.image.rgb_to_grayscale(tf.cast(image, tf.float32) / 255.0)

        modified_images.append(image)
    
    modified_images = tf.stack(modified_images)
    return modified_images, labels

modified_regional_dataset = regional_dataset.map(modify_by_region)

# Verify changes.
for images, _ in modified_regional_dataset.take(1):
   print(f"Shape of the modified images: {images.shape}")
```

In this case, each batch now includes image tensors, string tensors describing their regions, and labels.  The function `modify_by_region` demonstrates a mechanism to adjust images in a batch based on their region by looping through every image and applying conditional logic using the region string. Again, it's important to use `tf.stack()` to convert the list of tensors back into a tensor before passing it on. This illustrates how your data modification can be conditional.

In all these scenarios, the original dataset remains untouched; the modifications are lazily applied when the dataset is consumed during training or evaluation.  This provides flexibility without having to regenerate an entire dataset or perform modifications on large numpy arrays.

For further understanding, I would recommend studying the TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data.Dataset` and the different tensor operations available. Research publications discussing data augmentation and preprocessing pipelines will also provide a more in-depth insight. Books covering practical deep learning implementations are another good avenue for gaining perspective on common dataset manipulation techniques. Examining the source code of established TensorFlow based machine learning frameworks such as Tensorflow Recommenders can also be informative. The key to modifying input data effectively is a solid grasp of tensor operations and the TensorFlow data API.
