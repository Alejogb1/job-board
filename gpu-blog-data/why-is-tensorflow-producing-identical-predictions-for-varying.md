Identical predictions across varying time series inputs in TensorFlow often stem from a lack of sufficient input feature engineering or inappropriate model architecture selection for the temporal dependencies inherent in the data.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues in large-scale financial forecasting projects highlighted the critical role of feature scaling, temporal aggregation, and appropriate model choices.  Simply feeding raw time series data into a model rarely yields satisfactory results.

**1. Explanation:**

TensorFlow, like any machine learning framework, is only as good as the data and the architecture you provide.  Identical predictions suggest the model is failing to learn discriminative features from your input time series.  Several factors can contribute to this:

* **Missing or Insufficient Features:**  Raw time series data often lacks the information necessary for accurate prediction.  Essential features might be missing,  or existing features might not be appropriately represented.  For instance,  consider predicting stock prices: using only the closing price for the past few days neglects crucial information like trading volume,  market indices, and potentially even news sentiment.  The model might learn a constant function if the provided features don't contain enough variation to discriminate between different time series.

* **Inappropriate Model Architecture:**  The choice of model significantly impacts performance.  Simple models like linear regression, without proper feature engineering, will struggle with complex temporal dependencies.  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTMs or GRUs, are better suited for capturing sequential patterns.  However, even with RNNs, inadequate hyperparameter tuning can lead to poor performance, potentially manifesting as identical predictions.  For instance, an LSTM with too few units or layers might fail to capture the subtle nuances in the data.

* **Feature Scaling Issues:**  The scale of different input features can drastically affect model training.  If one feature has a much larger magnitude than others, it can dominate the learning process, overshadowing the impact of other potentially crucial features.  This can lead to the model effectively ignoring the subtle variations in other features, resulting in constant predictions.  Proper scaling techniques, like standardization (z-score normalization) or min-max scaling, are essential to address this.

* **Data Leakage:** This is a serious issue frequently overlooked.  If your training process inadvertently exposes information from the future to the model during training, it can artificially inflate performance, causing seemingly consistent, but ultimately unreliable, predictions on unseen data.  Careful consideration of the data splitting and feature engineering process is crucial to avoid this.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate how different approaches can influence the results.  These are simplified illustrations; real-world applications require more extensive feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

**Example 1:  Linear Regression with Insufficient Features**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

#Simulate data with one feature:  All time series will have the same outcome.
X = np.array([[1],[1],[1],[1],[1],[2],[2],[2],[2],[2]])
y = np.array([10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10])

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X,y)

# New data, with values that would ideally be predicted differently,  but won't due to lack of discriminatory features.
new_X = np.array([[1], [2]])
predictions = model.predict(new_X)
print(predictions) #Output: [10. 10.]
```

This example shows how a simple model, like linear regression, with insufficient features results in the same prediction for different inputs.  The single feature, regardless of the value, always leads to the same output.

**Example 2: LSTM with Properly Scaled Data**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Sample Time Series Data (multiple series)
data = np.array([
    [[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]],
    [[6],[7],[8],[9],[10]],
    [[11],[12],[13],[14],[15]]
])

#Scale data using StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data.reshape(-1,1)).reshape(data.shape)


model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(5, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(scaled_data, np.array([1,2,3]), epochs=100, verbose=0)

#New data.  The LSTM, with properly scaled data, will try to learn differences.
new_data = np.array([[[16],[17],[18],[19],[20]]])
new_scaled_data = scaler.transform(new_data.reshape(-1,1)).reshape(new_data.shape)
predictions = model.predict(new_scaled_data)
print(predictions)
```

This improved example uses an LSTM, better suited for time series, and incorporates data scaling.  The model attempts to learn the differences, although the quality of the prediction depends on the data and hyperparameters.

**Example 3: Handling Data Leakage**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

#Simulate data with temporal dependency
X = np.arange(10).reshape(-1,1)
y = X*2 + np.random.normal(0,1,10) #Simulate a linear relationship with noise

#INCORRECT:  Data leakage, resulting in overfitting
X_train = X
y_train = y

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

#CORRECT: Train-test split to prevent data leakage.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)  #shuffle=False maintains temporal order.

model_correct = LinearRegression()
model_correct.fit(X_train, y_train)

new_X = np.array([[11]])
prediction_incorrect = model.predict(new_X)
prediction_correct = model_correct.predict(new_X)

print(f"Incorrect prediction (data leakage): {prediction_incorrect}")
print(f"Correct prediction (no leakage): {prediction_correct}")

```

This illustrates the crucial difference between handling data leakage correctly versus introducing it.  The incorrect approach leads to a model that's only accurate in the range of the training data, while the correct approach, by using appropriate train/test splitting, produces a more generalizable model.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting  "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet,  "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, and relevant TensorFlow documentation.  Exploring research papers on time series forecasting and RNN architectures will also be beneficial.  Careful study of these resources will provide a solid foundation for effective time series analysis and prediction using TensorFlow.
