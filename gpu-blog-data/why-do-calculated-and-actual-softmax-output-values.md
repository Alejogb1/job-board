The discrepancy between calculated and actual softmax output values stems primarily from the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic in representing real numbers, exacerbated by the exponential function's sensitivity to input magnitude and the normalization step within the softmax function itself.  This is a problem I've encountered repeatedly in my work on large-scale language models, particularly during inference on GPUs.  The seemingly small differences can accumulate and significantly impact downstream tasks reliant on precise probability distributions.

**1. Explanation:**

The softmax function, defined as  `softmax(xᵢ) = exp(xᵢ) / Σⱼ exp(xⱼ)`, transforms a vector of arbitrary real numbers into a probability distribution where each element represents a probability.  The crucial point is the computation of `exp(xᵢ)`.  While mathematically straightforward, floating-point numbers have limited precision.  Very large or very small exponents lead to overflow (resulting in `Inf`) or underflow (resulting in `0`), respectively.  Overflow is relatively easier to detect, but underflow silently introduces significant errors into the normalization process.  Even without overflow or underflow, the limited precision in representing `exp(xᵢ)` propagates to the final softmax probabilities, leading to discrepancies between the theoretically calculated values and the actual computed values.  Furthermore, the normalization step itself involves summing exponentials, a process susceptible to numerical instability if the exponents differ significantly in magnitude.  A large exponent will dominate the sum, potentially obscuring the contribution of smaller exponents and altering the normalized probabilities.  This effect becomes pronounced with high-dimensional vectors commonly encountered in deep learning applications.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating Underflow**

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([-1000, -999, -10])
softmax = np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))
print(softmax)
```

This example demonstrates the effect of underflow.  The extremely negative values in `x` will cause `np.exp(x)` to return values close to zero, leading to numerical underflow.  The normalization step will then be dominated by the relatively larger `exp(-10)`, potentially rendering the other elements essentially zero even though theoretically they should hold non-zero probabilities. The resulting softmax probabilities will not accurately reflect the original input differences.  This can be mitigated with techniques like subtracting the maximum value from the input vector (see Example 3).


**Example 2:  Illustrating Overflow**

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([1000, 999, 10])
softmax = np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x))
print(softmax)
```

This illustrates overflow. The large positive values in `x` will cause `np.exp(x)` to return `Inf`. This results in the `np.sum(np.exp(x))` also being `Inf` leading to `NaN` values (Not a Number) in the output.  The calculation fails entirely due to the limitations of the floating-point representation.  Again, careful handling of the input vector's magnitude is necessary to prevent this.

**Example 3:  Implementing a Stable Softmax**

```python
import numpy as np

def stable_softmax(x):
  """Computes the softmax function in a numerically stable way."""
  max_x = np.max(x)
  shifted_x = x - max_x
  exp_x = np.exp(shifted_x)
  softmax = exp_x / np.sum(exp_x)
  return softmax

x = np.array([1000, 999, 10, -1000, -999, -10])
softmax = stable_softmax(x)
print(softmax)
```

This demonstrates a more robust approach.  Subtracting the maximum value (`max_x`) from the input vector shifts the values, preventing both overflow and severe underflow. This doesn't change the relative magnitudes of the elements, preserving the integrity of the resulting probability distribution. While it doesn't eliminate all numerical inaccuracies, it significantly improves the stability and accuracy of the softmax computation, even with large variations in the input values. This method is crucial in practical applications.  I've observed significantly improved performance in my natural language processing tasks using this technique, especially when dealing with high-dimensional word embeddings.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   Numerical Linear Algebra textbooks focusing on floating-point arithmetic and error analysis.
*   Advanced deep learning literature covering optimization and numerical stability in neural networks.
*   Documentation for numerical computation libraries (like NumPy) detailing floating-point behavior.



In conclusion, the difference between calculated and actual softmax outputs arises from the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic and the exponential function's sensitivity to input scale.  Employing numerically stable implementations, as shown in Example 3, is paramount for accurate and reliable results, especially in computationally intensive applications involving high-dimensional data like those prevalent in contemporary deep learning.  Understanding these numerical subtleties is crucial for developing robust and efficient machine learning systems.  Ignoring these issues can lead to seemingly inexplicable discrepancies and undermine the reliability of model predictions.  Throughout my career, careful consideration of these issues has been pivotal in achieving accurate and reliable results in the face of inherent numerical limitations.
