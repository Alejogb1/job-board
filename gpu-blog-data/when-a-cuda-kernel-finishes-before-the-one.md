The crux of achieving accurate synchronization between CUDA kernels using `cudaEventRecord` lies in the precise placement of these calls relative to the kernel launches and their dependencies.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications for geophysical simulations has highlighted the subtle but critical errors that can arise from misplacing these synchronization points.  Incorrect placement can lead to race conditions, data corruption, and ultimately, incorrect results.  This is particularly relevant when dealing with asynchronous kernel execution, where kernels may complete out of order despite explicit dependencies.

The fundamental issue stems from the asynchronous nature of CUDA kernel launches.  When you launch a kernel using `cudaLaunchKernel`, the function returns immediately, before the kernel has actually finished execution.  Therefore, if kernel B depends on the output of kernel A, simply launching A before B isn't sufficient for guaranteeing correct synchronization. The `cudaEventRecord` calls are essential for explicit synchronization, forcing the host to wait until a specific event—the completion of a kernel—occurs before proceeding.

To ensure accuracy, `cudaEventRecord` calls must be placed *after* the kernel launch and *before* any operations that depend on the kernel's output.  Failing to do so will result in unpredictable behavior, as the dependent operation might attempt to access data that hasn't been written by the preceding kernel.  This is because the host thread executes concurrently with the GPU kernels, and without synchronization, the execution order is undefined.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The correct synchronization strategy involves the following steps:

1. **Event Creation:** Create CUDA events using `cudaEventCreate`.  These events act as markers to indicate completion of specific operations.  Multiple events are generally needed for complex kernel dependencies.

2. **Kernel Launch and Event Recording:** Launch the first kernel (e.g., kernel A).  Immediately following the launch, record an event using `cudaEventRecord`, associating the event with the stream in which the kernel was launched. This event marks the completion of kernel A.

3. **Synchronization using `cudaEventSynchronize`:** Before launching the dependent kernel (e.g., kernel B), use `cudaEventSynchronize` to wait for the event recorded after kernel A's completion. This ensures kernel A has finished before B begins.  If you use `cudaStreamWaitEvent`, you can perform other operations asynchronously without explicitly waiting.

4. **Dependent Kernel Launch and Event Recording (Optional):** Launch kernel B and optionally record an event marking its completion. This can be useful for further synchronization or performance analysis.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Synchronization**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void kernelA(int *data, int N) {
  // ... kernel A operations ...
}

__global__ void kernelB(int *data, int N) {
  // ... kernel B operations dependent on kernel A's output ...
}

int main() {
  cudaEvent_t startA, stopA;
  cudaEventCreate(&startA);
  cudaEventCreate(&stopA);

  // ... allocate memory, copy data to GPU ...

  kernelA<<<1, 1>>>(data_d, N); // Launch Kernel A
  cudaEventRecord(stopA, 0); // Record event after Kernel A's launch

  cudaEventSynchronize(stopA); // Wait for Kernel A to complete

  kernelB<<<1, 1>>>(data_d, N); // Launch Kernel B

  // ... copy data back to CPU, free memory ...
  cudaEventDestroy(startA);
  cudaEventDestroy(stopA);

  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the basic synchronization using `cudaEventRecord` and `cudaEventSynchronize`.  The event `stopA` marks the end of kernel A. `cudaEventSynchronize(stopA)` ensures kernel B only starts after kernel A has finished.  Note that the default stream (stream 0) is used here.

**Example 2:  Multiple Kernels and Streams**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// ... kernel definitions ...

int main() {
  cudaEvent_t startA, stopA, startB, stopB;
  cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;

  cudaEventCreate(&startA);
  cudaEventCreate(&stopA);
  cudaEventCreate(&startB);
  cudaEventCreate(&stopB);
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);

  // ... memory allocation ...

  kernelA<<<1, 1, 0, stream1>>>(data_d, N); // Launch Kernel A on stream1
  cudaEventRecord(stopA, stream1); // Record event on stream1

  kernelB<<<1, 1, 0, stream2>>>(data_d, N); // Launch Kernel B on stream2
  cudaEventRecord(stopB, stream2); // Record event on stream2

  cudaStreamWaitEvent(stream2, stopA, 0); // Stream 2 waits for event stopA from stream 1

  // ... memory deallocation ...

  cudaEventDestroy(startA); cudaEventDestroy(stopA);
  cudaEventDestroy(startB); cudaEventDestroy(stopB);
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream1); cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);
  return 0;
}
```

This example uses multiple streams for concurrent execution and `cudaStreamWaitEvent` for inter-stream synchronization. Kernel B on stream2 waits for the completion of kernel A on stream1 before proceeding. This allows for better GPU utilization.

**Example 3:  Error Handling**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
// ... kernel definitions ...

int main() {
  cudaEvent_t event;
  cudaEventCreate(&event);

  // ... memory allocation and kernel launch ...

  cudaError_t err = cudaEventRecord(event, 0);
  if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaEventRecord failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    // ... error handling ...
  }

  err = cudaEventSynchronize(event);
  if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaEventSynchronize failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    // ... error handling ...
  }

  // ... rest of the code ...

  cudaEventDestroy(event);
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates robust error handling.  Checking the return value of CUDA functions is crucial for identifying and addressing potential errors promptly, which is especially important in complex multi-kernel scenarios.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA C Programming Guide,  the CUDA Toolkit documentation,  and a comprehensive textbook on parallel programming with CUDA are invaluable resources for understanding and mastering CUDA synchronization techniques.  Furthermore,  exploring the performance analysis tools included with the CUDA toolkit will help in verifying the correctness and optimizing the efficiency of your synchronization strategies.  Thorough testing and profiling are also critical steps in ensuring the stability and performance of your CUDA applications.
