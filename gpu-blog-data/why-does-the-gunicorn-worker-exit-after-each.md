The behavior of a Gunicorn worker exiting after each request stems from its default worker class, `sync`.  This is not a bug; it's the intended functionality.  During my years working on high-traffic web applications, I've extensively used Gunicorn, and understanding this default behavior – and how to override it – is crucial for optimizing performance and resource utilization.  The `sync` worker operates under a simple request-response cycle: it accepts a request, processes it, and then exits, relinquishing control back to the master process. This contrasts sharply with more sophisticated worker types designed for persistent connections and improved efficiency.

This inherent characteristic of the `sync` worker is linked to its simplicity. It's fundamentally designed for ease of use and management, particularly in less complex deployments. Each request is treated as an isolated task. This simplifies error handling and debugging, as each request exists in its own distinct process context.  There's no shared state across requests that could lead to unpredictable behavior or complex debugging scenarios. However, this simplicity comes at the cost of performance.  The overhead associated with process creation and termination for each request adds significant latency, particularly under heavy load.

To elaborate further, consider the process lifecycle.  When a request arrives at the Gunicorn master process, it spawns a new `sync` worker.  This worker then performs its duties: receiving the request, executing the application code (typically a WSGI application), and generating a response. Upon completion, the worker terminates.  The master process then monitors for new incoming requests and spawns new workers as needed. This approach is straightforward but resource-intensive, especially with frequent requests requiring a relatively short execution time. The constant process creation and destruction consume CPU cycles and memory.

To demonstrate this, let's look at three code examples illustrating Gunicorn configuration and their impact on worker behavior.

**Example 1: Default Sync Worker Behavior**

```python
# gunicorn.conf.py
bind = "0.0.0.0:8000"
workers = 3  # Three worker processes
worker_class = "sync" # Default, worker exits after each request
```

In this configuration, three `sync` workers are spawned. Each worker will process a single request, then terminate.  The master process will manage the creation and destruction of these workers, ensuring that the request queue is processed. While simple, this configuration is not optimal for high-concurrency scenarios due to the process overhead.


**Example 2: Utilizing the `gevent` Worker**

```python
# gunicorn.conf.py
bind = "0.0.0.0:8000"
workers = 3
worker_class = "gevent"
timeout = 120  # Adjust timeout as needed
```

Here, we leverage the `gevent` worker class. This worker class uses asynchronous I/O, allowing a single worker to handle multiple concurrent requests. This significantly reduces the process overhead.  The `gevent` worker maintains a pool of greenlets (lightweight coroutines) to handle concurrent connections, staying alive and reusing resources between requests. The `timeout` setting helps prevent stalled connections from blocking the worker indefinitely.  In my experience, migrating from `sync` to `gevent` drastically improves performance for applications with many concurrent, short-lived requests.

**Example 3:  Employing the `uvicorn` Server Instead of Gunicorn**

```bash
# uvicorn command line (assuming ASGI application)
uvicorn myapp:app --workers 3 --reload
```

This example departs from Gunicorn, using `uvicorn` directly.  `uvicorn` is a particularly efficient ASGI server well-suited for modern Python web frameworks like FastAPI and Starlette. It's designed for asynchronous operation from the ground up, offering superior performance and handling concurrency inherently.  This eliminates the need for Gunicorn entirely and significantly reduces overhead if your application architecture is ASGI-compatible.  I've found that for applications using frameworks built around ASGI, `uvicorn` often surpasses Gunicorn in terms of scalability and resource efficiency.


The choice of worker class, therefore, profoundly impacts Gunicorn's performance and resource consumption.  While the `sync` worker offers simplicity, it sacrifices efficiency for ease of management.   For high-traffic applications, utilizing asynchronous worker classes like `gevent`, `eventlet`, or moving towards a full ASGI server like `uvicorn` is critical for optimal resource utilization and application responsiveness.


In my experience, the performance gains from transitioning to an asynchronous worker or ASGI server are substantial, especially under stress.  I've encountered situations where a simple shift from `sync` to `gevent`, coupled with appropriate tuning of Gunicorn's configuration parameters (like `timeout` and `worker_connections`), resulted in a several-fold increase in requests handled per second and a noticeable reduction in latency.  The impact is even more dramatic when moving to a fully ASGI-based solution.

To further enhance your understanding, I recommend consulting the official Gunicorn documentation, exploring advanced Gunicorn configuration options, and researching the differences between WSGI and ASGI architectures.  Deeply understanding asynchronous programming concepts is also essential, particularly if you plan to utilize asynchronous workers effectively.  Understanding the process lifecycle and resource management within the context of your specific application workload is critical for making informed choices regarding your Gunicorn configuration and worker selection.  Furthermore, profiling your application under load can pinpoint bottlenecks and guide you toward the most efficient solution for your needs.
