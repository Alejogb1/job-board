In my experience developing custom machine learning models for time-series forecasting, I frequently encountered scenarios where the raw output from a TensorFlow model required post-processing before being suitable for downstream analysis or direct consumption. TensorFlow itself doesn’t inherently "convert" predicted values in the sense of altering their fundamental numerical representation; rather, it provides a rich toolkit to manipulate these values. The process typically involves using TensorFlow operations to map model output to a desired output space. These mappings can range from simple scaling to more complex transformations and are critical for aligning predictions with the expected form of the target variable.

The primary reason for this post-prediction adjustment stems from the design choices inherent in model architectures and training methodologies. For instance, activation functions within the final layers often dictate the range of the model’s output. A sigmoid activation function will yield values between 0 and 1, while a ReLU will produce non-negative outputs, which may not directly correspond to the range or scale of the target data. Additionally, models may predict standardized or normalized data, requiring inverse transformations to recover the original scale. Therefore, understanding how to manipulate these predictions effectively using TensorFlow's capabilities is crucial for achieving meaningful results.

The methods employed to convert predicted values typically fall into several categories: scaling/descaling, applying nonlinear transformations, and thresholding. Scaling and descaling usually involve multiplication or division by a constant or the application of a linear transformation using pre-calculated parameters, such as the mean and standard deviation used to normalize the input data. Nonlinear transformations, like logarithmic or exponential functions, are employed when the target variable exhibits a skewed distribution. Finally, thresholding, in classification tasks, entails converting probabilities into binary class labels by comparing them against a predefined threshold. These adjustments are implemented using various TensorFlow operations available in the `tf.math` and `tf.linalg` modules, often applied within custom model training loops or post-processing functions.

Let's consider a specific scenario to illustrate these concepts. Imagine building a model to predict stock prices. The training data has been normalized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The model, using a linear output layer, predicts values within the standardized range. To obtain predictions in the original stock price range, we need to reverse the normalization process. This requires access to the original mean and standard deviation of the training data. Below, I present an example of this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def descaler(predictions, mean, std):
    """
    Descales predictions from a normalized scale back to the original scale.

    Args:
        predictions: A TensorFlow tensor containing normalized model predictions.
        mean: The mean of the original training data used for normalization.
        std: The standard deviation of the original training data used for normalization.

    Returns:
         A TensorFlow tensor containing descaled predictions.
    """
    return (predictions * std) + mean

# Example Usage:
# Assume model predictions are in the variable 'normalized_predictions'
normalized_predictions = tf.constant([0.5, -0.2, 1.0, -0.8])
original_mean = 150.0
original_std = 25.0

descaled_predictions = descaler(normalized_predictions, original_mean, original_std)
print("Descaled predictions:", descaled_predictions.numpy())

```

This code snippet illustrates a simple yet essential operation: reversing the normalization process. The `descaler` function takes normalized predictions, the original mean, and the original standard deviation, and returns the descaled values. Here, the TensorFlow operations perform the basic mathematical calculation of multiplying by the standard deviation and adding the mean. This is a common and generally required step following a prediction operation when normalization has been performed on the training data.

Another common scenario involves models predicting probabilities, specifically within the 0-1 range using a sigmoid activation function in their final layer. If, for example, you’re dealing with a binary classification problem and require actual class labels, probabilities must be thresholded. For a threshold of 0.5, values greater than 0.5 would map to one class, and all others to the second. Here is an example illustrating the application of thresholding:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def apply_threshold(probabilities, threshold=0.5):
    """
     Converts probability predictions into binary class labels.

    Args:
        probabilities: A TensorFlow tensor containing probability predictions.
        threshold: The threshold used for classification.

    Returns:
        A TensorFlow tensor containing binary class labels (0 or 1).
    """
    binary_predictions = tf.cast(tf.greater(probabilities, threshold), tf.int32)
    return binary_predictions

# Example Usage:
# Assume the variable 'probability_predictions' contains model output.
probability_predictions = tf.constant([0.1, 0.8, 0.3, 0.9, 0.6])

binary_labels = apply_threshold(probability_predictions, threshold=0.5)
print("Binary class labels:", binary_labels.numpy())

```

This example shows how the `apply_threshold` function utilizes the TensorFlow operation `tf.greater` to compare probabilities against a specified threshold. It then casts the resulting boolean tensor into an integer tensor where `True` becomes 1 and `False` becomes 0, effectively translating probabilities into binary class labels. The key here is the `tf.cast` operation, ensuring the data type is aligned with the desired output.

Finally, consider a case where the model predicts log-transformed values. This might be encountered when the target variable possesses a highly skewed distribution. To get back to the original space, you would need to apply the exponential function. Here's a basic example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def exp_transform(log_predictions):
    """
    Transforms log-transformed predictions back to the original scale using the exponential function.

    Args:
        log_predictions: A TensorFlow tensor containing log-transformed predictions.

    Returns:
        A TensorFlow tensor containing exponentiated predictions.
    """
    return tf.exp(log_predictions)


# Example Usage:
# Assume model predictions of log-transformed target data are stored in 'log_preds'
log_preds = tf.constant([0.5, 1.2, 2.0, -0.3])

original_scale_predictions = exp_transform(log_preds)
print("Predictions on the original scale:", original_scale_predictions.numpy())
```

In this example, `exp_transform` utilizes `tf.exp` to apply the exponential function to the input predictions. If a natural logarithm was applied initially, the exponentiation effectively reverses the log transform, returning values that are on the same scale as the original target data. As seen, using basic TensorFlow functions are sufficient to transform and map between transformed and original value scales.

It is important to note that all the previous examples are basic yet commonly encountered methods of transforming predictions. More complex scenarios can involve combinations of such methods and more intricate transformations implemented using custom TensorFlow operations. Therefore, when developing such methods it’s crucial to examine the specific use case to know what type of manipulation is necessary.

For further learning, I recommend exploring resources that delve deeper into TensorFlow's mathematical operations, activation functions, and post-processing techniques. Specifically, study the `tf.math` and `tf.nn` modules within the TensorFlow documentation. Additionally, textbooks and online courses that cover the topics of data preprocessing for machine learning and regression analysis can provide the theoretical foundations needed to choose the right transformation. When facing complex conversion challenges, it also helps to examine the implementation of similar models within the scientific literature and other open source repositories.
