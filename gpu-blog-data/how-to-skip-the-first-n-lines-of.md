A common data processing challenge I’ve faced, especially with legacy systems, is handling files where the initial few lines are corrupted or contain irrelevant metadata. The key to efficiently extracting the useful information lies in a combination of file handling techniques and careful iteration. We must not rely on simply reading the entire file and then discarding the initial portion in memory as this can become inefficient with extremely large files. The preferred method involves selectively skipping lines during the initial read operation.

The most straightforward approach, in languages providing sequential read capabilities, involves iterating through the file object and tracking the number of lines processed. Before reaching our desired data, we increment a counter and discard the lines. Once the counter surpasses our designated 'N' value, each subsequent line will be output or further processed. This avoids unnecessary memory consumption while ensuring we capture only the relevant data.

Let’s consider how this can be done with Python, a language I frequently leverage for data wrangling tasks.

**Code Example 1: Basic Line Skipping in Python**

```python
def skip_and_print(filepath, lines_to_skip):
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
            for line_number, line in enumerate(file):
                if line_number >= lines_to_skip:
                    print(line.strip())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File not found at {filepath}")
    except Exception as e:
         print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage:
skip_and_print("data.txt", 2)
```

This code defines a function `skip_and_print` that accepts a file path and the number of lines to skip as input. It opens the file in read mode (`'r'`) using a `with` statement, which ensures the file is automatically closed, even if errors occur. `enumerate(file)` provides both the line number (starting from 0) and the line content itself during iteration. The core logic is within the `if` condition. If `line_number` is greater than or equal to `lines_to_skip`, the line is printed to standard output after removing trailing whitespace using `.strip()`. The try-except block handles common errors such as the file not being found and other exceptions that might arise during file I/O.

In scenarios involving significantly large files, especially in systems with limited memory, even the basic approach can sometimes benefit from chunked processing. Rather than reading individual lines, it's more efficient to read data in fixed-size blocks and then split these blocks into lines ourselves.

**Code Example 2: Chunked Line Skipping with File Reading in Python**

```python
def skip_and_print_chunked(filepath, lines_to_skip, chunk_size=4096):
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
            skipped_count = 0
            while skipped_count < lines_to_skip:
                chunk = file.read(chunk_size)
                if not chunk:
                  break  # End of file reached before skip count
                lines = chunk.splitlines()
                for line in lines:
                     skipped_count +=1
                     if skipped_count > lines_to_skip:
                       print(line.strip())

            # Process the remaining file in chunks
            while True:
              chunk = file.read(chunk_size)
              if not chunk:
                 break
              lines = chunk.splitlines()
              for line in lines:
                 print(line.strip())

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File not found at {filepath}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage:
skip_and_print_chunked("large_data.txt", 5)
```

Here, we’ve modified the function to read the file in chunks of 4096 bytes using `file.read(chunk_size)`. Each chunk is then split into lines using `.splitlines()`. A `skipped_count` tracks how many lines we've effectively ignored. The first loop consumes lines from chunks until `skipped_count` reaches `lines_to_skip`, at which point subsequent lines are printed after stripping whitespace.  The second loop processes the remainder of the file. This approach reduces memory pressure, particularly when dealing with extremely large data sets. This also includes handling the situation where there are less lines in the file than specified to be skipped, exiting the loop without further processing.

However, it's worth noting that reading the entire file into memory can be unavoidable when dealing with systems lacking robust file handling methods. The following example uses a more rudimentary approach that, while less optimal, might be useful in specific constraints, such as highly restrictive, embedded environments.

**Code Example 3: Basic Read and Slice in Python**

```python
def skip_and_print_full_read(filepath, lines_to_skip):
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
            all_lines = file.readlines()
            if lines_to_skip >= len(all_lines):
              return #skip all lines, file empty

            remaining_lines = all_lines[lines_to_skip:]

            for line in remaining_lines:
              print(line.strip())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File not found at {filepath}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage:
skip_and_print_full_read("small_data.txt", 1)
```

In this function,  `file.readlines()` reads all lines of the file into a list called `all_lines`. This approach is memory-intensive and is less suited for large files. We then perform list slicing using `all_lines[lines_to_skip:]` to obtain the remaining lines that should be processed. The rest is similar to the first example, where we print each line to the console after stripping trailing whitespaces. We added an early exit condition when the skip count is equal or greater to the total line count of the file, to prevent list index errors.

When selecting an approach, I carefully consider the trade-offs. The first example is ideal for most use cases, where memory is not heavily constrained and the data set size is medium. The second chunked approach is preferable for very large data sets that might not fit into memory. The third approach should only be used when dealing with specific environments where more efficient methods are not possible.

Further, if I were working in a C/C++ environment where more control over the file system is required for optimization, I might explore more low-level file operations, utilizing `fseek` to skip through portions of the file directly instead of iterating through lines in memory. In this case, a different method of finding line endings would be needed, such as manually scanning the byte stream for newline characters, and this is not trivial.

For expanding expertise and further reading, I recommend exploring the documentation for file operations within the chosen language. In Python, the official documentation on file I/O is a valuable resource. Additionally, texts focusing on system programming often cover different file handling techniques. Books focusing on data engineering principles can provide further insights into various file processing methodologies, and their efficiency implications based on data sizes and other constraints. Furthermore, research papers on algorithms and data structures can enhance understanding of advanced data processing techniques, which can be applied in more complex file handling scenarios. Specifically, investigating buffer management and disk I/O efficiency can prove useful for very large data applications.
