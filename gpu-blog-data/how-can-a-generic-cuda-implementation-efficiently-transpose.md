Efficiently transposing a non-square matrix in CUDA requires careful consideration of memory access patterns and workload balancing to maximize performance.  My experience optimizing large-scale linear algebra computations for geophysical simulations highlighted the limitations of naive approaches.  Simply mirroring indices across threads leads to significant coalesced memory access violations, resulting in considerable performance degradation.  The key lies in employing strategies that maintain coalesced reads and writes, even when dealing with rectangular matrices.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The fundamental challenge in transposing non-square matrices on the GPU stems from the differing memory layouts of the input and output matrices.  A row-major matrix, the standard in many programming languages, stores elements row by row in contiguous memory locations. Transposing such a matrix necessitates accessing elements non-sequentially.  This disrupts coalescence, where multiple threads access consecutive memory locations simultaneously.  A single thread divergence caused by non-coalesced access can cripple the overall performance of a GPU kernel.

To address this, efficient CUDA implementations for non-square matrix transposition typically rely on one of two strategies:

* **Tiled Transposition:** This method divides the input matrix into smaller, square tiles.  Each tile is transposed independently by a block of threads.  The smaller tile size ensures that within each tile, memory accesses remain coalesced. The transposed tiles are then assembled to form the final transposed matrix. This approach mitigates the impact of non-coalesced memory access across the larger matrix but introduces additional overhead associated with tile management.

* **Shared Memory Optimization:** Leveraging shared memory within each thread block further improves performance.  Threads within a block collaboratively load a portion of the input matrix into shared memory, transpose it in shared memory, and then write the transposed portion back to global memory. This reduces the number of global memory accesses, which are significantly slower than shared memory accesses.  Careful consideration of shared memory bank conflicts is crucial for optimal performance.

The optimal choice between these strategies depends on the matrix dimensions, GPU architecture, and other application-specific constraints.  For very large matrices, a hybrid approach combining both techniques may yield the best results.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Naive (Inefficient) Transposition**

This example demonstrates a naive approach, highlighting the performance pitfalls of neglecting coalesced memory access.

```cuda
__global__ void naiveTranspose(const float* input, float* output, int rows, int cols) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < rows && col < cols) {
        output[col * rows + row] = input[row * cols + col];
    }
}
```

This kernel directly maps input and output indices, leading to non-coalesced memory accesses, especially for non-square matrices.  The performance will degrade significantly as matrix dimensions increase.


**Example 2: Tiled Transposition**

This kernel utilizes the tiled approach, improving memory access patterns.

```cuda
__global__ void tiledTranspose(const float* input, float* output, int rows, int cols, int tileSize) {
    __shared__ float tile[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];

    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int inputRow = blockIdx.y * tileSize + threadIdx.x;
    int inputCol = blockIdx.x * tileSize + threadIdx.y;

    if (inputRow < rows && inputCol < cols) {
        tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = input[inputRow * cols + inputCol];
    }
    __syncthreads();

    if (row < cols && col < rows) {
        output[col * cols + row] = tile[threadIdx.x][threadIdx.y];
    }
}
```
Here, `tileSize` is a configurable parameter controlling the size of the tiles.  The use of shared memory ensures coalesced access within each tile.  `__syncthreads()` synchronizes threads within a block before writing to global memory.  The choice of `tileSize` is crucial, and optimal values are usually determined experimentally.


**Example 3: Shared Memory Optimization with Handling of Non-Square Matrices**

This example refines the shared memory approach to explicitly handle non-square matrices by dynamically adjusting the loading pattern into shared memory.

```cuda
__global__ void sharedMemTranspose(const float* input, float* output, int rows, int cols) {
    __shared__ float tile[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];

    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    int tx = threadIdx.x;
    int ty = threadIdx.y;

    int blockRow = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y;
    int blockCol = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;

    for(int i = 0; i < (cols + blockDim.x -1) / blockDim.x; i++){
        int input_x = blockCol + tx + i * blockDim.x;
        int input_y = blockRow + ty;

        if(input_x < cols && input_y < rows) {
            tile[ty][tx] = input[input_y * cols + input_x];
        } else {
            tile[ty][tx] = 0; //handle out-of-bounds
        }
        __syncthreads();

        int output_x = blockCol + ty;
        int output_y = blockRow + tx + i * blockDim.x;
        if(output_x < cols && output_y < rows){
            output[output_y * cols + output_x] = tile[tx][ty];
        }
    }
}

```

This kernel explicitly accounts for the non-square nature of the matrix, iterating over tiles to process the entire matrix.  The handling of out-of-bounds accesses with zero padding is included for robustness.  The loop ensures efficient loading and transposition, handling varying matrix dimensions.
