The core issue with suppressing Airflow CLI error messages lies in the nuanced interaction between the Airflow CLI's logging mechanisms and the underlying Python processes it manages.  Simply redirecting standard error (`stderr`) isn't always sufficient, as Airflow uses various logging modules and handlers internally, potentially leading to error messages escaping even sophisticated redirection techniques. My experience troubleshooting this in large-scale DAG deployments across diverse environments taught me the crucial role of configuring Airflow's logging system directly, rather than relying solely on CLI-level manipulations.

**1.  A Clear Explanation of Airflow CLI Error Handling and Suppression**

The Airflow CLI (`airflow` command) orchestrates DAG execution, utilizing Python's `subprocess` module or similar mechanisms to manage worker processes.  Each task within a DAG often runs its own Python script, and these scripts may generate errors.  These errors manifest in several ways:  as exceptions caught and logged within the task itself; as uncaught exceptions terminating the task; or as errors originating within Airflow's core functionality during DAG parsing or execution.

Standard error redirection during CLI invocation (`airflow ... 2>/dev/null`) primarily targets the output of the `airflow` command itself, not the individual task processes.  This means that errors occurring *within* tasks will likely still be visible in the Airflow UI or logs, even if suppressed at the CLI level.  To effectively suppress these errors completely, one must directly address Airflow's logging configuration at the system or DAG level.  This is achievable by manipulating Airflow's logging handlers to redirect or filter error messages before they reach the console or log files.

My experience suggests that attempting to completely suppress *all* errors is generally discouraged.  While suppressing informational or warning messages for cleaner CLI output can be beneficial, silencing errors can mask crucial issues requiring attention.  A more nuanced approach involves selectively suppressing certain error types or directing them to different log locations, allowing for easy review when needed.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Modifying Airflow's `airflow.cfg` (Global Suppression - Discouraged)**

This approach modifies Airflow's global configuration file, impacting all DAGs.  While potentially convenient, it's generally ill-advised for production environments due to its broad scope.

```python
# airflow.cfg (Partial Configuration)

[loggers]
keys=root,airflow

[handlers]
keys=consoleHandler

[formatters]
keys=simpleFormatter

[logger_root]
level=WARNING # Adjust the log level here to suppress errors. Setting to CRITICAL only shows critical errors
handlers=consoleHandler

[logger_airflow]
level=WARNING # Adjust the log level here to suppress errors. Setting to CRITICAL only shows critical errors
handlers=consoleHandler

[handler_consoleHandler]
class=StreamHandler
level=DEBUG #This determines the minimum level of log this handler will process, even if the logger's level is different
formatter=simpleFormatter
args=(sys.stdout,)

[formatter_simpleFormatter]
format=%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s
```

**Commentary:**  This configuration raises the logging level for both the root logger and the Airflow logger to `WARNING`.  This means only messages of `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` severity will be logged.  Errors below `WARNING` will be suppressed. Remember to restart the Airflow scheduler and webserver after any modification to `airflow.cfg`. Using `CRITICAL` would only show critical errors.

**Example 2:  Custom Logging Handler within a DAG (Selective Suppression)**

This approach allows for more targeted control over error suppression, specifically impacting only the given DAG.

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
import logging

# Define a custom handler to suppress specific exceptions
class CustomErrorHandler(logging.Handler):
    def emit(self, record):
        if "MySpecificError" not in record.getMessage(): #Only logs exceptions that don't contain "MySpecificError"
            super().emit(record)

with DAG(dag_id="my_dag", start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 27), schedule=None, catchup=False) as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id="task_1",
        python_callable=lambda: (1/0), #Exception example
        on_failure_callback=lambda context: print("Failure handled")
    )

    # Add a custom handler to the logger
    handler = CustomErrorHandler()
    handler.setLevel(logging.ERROR) #Only log errors, but filter within the handler
    logger = logging.getLogger('airflow.task')
    logger.addHandler(handler)


```

**Commentary:** This creates a custom handler that filters log messages based on the content of the message.  It only logs messages that do not contain "MySpecificError".  This allows selective suppression of specific error types.  This example also provides a custom `on_failure_callback` to gracefully handle exceptions.  This demonstrates that error suppression strategies work best in conjunction with robust error handling within the tasks themselves.


**Example 3:  Using `logging.captureWarnings()` (Warning Suppression)**

This technique focuses on suppressing warnings, distinct from errors, by capturing them and directing them to a separate handler or discarding them entirely.

```python
import logging
import warnings

# Suppress warnings entirely.
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")


#Redirect warnings to a null handler
warnings.simplefilter("ignore", category=UserWarning)
null_handler = logging.NullHandler()
logging.getLogger('my_logger').addHandler(null_handler)

with DAG(dag_id="my_dag_warnings", start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 27), schedule=None, catchup=False) as dag:
    task1 = PythonOperator(
        task_id="task_1",
        python_callable=lambda: warnings.warn("This is a warning message"),
    )
```

**Commentary:** The `warnings.filterwarnings` function globally suppresses warnings.  More granular control is possible by specifying the warning categories to filter.  The alternative approach leverages a `NullHandler` to redirect warnings without suppressing them entirely; a more controlled method for development where warnings are important but not always wanted in the primary log stream.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The Airflow documentation provides comprehensive details on logging configuration and customization. Examining the source code of various Airflow operators and their handling of exceptions will offer valuable insights.  Furthermore, consulting Python's extensive logging library documentation will solidify your understanding of logging mechanisms and their application within Airflow.  Finally, reviewing relevant Airflow community forums and Stack Overflow threads focusing on logging will reveal common solutions and best practices for advanced logging management.
