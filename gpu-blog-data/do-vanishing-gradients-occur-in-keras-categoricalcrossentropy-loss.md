Vanishing gradients in the context of categorical cross-entropy loss within Keras are not directly caused by low probabilities for the correct class, but rather by the interaction of these low probabilities with the specific gradient calculation and the network architecture.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image classification projects highlighted the subtle interplay between activation functions, network depth, and data characteristics. While extremely low probabilities can exacerbate the problem, they're not the root cause.  The core issue lies in the gradient's dependence on the predicted probability itself.

The categorical cross-entropy loss function for a single data point is defined as:

`L = - Σᵢ yᵢ * log(pᵢ)`

where `yᵢ` is 1 if the data point belongs to class `i` and 0 otherwise, and `pᵢ` is the predicted probability of the data point belonging to class `i`.  The gradient of this loss with respect to the logits (pre-softmax activations) `zᵢ` is:

`∂L/∂zⱼ = pⱼ - yⱼ`

where `pⱼ = softmax(zⱼ)`. Note that the softmax function itself involves exponentiation, which can lead to numerical instability and contribute to vanishing gradients.

The vanishing gradient problem arises when this gradient becomes extremely small, effectively halting the learning process for earlier layers in a deep network. While a low probability for the correct class (`pⱼ` where `yⱼ = 1`) contributes to a smaller gradient, it's the compounding effect across multiple layers, coupled with the properties of the activation functions used, that amplifies this issue.  Specifically, if the activation function saturates (like sigmoid or tanh at the extremes), the gradient becomes very small, further diminishing the backpropagated signal.  ReLU, while mitigating this to some extent, isn't immune; its zero gradient for negative inputs can still impede learning under certain conditions.

Let's examine this with code examples. I'll use TensorFlow/Keras for consistency.

**Example 1: Demonstrating the gradient calculation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample logits (pre-softmax)
logits = np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 0.1, -1.0]], dtype=np.float32)

# One-hot encoded true labels (class 1 is the correct class)
y_true = np.array([[0, 1, 0, 0]], dtype=np.float32)

# Compute softmax probabilities
probabilities = tf.nn.softmax(logits).numpy()

# Calculate the loss and gradient
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(logits)
    loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(y_true, probabilities)
    gradient = tape.gradient(loss, logits)

print("Probabilities:", probabilities)
print("Loss:", loss.numpy())
print("Gradient:", gradient.numpy())
```

This example explicitly calculates the gradient of the cross-entropy loss, showing how it's directly related to the difference between predicted and true probabilities. Note that even with a low probability for the correct class (0.09 in this case after softmax), the gradient is still relatively substantial.  The issue emerges with repeated application of this gradient calculation across numerous layers.


**Example 2:  Illustrating vanishing gradients with a deep network**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(4,)), #sigmoid causes vanishing gradient
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='sigmoid'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Sample data with imbalanced classes and small probabilities for the correct class
x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 4)
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000), num_classes=10)
# Force some low probabilities by manipulating y_train (e.g., setting a few classes to have extremely low probabilities).

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Observe training process, particularly the loss values and gradient norms. Low loss reduction indicates vanishing gradients.
```

This showcases a deeper network using sigmoid activations, which are highly susceptible to vanishing gradients. The deliberate creation of imbalanced data with low probabilities for the correct class in some samples would worsen the already inherent problem of vanishing gradients caused by sigmoid's saturation properties.

**Example 3:  Mitigation strategies using ReLU and Batch Normalization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)),
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Use the same x_train and y_train from Example 2.

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example employs ReLU activations and batch normalization to mitigate the vanishing gradient issue. ReLU's piecewise linear nature reduces saturation problems, while batch normalization helps stabilize the activations and gradients across layers. However, even with these improvements, extremely low probabilities and dataset imbalances can still negatively impact training.  Careful hyperparameter tuning and potential data augmentation might be necessary to compensate.

In summary, while exceptionally low probabilities for the correct class can contribute to slower convergence, they aren't the primary cause of vanishing gradients in categorical cross-entropy. The problem stems from the interplay of the loss function's gradient calculation, the network architecture (depth, activation functions), and data characteristics.  Addressing this requires focusing on choosing appropriate activation functions (ReLU, improvements on ReLU), using techniques like batch normalization, and addressing any data imbalances present in the dataset.  Careful monitoring of training metrics and gradients during training is crucial for diagnosing and rectifying vanishing gradients.

* "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.
* Research papers on vanishing gradients and optimization techniques in deep learning.  Specifically, explore papers focusing on activation functions and batch normalization.

Remember that meticulously analyzing your training data, choosing suitable model architecture and hyperparameters, and diligently monitoring training dynamics are essential for successfully training deep learning models.  Overcoming vanishing gradients often requires a combination of strategies rather than a single solution.
