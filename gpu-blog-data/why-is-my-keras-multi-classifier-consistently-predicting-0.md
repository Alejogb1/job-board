The consistent prediction of class 0 in a Keras multi-classifier almost invariably stems from an imbalance in the training data, coupled with an improperly configured model or loss function.  Over the course of my work developing image recognition systems for autonomous vehicles, I encountered this issue repeatedly.  The root cause is often subtle and requires careful investigation of data preprocessing, model architecture, and training parameters.

1. **Data Imbalance:**  A skewed class distribution significantly biases the model towards the majority class. If class 0 constitutes a disproportionately large portion of your training dataset, the model, even if correctly specified, will learn to prioritize predicting class 0 to minimize overall loss, effectively ignoring minority classes. This is particularly problematic with cross-entropy loss, a standard choice for multi-class classification.  The model achieves a low overall loss by accurately predicting the dominant class and is penalized minimally for misclassifying the minority classes.  My experience shows this effect can be drastic even with seemingly moderate imbalances.  Resampling techniques like oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class are crucial in mitigating this.

2. **Model Architecture:** An inadequately complex model might lack the capacity to learn the intricate relationships between features and classes.  If the model is too simplistic – for example, having too few layers or neurons – it might fail to capture the nuances required to distinguish between classes effectively.  In my work on pedestrian detection, using a shallow convolutional neural network resulted in this exact issue, consistently classifying images as "no pedestrian" (class 0) despite sufficient data. Increasing model depth and breadth, while carefully managing overfitting, is vital.  Regularization techniques such as dropout and weight decay should be employed to enhance generalization.

3. **Loss Function and Optimizer:**  The choice of loss function and optimizer directly impacts model training.  While categorical cross-entropy is often the preferred choice for multi-class classification, its effectiveness relies heavily on a balanced dataset.  In cases of severe imbalance, techniques like weighted cross-entropy, where misclassifications of minority classes incur higher penalties, can be beneficial.  Additionally, the choice of optimizer can influence convergence.  AdamW is a robust and commonly used optimizer, but other optimizers like SGD with momentum might be appropriate depending on the dataset and model complexity.  Incorrect hyperparameter tuning for these components (e.g., learning rate, decay rate) can further exacerbate the problem, leading to premature convergence to a suboptimal solution.


Let's illustrate these points with code examples.  Assume we have a dataset `X_train`, `y_train` for training and `X_test`, `y_test` for testing.  `y_train` and `y_test` are one-hot encoded.


**Example 1: Addressing Data Imbalance with Oversampling**

```python
import numpy as np
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Assuming X_train, y_train are your original imbalanced data
ros = RandomOverSampler(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = ros.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

#Now train your model using X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled
# ... Model definition and training ...
```

This example demonstrates the use of `RandomOverSampler` from the `imblearn` library to oversample the minority classes in the training data.  This creates a more balanced training set, thereby mitigating the bias towards class 0.  I've found this to be effective in numerous projects, particularly when the minority classes are crucial for the system's success.


**Example 2: Implementing Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_categorical_crossentropy(weights):
    """A weighted version of categorical_crossentropy for Keras.
       It allows to specify a different weight for each class.
    """
    def loss(y_true, y_pred):
        # scale predictions so that the class probas of each sample sum to 1
        y_pred /= K.sum(y_pred, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        # clip to prevent NaN's and Inf's
        y_pred = K.clip(y_pred, K.epsilon(), 1 - K.epsilon())
        # calc
        loss = -K.sum(y_true * K.log(y_pred) * weights, axis=-1)
        return loss
    return loss

# Calculate class weights based on your class distribution.  Numerous strategies exist.
# ... calculate weights ...

#Compile your model
model.compile(loss=weighted_categorical_crossentropy(weights), 
              optimizer='adam', 
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Here, we define a custom loss function that applies class weights to categorical cross-entropy.  Calculating appropriate weights (e.g., inversely proportional to class frequencies) requires careful consideration of the specific data imbalance.  The use of `K.clip` prevents numerical instability, a common problem I've encountered during training.

**Example 3:  Increasing Model Complexity and Regularization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout

#Example model architecture modification to address potential lack of capacity.
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    # ... Existing layers ...
    Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.001)), #increased units, added L2 regularization.
    Dropout(0.5), #added dropout for regularization
    Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# ... Model compilation and training ...
```

This example demonstrates a simple modification to a model architecture, incorporating more neurons in a dense layer and introducing dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.  Experimenting with different architectures, including deeper networks or using more sophisticated layers, is often necessary to achieve satisfactory performance, especially when dealing with complex datasets.
