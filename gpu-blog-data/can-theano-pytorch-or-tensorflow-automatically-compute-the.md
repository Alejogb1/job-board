Automatic differentiation is a cornerstone of modern deep learning frameworks, and my experience across numerous projects confirms its efficacy in significantly reducing development time and preventing errors in gradient calculation.  The answer to whether Theano, PyTorch, or TensorFlow automatically compute gradients is a resounding yes, though the implementation details and user experience differ slightly across these frameworks.  Each leverages a distinct approach, reflecting the evolution of automatic differentiation techniques.

**1.  Explanation of Automatic Differentiation**

Automatic differentiation (AD) is not a single algorithm but a family of techniques for efficiently calculating derivatives of functions defined by computer programs.  The key is to avoid the symbolic differentiation approach commonly taught in calculus, which can be computationally expensive and prone to errors for complex functions. Instead, AD works by exploiting the chain rule of calculus. It breaks down the computation into a sequence of elementary operations, each with a known derivative.  Then, it applies the chain rule recursively to propagate these derivatives through the computation graph representing the function.  This graph is implicitly or explicitly constructed by the framework during the execution of the forward pass.

Two main modes exist: forward mode and reverse mode (also known as backpropagation).  Forward mode calculates the derivatives of the output with respect to all inputs simultaneously.  Reverse mode, favored in deep learning, computes the derivative of the output with respect to a specific input (typically the loss function with respect to the model's parameters). Reverse mode is computationally more efficient when the number of outputs is smaller than the number of inputs, a common scenario in neural network training where we have many parameters and a single scalar loss value.

Theano, PyTorch, and TensorFlow all employ reverse-mode AD, though with differing levels of explicit control offered to the user.  Theano, now largely superseded, relied heavily on symbolic differentiation, making its approach distinct. PyTorch and TensorFlow, however, primarily rely on computational graph tracking and manipulation, offering a more dynamic and user-friendly experience.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**2.1 Theano (Illustrative - for historical context)**

While I haven't actively used Theano in several years due to its deprecation, I recall its process involved defining a symbolic computation graph first.  The gradient computation was then implicitly performed based on this graph definition. Theano's graph compilation step incurred overhead, but it could optimize the gradient computation.


```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as T

# Define symbolic variables
x = T.scalar('x')
y = x**2

# Compute the gradient symbolically
grad = T.grad(y, x)

# Compile the function to compute the gradient
compute_grad = theano.function([x], grad)

# Evaluate the gradient
gradient = compute_grad(3)
print(gradient)  # Output: 6.0
```

The example shows a simple quadratic function.  Note the symbolic definition of `x` and `y`, and the use of `T.grad` to explicitly request gradient computation. Theano then performs the symbolic differentiation and compiles a function (`compute_grad`) for efficient evaluation.  This symbolic approach, while powerful, had performance limitations compared to the more dynamic approaches of PyTorch and TensorFlow.

**2.2 PyTorch**

PyTorch's dynamic computational graph makes gradient computation straightforward.  Gradients are automatically computed using the `.backward()` method on the loss tensor, after constructing the computational graph through standard Python operations.  I've extensively used this framework for its ease of debugging and flexibility.

```python
import torch

# Define a tensor
x = torch.tensor([3.0], requires_grad=True)

# Define a function
y = x**2

# Compute the gradient
y.backward()

# Access the gradient
gradient = x.grad
print(gradient) # Output: tensor([6.])

```

The `requires_grad=True` flag indicates that the gradient with respect to `x` should be computed.  The `backward()` method triggers the automatic differentiation, and the gradient is directly accessible through `x.grad`.  The dynamic nature avoids the compilation step of Theano, resulting in improved performance, especially for iterative processes.

**2.3 TensorFlow**

TensorFlow, in its eager execution mode (the default in newer versions), closely mirrors PyTorch's dynamic behavior.  However, its graph construction, though often implicit, can be more explicit via `tf.GradientTape`. This grants finer control over gradient computation for advanced scenarios.  In my projects, I found TensorFlow's flexibility valuable for deployment to various platforms.


```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a tensor
x = tf.Variable([3.0])

# Define a function using GradientTape
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = x**2

# Compute the gradient
gradient = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(gradient) # Output: tf.Tensor([6.], shape=(1,), dtype=float32)
```

Similar to PyTorch, the gradient is automatically computed. The `tf.GradientTape` context manager records the operations for differentiation.  `tape.gradient()` then computes the gradient of `y` with respect to `x`.  The automatic differentiation is handled internally by TensorFlow's efficient backpropagation engine.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of automatic differentiation, I would recommend exploring textbooks on numerical optimization and machine learning.  Many introductory machine learning texts cover backpropagation in detail.  Furthermore, the official documentation for PyTorch and TensorFlow are invaluable resources, offering comprehensive tutorials and examples on gradient computation and advanced techniques like higher-order derivatives and custom gradients.   Advanced texts on computational graph manipulation and optimization techniques would further enhance your understanding of the underlying mechanics.  Finally, the original research papers on backpropagation and related algorithms will provide the foundational mathematical understanding.
