The intermittent failure of .NET bundling solely after a server restart frequently stems from a misconfiguration of the application's caching mechanism interacting with the bundling process's reliance on file timestamps and/or dependency tracking.  My experience resolving this issue across numerous enterprise-level deployments points to a race condition between the application's initialization and the file system's reporting of file changes.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

.NET bundling, typically used to optimize web application performance by combining and minifying JavaScript and CSS files, depends critically on accurate file system metadata, specifically timestamps. The bundling process determines whether a rebuild is necessary by checking modification dates of the source files.  A server restart introduces a temporal gap. During startup, the application's cache might be populated with stale data regarding the bundle files, or the file system might not yet have fully updated its metadata reflecting changes made since the last successful build.  This creates a scenario where the application believes the bundles are up-to-date, even though they are not, leading to the observed post-restart failure. This is further exacerbated if the bundling process relies on external dependencies that might also have changed but are not yet reflected in the application's internal state.

Further complicating the matter is the asynchronous nature of many .NET application initialization processes.  The bundler might initiate before the file system fully reflects the state of the files post-restart, or the cache might be updated after the bundler has already made its determination.  This race condition, subtle yet critical, is the root cause of the intermittent post-restart bundling failures.  The problem is not inherently a defect in the bundling process itself, but a consequence of the complex interaction between multiple system components during server startup.  Therefore, the solution necessitates carefully addressing the application's cache management and file dependency tracking to ensure consistency and eliminate the race condition.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential solutions using different .NET bundling approaches, focusing on mitigating the race condition:

**Example 1: Using a custom bundling task with explicit cache invalidation:**

```csharp
// Custom bundling task.  Crucial modification:  Explicit cache invalidation on startup.
public class CustomBundlerTask : IBundlerTask
{
    private readonly ICacheManager _cacheManager; //Dependency injection for cache

    public CustomBundlerTask(ICacheManager cacheManager)
    {
        _cacheManager = cacheManager;
    }

    public async Task<BundledOutput> BundleAsync(string bundleName)
    {
        // Check for existing bundle in cache.
        var cachedBundle = _cacheManager.Get(bundleName);
        if (cachedBundle != null) { return cachedBundle; }

        // Perform bundle creation...

        _cacheManager.Set(bundleName, result);
        return result;
    }

    // Method called on application start to force cache invalidation
    public void InvalidateCache(){
        _cacheManager.Clear();
    }
}

//Then, in your application startup:
var bundler = serviceProvider.GetService<CustomBundlerTask>();
bundler.InvalidateCache();
```

This example demonstrates the importance of explicitly invalidating the cache upon application start.  A custom bundling task is employed to directly manage cache interactions, ensuring a clean slate at server initialization.  The `InvalidateCache` method is called during application startup to preemptively address the potential for stale cache data.  Dependency injection provides a clean and testable approach to managing the cache.

**Example 2: Leveraging file system watchers for dynamic bundle updates:**

```csharp
//Utilizing a FileSystemWatcher to trigger bundle rebuilds.
private FileSystemWatcher _fileSystemWatcher;

public void InitializeBundling() {
    _fileSystemWatcher = new FileSystemWatcher(bundleSourceDirectory);
    _fileSystemWatcher.EnableRaisingEvents = true;
    _fileSystemWatcher.IncludeSubdirectories = true;
    _fileSystemWatcher.Changed += OnFileChanged;
    _fileSystemWatcher.Created += OnFileChanged;
    _fileSystemWatcher.Deleted += OnFileChanged;

    //Initial bundle creation
    BundleFiles();
}

private void OnFileChanged(object sender, FileSystemEventArgs e) {
    BundleFiles();
}


private void BundleFiles(){
    //Perform bundle creation using the updated files.
}
```

This approach dynamically rebuilds bundles when source file changes are detected.  The `FileSystemWatcher` monitors the source directory for modifications and triggers the `BundleFiles` method, ensuring bundles are always up-to-date, regardless of server restarts. This eliminates the reliance on timestamp comparisons during application startup.  However, be mindful of performance implications, especially with large numbers of files.

**Example 3: Using a robust build system with incremental compilation:**

```csharp
// Simplified representation.  Actual implementation depends on your build system (e.g., MSBuild).

//Build task in your build system
<Target Name="Bundle">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <BundleOutputDir>wwwroot/bundles</BundleOutputDir>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <Message Text="Bundling..." />
  <Exec Command="node node_modules/your-bundler/cli.js --input $(SourceFiles) --output $(BundleOutputDir)" />
</Target>

<Target Name="PreBuild" BeforeTargets="Bundle">
  <Message Text="Clearing old bundles..." />
  <RemoveDir Directories="$(BundleOutputDir)" />
</Target>
```


This example leverages an external bundling tool (like Webpack, Parcel, etc.) and integrates it into the project's build system.  The `PreBuild` target ensures previous bundles are removed before the build process, preventing stale bundles from being used.  The incremental compilation capabilities of most modern build systems further optimize the process by only rebuilding necessary parts after code changes.  This is often the most reliable and maintainable solution for complex projects.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official documentation for your chosen .NET bundling library or framework.   Explore advanced topics related to cache management in .NET and best practices for asynchronous operations.  Examine resources on build automation and dependency management relevant to your project's structure.  Investigate different approaches to file system monitoring and efficient handling of file changes.  Familiarize yourself with different .NET caching strategies.  Study design patterns relevant to managing dependencies and ensuring thread safety in multi-threaded scenarios.
