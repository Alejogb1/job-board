PyTorch's handling of batchwise indexing hinges fundamentally on its tensor representation and broadcasting capabilities.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects highlighted the crucial role of efficient indexing, particularly when dealing with mini-batches during training.  Understanding how PyTorch manages this is paramount for optimization and avoiding performance bottlenecks.  It leverages advanced indexing techniques, notably advanced indexing with tensors of integer indices, which allows for flexible and performant batch-level data manipulation.  This differs significantly from simple slicing, offering greater control and scalability.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch tensors, unlike standard Python lists or NumPy arrays, possess a sophisticated internal structure optimized for parallel computation on GPUs. This structure allows for efficient vectorized operations, including advanced indexing.  Batchwise indexing refers to accessing specific elements within each batch of a multi-dimensional tensor.  Consider a tensor representing a mini-batch of images, where the first dimension represents the batch size, the subsequent dimensions represent the image height, width, and channels.  Batchwise indexing permits selection of specific pixels, regions, or even entire images within this batch without explicit looping.

The key mechanism here is the use of integer index tensors.  Instead of using single integer indices (e.g., `tensor[0]`), we employ tensors as indices.  These index tensors specify which elements to retrieve from the primary tensor along each dimension.  The shape of the index tensor dictates the shape of the resulting output.  Importantly, broadcasting rules apply to the indexing process, enabling efficient operations even when the index tensors have different shapes than the original tensor, provided the dimensions are compatible.  Mismatched dimensions will result in errors.  It's crucial to ensure the index tensor's dimensions align appropriately with the targeted dimensions of the primary tensor.  Incorrect dimension alignment commonly results in `IndexError` exceptions.

Advanced indexing also interacts with PyTorch's automatic differentiation capabilities.  When gradients are enabled (using `requires_grad=True`), indexing operations are tracked, allowing for automatic computation of gradients with respect to the indexed elements. This is crucial for backpropagation during neural network training.  Conversely, using boolean indexing, often preferred for masking, typically prevents automatic gradient calculation for the selected elements, necessitating careful handling of gradients if backpropagation is required for those specific elements.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Selecting specific elements within each batch:**

```python
import torch

# Batch of 3 images, each 2x2 pixels (grayscale)
batch_tensor = torch.tensor([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]], [[9, 10], [11, 12]]])

# Index tensor selecting the top-left pixel of each image
row_indices = torch.tensor([0, 0, 0])
col_indices = torch.tensor([0, 0, 0])

# Batchwise indexing
selected_pixels = batch_tensor[torch.arange(batch_tensor.shape[0]), row_indices, col_indices]
print(selected_pixels)  # Output: tensor([ 1,  5,  9])

#Alternative - using a single index tensor.
indices = torch.tensor([[0,0],[0,0],[0,0]])
selected_pixels_alt = batch_tensor[torch.arange(batch_tensor.shape[0]),indices[:,0],indices[:,1]]
print(selected_pixels_alt) #Output: tensor([ 1,  5,  9])
```

This example showcases how to select a specific element (top-left pixel) from each image in the batch using index tensors. The `torch.arange` function generates the indices for the batch dimension, ensuring each image is accessed individually.  The `row_indices` and `col_indices` tensors specify the row and column indices within each image.


**Example 2:  Selecting a subset of images:**

```python
import torch

# Same batch tensor as Example 1
batch_tensor = torch.tensor([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]], [[9, 10], [11, 12]]])

# Select the first and third images
selected_batch_indices = torch.tensor([0, 2])
selected_images = batch_tensor[selected_batch_indices]
print(selected_images) #Output: tensor([[[ 1,  2],
#                                          [ 3,  4]],

#                                         [[ 9, 10],
#                                          [11, 12]]])

```

This example demonstrates selecting entire images from the batch. The `selected_batch_indices` tensor specifies which images to retrieve.


**Example 3:  Masking with Boolean Indexing:**

```python
import torch

# Batch of 3 images, 2x2 pixels
batch_tensor = torch.tensor([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]], [[9, 10], [11, 12]]])

# Boolean mask to select pixels greater than 5
mask = batch_tensor > 5
print(mask)

# Apply the mask
masked_tensor = batch_tensor[mask]
print(masked_tensor) # Output: tensor([ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12])
```

This example illustrates boolean indexing, where a boolean tensor is used to select elements satisfying a condition. Note that the output is a flattened tensor.  While efficient, the resulting tensor's shape is not directly tied to the original batch structure.  If preserving the original batch structure is important, more complex indexing strategies might be needed.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation is indispensable.  Thorough understanding of tensor operations and broadcasting rules is essential.   Consult a comprehensive linear algebra textbook for a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations underlying tensor manipulations.   A book focused on deep learning using PyTorch provides practical context and application examples.  Finally, I found studying the source code of established PyTorch projects immensely helpful in understanding advanced techniques.


In conclusion, PyTorch's advanced indexing capabilities, particularly the use of integer index tensors, provide a highly flexible and performant mechanism for batchwise data manipulation.  Understanding broadcasting rules and the interaction between indexing and automatic differentiation is critical for writing efficient and effective PyTorch code, especially when dealing with large datasets common in machine learning applications.  Careful consideration of index tensor shapes and the desired output structure is essential to avoid errors and ensure optimal performance.
