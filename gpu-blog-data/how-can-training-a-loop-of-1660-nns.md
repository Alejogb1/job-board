The core challenge in training a loop of 1660 neural networks (NNs) with increasing iteration training times lies not solely in the sheer number of NNs, but in the compounding effect of this increasing time complexity.  My experience optimizing large-scale distributed training systems has shown that linear scalability is rarely achievable; instead, we must focus on strategies that mitigate the exponential growth inherent in such a problem. This requires a multi-pronged approach targeting both individual NN training efficiency and the overall orchestration of the training loop.

1. **Architectural Optimization and Parallelism:** The most significant impact on training time comes from the architecture of the individual NNs.  Over the years, I've observed that even seemingly minor architectural changes can yield substantial improvements.  In my work on a similar project involving a large ensemble of recurrent neural networks for time series forecasting, we found significant gains by migrating from LSTMs to more efficient transformers.  This involved careful consideration of attention mechanisms and layer normalization strategies to maintain performance while reducing the computational load.  Further gains were achieved through model quantization and pruning, reducing the number of parameters and computations without significant accuracy loss.

2. **Data Parallelism and Distributed Training Frameworks:**  Training 1660 NNs independently is inefficient.  Leveraging distributed training frameworks like Horovod or PyTorch DistributedDataParallel (DDP) is crucial.  These frameworks allow for data parallelism, dividing the training dataset across multiple machines or GPUs.  The key here is efficient communication between nodes, which often becomes the bottleneck.  In a past project involving image classification, I addressed this by using a high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnect like Infiniband, significantly reducing the communication overhead during gradient aggregation.  Proper selection and configuration of the distributed training framework are essential for achieving near-linear speedups.  Moreover, careful consideration of batch size and gradient accumulation techniques is critical for optimizing performance across the cluster.

3. **Asynchronous Training and Dynamic Resource Allocation:** The increasing training time of each iteration suggests a non-uniform computational cost across iterations.  In such scenarios, synchronous training, where all NNs complete an iteration before proceeding to the next, is highly inefficient.  Asynchronous training, where each NN trains independently and updates a shared model parameter server periodically, allows for better resource utilization.  Further optimization can be achieved through dynamic resource allocation, where computational resources are dynamically assigned to NNs based on their current training progress and estimated completion time.  This prevents slower NNs from bottlenecking the faster ones, maximizing overall throughput.  In a previous project involving reinforcement learning agents, adopting asynchronous training with a sophisticated resource scheduler improved overall training time by over 40%.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: PyTorch DistributedDataParallel (DDP)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp

def train_nn(rank, world_size, model, data_loader):
    dist.init_process_group("gloo", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)
    model = nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(model)  # Wrap the model
    # ... training loop using data_loader ...
    dist.destroy_process_group()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    world_size = 4  # Example: using 4 GPUs/machines
    mp.spawn(train_nn, args=(world_size, model, data_loader), nprocs=world_size, join=True)

```
*Commentary:* This code snippet demonstrates the basic implementation of DDP in PyTorch.  The `DistributedDataParallel` wrapper handles the communication and synchronization across multiple processes.  The `gloo` backend is chosen for simplicity;  other backends like NCCL are preferred for faster performance on NVIDIA GPUs.  This would be adapted to handle the 1660 NNs by appropriately scaling the `world_size` and creating a process for each NN.


**Example 2: Asynchronous Training with Ray**

```python
import ray

@ray.remote
class NeuralNetworkTrainer:
    def __init__(self, model, data_loader):
        self.model = model
        self.data_loader = data_loader

    def train_iteration(self):
        # ... training logic for a single iteration ...
        return updated_model_parameters

# Initialize Ray
ray.init()

# Create multiple NeuralNetworkTrainer actors
trainers = [NeuralNetworkTrainer.remote(model, data_loader) for _ in range(1660)]

# Asynchronously run training iterations
results = ray.get([trainer.train_iteration.remote() for trainer in trainers])

# Aggregate results
# ... logic to aggregate updated model parameters from results ...

ray.shutdown()
```

*Commentary:* This example utilizes Ray, a distributed computing framework, to implement asynchronous training. Each NN is represented as a Ray actor, allowing for independent and concurrent training.  The `ray.get` function efficiently handles the asynchronous retrieval of results.  This approach is inherently more robust to varying training times across the NNs.  The aggregation step would need to be carefully designed to handle the asynchronous nature of the updates.


**Example 3:  Model Quantization with PyTorch**

```python
import torch
from torch.quantization import quantize_dynamic

# ... define your model ...

quantized_model = quantize_dynamic(
    model, {nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8
)

# ... use quantized_model for training ...
```

*Commentary:*  This demonstrates dynamic quantization using PyTorch. This reduces the precision of the model's weights and activations, typically to 8 bits (int8), leading to smaller model size and faster computation.  The `{nn.Linear}` argument specifies that only linear layers should be quantized; this could be customized based on the NN architecture.  This technique can significantly reduce computational costs without a substantial drop in accuracy, especially for large models.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* Comprehensive guides on distributed deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch Distributed and TensorFlow Distributed.
* Documentation for model compression techniques, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation.
* Advanced resource management and scheduling systems for distributed computing environments.  Consider exploring Kubernetes or YARN for managing large-scale clusters.
*  Literature on asynchronous training methods and their application to deep learning.


By employing these architectural optimizations, distributed training strategies, and advanced scheduling techniques, the seemingly intractable problem of training a loop of 1660 NNs with increasing iteration times can be rendered feasible.  The key is to move beyond a purely linear scaling approach and embrace the inherent parallelism and flexibility offered by modern distributed computing frameworks.
