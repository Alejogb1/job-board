The fundamental mechanism governing data transfer from a GPU to DRAM hinges on the system's memory architecture and the interplay between various hardware components, primarily the GPU's memory controller and the system's memory bus.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing workloads, particularly in scientific simulations, has highlighted the critical role of understanding this data path for achieving optimal performance.  It's not a monolithic process but rather a carefully orchestrated series of operations influenced by factors like data size, memory bandwidth, and the specific GPU and system configuration.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Data transmission from a GPU to DRAM isn't a single, direct operation. Instead, it involves several steps, each contributing to the overall latency and throughput. The process begins within the GPU itself. Processed data resides in the GPU's on-chip memory (e.g., GDDR6X, HBM2e), which is significantly faster than DRAM. To transfer this data to DRAM, the GPU's memory controller initiates a read operation from its local memory. This data is then staged in a buffer managed by the controller.  Crucially, the transfer size is not arbitrary; it's organized into packets or transactions optimized for the system's memory bus.  This process is significantly affected by the memory bus architecture (e.g., PCIe 4.0, PCIe 5.0), which defines the available bandwidth and the protocol governing data transmission.  The memory controller manages the transfer, splitting large data transfers into smaller chunks as needed to fit within the bus's capacity and addressability.  These chunks are sent across the PCIe bus (or similar interface) to the system's northbridge or memory controller hub, which then routes the data to the appropriate DRAM channels. Finally, the DRAM controller receives the data and writes it to specific DRAM locations based on the provided addresses.  The entire process is heavily influenced by DMA (Direct Memory Access) capabilities; this allows the GPU to transfer data to DRAM without significant CPU intervention, significantly improving performance. The efficiency of DMA transfer, especially its ability to manage concurrent transfers and minimize bus contention, is a critical aspect impacting the overall data transmission speed.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples illustrate the process from a high-level perspective, focusing on the programming paradigm rather than the low-level hardware interaction.  Direct hardware manipulation is typically handled by specialized libraries and drivers.

**Example 1:  CUDA (CUDA-C/C++)**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void processData(float *input, float *output, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    output[i] = input[i] * 2.0f; // Example computation
  }
}

int main() {
  float *h_input, *h_output;
  float *d_input, *d_output;
  int size = 1024 * 1024; // Example size

  // Allocate host memory
  h_input = (float*)malloc(size * sizeof(float));
  h_output = (float*)malloc(size * sizeof(float));

  // Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_input, size * sizeof(float));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_output, size * sizeof(float));

  // Copy data from host to device
  cudaMemcpy(d_input, h_input, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // Launch kernel
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  processData<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_input, d_output, size);

  // Copy data from device to host
  cudaMemcpy(h_output, d_output, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // Free memory
  free(h_input);
  free(h_output);
  cudaFree(d_input);
  cudaFree(d_output);

  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a basic CUDA kernel that performs a simple computation on an array.  `cudaMemcpy` is crucial; it explicitly manages the data transfer between host (CPU) memory and device (GPU) memory.  The implicit transfer back to host memory after GPU processing demonstrates the data transfer from GPU to system memory (which ultimately resides in DRAM).  The efficiency depends on factors such as memory coalescing and the appropriate block and grid dimensions.

**Example 2: OpenCL (C++)**

```c++
// ... OpenCL context setup and kernel compilation ...

cl::Buffer inputBuffer(context, CL_MEM_READ_ONLY | CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR, size * sizeof(float), h_input, &err);
cl::Buffer outputBuffer(context, CL_MEM_WRITE_ONLY, size * sizeof(float), NULL, &err);

// ... Kernel execution ...

cl::copy(queue, outputBuffer, h_output, 0, 0, size * sizeof(float), NULL, &err);

// ... cleanup ...
```

This OpenCL snippet highlights the use of `cl::Buffer` to represent data on the device.  `CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR` flag during buffer creation facilitates the initial transfer to the device; the `cl::copy` function explicitly moves the data back to the host.  Similar to CUDA, efficient memory management and kernel optimization are critical for performance.

**Example 3:  HIP (C++)**

```c++
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>

// ... HIP kernel definition ...

hipMemcpy(d_output, h_output, size * sizeof(float), hipMemcpyDeviceToHost); // Transfer from GPU to Host

// ... error checking and resource cleanup ...
```

HIP, a close relative to CUDA, shares a similar programming model.  The `hipMemcpy` function mirrors the CUDA counterpart, showcasing the explicit management of data transfers between host and device memories.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official documentation for your specific GPU vendor (e.g., NVIDIA CUDA documentation, AMD ROCm documentation) and researching advanced memory management techniques such as pinned memory and asynchronous data transfers. Furthermore, studying the architecture of modern memory controllers and system buses will provide invaluable insight.  Exploring publications on high-performance computing and parallel programming would greatly augment your understanding. Finally, reviewing relevant sections in computer architecture textbooks is crucial for a solid foundational knowledge.
