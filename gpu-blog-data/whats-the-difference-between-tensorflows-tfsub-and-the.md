TensorFlow’s `tf.sub` is, in most modern TensorFlow versions, an alias for `tf.subtract`. The critical distinction between these and the `-` operator lies not in core functionality—they all perform element-wise subtraction—but in their behavior within TensorFlow's computational graph and their implications for optimization and interoperability. My experience developing custom deep learning models for medical image analysis has highlighted this nuance frequently. The choice between the two, while seemingly trivial, significantly impacts graph construction and, by extension, performance.

The `-` operator in Python, when used with TensorFlow tensors, is overloaded to create a `tf.subtract` operation implicitly. This overloading is a convenience feature, allowing for more readable code that resembles standard mathematical notation. However, this implicit conversion can mask underlying behaviors that are crucial for understanding how TensorFlow manages its computational graph. Conversely, explicitly calling `tf.subtract` or its deprecated alias `tf.sub` directly builds the subtraction operation as a node in the graph with full explicitness.

The fundamental difference stems from how TensorFlow registers operations in its computational graph. Using `-` with tensors triggers TensorFlow’s operator overloading mechanism. The framework interprets the `-` and automatically creates the corresponding `tf.subtract` node. This implicit conversion is typically transparent. It is suitable for most elementary operations, particularly within eager execution. However, in graph mode, it means the graph contains `tf.subtract` nodes generated behind the scenes, adding one more layer of abstraction. This abstraction layer, while beneficial in many contexts, can obscure detailed control of the graph, and also it can become important for complex and specialized operations. Explicitly using `tf.subtract` grants clearer control of the generated graph.

Consider this difference from a performance standpoint, particularly in versions of TensorFlow prior to 2.0, where graph execution was the norm. While both approaches result in a subtraction operation being executed, during graph construction, the automatic overload through `-` could sometimes have subtle performance implications. For instance, complex nested operations relying heavily on `-` might produce a graph that is harder to analyze and optimize. Explicitly utilizing `tf.subtract` facilitates explicit identification of all subtract nodes, potentially enabling targeted optimizations, such as placement on specific devices or customized memory management.

Furthermore, although in modern TensorFlow, the `-` operator and `tf.subtract` function identically in terms of the results they produce and the underlying computations they invoke, a significant difference emerges when considering how they fit within a larger model's architecture. Using `tf.subtract` is more expressive in code. It signals the intention of creating a subtraction operation to a reader more clearly than the overloaded operator could. This can be particularly important when reviewing complex models with several collaborators, ensuring that everyone understands how the computation flows, including the mathematical nature of operations being performed. The explicit call to `tf.subtract` also integrates more smoothly within tools that analyse graph structure to ensure correct behavior and the ability to generate clear visualizations.

Let's move to code examples to illustrate:

**Example 1: Basic Subtraction**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Using the - operator
a = tf.constant([5, 10, 15], dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.float32)
c = a - b
print(c) # Output: tf.Tensor([ 4.  8. 12.], shape=(3,), dtype=float32)

# Using tf.subtract
d = tf.subtract(a, b)
print(d) # Output: tf.Tensor([ 4.  8. 12.], shape=(3,), dtype=float32)

# Using the deprecated tf.sub
e = tf.sub(a, b)
print(e) # Output: tf.Tensor([ 4.  8. 12.], shape=(3,), dtype=float32)
```

In this example, the output of the operation is identical, showing that the operation results in element-wise subtraction in all three cases. From a developer's viewpoint, especially for simple operations like this, there is no performance difference when using either approach within an eager execution context. However, even when running in eager mode, TensorFlow's graph is being constructed behind the scenes. The difference between these two approaches is best shown when working in a functional or graph based manner.

**Example 2: Impact on Graph Construction (Illustrative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def subtract_with_operator(x, y):
  return x - y

@tf.function
def subtract_with_function(x, y):
  return tf.subtract(x, y)


a = tf.constant([5, 10, 15], dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.float32)

# Execute both with the same inputs
op_result = subtract_with_operator(a, b)
func_result = subtract_with_function(a, b)

# Inspecting the concrete functions

print(subtract_with_operator.get_concrete_function(a, b).graph.as_graph_def())
print(subtract_with_function.get_concrete_function(a, b).graph.as_graph_def())
```

This example highlights the difference when tracing the computation graph of a function using `tf.function`. Whilst the output of calling `subtract_with_operator` and `subtract_with_function` is identical, the underlying graph definition will illustrate how different operations are represented in the constructed graph. While the output might be verbose, a careful analysis would reveal, that both functions create an underlying subtraction node. However, by explicitly using `tf.subtract` we achieve greater transparency. This can be more important when debugging complex models. In this scenario, using `@tf.function` is vital, to demonstrate the difference on the computational graph, which is masked during eager execution. While the concrete functions produce similar graphs, the expressiveness of each approach varies as described previously.

**Example 3: Integration within Complex Computation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def complex_computation(x, y):
  intermediate_result = x / 2.0 # Uses the implicit operator
  final_result = tf.subtract(intermediate_result, y) # Uses the explicit function
  return final_result

a = tf.constant([5.0, 10.0, 15.0], dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)

result = complex_computation(a, b)
print(result) # Output: tf.Tensor([1.5 3.  4.5], shape=(3,), dtype=float32)

# Within a compiled function, tf.function
@tf.function
def compiled_complex_computation(x,y):
  intermediate_result = x / 2.0 # Uses the implicit operator
  final_result = tf.subtract(intermediate_result, y) # Uses the explicit function
  return final_result
result = compiled_complex_computation(a, b)
print(result) # Output: tf.Tensor([1.5 3.  4.5], shape=(3,), dtype=float32)
```

In the above example, using both approaches within a single function highlights that they operate interchangeably, but with differences in how the graph is constructed as previously shown in Example 2. In practice, while results are identical, mixing approaches can create inconsistencies in coding style and might make model development and debugging more difficult. However, in the compiled function approach this is mitigated by the abstraction offered by `tf.function`.

For deeper exploration into the nuances of TensorFlow operations, I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically, the API documentation related to `tf.math` for a comprehensive overview of available mathematical functions. It is also beneficial to study code examples from research papers or open-source projects that use TensorFlow, observing how they utilize these operators and functions. Another source of knowledge are the TensorFlow tutorials, focusing on understanding graph mode execution. Reviewing these can provide real-world insights into the best practices of TensorFlow development.
