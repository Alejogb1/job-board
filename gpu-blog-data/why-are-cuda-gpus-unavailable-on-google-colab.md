CUDA-enabled GPUs are not consistently available on Google Colab for PyTorch primarily due to resource allocation policies and the dynamic nature of Colab's infrastructure, not inherent incompatibilities between the technologies themselves. As someone who has spent considerable time optimizing deep learning models within Colab's environment, I've often encountered this frustration firsthand and consequently have a developed understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Google Colab operates on a shared resource model where users are allocated computational resources dynamically based on demand and availability. This means that access to specific hardware, including CUDA GPUs, is not guaranteed and can fluctuate considerably across different sessions and even within the same session. The underlying issue stems from managing a finite number of GPU resources across a large user base.

The core problem isn't PyTorch’s incompatibility with CUDA but the inherent resource management strategies employed by Google. Colab offers various tiers of compute resources, including free and paid options. The free tier, which constitutes the majority of usage, experiences the highest resource variability. GPUs are not always available in this tier and even when allocated, they may not be the desired high-performance models like NVIDIA Tesla P100s or T4s. The allocation process prioritizes users based on various factors that Google keeps proprietary to manage its infrastructure costs and maintain acceptable performance for most users. In essence, Colab's approach is to distribute the available resources, which include a pool of GPUs, among a large user base in a dynamic fashion. Since GPU allocations are not exclusive, they are frequently reassigned or even temporarily disconnected between cells or across sessions to distribute computing power.

PyTorch, being a framework heavily reliant on GPU acceleration for efficient deep learning, suffers when this hardware is not reliably available. While PyTorch can run on CPUs, the performance degradation is often unacceptable for computationally intensive operations, such as training deep neural networks.  The runtime environment of Colab is ephemeral, meaning your virtual machine instance can be reclaimed, leading to GPU disconnections and reallocations. This transient allocation mechanism combined with high demand and a limited number of GPUs, directly impacts the predictability of GPU availability for PyTorch users. There's also a deliberate cap on the amount of free resources given to individual users, preventing one user from dominating the available GPUs.

To better illustrate how users interact with this unpredictable environment, consider these three code scenarios. First, the simplest case where we attempt to verify GPU access:

```python
import torch

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print(f"CUDA is available. Device count: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
    print(f"Current CUDA device: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
    device = torch.device("cuda")
else:
    print("CUDA is not available, using CPU instead.")
    device = torch.device("cpu")


tensor_gpu = torch.randn(100, 100).to(device)
print(f"Tensor is on device: {tensor_gpu.device}")

```

This code snippet first checks if CUDA is available, prints the number of devices, current device name and creates a random tensor on that device. The output fluctuates based on whether a GPU has been allocated.  Sometimes it will show device count is one and a name, sometimes it will show 'CUDA is not available' and the tensor on CPU.  This highlights that GPU availability is not guaranteed by using PyTorch's check. We cannot rely on these simple checks to guarantee GPU usage.

Next, consider a scenario in a training loop that is dependent on a GPU.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Check CUDA availability
if torch.cuda.is_available():
  device = torch.device("cuda")
else:
    device = torch.device("cpu")
    print("CUDA not available. Running on CPU.")

# Dummy model and data
model = nn.Linear(10, 2).to(device)
data = torch.randn(100, 10).to(device)
target = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,)).to(device)


optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr = 0.01)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Training Loop
num_epochs = 3
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  output = model(data)
  loss = criterion(output, target)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()
  print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This code creates a simple linear model, places it and training data on the specified device (CUDA if available, CPU otherwise), and runs a small training loop. If a GPU is available, training is significantly faster. However, if the Colab runtime session loses its GPU allocation mid-run or restarts with no GPU, this training loop may slow down severely. The code is written to accommodate CPU execution, but this does not solve the original problem of GPU unavailability when it is desired.  It just avoids an outright error.

Finally, consider a case that includes a simple model definition:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import time

class SimpleClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):
        super(SimpleClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Check CUDA availability
if torch.cuda.is_available():
  device = torch.device("cuda")
else:
  device = torch.device("cpu")
  print("CUDA not available. Running on CPU.")

# Model, data and optimizer
input_size = 784
hidden_size = 128
num_classes = 10

model = SimpleClassifier(input_size, hidden_size, num_classes).to(device)
data = torch.randn(64, input_size).to(device)
target = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (64,)).to(device)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr = 0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Start Training Loop
num_epochs = 20
start = time.time()

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  output = model(data)
  loss = criterion(output, target)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()
  if (epoch + 1) % 5 == 0 :
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

end = time.time()

print(f"Training took {end - start:.2f} seconds.")
```

This example extends the previous one by introducing a custom model, timing the process, and printing the loss every 5 epochs. When a GPU is available, the 'Training took' measurement should be significantly lower. Again, the unreliability of the GPU availability will affect the reported speed. The user has no control over Colab’s allocation decisions which lead to inconsistent performance. This illustrates how a user can write PyTorch code that functions on both CPU and GPU but is subject to Google’s allocation policy making performance unpredictable.

In summary, while PyTorch is fully compatible with CUDA and can leverage GPUs if they are available, the unreliable GPU access in Google Colab stems primarily from the shared and dynamic resource allocation policies employed by Google to manage their infrastructure. PyTorch code can be written to gracefully handle the absence of a GPU, but it cannot solve the problem of the sporadic allocation decisions of Google Colab, nor the resultant variable performance. There are practical steps a user can take to increase GPU allocation frequency within Colab (such as using the paid tier), but no method will give guaranteed access.

For further understanding of Colab's resource management and PyTorch's utilization of GPUs, research papers related to cloud computing and virtualized environments would be beneficial.  Consult PyTorch's official documentation for specifics on CUDA and device management within the framework. Also, the user forums for Google Colab offer insights into the user's real-world experiences and mitigation strategies which can be invaluable.
