My experience working on a mobile rendering engine for the past five years has repeatedly thrown me into the trenches of texture management, particularly dealing with compressed formats. I've directly observed that while `glCompressedTexImage2D` itself isn't inherently slow *solely* due to using ASTC, performance bottlenecks often stem from related factors, notably how the data being fed into the function is prepared and handled. It's a nuanced performance puzzle.

The core issue with considering `glCompressedTexImage2D` "slow" for ASTC lies not within the OpenGL ES driver's implementation of the function, but in the overall pipeline from texture data creation to its upload to the GPU. `glCompressedTexImage2D` directly uploads a compressed buffer; thus, it avoids the potentially expensive real-time compression that would occur with `glTexImage2D` using uncompressed data and `GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_ASTC_*` as the internal format. The potential slowness I've encountered primarily relates to inefficiencies around the *preparation* of the ASTC compressed data, and how this compressed data interacts with system memory. If we have a large ASTC texture, and we must copy it several times before handing it off to `glCompressedTexImage2D`, the cumulative performance cost becomes significant.

To detail, consider that ASTC compression is a relatively complex, multi-pass algorithm. While we may think of simply dropping a raw image into an encoder, encoding time can vary significantly based on the selected profile and quality settings, resulting in considerable processing on the CPU. Further, the compressed result may not always be immediately suitable for direct transfer to the GPU. Buffers created through libraries, or obtained after file loading, might require intermediate transformations before they’re in a format `glCompressedTexImage2D` can consume efficiently. This is especially true with custom or third-party compression tools. Data can be stored in CPU memory in a way not optimal for GPU transfer, causing extra work within the driver when the compressed data arrives.

Here's an example of where I've seen overhead issues. Suppose we are loading an ASTC-compressed texture from disk, and the compressed data is stored in a structure like a `std::vector` which has internal reallocations as the file is being read in segments:

```cpp
// Example 1: Inefficient memory copy during loading
std::vector<char> compressedData;
// ... read from file into the vector, potentially with reallocations
glCompressedTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_ASTC_8x8_KHR, width, height, 0, compressedData.size(), compressedData.data());
```

In this initial scenario, even though the final compressed data itself is what is intended for the GPU, the process of reading and resizing the `std::vector` potentially induces numerous memory allocations and copies before the final `glCompressedTexImage2D` call. This intermediate work impacts performance, not `glCompressedTexImage2D` itself. The crucial point here is that the cost isn't the upload, but the data wrangling prior to that point.

A slightly better, but not ideal approach could involve a fixed-size pre-allocated buffer that is then filled from the disk file:

```cpp
// Example 2: Pre-allocated buffer, but not optimal for transfer
char* compressedData = new char[compressedSize];
// ... read from file directly into the pre-allocated buffer
glCompressedTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_ASTC_8x8_KHR, width, height, 0, compressedSize, compressedData);
delete[] compressedData; // Don't forget to clean up later.
```

While this avoids resizing, it still involves a copy of the entire buffer from the disk, through the filesystem layer, and then into the GPU-accessible memory.  Further, the way the buffer is allocated might lead to potential stalls if it's not optimally placed relative to the GPU.

A significantly more performant approach is to utilize a memory-mapping mechanism, where possible, and ensure a direct transfer:

```cpp
// Example 3: Direct mapping and optimized data transfer. (Pseudo-Code)
// Assume some API maps the file directly in memory.
MappedMemoryRegion mappedData = mapFileToMemory("texture.astc");
glCompressedTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_ASTC_8x8_KHR, width, height, 0, mappedData.size, mappedData.data);
unmapMemoryRegion(mappedData);
```

In this last example, we bypass the intermediate copy, loading the texture data directly from the memory-mapped file region. This is more aligned with the way the graphics hardware operates. We only move the data during the final `glCompressedTexImage2D` call, maximizing data transfer efficiency. The driver still might do internal data movement if the mapped memory is not in the optimal location for GPU consumption, but this is an internal driver detail that is usually well optimized.

It's also worth noting that the specific ASTC block size (e.g., 8x8, 6x6, etc.) selected during encoding can influence the compression ratio, but, critically, doesn't impact the upload time as the same compressed byte data, representing that block, is what’s transferred. Some block sizes can achieve greater compression but might require more processing during encoding.

Further considerations that I've found important to avoid what appears as `glCompressedTexImage2D` being slow are: ensuring the texture is a power-of-two when using mipmaps, and that proper texture minification and magnification filters are in use. Mismatches can force driver fallbacks to uncompressed paths with lower performance. The upload process can be slower if the data is being passed across process boundaries or when the texture object's state is not in a pre-created, well-defined state. Pre-creating texture objects when possible can also reduce the overhead of setting up the texture parameters each frame.

In summary, I've not found `glCompressedTexImage2D` to be the source of slowdown. It's a wrapper around the process of directly copying data from the CPU to the GPU. Any perceived slowness typically relates to the overhead of preparing the data to be transferred, inefficient memory allocation, and copies, and incorrect pipeline setup. Ensuring efficient memory management, using memory-mapping when appropriate, and understanding the correct use of texture parameters, along with pre-creating texture objects, all contribute greatly to the performance of texture uploads and, therefore, to the smoothness of your rendering. The performance of `glCompressedTexImage2D` itself, when used with already well-prepared compressed data, is typically not the problem. The core responsibility resides in having a carefully orchestrated memory pipeline for optimal texture processing.

For further information, I'd recommend reviewing the documentation for OpenGL ES, reading publications on GPU optimization, and exploring materials on memory management. These resources will offer further insights into the complexities of GPU texture handling and will be invaluable for anyone wanting to optimize their rendering pipeline.
