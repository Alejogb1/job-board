The specific error messages, “InvalidArgumentError:  Matrix matmul: Input tensors must have the same type” and “ValueError: Shape must be rank 2 but is rank 1 for Add”, strongly indicate a mismatch in tensor data types and dimensionality within your TensorFlow model’s computational graph during training. These are common issues, stemming often from a combination of implicit type conversions, mishandled input data, and incorrect layer configurations. Based on my experience debugging similar problems, these errors frequently arise during the forward propagation phase where the model computes output from input data. They signal a fundamental incompatibility preventing the required operations from executing.

The “InvalidArgumentError:  Matrix matmul: Input tensors must have the same type” typically surfaces when a matrix multiplication operation is attempted between tensors of differing data types—for instance, a float32 tensor and an int64 tensor. TensorFlow is explicit about data type consistency in matrix math; it does not perform implicit type conversions in these cases. This error commonly results from input data that has not been explicitly cast to the expected data type of the model's layers or parameters. When loading data, especially from external sources, TensorFlow may infer data types based on the contents, and these may not align with how the model was designed to operate. The mismatch can also occur deeper within your model architecture, possibly as an output from a custom layer or an improperly specified operation. The key takeaway is that the matrices being multiplied need to be of precisely the same data type before the `tf.matmul` operation can succeed.

The “ValueError: Shape must be rank 2 but is rank 1 for Add” points to a shape mismatch during an addition operation.  Specifically, TensorFlow's element-wise addition operations, including `tf.add`, require that the tensors involved either have identical shapes or can be broadcast to a compatible shape. A rank 2 tensor, effectively a matrix, is being added to a rank 1 tensor, effectively a vector, without this being properly resolved by broadcasting or reshaping. This issue usually originates from incorrect reshaping of tensors, or from passing tensors with unexpected dimensionality into layers requiring a matrix as input. For example, a common mistake is to pass a flattened input vector, which results in a rank 1 tensor, to a fully connected layer that requires a rank 2 tensor representing a batch of feature vectors.  The fix requires ensuring that all relevant inputs are rank 2 (or appropriate for broadcasting).  It also means reviewing the network architecture itself to locate the specific `Add` operation causing the issue. A careful examination of the tensors involved—their shapes, and how they flow through the network—is critical to troubleshooting this error effectively.

Below, I've provided three code snippets, each demonstrating how these errors may occur and how they can be addressed, along with accompanying commentary.

**Example 1: Data Type Mismatch in Matrix Multiplication**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect data types leading to "InvalidArgumentError"
input_data_int = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=tf.int64)
weights_float = tf.Variable([[0.5, 0.2], [0.1, 0.9]], dtype=tf.float32)

try:
    output = tf.matmul(input_data_int, weights_float)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
  print(f"Error Detected: {e}")

# Correcting the data type mismatch.
input_data_float = tf.cast(input_data_int, tf.float32)
output_corrected = tf.matmul(input_data_float, weights_float)
print(f"Corrected Output Shape: {output_corrected.shape}")

```

*Commentary:* In this example, the initial attempt at matrix multiplication fails due to differing data types (`tf.int64` and `tf.float32`). The exception is caught and printed.  The error is then resolved by casting the `input_data_int` tensor to `tf.float32` using `tf.cast`, ensuring data type consistency for the matrix multiplication.  This corrected approach allows the matrix multiplication to proceed successfully, as evidenced by the shape of the output tensor. This reinforces the need to explicitly define or cast data types to avoid inconsistencies, especially when mixing different source data.

**Example 2:  Rank Mismatch in Addition Operation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect shape for addition: rank 1 added to rank 2 resulting in "ValueError"
input_matrix = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=tf.float32)
bias_vector = tf.constant([0.1, 0.2], dtype=tf.float32)

try:
  output = tf.add(input_matrix, bias_vector)
except ValueError as e:
   print(f"Error Detected: {e}")


# Correcting shape mismatch using tf.expand_dims
bias_vector_expanded = tf.expand_dims(bias_vector, axis=0)  # Now rank 2
output_corrected = tf.add(input_matrix, bias_vector_expanded)
print(f"Corrected Output Shape: {output_corrected.shape}")

```

*Commentary:* The original code demonstrates a `ValueError` because `bias_vector`, a rank 1 tensor, is directly added to `input_matrix`, a rank 2 tensor. TensorFlow's `tf.add` operation requires compatible shapes (after broadcasting).  To fix it, we use `tf.expand_dims` to reshape `bias_vector` into a rank 2 tensor (shape [1,2]) making its shape compatible with that of `input_matrix`, before broadcasting can happen during addition. The resulting shape of the output then demonstrates that the addition is successful following this shape change. This illustrates that shape manipulation through functions like `tf.expand_dims` or `tf.reshape` is essential for aligning tensors during operations.

**Example 3: Incorrectly Flattened Layer Output**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Simulate an improperly flattened layer output that is then passed into a Dense layer
input_tensor = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]], dtype=tf.float32)
flat_output = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [-1])  # Intended to flatten to a rank 1 tensor

# Dense Layer expecting rank 2 tensor, producing an error when passed a rank 1 tensor
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

try:
  output = dense_layer(flat_output)
except ValueError as e:
  print(f"Error Detected: {e}")


# Corrected usage using a correctly formed batch of data
flat_output_rank_2 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, [input_tensor.shape[0], -1])
output_corrected = dense_layer(flat_output_rank_2)
print(f"Corrected Output Shape: {output_corrected.shape}")

```
*Commentary:* Here, we simulate a scenario where a tensor is incorrectly flattened, resulting in a rank 1 tensor `flat_output`, instead of a batch of feature vectors.  The `Dense` layer expects a rank 2 tensor, therefore throws an error because it is expecting a rank 2 tensor input representing a batch of feature vectors. The resolution is to ensure we retain the batch dimension by reshaping the flattened tensor into `flat_output_rank_2` retaining a rank 2 tensor shape before passing into the `Dense` layer. By correctly reshaping and retaining the batch dimension in the data entering the Dense layer, we produce a valid output and resolve the shape error.  This illustrates how crucial it is to track tensor shapes throughout your model, particularly when handling outputs of flattening or reshaping layers.

To further improve debugging and prevent such errors, I recommend using these practices:

1.  **Explicit Data Type Definitions**: When loading or creating tensors, explicitly define their data types using the `dtype` argument in functions like `tf.constant`, `tf.Variable`, and `tf.cast`.  Avoid relying on TensorFlow's default type inference.
2.  **Shape Inspections**: During debugging, frequently print tensor shapes via `tf.shape(tensor)` at various points within your model. This is especially helpful around layers or operations causing issues. Tools like TensorBoard can also assist here.
3.  **Input Data Validation:** Always validate your input data for both data type and shape before feeding it into the model, particularly if dealing with data from external sources. Introduce defensive programming and sanity checks.
4. **Model Visualization:** Visualise the model graph using Tensorboard's graph feature. This can help identify where these type and shape errors occur and can allow you to trace the flow of data through your network.

Referencing the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on tensor manipulation and data type conversion, is also very helpful for deepening your understanding. Consider reviewing TensorFlow tutorials that involve similar network architectures or data loading procedures. Also, the TensorFlow guide on Debugging TensorFlow Models will provide best practices on identifying the root causes of issues like this. By combining these techniques, you'll be better equipped to both diagnose and correct data type and dimensionality mismatches.
