The discrepancy in tensor order between hidden state tensors and returned tensors in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) often stems from the inherent design choices concerning time-major versus batch-major ordering and the specific needs of both the recurrent computation and the output generation.  My experience building and optimizing LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence models for natural language processing has highlighted this repeatedly.  The choice fundamentally affects computational efficiency and memory management.

**1. Explanation:**

RNNs process sequences sequentially. Each timestep's input contributes to an updated hidden state, encapsulating the information from the sequence up to that point.  However, the final output may not directly correspond to the *final* hidden state. The arrangement of tensors, often in either batch-major or time-major format, directly impacts how this information is structured.

Batch-major ordering prioritizes handling batches of sequences concurrently.  Each batch element represents a single sequence.  The tensor dimensions usually follow the order: `[batch_size, timesteps, features]`. Conversely, time-major ordering prioritizes processing timesteps. The dimensions typically appear as `[timesteps, batch_size, features]`.  The choice influences the optimal memory access patterns during training.

The hidden state, typically updated recursively at each timestep, maintains information across the sequence.  The nature of this state often necessitates a specific ordering to efficiently integrate new input data at each timestep.  Consider an LSTM; its internal gates (input, forget, output) operate on the concatenation of the current input and the *previous* hidden state.  A time-major format aligns perfectly with this sequential update because the previous hidden state is readily available in memory due to sequential processing.

However, the desired output might be a sequence of predictions (e.g., next word in a text generation task), or a single summary vector (e.g., sentiment classification of a whole sentence).  In the former, the output tensor mirrors the input sequence length, potentially adopting a batch-major structure for efficiency in parallelization during prediction or training. The final hidden state, while potentially informative, isn't necessarily the direct output for each timestep, instead serving as a context for generating the output sequence.  This divergence explains the differing orders.

In the latter (single summary vector case), the final hidden state itself *might* be the output, but the dimensions would still differ from the sequence of hidden states that constitute the internal computation.  The sequence of hidden states remains time-major (or batch-major) for computational reasons, while the final output is a single vector.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate these concepts using a fictionalized Keras-like API, focusing on the structural aspects rather than complete model definitions.

**Example 1: Time-major hidden state, batch-major output:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Fictional Keras-like API
class RNNLayer:
    def __init__(self, units):
        self.units = units

    def __call__(self, inputs):
        # Simulates RNN computation; hidden_states is time-major
        hidden_states = np.random.rand(inputs.shape[1], inputs.shape[0], self.units)
        # Output is batch-major for ease of subsequent processing
        outputs = np.random.rand(inputs.shape[0], inputs.shape[1], self.units)
        return outputs, hidden_states

# Example usage
batch_size = 32
timesteps = 10
input_dim = 50
rnn_layer = RNNLayer(units=100)

inputs = np.random.rand(batch_size, timesteps, input_dim)
outputs, hidden_states = rnn_layer(inputs)

print("Outputs shape:", outputs.shape)  # (32, 10, 100) - batch-major
print("Hidden states shape:", hidden_states.shape)  # (10, 32, 100) - time-major
```

**Commentary:** This demonstrates a scenario where the output tensor is batch-major, while the hidden state tensor maintains a time-major structure.  This might be typical for sequence-to-sequence tasks where efficient batch processing of the output is desired.

**Example 2: Batch-major hidden states, batch-major output:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Fictional Keras-like API (modified)
class RNNLayer:
    def __init__(self, units):
        self.units = units

    def __call__(self, inputs):
        # Simulates RNN computation; hidden_states is batch-major
        hidden_states = np.random.rand(inputs.shape[0], inputs.shape[1], self.units)
        # Output is also batch-major for consistency
        outputs = np.random.rand(inputs.shape[0], inputs.shape[1], self.units)
        return outputs, hidden_states

# Example usage (same input as before)
outputs, hidden_states = rnn_layer(inputs)

print("Outputs shape:", outputs.shape)  # (32, 10, 100) - batch-major
print("Hidden states shape:", hidden_states.shape)  # (32, 10, 100) - batch-major

```

**Commentary:** This example illustrates a scenario where both the output and hidden state tensors follow batch-major ordering.  While feasible, this may not always be the most computationally efficient approach, particularly for longer sequences.

**Example 3:  Time-major hidden states, single vector output:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Fictional Keras-like API (modified)
class RNNLayer:
    def __init__(self, units):
        self.units = units

    def __call__(self, inputs):
        # Simulates RNN computation; hidden_states is time-major
        hidden_states = np.random.rand(inputs.shape[1], inputs.shape[0], self.units)
        # Output is a single vector (final hidden state)
        outputs = np.random.rand(inputs.shape[0], self.units) #Takes final state from hidden_states, but this is omitted for brevity
        return outputs, hidden_states

# Example usage (same input as before)
outputs, hidden_states = rnn_layer(inputs)

print("Outputs shape:", outputs.shape)  # (32, 100) - single vector
print("Hidden states shape:", hidden_states.shape)  # (10, 32, 100) - time-major
```


**Commentary:**  Here, the output is a single vector representing a summary (e.g., the final hidden state), while the internal hidden states are maintained in a time-major format.  This is common in tasks like sentiment analysis where a single classification is desired from the entire input sequence.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   A comprehensive textbook on deep learning.  Focus on the chapters covering recurrent neural networks and sequence processing.  Pay close attention to sections detailing the computational aspects of various RNN architectures.
*   Advanced tutorials focusing on the implementation details of RNNs using popular deep learning frameworks. Look for material specifically covering tensor manipulation and performance optimization.
*   Research papers on optimized RNN implementations and memory-efficient training techniques for long sequences. These papers often delve into the intricacies of tensor ordering and their impact on performance.


In summary, the seemingly arbitrary difference in tensor order between hidden states and output tensors in RNNs is a direct consequence of design choices made to optimize either computational efficiency or the specific output format required by the task. Understanding these design choices is critical for effectively building and optimizing RNN-based models.  The examples provided illustrate the diversity of these design choices and their impact on the final tensor shapes.
