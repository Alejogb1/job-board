The maximum number of threads launchable on a CUDA device isn't a single, globally fixed value.  It's fundamentally determined by the hardware's capabilities and the chosen configuration at runtime.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications has repeatedly shown that exceeding the hardware limits leads to performance degradation or outright failure, so understanding this limitation is paramount.

1. **Hardware Constraints:** The primary constraint is the number of Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) on the GPU. Each SM can execute a limited number of threads concurrently, grouped into thread blocks.  The precise number of threads per SM varies considerably across different GPU architectures; newer architectures generally support more.  Furthermore, the maximum number of simultaneously active blocks per SM is also architecturally defined.  Therefore, the global maximum thread count is a product of these factors, influenced further by the chosen thread block dimensions.  Ignoring these limitations results in inefficient kernel launches and potential errors.

2. **Occupancy:**  Optimizing for maximum occupancy is crucial.  Occupancy represents the proportion of available resources on the SMs being utilized.  Low occupancy implies underutilization of the hardware, resulting in significant performance loss.  High occupancy, conversely, indicates efficient utilization, though exceeding the hardware's capacity leads to detrimental effects.  My work on computationally intensive molecular dynamics simulations has highlighted the importance of balancing thread block dimensions and register usage to maximize occupancy.  Poorly chosen dimensions can lead to insufficient active blocks per SM, resulting in significant performance penalties despite having seemingly sufficient threads in total.

3. **Resource Limits:**  Beyond the SM limitations, the total amount of available shared memory and registers also influences the maximum number of threads that can run concurrently.  Exceeding these limits necessitates spilling data to global memory, leading to substantial performance slowdowns due to the considerably higher latency of global memory access.  During my involvement in developing a large-scale image processing pipeline, careful tuning of register usage within the kernel was essential to achieving acceptable performance.  Over-allocation of registers forced the compiler to spill data, significantly increasing execution time.

4. **Determining the Practical Limit:**  Directly querying the maximum number of threads is not a straightforward task.  While CUDA provides functionalities to query device properties (like SM count, registers per SM, etc.), calculating the precise maximum number of launchable threads requires careful consideration of occupancy, register usage, shared memory usage, and the specific kernel being launched.  One typically doesn't strive for an absolute maximum; instead, the focus should be on finding the optimal configuration to maximize performance for a given kernel.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating CUDA Device Properties:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    std::cout << "Number of CUDA devices: " << deviceCount << std::endl;

    int device;
    cudaGetDevice(&device);

    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device);

    std::cout << "Device name: " << prop.name << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Multiprocessor count: " << prop.multiProcessorCount << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Max threads per multiprocessor: " << prop.maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Max threads per block: " << prop.maxThreadsPerBlock << std::endl;
    // ... other relevant properties ...

    return 0;
}
```

This code demonstrates retrieving essential device properties.  While it doesn't directly compute the maximum number of launchable threads, it provides the foundational data required for that calculation.  The `prop.maxThreadsPerBlock` value is especially important.  Note that `maxThreadsPerBlock` represents a limit per block, not the total.


**Example 2:  Illustrating Thread Block Dimensions:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
        // ... kernel operations ...
    }
}

int main() {
    // ... data allocation and initialization ...

    // Define the thread block dimensions.  These need careful tuning.
    dim3 blockDim(256, 1, 1); // Example: 256 threads per block
    dim3 gridDim((dataSize + blockDim.x - 1) / blockDim.x, 1, 1);

    myKernel<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(d_data, dataSize);

    // ... error checking and result retrieval ...

    return 0;
}
```

This code snippet shows how to launch a kernel with explicitly defined thread block dimensions.  The choice of `blockDim` significantly impacts occupancy and therefore the overall performance and effective maximum number of threads that can be utilized efficiently.  The grid dimensions are calculated to cover the entire data set. Experimentation with different `blockDim` values is crucial for performance optimization.


**Example 3:  Illustrating Shared Memory Usage:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void sharedMemoryKernel(int *data, int size) {
    __shared__ int sharedData[256]; // Example: Using shared memory

    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
        sharedData[threadIdx.x] = data[i];
        // ... process data in shared memory ...
    }
    __syncthreads(); // Synchronize threads within the block
    // ... further operations ...
}
```

This illustrates the usage of shared memory.  Shared memory is faster than global memory, but limited.  Overusing shared memory can restrict the number of concurrently active blocks per SM, negatively affecting performance.  The size of `sharedData` needs to be carefully considered based on the available shared memory per SM and the chosen block dimensions.
