Precise performance measurement of C and CUDA code necessitates a nuanced approach beyond simple system timers.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications has shown that the inherent differences in execution environments—single-threaded CPU versus massively parallel GPU—require specialized tools that account for kernel launch overhead, data transfer times, and variations in GPU occupancy.  Relying solely on standard `gettimeofday` or `clock()` functions will yield inaccurate and misleading results.

The most appropriate choice for measuring performance differences is a combination of tools: the NVIDIA profiling tools (nvprof and Nsight Compute) coupled with carefully designed benchmark code.  These tools offer detailed insights into kernel execution time, memory access patterns, and other critical performance bottlenecks, providing a more complete picture than general-purpose timers.  Standard system timers, while useful for measuring overall application runtime, are insufficient for isolating the performance of individual CUDA kernels within the context of a larger application.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Accurate performance comparison demands isolating the CUDA kernel execution time from other factors.  A naive approach involving only system timers would confound kernel execution time with data transfers between host (CPU) and device (GPU) memory. These transfers, often significantly impacting overall runtime, are not representative of the kernel's intrinsic performance. Therefore, we must utilize profiling tools to measure solely the kernel execution time on the GPU.

Furthermore, kernel performance is inherently affected by GPU occupancy, which is dependent on the number of threads, blocks, and the kernel's memory access patterns. Therefore, to ensure fair comparisons, benchmarking must be performed across a range of parameters to identify potential performance bottlenecks arising from suboptimal configurations.  Finally, the benchmarking environment itself must be consistent, ensuring minimal background processes or interference that could skew results.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different approaches, progressing from naive to more sophisticated methods.  All examples assume a basic understanding of CUDA programming.

**Example 1: Naive Approach (using `clock()` - Incorrect)**

```c++
#include <time.h>
#include <cuda.h>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int N) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        data[i] *= 2;
    }
}

int main() {
    int N = 1024 * 1024;
    int *h_data, *d_data;
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_data, N * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, N * sizeof(int));

    // Initialize h_data
    // ...

    clock_t start = clock();
    cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, N * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    myKernel<<<(N + 255) / 256, 256>>>(d_data, N);
    cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, N * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    clock_t end = clock();

    double time_taken = (double)(end - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    printf("Time taken: %f seconds\n", time_taken);

    // ... clean up ...

    return 0;
}
```

This approach is flawed because it measures the entire process, including data transfers, which dominate the timing for smaller datasets.  It does not accurately reflect the kernel's execution time.

**Example 2:  Improved Approach (using CUDA events - Better)**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int N) {
  // ... kernel code ...
}

int main() {
    // ... memory allocation and data initialization ...

    cudaEvent_t start, stop;
    cudaEventCreate(&start);
    cudaEventCreate(&stop);

    cudaEventRecord(start, 0);
    myKernel<<<(N + 255) / 256, 256>>>(d_data, N);
    cudaEventRecord(stop, 0);
    cudaEventSynchronize(stop);

    float milliseconds = 0;
    cudaEventElapsedTime(&milliseconds, start, stop);
    printf("Kernel execution time: %f milliseconds\n", milliseconds);

    // ... cleanup ...

    return 0;
}
```

This example uses CUDA events to precisely time the kernel execution.  `cudaEventRecord` marks the start and end points, and `cudaEventElapsedTime` calculates the elapsed time.  This is a significant improvement over the naive approach, but still lacks detailed profiling capabilities.

**Example 3:  Advanced Approach (using nvprof - Best)**

This example doesn't include code, but instead demonstrates the usage of `nvprof`.  Run your CUDA application with `nvprof` as follows: `nvprof ./my_cuda_application`.  This command will generate a detailed report including kernel execution time, memory transfers, occupancy, and other crucial metrics.  This provides a far more comprehensive analysis than the previous methods and offers granular insights into performance bottlenecks.  Nsight Compute provides a more visual and interactive environment for analyzing this profiling data.

CUDA C++ Programming Guide.  CUDA Best Practices Guide.  NVIDIA Nsight Compute User Guide.  NVIDIA Nsight Systems User Guide.  High-Performance Computing (HPC) textbooks focusing on parallel programming and GPU acceleration.


In conclusion, while CUDA events provide a more accurate measurement of kernel execution time compared to standard system timers, the most comprehensive approach for comparing C and CUDA code performance involves leveraging the NVIDIA profiling tools (nvprof and Nsight Compute).  These tools offer detailed insights into various performance aspects, allowing for a more informed and accurate assessment of performance differences between CPU and GPU implementations.  Combining these tools with carefully constructed benchmarks is crucial for obtaining reliable and meaningful results.  Neglecting these nuances can lead to erroneous conclusions and hinder the optimization process.  The provided code examples and recommended resources are intended to facilitate this process.
