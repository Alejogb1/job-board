Saving and loading Keras subclassed models requires a nuanced approach compared to the simpler `model.save()` method used with models built using the sequential or functional APIs.  This stems from the inherent flexibility of subclassed models, where the model architecture is defined within a custom class, leading to a less standardized serialization process.  My experience debugging large-scale image recognition projects underscored this point, forcing me to delve into the intricacies of saving custom model architectures and weights.  The key is to leverage the `save_weights` and `load_weights` methods in conjunction with a separate mechanism to store the model architecture definition.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras subclassed models do not directly support the `model.save()` method for saving the entire model architecture and weights in a single file.  This is because the model structure isn't implicitly represented as a graph; it's defined dynamically within the class's `__init__` and `call` methods. Therefore, a two-step process is required:

* **Saving:** First, the model's weights are saved using `model.save_weights()`. This saves only the numerical parameters learned during training.  Second, the model architecture needs to be saved separately.  This can be accomplished using various methods, including saving the class definition itself (as source code), or utilizing a serialization library like Pickle for more complex scenarios involving custom layers or other non-standard components.

* **Loading:** The loading process reverses this. The model architecture is reconstructed (by loading the class definition or deserializing it), and then the saved weights are loaded using `model.load_weights()`. The model is now ready for inference or further training.  Crucially, the loaded model must have an architecture that precisely mirrors the saved weights.  Any mismatch in layer shapes or types will lead to errors.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Subclassed Model with `save_weights` and `load_weights` (using `pickle`):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pickle

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)

model = MyModel()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

#Dummy training
model.fit([[1,2,3]], [[4,5,6]], epochs=1)

# Save weights and architecture
model.save_weights('my_model_weights.h5')
with open('my_model_arch.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(MyModel, f)  #Saving the class definition.


# Load architecture and weights
with open('my_model_arch.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    loaded_model_class = pickle.load(f)
loaded_model = loaded_model_class()
loaded_model.load_weights('my_model_weights.h5')

#Verify load
print(loaded_model.predict([[1,2,3]]))
```

This example demonstrates the basic principle.  Pickling the class itself is sufficient for simple models.  However, for more complex models with custom layers, this may not suffice.

**Example 2: Handling Custom Layers (using a configuration dictionary):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import json

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
      return tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(inputs, self.w))


class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.custom_layer = MyCustomLayer(32)
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.custom_layer(inputs)
        return self.dense(x)

model = MyModel()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit([[1,2,3]], [[4,5,6]], epochs=1)


# Save weights and configuration
model.save_weights('my_model_weights.h5')

config = {'layers': [{'type': 'MyCustomLayer', 'units': 32}, {'type': 'Dense', 'units': 10}]}

with open('model_config.json', 'w') as f:
  json.dump(config, f)

# Load configuration and weights
with open('model_config.json', 'r') as f:
    config = json.load(f)

loaded_model = MyModel()  #Need to reconstruct

loaded_model.load_weights('my_model_weights.h5')
```

Here, instead of pickling the entire class, a JSON configuration describes the architecture, allowing for more robust reconstruction, particularly useful when dealing with custom layers.  The model reconstruction involves instantiating the correct classes based on the JSON configuration.


**Example 3:  More Robust Architecture Serialization (using a custom function):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def model_from_config(config):
    #Config is a dictionary representing your layer architecture.
    model = tf.keras.Sequential()
    for layer_config in config:
        layer_type = layer_config['type']
        if layer_type == 'Dense':
            model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(**layer_config['kwargs']))
        elif layer_type == 'Conv2D':
            model.add(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(**layer_config['kwargs']))
        #add other layer types as needed
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported layer type: {layer_type}")
    return model


# Example usage within a subclassed model (simplified for brevity)

class MySubclassedModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = model_from_config(config)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.model(inputs)

# Define a model configuration
model_config = [
  {'type': 'Dense', 'kwargs': {'units': 64, 'activation': 'relu'}},
  {'type': 'Dense', 'kwargs': {'units': 10}}
]

model = MySubclassedModel(model_config)

# ... (training and saving weights as before) ...

# Loading:
loaded_model = MySubclassedModel(model_config)
loaded_model.load_weights('my_model_weights.h5')

```

This example demonstrates a more sophisticated approach.  A separate function `model_from_config` reads a configuration, dynamically building the model. This method significantly improves modularity and maintainability, especially for larger and more complex models, enabling greater control over the serialization and reconstruction process.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on Keras is invaluable.  Explore the sections detailing model saving and loading, custom layers, and the Keras functional API for a comprehensive understanding. Pay close attention to the details of using `save_weights` and `load_weights`.  Furthermore, consider reviewing advanced Python serialization techniques, focusing on the trade-offs and best practices of using tools like Pickle and JSON for various data structures, including complex nested objects.  Finally, studying examples of custom Keras layers and exploring different model architectures can strengthen your grasp of the underlying principles.
