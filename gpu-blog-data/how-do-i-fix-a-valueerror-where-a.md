The core of this problem resides in a mismatch between the input shape expected by a Keras model's first layer and the actual shape of the data you're feeding it. Specifically, a `ValueError` arising from expecting a 2D array but receiving a 3D one generally points to issues with data preprocessing or model architecture. I encountered this regularly during the development of a time-series prediction model for stock prices, where accidentally retaining temporal dimensions caused exactly this issue.

Let's break down why this error occurs and how to resolve it. Keras, by design, requires consistent shape alignment throughout its layers.  A 2D array typically represents a collection of samples, where each sample is a vector of features (e.g., a batch of images, after flattening, could be described as [batch_size, flattened_image_dimensions]). A 3D array, on the other hand, introduces an extra dimension, often representing time steps in sequential data, multiple channels in an image (RGB), or some other multi-dimensional characteristic of each sample (e.g. [batch_size, time_steps, feature_dimensions]). When a layer expecting 2D data receives 3D data, the shape mismatch will manifest as a ValueError.

The simplest scenario is when you are feeding a batch of sequences to a model designed for independent samples. For instance, a fully connected (`Dense`) layer, typically the first layer in a basic classifier or regressor, operates on 2D matrices. It cannot understand sequences or multi-channel information in the 3rd dimension. To rectify this, you must either reshape your data or modify the model architecture. The chosen approach will depend heavily on your task.

**Reshaping the data**

The easiest fix, assuming your model *should* receive 2D data, is to flatten the input's 3D shape to 2D. This is suitable when you want to disregard the sequential or other multi-dimensional structure in the data, essentially treating all individual time steps as distinct feature vectors. We can accomplish this using `numpy.reshape()`.  Consider a scenario where you've prepared your data as a 3D array: `[num_samples, time_steps, num_features]`. If your model expects the input to be 2D in the format of `[num_samples, flattened_features]`, then you can flatten your data into the desired format before feeding it to the model.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Example 3D input data: [batch_size, time_steps, num_features]
num_samples = 100
time_steps = 20
num_features = 5
data_3d = np.random.rand(num_samples, time_steps, num_features)

# Reshape to 2D: [num_samples, time_steps * num_features]
reshaped_data_2d = data_3d.reshape(num_samples, time_steps * num_features)

# A basic model expecting a 2D input
input_shape = (time_steps * num_features,)
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=input_shape),
    layers.Dense(32, activation="relu"),
    layers.Dense(1)
])

# Successfully train with the reshaped 2D data
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="mse")
model.fit(reshaped_data_2d, np.random.rand(num_samples, 1), epochs=2)


print(f"Shape of the reshaped data: {reshaped_data_2d.shape}")

```

Here, we first create the example 3D dataset. Then the critical line is the `.reshape()` method. The flattened size calculates to `time_steps * num_features`, so this operation transforms a single sample, previously with shape `(time_steps, num_features)` into a flat array of shape `(time_steps * num_features,)`. The `num_samples` dimension remains unaffected during flattening. The model expects input shape which we specified as a tuple, and since our reshaped data has correct dimensions, the training proceeds correctly.

**Adjusting the Model Architecture**

Alternatively, when the sequential nature of the data is vital, directly reshaping the input often results in information loss. Consider temporal data where time dependencies are crucial, using a simple fully connected network would destroy temporal structure. In these scenarios, you must adjust the model's architecture. Instead of a `Dense` layer, you should leverage layer types which *can* handle the 3D structure of your data. For sequences, recurrent layers such as `LSTM` or `GRU` are suited for temporal data. Convolutional layers (like `Conv1D`) can also handle sequential data, especially for pattern recognition across time.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Example 3D input data: [batch_size, time_steps, num_features]
num_samples = 100
time_steps = 20
num_features = 5
data_3d = np.random.rand(num_samples, time_steps, num_features)

# A model designed to accept sequences using an LSTM layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(time_steps, num_features)),
    layers.LSTM(32),
    layers.Dense(1)
])

# Training directly with the 3D data
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="mse")
model.fit(data_3d, np.random.rand(num_samples, 1), epochs=2)

print(f"Shape of the 3D data: {data_3d.shape}")

```

This second example demonstrates the use of an `LSTM` layer. Observe that I define the input shape for this model as `(time_steps, num_features)` which matches the last two dimensions of the 3D input data. Consequently, no reshaping is required. The Keras backend understands that the `LSTM` layer is meant to receive a series of features over time.

**Addressing an Image Dataset with an unintended third dimension**

Sometimes, this error can surface in the context of images, where you may inadvertently introduce a third dimension. For example, you might expect a 2D grayscale image, but, due to some pre-processing, an extra dimension might appear. This might occur when a single-channel image is loaded as an array of shape `(height, width, 1)` which is a 3D array. The fix is to reduce the number of dimensions through `np.squeeze()` function.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Example grayscale image data with an extra channel dimension [height, width, 1]
num_samples = 100
height = 28
width = 28
data_3d = np.random.rand(num_samples, height, width, 1)

# Remove extra channel dimension using squeeze
data_2d = np.squeeze(data_3d, axis=3)


# A model expecting a 2D image input
input_shape = (height, width)
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=input_shape),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(32, activation="relu"),
    layers.Dense(1)
])

# Training now proceeds smoothly with the 2D data
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="mse")
model.fit(data_2d, np.random.rand(num_samples, 1), epochs=2)

print(f"Shape of squeezed data: {data_2d.shape}")

```

This example highlights that the dimension with value 1 can be removed.  `np.squeeze(data_3d, axis=3)` removes the channel dimension from the image.  Subsequently the model now trains with the 2D data. Notice the shape of the input layer is defined as `(height, width)`. This highlights how the first layer of the model expects 2D input, and how you have to reshape data to fit this requirement.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a more in-depth understanding of data handling within Keras, consult the official Keras documentation. It provides thorough guides on input layer specifications and best practices.  For a general understanding of tensors and array manipulation in Python, the NumPy documentation will prove invaluable. For more advanced scenarios, resources discussing recurrent networks and other deep learning architectures within the deep learning framework offer considerable guidance. These, coupled with careful debugging, should effectively address the `ValueError` when a Keras model expects a 2D input but receives a 3D array.
