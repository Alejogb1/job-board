TensorFlow's manipulation capabilities allow for complex tensor reshaping and data extraction. The challenge of gathering every Nth element from a 2D tensor into a 3D tensor with strides of 1 specifically requires a careful application of slicing and reshaping operations, often in conjunction with `tf.range` and `tf.gather_nd`. This task frequently arises when dealing with time-series data segmented into subsequences, where each subsequence needs to be considered as an independent training sample within a larger batch.

Let's assume, for context, that I recently worked on a project involving financial market data. We had a 2D tensor representing price data across multiple assets, with rows corresponding to time points and columns to different securities. We needed to create 3D tensor batches suitable for recurrent neural network training where each time series fragment became a training sample. We would take sequences of, say, length 10 from the raw time series and then move over with a stride of one to form the next training sample. Therefore we were grabbing every tenth element.

The problem can be broken down into three key stages: first, calculating the necessary indices to extract the correct elements. Second, using those indices to gather the elements from the source tensor. Third, reshaping the result into the desired 3D tensor structure. The difficulty lies mainly within the index generation stage. TensorFlow itself does not directly provide a single function for extracting sub-tensors in this exact way, making manual manipulation essential.

To start, we need to understand the source 2D tensorâ€™s dimensions and the intended structure of the 3D tensor. Suppose our input 2D tensor is shaped `[num_rows, num_cols]`, and we want every Nth row in the final 3D tensor to have `slice_length` elements of a row at stride one. The 3D tensor will then have dimensions `[num_batches, slice_length, num_cols]`.

The core insight here is that `tf.range` allows for generating sequential numbers. In our case, we can use it to create offsets into the original tensor. Once we have these offsets we can generate a multi-dimensional set of indices using the concept of broadcasting, where lower-dimensional tensors are automatically expanded to be compatible with higher dimensional ones. We then utilize `tf.gather_nd` to retrieve the relevant values. This is not a simple slice on the primary dimension, but a set of indices into it.

Here are three examples with increasing complexity.

**Example 1: Basic Nth Element Extraction with a Constant Sequence Length**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def extract_nth_elements_basic(tensor_2d, n, slice_length):
    """
    Extracts every Nth slice of a 2D tensor into a 3D tensor, assuming a slice length of 'slice_length' with strides of 1.
    Args:
      tensor_2d: A 2D tensor of shape [num_rows, num_cols].
      n: The interval to grab elements from, every Nth row.
      slice_length: The length of each slice.
    Returns:
      A 3D tensor of shape [num_batches, slice_length, num_cols].
    """
    num_rows = tf.shape(tensor_2d)[0]
    num_cols = tf.shape(tensor_2d)[1]

    # Calculate the start indices for each batch and the number of batches.
    start_indices = tf.range(0, num_rows - slice_length + 1, n)
    num_batches = tf.shape(start_indices)[0]

    # Generate indices for all values within all slices.
    batch_indices = tf.range(num_batches)
    slice_indices = tf.range(slice_length)
    
    # This creates a matrix of start indexes, corresponding to slices at strides of one.
    slice_offset = tf.expand_dims(slice_indices, axis=0)
    slice_start_indices = tf.expand_dims(start_indices, axis=1) + slice_offset
   
    # Convert slice_start_indices into a multi-dimensional index that can be passed to gather_nd.
    batch_indices_3d = tf.reshape(tf.tile(tf.expand_dims(batch_indices, axis = 1), [1, slice_length]), [num_batches, slice_length, 1])
    slice_start_indices_3d = tf.expand_dims(slice_start_indices, axis=2)
    column_indices_3d = tf.reshape(tf.tile(tf.range(num_cols), [num_batches*slice_length]), [num_batches, slice_length, num_cols])
    
    # Create a final index tensor.
    all_indices = tf.concat([batch_indices_3d, slice_start_indices_3d, column_indices_3d], axis=2)

    #Gather the tensor.
    gathered = tf.gather_nd(tensor_2d, all_indices[:,:,1:])

    return gathered

# Example Usage
tensor_2d = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18], [19, 20, 21], [22, 23, 24]], dtype=tf.int32)
n = 2
slice_length = 3
result = extract_nth_elements_basic(tensor_2d, n, slice_length)
print(result)

```

This first example implements the basic logic. It first calculates `start_indices` and then constructs the actual indexes used for `tf.gather_nd`. It showcases the principle of using `tf.range` for index generation, and importantly shows how to use it to gather elements from the tensor.

**Example 2: Handling Variable Slice Length (padding)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def extract_nth_elements_variable(tensor_2d, n, max_slice_length):
  """
  Extracts every Nth slice of a 2D tensor into a 3D tensor, assuming a slice length up to max_slice_length with strides of 1. 
  Pads with zeros to max_slice_length.
  Args:
    tensor_2d: A 2D tensor of shape [num_rows, num_cols].
    n: The interval to grab elements from, every Nth row.
    max_slice_length: The maximum length of each slice.
  Returns:
    A 3D tensor of shape [num_batches, max_slice_length, num_cols].
  """
  num_rows = tf.shape(tensor_2d)[0]
  num_cols = tf.shape(tensor_2d)[1]

  # Calculate the start indices for each batch.
  start_indices = tf.range(0, num_rows - max_slice_length + 1, n)
  num_batches = tf.shape(start_indices)[0]

  # Generate indices for all values within all slices.
  batch_indices = tf.range(num_batches)
  slice_indices = tf.range(max_slice_length)
  
  # This creates a matrix of start indexes, corresponding to slices at strides of one.
  slice_offset = tf.expand_dims(slice_indices, axis=0)
  slice_start_indices = tf.expand_dims(start_indices, axis=1) + slice_offset
   
  # Convert slice_start_indices into a multi-dimensional index that can be passed to gather_nd.
  batch_indices_3d = tf.reshape(tf.tile(tf.expand_dims(batch_indices, axis = 1), [1, max_slice_length]), [num_batches, max_slice_length, 1])
  slice_start_indices_3d = tf.expand_dims(slice_start_indices, axis=2)
  column_indices_3d = tf.reshape(tf.tile(tf.range(num_cols), [num_batches*max_slice_length]), [num_batches, max_slice_length, num_cols])
    
    # Create a final index tensor.
  all_indices = tf.concat([batch_indices_3d, slice_start_indices_3d, column_indices_3d], axis=2)

  #Gather the tensor.
  gathered = tf.gather_nd(tensor_2d, all_indices[:,:,1:])

  #Handle variable slice length with padding.
  mask = (slice_start_indices < num_rows)
  masked_gathered = tf.where(tf.expand_dims(mask, axis=2), gathered, tf.zeros_like(gathered))

  return masked_gathered

# Example Usage
tensor_2d = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18], [19, 20, 21], [22, 23, 24]], dtype=tf.int32)
n = 2
max_slice_length = 4
result = extract_nth_elements_variable(tensor_2d, n, max_slice_length)
print(result)
```

This example introduces the concept of handling a variable slice length. It first calculates the maximum possible length, then pads the sequence with zeros at positions that don't exist in the original tensor. This padding approach is useful in cases where the sequences aren't always perfectly evenly spaced or need to conform to a fixed size for mini-batching. We use `tf.where` and a mask to achieve the padding.

**Example 3: Handling Edge Cases**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def extract_nth_elements_robust(tensor_2d, n, slice_length):
    """
    Extracts every Nth slice of a 2D tensor into a 3D tensor with a stride of 1.
     Handles edge cases when tensor_2d has too few rows for a given n and slice_length.
    Args:
      tensor_2d: A 2D tensor of shape [num_rows, num_cols].
      n: The interval to grab elements from, every Nth row.
      slice_length: The length of each slice.
    Returns:
      A 3D tensor of shape [num_batches, slice_length, num_cols]. Returns an empty tensor if no slices are possible.
    """
    num_rows = tf.shape(tensor_2d)[0]
    num_cols = tf.shape(tensor_2d)[1]

    # Calculate the start indices for each batch.
    start_indices = tf.range(0, num_rows - slice_length + 1, n)
    num_batches = tf.shape(start_indices)[0]

    #Check for an empty slice.
    if num_batches == 0:
        return tf.zeros(shape=[0, slice_length, num_cols], dtype=tensor_2d.dtype)

     # Generate indices for all values within all slices.
    batch_indices = tf.range(num_batches)
    slice_indices = tf.range(slice_length)
    
    # This creates a matrix of start indexes, corresponding to slices at strides of one.
    slice_offset = tf.expand_dims(slice_indices, axis=0)
    slice_start_indices = tf.expand_dims(start_indices, axis=1) + slice_offset
   
    # Convert slice_start_indices into a multi-dimensional index that can be passed to gather_nd.
    batch_indices_3d = tf.reshape(tf.tile(tf.expand_dims(batch_indices, axis = 1), [1, slice_length]), [num_batches, slice_length, 1])
    slice_start_indices_3d = tf.expand_dims(slice_start_indices, axis=2)
    column_indices_3d = tf.reshape(tf.tile(tf.range(num_cols), [num_batches*slice_length]), [num_batches, slice_length, num_cols])
    
    # Create a final index tensor.
    all_indices = tf.concat([batch_indices_3d, slice_start_indices_3d, column_indices_3d], axis=2)

    #Gather the tensor.
    gathered = tf.gather_nd(tensor_2d, all_indices[:,:,1:])

    return gathered

# Example Usage
tensor_2d = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=tf.int32)
n = 3
slice_length = 3
result = extract_nth_elements_robust(tensor_2d, n, slice_length)
print(result)

tensor_2d = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18], [19, 20, 21], [22, 23, 24]], dtype=tf.int32)
n = 2
slice_length = 3
result = extract_nth_elements_robust(tensor_2d, n, slice_length)
print(result)
```

This third example introduces robustness by checking if the number of batches is zero. This case occurs when the input tensor does not have enough rows to fulfill the requested slicing requirements. The function then returns an empty tensor of appropriate dtype. This explicit handling of edge cases prevents runtime errors, which is important when using this function as part of a larger pipeline.

For further exploration and understanding of these techniques, I suggest reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.range`, `tf.gather_nd`, and `tf.reshape`. Studying the concept of broadcasting in NumPy/TensorFlow can also deepen comprehension. I would also recommend reviewing case studies involving time series data preprocessing since this particular task occurs frequently in that context. Specifically, familiarize yourself with windowing and striding operations in the time-series domain. It is also beneficial to experiment directly with small tensors and various values for `n` and `slice_length` to solidify understanding. Careful understanding of how TensorFlow handles multi-dimensional indexing is critical when working with `tf.gather_nd`. By carefully leveraging these tools, we can create arbitrary extractions for machine learning tasks.
