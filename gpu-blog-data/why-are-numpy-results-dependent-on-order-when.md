The apparent order-dependency in NumPy results, when dealing with operations that intuitively should be commutative or associative, almost invariably stems from the interplay between broadcasting, memory layout, and the underlying implementation details of NumPy's optimized functions.  It's not that NumPy inherently violates mathematical principles; rather, the optimizations employed, while often highly effective, can expose subtle dependencies on data arrangement that aren't immediately apparent from the mathematical expression of the operation.  My experience debugging similar issues in high-performance computing applications, specifically within large-scale simulations relying on NumPy for array manipulation, underscores this point repeatedly.

**1. Explanation of Order Dependency in NumPy Operations:**

NumPy's strength lies in its vectorized operations.  These operate on entire arrays simultaneously, leveraging low-level optimizations like SIMD instructions and optimized BLAS/LAPACK libraries. These optimizations often prioritize efficiency over strict adherence to a mathematically guaranteed order of operations at a granular level. Consider addition:  mathematically, `a + b` and `b + a` are identical. However, NumPy's implementation might process these differently depending on the array's memory layout (row-major vs. column-major) and the specific optimization strategy employed.  If one array is significantly larger than the other, broadcasting might introduce a sequence of operations internally that affects the final result, due to differences in cache access patterns and memory management.  Furthermore, floating-point arithmetic itself isn't associative; the order of operations can subtly influence the final result due to rounding errors, an effect often amplified with many operations.

Another crucial factor is the presence of `NaN` (Not a Number) values.  The way `NaN` propagates through addition or other operations isn't always consistent across different orders.  For example, `NaN + x` always results in `NaN`, irrespective of `x`, but the order of operations involving multiple `NaN`s and other numbers can yield different outcomes depending on the evaluation sequence.

Furthermore, when dealing with in-place operations (modifying arrays directly using operators like `+=`), the order becomes critical.  Consider a scenario where you're incrementally updating a large array across multiple iterations. If the order of updates is changed, the intermediate results stored in the array will differ, leading to a different final state.  This is a direct consequence of the mutable nature of NumPy arrays and the side effects of in-place modifications.


**2. Code Examples Illustrating Order Dependency:**

**Example 1: Broadcasting and Floating-Point Errors**

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = np.array([[4.0], [5.0], [6.0]])
c = np.array([7.0, 8.0, 9.0])


# Order 1:
result1 = (a + b) + c  #Broadcasting, then addition

# Order 2:
result2 = a + (b + c) #Broadcasting, then addition, different order

print(result1)
print(result2)
print(np.allclose(result1, result2)) # Check for near equality due to floating-point

```

Commentary: Even though addition is associative, slight differences due to the internal order of floating-point additions during broadcasting can lead to `np.allclose` returning `False`, indicating differences beyond the expected numerical precision.

**Example 2:  In-place Operations and Mutable Arrays**


```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Order 1:
a += b # In-place addition
print("Order 1:", a)

# Order 2:  Reset 'a'
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b += a #In-place addition to 'b', 'a' remains unchanged
print("Order 2: a:",a)
print("Order 2: b:", b)

```
Commentary:  The in-place addition (`+=`) directly modifies the array.  The order of operations drastically affects the final values.  The same applies to other in-place operations such as `-=`, `*=`, `/=`.


**Example 3: NaN Propagation**

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1.0, np.nan, 3.0])
b = np.array([4.0, 5.0, np.nan])

# Order 1:
result1 = a + b

#Order 2:
result2 = b + a

print("Order 1:", result1)
print("Order 2:", result2)
print(np.array_equal(result1, result2)) # Check for exact equality.

```

Commentary:  While the output might appear identical at a glance, subtle variations in the propagation of NaN depending on the implementation could exist.  Exact equality (`np.array_equal`) is therefore a more appropriate check than `np.allclose` in this instance.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of NumPy's internal workings and potential pitfalls, I would advise consulting the official NumPy documentation, paying particular attention to the sections on broadcasting, memory layout, and the underlying linear algebra libraries it utilizes.  A strong grasp of linear algebra and numerical analysis is also indispensable in diagnosing and understanding these issues.  Finally, studying the source code of NumPy itself (though challenging) provides the most detailed perspective.  Exploring advanced topics such as memory management and SIMD optimization within the context of NumPy will provide a far more nuanced understanding of these subtle order dependencies.  These combined resources should furnish a thorough understanding of the complexities involved.
