The root cause of your observation – code expecting CPU execution but receiving CUDA – almost invariably stems from a mismatch between your code's execution environment and the runtime library it's linked against. This manifests most commonly when inadvertently utilizing a CUDA-enabled library or inadvertently setting environment variables that direct execution to the GPU. My experience debugging similar issues across numerous high-performance computing projects has consistently highlighted this core problem.  Let's delve into the specifics.

**1. Understanding the Execution Context:**

Your application likely utilizes libraries designed for parallel computation.  These libraries, such as cuBLAS, cuDNN, or even custom CUDA kernels, are inherently GPU-accelerated.  The problem arises when the code *implicitly* or *explicitly* attempts to leverage these libraries without sufficient checks for the availability of a CUDA-capable device.  If a CUDA-capable device *is* present, the libraries will transparently offload computations to the GPU. The error, therefore, isn't a direct 'CPU expecting CUDA' scenario; instead, it's your code inadvertently triggering GPU execution when it anticipates CPU-only behavior.

This typically surfaces in two ways:

* **Implicit GPU Usage:** Your code might utilize functions from a library that internally uses CUDA.  Even a simple matrix multiplication, if performed using a library like cuBLAS without explicit CPU-specific calls, will default to GPU execution if a CUDA device is detected.

* **Explicit Device Selection:**  The code might explicitly call functions that select a CUDA device, or it may rely on environment variables that dictate the execution environment. For example, an improperly configured `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable could force the application to use the GPU even if the code doesn't directly interact with CUDA APIs.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's examine three illustrative scenarios, focusing on Python and its interaction with popular libraries.  These examples demonstrate the subtle ways in which unintended GPU execution can occur.


**Example 1: Implicit GPU Usage with NumPy (and CuPy)**

```python
import numpy as np  # This might inadvertently import a CuPy-backed NumPy

a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
b = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
c = a + b  # This operation might run on the GPU if CuPy is active

print(c)
```

Commentary:  This appears innocuous. However, if a CuPy installation is present and configured to replace NumPy (or its backend), this simple addition could be performed on the GPU.  The seemingly standard NumPy array operations can become GPU operations without explicit programmer awareness. The solution involves explicitly using CPU-based libraries or disabling CuPy integration.  This highlights the crucial aspect of dependency management and carefully verifying the execution environment.


**Example 2: Explicit Device Selection with PyCUDA**

```python
import pycuda.driver as cuda
import pycuda.autoinit  # This line implicitly initializes CUDA

# ... other code ...

cuda.Device(0).make_context()  # Explicitly selects GPU 0
# ... CUDA kernel launch ...
cuda.Context.pop()
```

Commentary:  This code snippet, utilizing PyCUDA, explicitly initializes the CUDA driver and selects GPU 0.  Any subsequent kernel launches will target this device.  The error here isn't a misconfiguration but rather a lack of conditional checks. The code should include checks for CUDA device availability before attempting to use CUDA resources.  A robust solution involves checking `cuda.Device.count()` before proceeding with GPU-specific operations.


**Example 3:  Environment Variable Influence**

```python
import numpy as np

# Assume this script uses a library that can use either CPU or GPU

a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
b = np.array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
c = a * b
print(c)

```


Commentary:  This example, while seemingly straightforward, is vulnerable to environment variables.  If `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is set to "0", for example, despite the lack of explicit CUDA calls in this snippet, a library (e.g. a NumPy backend utilizing CUDA under the hood) could interpret this and use the GPU. The solution requires careful management of the environment variables, potentially unsettting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` before execution to enforce CPU usage.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To resolve such issues, I would recommend consulting the documentation for the specific libraries used within your application.  Pay particular attention to sections on device selection, environment variables, and CPU/GPU execution control.  Furthermore, a thorough review of your system's CUDA configuration, including installed drivers and environment variables, is essential. Finally, systematically removing or commenting out sections of your code to isolate the point of unintended GPU usage aids in debugging.  Detailed logging throughout your code can provide crucial insights during investigation.  The ability to selectively disable GPU acceleration within libraries can significantly aid in pinpointing the offending code sections.
