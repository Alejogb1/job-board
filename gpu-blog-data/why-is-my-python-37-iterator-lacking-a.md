The absence of a `next` attribute on your Python 3.7 iterator stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how iterators are implemented and accessed within the language.  It's crucial to differentiate between iterator objects themselves and the iterator protocol they adhere to.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale data processing pipelines taught me that this distinction is often overlooked.  An iterator doesn't *possess* a `next` attribute as a member variable; instead, it implements the iterator protocol, meaning it defines the `__next__` method (or `next` in Python 2).  The built-in `next()` function utilizes this `__next__` method.  Attempts to directly access `.next` will therefore fail.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Python iterators are objects that implement the iterator protocol. This protocol mandates the existence of a `__next__` method. This method is responsible for returning the next item in the iteration sequence. When the iteration is exhausted, it should raise a `StopIteration` exception.  The built-in `next()` function acts as an intermediary, invoking the iterator's `__next__` method.  Crucially, the `next()` function is not a method of the iterator object; it's a function that operates *on* the iterator object.  Trying to access `.next` as an attribute is incorrect because the iterator object doesn't store the iteration logic as a directly accessible member; it's encapsulated within the `__next__` method.  Any attempt to access `.next` directly will result in an `AttributeError`.  The correct way to access the next element is by using the `next()` function, passing the iterator as an argument.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Iterator Implementation and Usage**

```python
class MyIterator:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.index = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.index >= len(self.data):
            raise StopIteration
        value = self.data[self.index]
        self.index += 1
        return value

my_iterator = MyIterator([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 1
print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 2
print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 3
# ... and so on until StopIteration is raised.

#Attempting my_iterator.next() here will raise an AttributeError
```

This example demonstrates a correct iterator implementation. The `__iter__` method returns the iterator itself (allowing for iteration using `for` loops), and the `__next__` method correctly handles iteration and the `StopIteration` exception. The `next()` function is used to retrieve elements correctly.

**Example 2:  Incorrect Attempt to Access `next` as an Attribute**

```python
class MyIterator:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.index = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.index >= len(self.data):
            raise StopIteration
        value = self.data[self.index]
        self.index += 1
        return value

my_iterator = MyIterator([10, 20, 30])

try:
    result = my_iterator.next  # Incorrect: attempting to access as an attribute
    print(result)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Caught AttributeError: {e}") # Output: Caught AttributeError: 'MyIterator' object has no attribute 'next'
```

This example showcases the error.  Directly accessing `my_iterator.next` raises an `AttributeError` because `next` is not an attribute but a method invoked through the `next()` function.

**Example 3: Generator Expression (A Simpler Approach)**

```python
data = [100, 200, 300, 400]
my_generator = (x * 2 for x in data)  # Generator expression

print(next(my_generator)) # Output: 200
print(next(my_generator)) # Output: 400
# ... and so on

#Again, my_generator.next will raise an AttributeError.
```

Generator expressions provide a concise way to create iterators.  This example illustrates that even with this more streamlined approach, the same principle applies:  the `next()` function, not a `.next` attribute, retrieves the next element. The underlying generator object still adheres to the iterator protocol, employing `__next__` internally.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest reviewing the official Python documentation on iterators and generators.  Furthermore, a thorough understanding of the iterator protocol is vital.   Finally, consider working through relevant chapters in intermediate-level Python programming textbooks; these typically cover iterators in detail, providing practical examples and exercises.  Studying these resources will solidify your understanding of the difference between the iterator protocol and the way iterators are utilized within the Python language.  Careful attention to these distinctions will resolve similar issues efficiently in the future.  My personal experience debugging similar errors in production systems emphasizes the importance of a robust conceptual understanding of these fundamental elements of Python.  Without this, even experienced programmers can fall victim to this common misunderstanding.
