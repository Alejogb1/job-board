In my experience troubleshooting container builds, a common pitfall arises when expecting the container layer to reflect changes made within a build process, yet those changes fail to materialize in the final image. This discrepancy typically stems from a misunderstanding of how Docker layers are created and cached, specifically concerning the distinction between *image* layers and *container* layers. The core issue isn't that the container layer "isn't being added," but rather that *operations within a running container, which generate a container layer, are not automatically persisted back into a new image layer*. Let me elaborate.

A Docker image is fundamentally a read-only template composed of stacked layers. Each layer corresponds to a step in your Dockerfile, such as a `COPY` instruction or a `RUN` command that installs packages. Docker’s build process calculates a hash for each instruction based on the instruction and relevant content (e.g., the files being copied). If nothing has changed from a prior build, Docker will reuse cached layers based on that hash, greatly accelerating build times. When you use `docker run`, you instantiate a *container* from this image. The container adds a writable layer on top of the image's read-only layers, where any changes you make within the container (file modifications, package installations, etc.) are stored. These changes are not automatically reflected in the base image from which the container was created, and they are specific to that *container* instance, not the image itself. When the container stops, these changes disappear along with the container (unless you committed the container to a new image).

The confusion often happens because one might perform actions in a container that are assumed to be included in the base image simply by virtue of being done within it. For example, one might run `docker run myimage bash -c 'apt update && apt install -y somepackage'`, expecting the updated package lists and new package to exist in `myimage` afterwards. However, that command only updates the container's writable layer. The original `myimage` remains unchanged. To include changes permanently within an image, you must define those operations within your Dockerfile so they generate new image layers *during the build process*. Furthermore, understanding that these changes are not automatically carried over can lead to a misconception about why rebuilds often do not pick up small changes.

Let’s examine some examples that highlight this principle.

**Example 1: Missing File in Image**

Suppose I have a Dockerfile with this simple content:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
WORKDIR /app
RUN apt update && apt install -y wget
```

I build this image with `docker build -t myapp .` and run it: `docker run -it myapp bash`. Inside the container, I create a file: `touch myfile.txt`. Upon exiting the container and rerunning it, the file `myfile.txt` is gone. Even if I then `docker commit` this container to a new image, that new image will only contain that file in the *final* layer that results from the commit operation. The layer associated with `RUN apt update && apt install -y wget` will *not* contain `myfile.txt`. Now, if I go back and make a slight change to the Dockerfile by adding a command like `RUN touch /app/newfile.txt`, build it again, then run a new container, `myfile.txt` is still not there, but `newfile.txt` *is*. The initial image layer created by `RUN apt update && apt install -y wget` remains unmodified, even if I run updates inside the container. The container’s volatile layer holds `myfile.txt`, not the image layers.

**Example 2: Correcting a Package Install**

Assume I have this Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt update && apt install -y python3
```

This results in an image with `python3` installed. I notice that I need `pip` as well, so I *wrongly* believe I can correct this after building, and I run: `docker run -it myimage bash -c 'apt install -y python3-pip'`. However, this adds `pip` to the container's mutable layer, not the `myimage` itself. The only way to ensure `pip` is there when I start a *new* container from `myimage` is to modify the Dockerfile to include the pip installation:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt update && apt install -y python3 python3-pip
```

Now, when the image is built *from scratch*, the resulting layers will include `pip`, and all subsequent containers launched from this new image will have it available without needing a manual install inside the container. This is because the `RUN` command creates an image layer, making the changes permanent in the base image.

**Example 3: Caching Issues and Layer Reuse**

Consider this sequence:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
COPY requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install -r /app/requirements.txt
```

Initially, `requirements.txt` contains `requests==2.28.1`. I build the image. Later, I modify `requirements.txt` to use `requests==2.29.0`. When I rebuild, Docker will detect that the content of `requirements.txt` has changed, leading to a cache miss, and the `RUN pip install ...` layer will be re-executed, reflecting the update. However, if I *don't* change the `requirements.txt` file, but simply install a different package in the container after it's created and commit the changes, then the image layers associated with `COPY` and `RUN` remain unmodified. The changes exist only in the new final layer of the image that was created by the `commit` command. This is vital to understand, as changes made within a container are *not* incorporated into prior image layers, and without altering the `requirements.txt` file, the cached version of the `pip install` step (from the build process) remains unchanged, no matter what I do in a running container. This demonstrates the importance of not relying on container-specific changes if they should be part of the base image.

In summary, the key takeaway is that changes made *within* a container's writable layer, while a container is running, do not automatically become part of the underlying *image* layers. Persistent changes must be incorporated into the image by modifying the Dockerfile and rebuilding the image. Container layers are ephemeral. Image layers, once constructed via the Dockerfile, are read-only until rebuilt with a change in the dockerfile or associated build context.

For further exploration, consider consulting comprehensive guides on Docker best practices, particularly those that detail layer caching mechanisms and optimal Dockerfile construction. Resources on container image security are also important to understanding why relying on manual updates within running containers can be problematic. In particular, resources that delve deeper into how Docker handles layer caching are highly beneficial. Knowledge of the `docker history` command, which reveals the layers of a built image, is invaluable for debugging purposes and for improving an understanding of how your Dockerfile is building the final image.
