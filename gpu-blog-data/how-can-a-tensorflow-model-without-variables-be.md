Exporting a TensorFlow model that lacks trainable variables for use in OpenCV requires careful consideration of how TensorFlow and OpenCV handle model representations. Typically, a TensorFlow model involves variables that hold the model’s learned parameters. However, some models, particularly those performing pre-processing or feature extraction, may be architected without trainable weights, effectively operating as a fixed function. The key challenge lies in translating the TensorFlow computational graph into a format that OpenCV can understand, specifically through the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) intermediate representation. I have encountered this scenario frequently when deploying models designed for image resizing and normalization.

The absence of variables fundamentally alters the export process. With traditional models, TensorFlow's SavedModel format along with freezing the graph to incorporate the learned parameters is the typical method. However, in our case, there are no parameters to freeze. Thus, we bypass this process and focus on the computational graph itself. We will explicitly convert the model to an ONNX representation, which is then suitable for import into OpenCV’s DNN module. It is essential to ensure that the TensorFlow graph is composed only of operations supported by the ONNX converter, since the conversion will fail if any unsupported operation is used.

The general process involves several stages: first, we define or load the TensorFlow model without variables. Second, we convert this model to an ONNX format. Third, we verify the ONNX model using a tool like ONNX Runtime. Finally, we import and run the ONNX model in OpenCV. The key lies in proper configuration and handling of input/output tensors. Let us explore this process through specific examples.

**Example 1: A Simple Normalization Model**

Suppose I’ve built a TensorFlow model that simply normalizes image pixel values from the range [0, 255] to [0, 1]. This is often a preprocessing step before feeding images into a larger model. It involves only division and type conversion operations and therefore has no trainable variables.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import onnx
from onnx_tf.backend import prepare

# Define the model as a TensorFlow function using function decoration
@tf.function
def normalize_image(image):
  image = tf.cast(image, tf.float32)
  normalized_image = image / 255.0
  return normalized_image

# Create a concrete function using input specification
concrete_function = normalize_image.get_concrete_function(tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, None, None, 3], dtype=tf.uint8))

# Convert to a TensorFlow graph representation
tf_graph_def = concrete_function.graph.as_graph_def()

# Prepare the model for ONNX conversion
tf_rep = prepare(tf_graph_def)

# Convert to ONNX
onnx_model = tf_rep.export_graph()

# Save the ONNX model
with open("normalization_model.onnx", "wb") as f:
  f.write(onnx_model.SerializeToString())
```

In this example, I defined `normalize_image` as a TensorFlow function decorated using `@tf.function` to obtain a computational graph. The `get_concrete_function` call instantiates the function using a tensor specification which determines the expected input shape. The model is then converted from graph definition to ONNX format. The `prepare` function from `onnx-tf` handles the translation between TensorFlow graph and ONNX representation. Crucially, the resulting ONNX model encapsulates the normalization process which contains no learnable parameters but still performs a useful function, ready to be used by OpenCV. The final line saves the ONNX model to disk which is then used by the next phase.

**Example 2: Image Resizing Model**

Let us consider a model designed to resize an input image to a specific size. Again, this operation does not involve any learnable parameters, and uses TensorFlow’s `tf.image.resize` operation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import onnx
from onnx_tf.backend import prepare


# Define resize function
@tf.function
def resize_image(image, target_height, target_width):
    resized_image = tf.image.resize(image, [target_height, target_width])
    return resized_image


# Define the input specification
input_spec = tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, None, None, 3], dtype=tf.uint8)
height_spec = tf.TensorSpec(shape=[], dtype=tf.int32)
width_spec = tf.TensorSpec(shape=[], dtype=tf.int32)

# Generate the concrete function
concrete_function = resize_image.get_concrete_function(input_spec, height_spec, width_spec)

# Convert the concrete function graph into a GraphDef
tf_graph_def = concrete_function.graph.as_graph_def()

# Prepare the model for ONNX conversion
tf_rep = prepare(tf_graph_def)

# Convert to ONNX
onnx_model = tf_rep.export_graph()

# Save ONNX model to disk
with open("resize_model.onnx", "wb") as f:
    f.write(onnx_model.SerializeToString())
```

In this example, the `resize_image` function is designed with two additional scalar inputs representing the target height and width. It's crucial to provide these parameters as separate inputs to `get_concrete_function`, which correctly translates to the ONNX specification. The `tf.image.resize` operation is commonly supported in ONNX, making this model conversion straightforward. The generated ONNX model includes not only the resize operation but also input specification so that OpenCV can interpret the meaning of the input arguments.

**Example 3: A Concatenation Model**

Consider a model that concatenates two input images along the channel axis. Once again this operation does not introduce any trainable parameters and demonstrates the handling of multi-input models.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import onnx
from onnx_tf.backend import prepare

# Define the concatenation function
@tf.function
def concatenate_images(image1, image2):
    concatenated_image = tf.concat([image1, image2], axis=-1)
    return concatenated_image


# Define input specifications
input_spec1 = tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, None, None, 3], dtype=tf.uint8)
input_spec2 = tf.TensorSpec(shape=[None, None, None, 3], dtype=tf.uint8)

# Generate concrete function
concrete_function = concatenate_images.get_concrete_function(input_spec1, input_spec2)

# Convert the concrete function graph to a GraphDef
tf_graph_def = concrete_function.graph.as_graph_def()

# Prepare the graph for ONNX conversion
tf_rep = prepare(tf_graph_def)

# Convert to ONNX
onnx_model = tf_rep.export_graph()

# Save the ONNX model
with open("concat_model.onnx", "wb") as f:
    f.write(onnx_model.SerializeToString())
```

Here, `concatenate_images` takes two images as inputs. The concrete function is instantiated using two separate `TensorSpec` objects, one for each input image. This multi-input scenario highlights the flexibility of the `onnx-tf` conversion process. The generated ONNX model defines two inputs corresponding to the image tensor which is subsequently used by the concatenation operation.

Following the conversion, I typically verify the resulting ONNX model’s correctness using the ONNX Runtime to ensure it produces the intended output before deploying it with OpenCV. This step involves loading the ONNX model and executing it using a sample input which can verify the expected behavior before use in OpenCV.

After these conversions, OpenCV can import and utilize the exported ONNX models. The DNN module in OpenCV can load the ONNX file and execute the computation graph, effectively using the same preprocessing or fixed function performed by TensorFlow directly within the OpenCV environment.

For further study on this topic, I recommend exploring the documentation for `onnx-tf`, focusing on the requirements for TensorFlow operations to be ONNX-compatible. The ONNX project itself provides comprehensive documentation regarding the format and its supported operations, which can aid in understanding limitations and expected behavior during conversion. Also, studying the OpenCV documentation pertaining to the `dnn` module will enhance comprehension of how to correctly import and run the converted ONNX models. Finally, the TensorFlow documentation on concrete functions and their graph representations provides insights that are very useful to this process.
