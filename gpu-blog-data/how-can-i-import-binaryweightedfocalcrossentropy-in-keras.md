The `binary_weighted_focal_crossentropy` loss function isn't a standard Keras offering.  My experience building custom loss functions for image segmentation tasks, particularly those involving imbalanced datasets, has taught me the crucial need for careful implementation when dealing with such specialized loss functions.  The absence of a pre-built function necessitates crafting a custom implementation leveraging Keras's backend capabilities. This requires a thorough understanding of the underlying mathematics of focal loss and its weighted variant.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Focal loss addresses class imbalance by down-weighting the loss assigned to easily classified examples.  The standard binary cross-entropy loss can be overwhelmed by the majority class, leading to poor performance on the minority class.  Focal loss mitigates this by introducing a modulating factor (1 - p_t)^γ, where p_t is the model's estimated probability for the ground truth class and γ is a focusing parameter (typically > 0).  A higher γ value increases the down-weighting effect.

The weighted variant further extends this by incorporating class weights, addressing potential differences in the importance or cost associated with misclassifying each class.  The weighted focal loss can be expressed as:

`Loss = -α_t * (1 - p_t)^γ * log(p_t)`

where:

* `α_t` is the weight assigned to class t (0 or 1 for binary classification).  This is often determined by the inverse class frequencies in the training data.
* `p_t` is the predicted probability of the ground truth class.
* `γ` is the focusing parameter.

Implementing this in Keras requires leveraging the backend functionality (typically TensorFlow or Theano, depending on your Keras installation) to perform the element-wise calculations efficiently.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Implementation using TensorFlow/Keras backend:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K

def binary_weighted_focal_crossentropy(gamma=2., alpha=.25):
    """
    Binary weighted focal crossentropy loss function.

    Args:
        gamma: Focusing parameter for modulating easy examples.
        alpha: Weight assigned to the positive class.

    Returns:
        A function that computes the binary weighted focal crossentropy loss.
    """
    def loss_function(y_true, y_pred):
        pt_1 = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true, 1), y_pred, tf.ones_like(y_pred))
        pt_0 = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true, 0), y_pred, tf.zeros_like(y_pred))

        epsilon = K.epsilon()  # Avoid log(0) errors
        pt_1 = K.clip(pt_1, epsilon, 1. - epsilon)  # Clip probabilities to avoid numerical instability
        pt_0 = K.clip(pt_0, epsilon, 1. - epsilon)

        loss_1 = -alpha * K.pow(1. - pt_1, gamma) * K.log(pt_1)
        loss_0 = -(1 - alpha) * K.pow(pt_0, gamma) * K.log(1. - pt_0)

        return K.mean(y_true * loss_1 + (1 - y_true) * loss_0)

    return loss_function

#Example usage:
model.compile(loss=binary_weighted_focal_crossentropy(gamma=2., alpha=0.25), optimizer='adam')
```

This example directly utilizes TensorFlow operations within the Keras backend.  The `tf.where` function efficiently handles the conditional assignment based on the ground truth labels. Clipping probabilities prevents potential numerical instability associated with `log(0)`.


**Example 2:  Utilizing Keras `K.switch` for conditional logic:**

```python
import keras.backend as K

def binary_weighted_focal_crossentropy_switch(gamma=2., alpha=.25):
    def loss_function(y_true, y_pred):
        pt_1 = K.switch(K.equal(y_true, 1), y_pred, K.ones_like(y_pred))
        pt_0 = K.switch(K.equal(y_true, 0), y_pred, K.zeros_like(y_pred))

        epsilon = K.epsilon()
        pt_1 = K.clip(pt_1, epsilon, 1. - epsilon)
        pt_0 = K.clip(pt_0, epsilon, 1. - epsilon)

        loss_1 = -alpha * K.pow(1. - pt_1, gamma) * K.log(pt_1)
        loss_0 = -(1 - alpha) * K.pow(pt_0, gamma) * K.log(1. - pt_0)

        return K.mean(y_true * loss_1 + (1 - y_true) * loss_0)
    return loss_function

# Example usage:
model.compile(loss=binary_weighted_focal_crossentropy_switch(gamma=2., alpha=0.25), optimizer='adam')

```

This version replaces `tf.where` with `K.switch`, offering an alternative approach that maintains backend compatibility.


**Example 3:  Handling class weights externally:**

```python
import numpy as np
import keras.backend as K

def binary_weighted_focal_crossentropy_external(gamma=2.):
    def loss_function(y_true, y_pred):
        # Assuming class weights are passed externally
        alpha = class_weights[0]  # Weight for class 0
        # ... rest of the code is the same as in Example 1 or 2, except you don't need to pass alpha
        # ... use the alpha defined here
        return K.mean(y_true * loss_1 + (1 - y_true) * loss_0)
    return loss_function

# Example usage:
class_weights = np.array([0.75, 0.25]) # Example class weights.  Calculate these based on your dataset
model.compile(loss=binary_weighted_focal_crossentropy_external(gamma=2.), optimizer='adam')

```
This approach demonstrates how class weights can be pre-calculated and passed to the loss function, providing flexibility in managing class weighting separately from the loss function definition itself.  This improves code readability and maintainability for more complex scenarios.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of focal loss and its variants, I suggest consulting research papers on focal loss and class imbalance in classification.  Furthermore, thoroughly examine the Keras documentation regarding custom loss functions and the available backend functionalities.  Exploring TensorFlow/Theano documentation will prove invaluable in understanding the underlying tensor operations used in these examples.  Pay close attention to error handling and numerical stability when implementing custom loss functions.  Robust testing is also crucial. Remember to verify your implementation's correctness using simpler test cases before applying it to your full dataset.
