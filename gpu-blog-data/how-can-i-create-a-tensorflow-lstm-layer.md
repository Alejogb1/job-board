The core challenge in replicating Keras's LSTM layer behavior with `return_sequences=True` and `return_state=True` in raw TensorFlow lies in understanding the internal state management and output shaping.  Keras elegantly abstracts these details, but achieving the same functionality requires explicit handling of the hidden state and cell state tensors across time steps.  My experience developing a time-series forecasting model for a large financial institution highlighted the intricacies of this process; accurately reproducing the Keras output proved crucial for model validation and deployment.


**1. Clear Explanation**

A Keras LSTM layer with `return_sequences=True` and `return_state=True` produces three outputs:

1. **Sequences of hidden states:** A 3D tensor (samples, timesteps, units) representing the hidden state at each time step for each input sample.
2. **Final hidden state:** A 2D tensor (samples, units) representing the hidden state at the last time step.
3. **Final cell state:** A 2D tensor (samples, units) representing the cell state at the last time step.

To replicate this in TensorFlow, we must manually unroll the LSTM over the time steps, maintain the hidden and cell states, and then construct the output tensors accordingly.  This involves leveraging TensorFlow's low-level `tf.while_loop` for iterative processing and careful tensor manipulation to ensure dimensional consistency. The core LSTM computation itself will utilize `tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell`, allowing us to leverage the optimized implementation while retaining control over the overall process.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic LSTM Implementation**

This example demonstrates the fundamental structure.  Error handling and advanced features are omitted for clarity.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_lstm(inputs, units, return_sequences=True, return_state=True):
    # Initialize hidden and cell states.  Shape: (batch_size, units)
    h = tf.zeros((tf.shape(inputs)[0], units))
    c = tf.zeros((tf.shape(inputs)[0], units))
    lstm_cell = tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(units)

    outputs = []
    # Unroll the LSTM over time steps
    for t in tf.range(tf.shape(inputs)[1]):
        x_t = inputs[:, t, :]  # Extract input at time step t
        output, (h, c) = lstm_cell(x_t, [h, c])
        outputs.append(output)

    if return_sequences:
        outputs = tf.stack(outputs, axis=1) # Shape: (batch_size, timesteps, units)

    if return_state:
        return outputs, h, c
    else:
        return outputs
```

**Commentary:**  This code iterates through the time steps, feeding each time step's input into the `LSTMCell`. The hidden and cell states are updated cumulatively. The resulting outputs are stacked to form the sequence output if `return_sequences` is true.

**Example 2:  Handling Variable-Length Sequences**

Real-world data often contains sequences of varying lengths.  This necessitates a more robust approach.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_lstm_variable_length(inputs, sequence_lengths, units, return_sequences=True, return_state=True):
  # ... (Initialization as in Example 1) ...

  outputs = []
  for t in tf.range(tf.shape(inputs)[1]):
      x_t = inputs[:, t, :]
      mask = tf.less(t, sequence_lengths) #Mask for variable length sequences
      x_t = tf.where(mask[:, tf.newaxis], x_t, tf.zeros_like(x_t)) #Zero-pad inputs beyond sequence length
      output, (h, c) = lstm_cell(x_t, [h, c])
      outputs.append(output)

  #... (Output handling as in Example 1) ...
```

**Commentary:** This version introduces a masking mechanism to handle variable-length sequences. The `sequence_lengths` tensor provides the length of each sequence in the batch.  Inputs beyond each sequence's length are masked to zero, preventing them from influencing the LSTM computations.

**Example 3:  Integration with a Static Input**

In some applications, a static input vector might need to be concatenated with the time-series data before feeding into the LSTM.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_lstm_static_input(inputs_dynamic, inputs_static, units, return_sequences=True, return_state=True):
    #inputs_dynamic: (batch_size, timesteps, units_dynamic)
    #inputs_static: (batch_size, units_static)

    inputs_combined = tf.concat([inputs_dynamic, tf.expand_dims(inputs_static, axis=1)], axis=1)
    lstm_cell = tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(units)

    # ... (Initialization and unrolling as in Example 1, but using inputs_combined) ...

```

**Commentary:** This example shows how to integrate a static input vector (`inputs_static`) with the dynamic time-series input (`inputs_dynamic`). The static input is expanded to match the time dimension and then concatenated. The combined input is then processed by the LSTM.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's low-level APIs, I would recommend thoroughly reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on `tf.while_loop`, tensor manipulation functions, and the details of the `tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell` class.  Additionally, exploring resources dedicated to recurrent neural networks and sequence modeling will provide broader context. Examining well-documented open-source projects that implement custom RNN layers will also prove highly beneficial.  Careful study of these materials will illuminate the nuanced aspects of state management and output shaping crucial for accurate replication of Keras's LSTM functionalities.  Understanding the mathematical underpinnings of LSTMs is also essential for debugging and optimization.
