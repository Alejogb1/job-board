A Keras model’s `save_weights` function, when generating an empty HDF5 file, typically indicates an issue with the model's state *before* the weights are attempted to be serialized, rather than a problem with the saving process itself. Specifically, the model might not have been properly built, its layers may not have been initialized with a weight configuration or the computational graph isn't established before calling the `save_weights` function. I've encountered this several times during prototyping complex architectures and data preprocessing pipelines, each time tracing back to this fundamental concept of Keras model construction.

The `save_weights` method, unlike `save_model`, specifically preserves only the numerical parameters of each trainable layer within the neural network. It does not retain any information about the model's architecture, its input shapes, or the optimizer configuration. This focused approach is designed to facilitate tasks like transfer learning, where the weights of a pre-trained model are loaded into a new model with potentially different, yet compatible, architecture. However, for a weight file to contain any values, Keras needs to have gone through the process of building the underlying graph, associating weight variables with each layer, and then optionally, training (or initializing via some other mechanism) those weights. An empty file suggests this hasn't occurred.

Let me elaborate on the common scenarios that result in this issue. A frequent cause stems from calling `save_weights` immediately after defining a model, before the model's architecture has been established through forward propagation on an input tensor or explicit instantiation of the weight variables. Keras, in its dynamic nature, doesn't fully concretize the network until it is called with data. Without this operation, the framework doesn't know the input shapes, the necessary memory allocations for the tensors representing the weights, or how to interconnect the layers into a computational graph.

Another scenario is when using custom layers or models where explicit weight creation isn't handled correctly. Keras' built-in layers usually manage their own weight initialization, but custom components need careful attention. If the custom code doesn't define `build` method that initializes variables with `self.add_weight`, the layers don't have weights to serialize and will therefore cause empty files.

A third common case arises when working with subclassed models in TensorFlow/Keras and utilizing functions like `model.summary()` before training. While the summary function attempts to infer output shapes and model information, it does not definitively initiate the actual weight tensors. A call to `save_weights` at this juncture will produce an empty file. Only a forward pass through the model will truly build the weights.

Let’s illustrate this with some code examples:

**Example 1: Incorrect call order**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Incorrect: Saving weights before building
model.save_weights('empty_weights.h5')

print("Weights saved: empty_weights.h5 (Likely Empty)")

# Correct: Generate input to make the model built and weight variables allocated
import numpy as np
dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 784).astype(np.float32)
model(dummy_input)  # Forward pass that builds model

# Now the weights are properly populated
model.save_weights('populated_weights.h5')

print("Weights saved: populated_weights.h5 (Not Empty)")
```

In this example, the first `save_weights` call generates an empty file because the model's layers are just defined but haven't undergone their build process. By passing `dummy_input` through the model, we implicitly initiate the construction of the weight tensors, allowing the second call to `save_weights` to create a valid file with weights information.

**Example 2: Custom layer with missing weight initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomDense(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(CustomDense, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Wrong: No weight initialization implemented here.
        output = tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel) + self.bias
        return output

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    CustomDense(128),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Note: No graph was constructed because the custom layer is missing weight variables, thus resulting to an empty weights file.
model.save_weights('custom_empty_weights.h5')
print("Weights saved: custom_empty_weights.h5 (Empty)")

class CustomDenseCorrect(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(CustomDenseCorrect, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
       self.kernel = self.add_weight(name='kernel',
                                    shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                    initializer='uniform',
                                    trainable=True)
       self.bias = self.add_weight(name='bias',
                                    shape=(self.units,),
                                    initializer='zeros',
                                    trainable=True)
    def call(self, inputs):
        output = tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel) + self.bias
        return output

model_correct = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    CustomDenseCorrect(128),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# A forward pass will initialize the layer variables
dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 10).astype(np.float32)
model_correct(dummy_input)

model_correct.save_weights('custom_populated_weights.h5')
print("Weights saved: custom_populated_weights.h5 (Not Empty)")

```
The initial custom layer version omits the crucial step of weight initialization. The `build` method is essential to define weights using `self.add_weight`. By adding `build`, the second `model_correct` gets a weight definition that can be later saved.

**Example 3: Subclassed model and summary call**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)


model = MyModel()
model.summary()  # Summary does NOT trigger weight creation.

# Incorrect: Saving weights before a call()
model.save_weights('subclass_empty_weights.h5')
print("Weights saved: subclass_empty_weights.h5 (Empty)")

dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 784).astype(np.float32)
model(dummy_input)  # Forward pass that initializes weights

model.save_weights('subclass_populated_weights.h5')
print("Weights saved: subclass_populated_weights.h5 (Not Empty)")
```

The `model.summary()` call computes input and output shape information based on inferred or explicitly set input layer shapes. However, this method is purely informational and does not initiate tensor variable creation for the trainable parameters. It's the subsequent forward pass `model(dummy_input)` that causes Keras to build the model weights.

When facing an empty weight file, systematically examining these potential causes is crucial. Specifically: have I performed a forward propagation through the model with a data batch to initiate the weights? If custom layers are implemented, does each have proper weight creation logic within their `build` method using `self.add_weight`? And with subclassed models, is a forward pass to materialize the weights performed? Careful review of these points is usually sufficient for identifying and resolving the issue.

For further learning, I’d suggest exploring the Keras API documentation on model building, specifically the details on how layers and models initialize weights, how custom layers are implemented. Also, investigating tutorials covering the usage of Keras with subclassed models and the distinction between the use of `save_weights` and `save_model` is recommended. Furthermore, I advise reviewing the specific code implementations of Keras core layers such as `Dense` or `Conv2D` in the TensorFlow source code. This allows to understand how the weight variables are created, and how they should be properly used for both built-in and custom layer implementation purposes.
