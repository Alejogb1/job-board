The core limitation preventing a direct, universal replacement of `torch.einsum` with `torch.matmul` lies in the expressiveness of Einstein summation notation. While `torch.matmul` efficiently handles matrix multiplication and batched matrix multiplication, `torch.einsum`'s ability to specify arbitrary summation over indices provides a significantly broader range of tensor operations.  My experience optimizing deep learning models frequently highlighted this distinction.  I've encountered situations where a direct `torch.matmul` equivalent simply wasn't feasible, necessitating the flexibility of `torch.einsum`.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`torch.matmul` performs matrix multiplication according to standard linear algebra rules.  Specifically, it computes the dot product between rows of the first tensor and columns of the second tensor. This is implicitly defined; the dimensions are inferred and must conform to the matrix multiplication rules.  Dimensions must align appropriately (i.e., the inner dimensions must match).

`torch.einsum`, conversely, allows for the explicit specification of which dimensions are summed over and which are retained in the output. This is expressed through a subscript string that defines the operation.  This subscript string describes how the input tensors are contracted and what the output tensor's shape will be.  Consequently, `torch.einsum` encompasses a vastly larger set of tensor operations than `torch.matmul`.  Matrix multiplication is just a *subset* of operations achievable through `torch.einsum`.

Consider the case of a dot product between two vectors.  `torch.matmul` can directly compute this. However, `torch.einsum` can also achieve this using a subscript string that specifies the summation over a single dimension.  More importantly, `torch.einsum` can easily handle tensor contractions of arbitrary order and dimensionality, operations that would require intricate reshaping and multiple `torch.matmul` calls using `torch.reshape` and potentially `torch.transpose` if attempted with only `torch.matmul`.  The complexity of such a multi-step process dramatically increases with tensor dimensionality.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Matrix Multiplication**

This showcases the straightforward equivalence between `torch.matmul` and a specific `torch.einsum` case.

```python
import torch

a = torch.randn(10, 5)
b = torch.randn(5, 3)

# Using torch.matmul
result_matmul = torch.matmul(a, b)

# Using torch.einsum
result_einsum = torch.einsum('ik,kj->ij', a, b)

# Verification
print(torch.allclose(result_matmul, result_einsum))  # Output: True
```

Here, `'ik,kj->ij'` specifies that the summation is over index `k`.  This is the standard matrix multiplication case and is easily replicated with `torch.matmul`.


**Example 2:  Tensor Contraction Beyond Matmul's Capabilities**

This example highlights an operation impossible to directly perform with `torch.matmul`.

```python
import torch

a = torch.randn(5, 3, 2)
b = torch.randn(5, 2, 4)

# Using torch.einsum for tensor contraction
result_einsum = torch.einsum('ijk,ikl->ijl', a, b)

# No direct equivalent in torch.matmul
# Attempting a direct equivalent would require manual reshaping and multiple matmul calls.
```

The `torch.einsum` expression `'ijk,ikl->ijl'` performs a contraction along the `k` dimension.  Achieving this with `torch.matmul` alone would demand significant preprocessing involving reshaping and possibly transposing the tensors, substantially impacting both code readability and computational efficiency. I've personally spent considerable time optimizing such scenarios to avoid this overhead.


**Example 3: Batch Matrix Multiplication with Added Complexity**

This illustrates how `torch.einsum` can handle batch operations elegantly, contrasting with potentially less concise `torch.matmul` approaches.

```python
import torch

a = torch.randn(10, 2, 5)  # Batch of 10 matrices, 2x5
b = torch.randn(10, 5, 3)  # Batch of 10 matrices, 5x3

# Using torch.einsum for batched matrix multiplication
result_einsum = torch.einsum('bij,bjk->bik', a, b)

# Using torch.bmm for batched matrix multiplication (a more direct alternative in this specific case)
result_bmm = torch.bmm(a, b)

# Verification
print(torch.allclose(result_einsum, result_bmm))  # Output: True
```

While `torch.bmm` offers a direct solution for batched matrix multiplication, `torch.einsum` maintains a consistent notation across different operations, enhancing code readability and maintainability.  It handles the batch dimension implicitly, avoiding the need for explicit batching considerations.  This clean syntax becomes extremely valuable when dealing with more complex scenarios involving multiple batch dimensions or more intricate tensor contractions.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official PyTorch documentation for detailed explanations of both `torch.matmul` and `torch.einsum`.  Thoroughly study linear algebra fundamentals, focusing on tensor contractions and Einstein summation notation.  Explore advanced linear algebra textbooks for a deeper understanding of tensor operations. The efficient use of both functions often requires a good understanding of the underlying mathematical operations.  Working through practical examples involving various tensor shapes and dimensions is crucial for mastering the capabilities and limitations of each function.  Understanding broadcasting semantics within PyTorch will also enhance your ability to optimize these operations.
