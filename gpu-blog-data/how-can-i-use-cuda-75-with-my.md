The challenge of utilizing CUDA 7.5 with a legacy GPU primarily revolves around compatibility—specifically, the compute capability of your GPU and the minimum driver version requirements imposed by CUDA Toolkit versions. I encountered this exact issue several years ago, attempting to resurrect an old Fermi-based server for a research project. The key realization was that not all CUDA Toolkits support all GPU architectures, and driver support, often overlooked, is a critical factor.

CUDA 7.5, while a significant release in its time, is now considered quite old. Its major limitation is that it only officially supports GPUs with compute capabilities ranging from 2.0 to 5.2. This detail is paramount because GPUs are categorized by compute capability, reflecting their architectural generation and feature sets. A legacy GPU, in this context, most likely falls into an architecture older than the Maxwell generation (compute capability 5.0), potentially even a Fermi (compute capability 2.x) or Kepler (compute capability 3.x) architecture. If your GPU's compute capability is below 2.0 or above 5.2, CUDA 7.5 will not work directly. Even if it falls within the 2.0-5.2 range, you still have driver compatibility to consider. CUDA 7.5 requires a specific minimum driver version, which might be newer than what your legacy system is configured for.

To practically address this, one must determine the compute capability of the specific GPU. This can be done using `nvidia-smi` (if the NVIDIA driver is already installed) or by consulting the NVIDIA documentation specific to your GPU's model number. Once the compute capability is ascertained, we can proceed with the necessary adjustments.

If your GPU's compute capability falls outside the supported range of 2.0-5.2, using CUDA 7.5 directly becomes exceedingly difficult, if not impossible. Your options then narrow to one of the following strategies: 1) Using an older CUDA toolkit that might support your particular GPU or 2) attempting to build CUDA applications targeting the oldest supported compute capability of CUDA 7.5 (2.0) and hoping the driver will still operate with a degree of functionality.  This latter approach is far from guaranteed and involves considerable risk of system instability.

I strongly advise against attempting to circumvent version restrictions without careful consideration. Instead, the better approach often involves adopting more modern versions of the CUDA Toolkit that inherently support older architectures. Often, modern toolkits have maintained backwards compatibility with older GPUs, but require more modern drivers. This does have drawbacks, as newer toolkits might not offer all the performance advantages that would be expected with newer architectures.

Let’s delve into some practical examples:

**Example 1: Basic Kernel with Compute Capability 2.0**

Assuming your legacy GPU has compute capability 2.0 (Fermi), you might write a simple kernel for vector addition like this:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cuda.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    float *a, *b, *c;
    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;
    size_t size = n * sizeof(float);

    // Host memory allocation and initialization (omitted for brevity)

    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, size);

    // Memory copying (omitted)

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

    cudaMemcpy(c, d_c, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Memory deallocation (omitted)
    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);
    return 0;
}
```

This code is compatible with CUDA 7.5 and a GPU with compute capability 2.0. The kernel simply adds two vectors element-wise. The key point is that the grid and block dimensions, along with the memory allocation and copy operations, must adhere to the limitations of the target architecture and the limitations of older CUDA versions.

**Example 2: Error Handling with CUDA API**

When using CUDA 7.5 on older hardware, error handling becomes paramount. Older GPUs are far more prone to errors due to the limitations of their compute capabilities or out of date drivers.  Therefore, I highly suggest checking for errors after each CUDA API call, like in the following example:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cuda.h>

void checkCudaError(cudaError_t error, const char* file, int line) {
    if (error != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA Error at %s:%d: %s\n", file, line, cudaGetErrorString(error));
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}

#define CHECK_CUDA(x) checkCudaError(x, __FILE__, __LINE__);

__global__ void kernel(float *data, int size){
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < size)
        data[idx] = idx * 1.0f;
}

int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    float* host_data = new float[size];
    float* device_data = nullptr;

    CHECK_CUDA(cudaMalloc((void**)&device_data, size * sizeof(float)));

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(device_data, size);
    CHECK_CUDA(cudaGetLastError()); // Check for kernel launch errors

    CHECK_CUDA(cudaMemcpy(host_data, device_data, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost));


    CHECK_CUDA(cudaFree(device_data));

    delete[] host_data;

    return 0;
}
```
Here, the `CHECK_CUDA` macro streamlines error checking. It's critical to implement such a system, as running out of device memory or errors in the kernel launch will lead to unpredictable behavior if not handled correctly. Specifically, `cudaGetLastError()` will check for errors after a kernel launch.

**Example 3:  Handling different device capabilities**

In some cases you might not be certain about the specific compute capability of your GPU. I have found it valuable to implement runtime checks as shown below:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaError_t error = cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (error != cudaSuccess) {
         std::cerr << "CUDA error getting device count: " << cudaGetErrorString(error) << std::endl;
         return 1;
    }
    if (deviceCount == 0){
      std::cerr << "No CUDA devices detected." << std::endl;
      return 1;
    }


    for (int i = 0; i < deviceCount; ++i) {
        cudaDeviceProp deviceProp;
        error = cudaGetDeviceProperties(&deviceProp, i);
        if (error != cudaSuccess) {
            std::cerr << "Error getting device properties for device " << i << ": " << cudaGetErrorString(error) << std::endl;
            continue; // Move to the next device
        }

        std::cout << "Device " << i << ": " << deviceProp.name << std::endl;
        std::cout << "  Compute Capability: " << deviceProp.major << "." << deviceProp.minor << std::endl;

        // Check compatibility with CUDA 7.5
        if ((deviceProp.major == 2 && deviceProp.minor >= 0) ||
            (deviceProp.major == 3 && deviceProp.minor >= 0) ||
            (deviceProp.major == 5 && deviceProp.minor <= 2)) {
            std::cout << "  Compatible with CUDA 7.5 (compute capability 2.x-5.2)." << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cout << "  Incompatible with CUDA 7.5." << std::endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code iterates through available CUDA devices, prints their names, compute capabilities and determines if they fall into the appropriate range for CUDA 7.5. This can be valuable for diagnostics or for making decisions on the fly regarding what CUDA version should be used.  It should be used in tandem with proper error checking such as the example code above.

For further exploration of CUDA and GPU architecture, I recommend consulting NVIDIA's official documentation, particularly the programming guides and reference manuals for specific CUDA Toolkit versions. Textbooks focusing on parallel computing with CUDA provide invaluable theoretical background, as well as other texts detailing GPU architectures. Reviewing example CUDA code hosted on repositories like GitHub and similar platforms can be incredibly beneficial, but proceed with care to ascertain the code is applicable to your needs. Additionally, various online forums dedicated to CUDA development and parallel computing can provide insight into common problems and solutions, though remember the advice there may not be correct for your specific problem. Always consult official NVIDIA documentation first when encountering a complex problem.
