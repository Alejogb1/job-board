Theano, while no longer actively developed, fundamentally alters how numerical computations are executed through its core architecture, enabling significant performance gains, particularly when using GPU hardware. This improvement stems from the way Theano defines, optimizes, and subsequently compiles mathematical expressions rather than executing them sequentially, line-by-line as standard Python might. I’ve spent considerable time dissecting and applying Theano across several research projects where performance was critical, and that experience has solidified my understanding of its GPU utilization techniques.

Theano operates on a symbolic computation model. Instead of immediately calculating a value, Theano builds a computational graph, representing the sequence of mathematical operations that need to be performed. These operations are expressed as symbolic variables, and Theano only performs the calculations when instructed by the programmer. This symbolic representation is crucial because it allows Theano’s internal optimizer to inspect and transform the computational graph before actual execution. It is this compilation process that enables Theano to offload suitable graph sections to the GPU via CUDA, effectively leveraging the parallel processing capabilities available.

The core mechanism behind GPU acceleration in Theano is its capacity to translate symbolic operations into equivalent CUDA kernels. When Theano detects that certain operations in the computation graph are amenable to GPU execution—typically dense array operations like matrix multiplications, element-wise operations, and convolutions—it generates the necessary CUDA code and utilizes the appropriate libraries provided by NVIDIA, such as cuBLAS (for linear algebra operations) and cuDNN (for deep neural networks primitives). This translation process is not always a one-to-one mapping; often, Theano's optimizer groups operations into larger chunks or identifies optimized CUDA implementations for specific combinations of operations. This optimization occurs transparently to the end-user, but it has a large impact on performance.

To actually execute code on the GPU, Theano relies on a device-specific configuration system. This is largely handled through the THEANO_FLAGS environment variable or by explicitly specifying the device when creating shared variables. When a computation graph is compiled for GPU execution, the shared variables—i.e., data that lives on the GPU—must be specified as existing on the GPU, and all operations involving these variables are dispatched to the GPU where possible. If data needs to be transferred between the CPU and GPU, it incurs a performance penalty, so Theano is optimized to minimize data transfers, which is a key consideration when designing algorithms for GPU execution.

Now, let's look at some specific code examples illustrating GPU usage in Theano.

**Example 1: Basic Matrix Multiplication**

This code snippet shows a basic matrix multiplication operation. Notice the explicit declaration of shared variables on the GPU using `theano.shared` and then the use of `theano.function` to compile and execute the expression. This compilation process is essential for offloading the matrix multiplication to the GPU.

```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as tt
import numpy as np

# Define symbolic variables
A = tt.matrix('A')
B = tt.matrix('B')

# Symbolic multiplication
C = tt.dot(A, B)

# Create a function that computes C
f = theano.function([A, B], C)

# Define numpy matrices on the CPU
a_np = np.random.rand(1000, 500).astype(theano.config.floatX)
b_np = np.random.rand(500, 1000).astype(theano.config.floatX)

# Create shared variables on the GPU,
# Theano will transfer the numpy data to these variables on first use
a_gpu = theano.shared(a_np)
b_gpu = theano.shared(b_np)

# Create a function to execute with the GPU variables.
# Theano's optimizer will recognize that the input variables are on the GPU,
# and will execute the multiplication there as well
f_gpu = theano.function([], tt.dot(a_gpu, b_gpu))


# Run the computation
result_cpu = f(a_np,b_np)
result_gpu = f_gpu()

# The results should be approximately equal
print("CPU result shape:", result_cpu.shape)
print("GPU result shape:", result_gpu.shape)

# Verify the results are approximately equal
print("Are the CPU and GPU results approximately equal?:", np.allclose(result_cpu, result_gpu))
```

In this example, by using `theano.shared` the numpy arrays are copied to the GPU once the first time `f_gpu` is called.  Subsequent calls execute on the GPU, eliminating the cost of repeated data transfers, provided the arrays remain the same. Theano's optimizer is intelligent enough to identify that the input `a_gpu` and `b_gpu` are on the GPU and, consequently, will generate CUDA code to perform the matrix multiplication directly on the GPU.

**Example 2: Element-wise Addition and Scalar Multiplication**

This example shows element-wise operations, which can also be effectively parallelized on the GPU. The shared variables `x_gpu` and `scalar_gpu` are set to float32 type, and the addition and multiplication are performed in that context.
```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as tt
import numpy as np

# Define symbolic variable
x = tt.vector('x')
s = tt.scalar('s')

# Define a symbolic operation
y = x + s * x

# Create a Theano function
f = theano.function([x, s], y)

# Create numpy data on the CPU
x_np = np.random.rand(1000).astype(theano.config.floatX)
scalar_np = np.float32(2)

# Transfer x_np to the GPU as a shared variable
x_gpu = theano.shared(x_np)

# Create a scalar variable on the GPU
scalar_gpu = theano.shared(scalar_np)

# Create a function to execute on the GPU
f_gpu = theano.function([], x_gpu + scalar_gpu * x_gpu)

# Execute both functions
result_cpu = f(x_np, scalar_np)
result_gpu = f_gpu()


# Verify the results
print("CPU result shape:", result_cpu.shape)
print("GPU result shape:", result_gpu.shape)

# Verify that results are approximately equal
print("Are the CPU and GPU results approximately equal?:", np.allclose(result_cpu, result_gpu))

```
The operations of adding and multiplying are translated by Theano into CUDA code that executes across multiple GPU cores simultaneously. When running `f_gpu`, Theano executes the computation directly on the GPU. It's important to note the `theano.config.floatX` usage, which ensures that the data type used by Theano matches the float precision of the GPU.

**Example 3: Convolutional Layer with cuDNN**

This example demonstrates a convolution operation using `tensor4`, typically found in convolutional neural networks. The key benefit here is that if cuDNN is available and Theano is configured to use it, the convolution operation will automatically leverage the high-performance convolution implementations provided by the cuDNN library, enabling substantial speedups.

```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as tt
import numpy as np
from theano.tensor.nnet import conv2d

# Define the input (image) as a tensor4
input_shape = (10, 3, 32, 32) # (batch_size, channels, height, width)
input_tensor = tt.tensor4('input')

# Define the filter weights
filter_shape = (5, 3, 5, 5) # (num_filters, in_channels, height, width)
filters = theano.shared(np.random.rand(*filter_shape).astype(theano.config.floatX))

# Define the convolution operation
conv_output = conv2d(input_tensor, filters)


# Create a function to compute the convolution
f = theano.function([input_tensor], conv_output)

# Create an input array
input_array = np.random.rand(*input_shape).astype(theano.config.floatX)

# Create shared variable for the input array, and move to GPU
input_gpu = theano.shared(input_array)


# Create a function that works with the GPU input
f_gpu = theano.function([], conv2d(input_gpu, filters))


# Run the functions
result_cpu = f(input_array)
result_gpu = f_gpu()


# Verify the results
print("CPU result shape:", result_cpu.shape)
print("GPU result shape:", result_gpu.shape)

# Verify that results are approximately equal
print("Are the CPU and GPU results approximately equal?:", np.allclose(result_cpu, result_gpu))


```

When `f_gpu` is executed, Theano automatically uses the cuDNN library (if configured), ensuring that the convolution operation is performed using its optimized implementation.  The use of `tensor4` indicates that we are dealing with batches of images, and therefore, we can benefit significantly from the parallelism offered by GPUs.  Theano’s optimization process also includes other operations like pooling which can benefit from CUDA acceleration, though they are not explicitly showcased here. The key understanding is that these operations are transformed into CUDA kernels by Theano's compiler.

In conclusion, Theano leverages GPU acceleration by translating symbolic expressions into CUDA code and utilizing libraries like cuBLAS and cuDNN. It effectively maximizes performance by offloading suitable calculations to the GPU. Furthermore, the careful use of `theano.shared` variables to minimize data transfer between the CPU and GPU is crucial for achieving optimal performance. For further study, I would recommend delving into the Theano documentation for details on its configuration options and the specifics of each optimization pass. Studying examples of deep neural network implementations in Theano will also provide deeper insights into how it's used in practice. Additionally, examining NVIDIA's documentation on CUDA, cuBLAS, and cuDNN can help one understand how these libraries integrate with Theano's GPU acceleration mechanisms.
