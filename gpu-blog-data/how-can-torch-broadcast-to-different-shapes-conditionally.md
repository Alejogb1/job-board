Conditional broadcasting in PyTorch necessitates a nuanced understanding of tensor shapes and the underlying broadcasting rules.  My experience optimizing deep learning models frequently encountered scenarios where broadcasting behavior needed dynamic adaptation based on runtime conditions.  Directly leveraging PyTorch's built-in broadcasting isn't always sufficient;  we often require conditional logic to handle variations in input tensor dimensions.  The key lies in utilizing PyTorch's shape manipulation functions alongside conditional statements to achieve flexible broadcasting.

The core challenge stems from the fact that PyTorch's broadcasting operates deterministically based on predefined rules.  If the shapes of tensors are not compatible for broadcasting, a `RuntimeError` is raised.  Consequently, to conditionally broadcast, we must first ascertain shape compatibility and then perform the broadcasting operation only when the shapes allow it.  Otherwise, alternative operations, such as reshaping, tiling, or even masking, are necessary.  This necessitates a strategy of pre-broadcast shape validation coupled with conditional execution of broadcasting operations.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The process involves a two-step approach:

* **Shape Analysis:**  Prior to attempting any broadcasting, we must analyze the shapes of the tensors involved.  This analysis determines whether the tensors are broadcastable according to PyTorch's rules. This involves checking if dimensions are either equal or one of them is 1.  If the dimensions are incompatible, alternative strategies (as mentioned earlier) are needed.

* **Conditional Broadcasting:**  Based on the outcome of the shape analysis, we proceed conditionally.  If the tensors are broadcastable, we directly perform the broadcasting operation using the standard PyTorch operators (e.g., `+`, `*`, `-`, etc.).  If not, we implement a suitable alternative: reshaping one or both tensors to achieve compatibility, creating a mask to handle partial operations, or replicating tensor data to simulate broadcasting where needed.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Conditional Addition with Reshaping**

This example demonstrates conditional addition of two tensors where one tensor might need reshaping to enable broadcasting.

```python
import torch

def conditional_add(tensor1, tensor2):
    """Conditionally adds two tensors, reshaping tensor2 if necessary."""
    shape1 = tensor1.shape
    shape2 = tensor2.shape

    if len(shape1) == len(shape2):
        if shape1 == shape2:
            return tensor1 + tensor2
        else:
            return "Shapes are incompatible, cannot add using broadcasting"
    elif len(shape1) > len(shape2):
        try:
            tensor2 = tensor2.reshape((1,) * (len(shape1) - len(shape2)) + shape2)  # Prepend 1s
            return tensor1 + tensor2
        except RuntimeError:
            return "Shapes are fundamentally incompatible"
    else:
       try:
           tensor1 = tensor1.reshape((1,) * (len(shape2) - len(shape1)) + shape1) # Prepend 1s
           return tensor1 + tensor2
       except RuntimeError:
           return "Shapes are fundamentally incompatible"



tensor_a = torch.randn(3, 4)
tensor_b = torch.randn(4)
result = conditional_add(tensor_a, tensor_b)
print(result)

tensor_c = torch.randn(2,3,4)
tensor_d = torch.randn(3,4)
result = conditional_add(tensor_c, tensor_d)
print(result)

tensor_e = torch.randn(2,3)
tensor_f = torch.randn(4,5)
result = conditional_add(tensor_e,tensor_f)
print(result)
```

This function first checks if the tensors are of the same dimension. If so, a direct comparison of the shapes is performed to handle identical shapes. If the number of dimensions differs, it attempts to prepend `1` dimensions to the smaller tensor using `reshape` to enable broadcasting.  If `reshape` fails, it implies fundamental shape incompatibility beyond simple broadcasting solutions.

**Example 2:  Conditional Multiplication with Masking**

This example illustrates conditional multiplication where broadcasting is not possible, instead opting for element-wise multiplication using a carefully constructed mask.

```python
import torch

def conditional_multiply(tensor1, tensor2):
    """Conditionally multiplies tensors, using masking for incompatible shapes."""
    shape1 = tensor1.shape
    shape2 = tensor2.shape

    if torch.broadcast_tensors(tensor1, tensor2): #Checking for broadcasting compatibility
        return tensor1 * tensor2
    else:
        if len(shape1) != len(shape2) and min(len(shape1),len(shape2)) == 1:
            if len(shape1) == 1:
                tensor1 = tensor1.reshape(1,-1)
            else:
                tensor2 = tensor2.reshape(1,-1)
            return torch.einsum('ij,jk->ik', tensor1, tensor2)
        else:
            return "Shapes are fundamentally incompatible for both broadcasting and element-wise multiplication"


tensor_a = torch.randn(3, 4)
tensor_b = torch.randn(1,4)
result = conditional_multiply(tensor_a, tensor_b)
print(result)

tensor_c = torch.randn(2,3,4)
tensor_d = torch.randn(3,4)
result = conditional_multiply(tensor_c, tensor_d)
print(result)

tensor_e = torch.randn(2,3)
tensor_f = torch.randn(4,5)
result = conditional_multiply(tensor_e,tensor_f)
print(result)
```

This function initially checks for broadcast compatibility. If broadcasting isn't possible and the dimensions differ but one tensor is of length 1, it attempts element wise multiplication using einsum.  Other scenarios are deemed fundamentally incompatible for both broadcasting and element-wise multiplication.


**Example 3: Conditional Operation with Tiling**

This example demonstrates conditional broadcasting using tiling to replicate a smaller tensor to match the dimensions of a larger tensor.

```python
import torch

def conditional_operation(tensor1, tensor2, operation):
    """Conditionally performs an operation, tiling tensor2 if necessary."""
    shape1 = tensor1.shape
    shape2 = tensor2.shape

    if torch.broadcast_tensors(tensor1,tensor2):
        return operation(tensor1, tensor2)
    elif len(shape1) > len(shape2):
        tile_dims = tuple(shape1[i] // shape2[i] if shape1[i]% shape2[i] == 0 else -1 for i in range(len(shape2)))
        if all(dim > 0 for dim in tile_dims):
            tensor2 = tensor2.repeat(tile_dims)
            return operation(tensor1, tensor2)
        else:
            return "Tiling is not possible"
    else:
        return "Incompatible shapes, tiling is only handled for smaller second tensor"

tensor_a = torch.randn(2, 3, 2)
tensor_b = torch.randn(3, 2)
result = conditional_operation(tensor_a, tensor_b, lambda x, y: x + y)
print(result)


tensor_c = torch.randn(2,3,4)
tensor_d = torch.randn(3,2)
result = conditional_operation(tensor_c, tensor_d, lambda x, y: x + y)
print(result)


tensor_e = torch.randn(3,4)
tensor_f = torch.randn(3,4)
result = conditional_operation(tensor_e, tensor_f, lambda x, y: x * y)
print(result)
```

This function checks for broadcasting compatibility and handles the case where a smaller tensor (`tensor2`) can be tiled to match the larger tensor (`tensor1`).  It employs the `repeat` function for tiling and gracefully handles cases where tiling is impossible due to incompatible dimensions.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation's sections on tensor manipulation and broadcasting are invaluable.  Furthermore, a comprehensive guide to linear algebra and matrix operations will greatly assist in understanding the mathematical foundations of tensor operations.  Finally, exploring resources on advanced indexing and reshaping techniques in NumPy (which often translate directly to PyTorch) is highly beneficial.
