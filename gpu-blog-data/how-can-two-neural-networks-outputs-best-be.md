The optimal strategy for combining the outputs of two neural networks hinges critically on the nature of their individual predictions and the overall objective.  Simply averaging their outputs, while seemingly straightforward, often fails to account for potential discrepancies in confidence levels or the differing strengths and weaknesses inherent in each network's architecture and training data. My experience working on multi-modal sentiment analysis projects revealed this limitation acutely.  Averaging raw sentiment scores from a text-based network and an image-based network consistently yielded suboptimal results, as the image network frequently struggled with ambiguous or low-resolution imagery, skewing the combined prediction.  Therefore, a more sophisticated approach is necessary, adapting to the specific characteristics of the individual networks and the desired outcome.


Several methods exist, each with strengths and weaknesses:

**1. Weighted Averaging:** This expands upon simple averaging by assigning weights to each network's output based on their individual performance metrics. This requires a separate evaluation step, perhaps using a held-out validation set, to determine the relative reliability of each network.  A higher weight is assigned to the more accurate network.

**2. Stacking/Ensemble Methods:**  This approach treats one network's output as the input to the second. The first network acts as a feature extractor, generating intermediate representations that are then fed into the second network, which performs the final prediction.  This is particularly effective when the networks have complementary strengths; one might excel at identifying coarse features, while the other refines those features for a more precise prediction.  In my work on object detection, I utilized a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to generate bounding boxes, which were then fed as input to a classifier network to improve the accuracy of object recognition.  The RPN, while fast, is prone to inaccuracies. The subsequent classifier leveraged the strength of the initial RPN output while mitigating its shortcomings.

**3. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA):**  For probabilistic outputs, BMA offers a powerful approach. It combines the predictions by considering the uncertainty associated with each network's output. Instead of simply averaging predictions, BMA weights each prediction based on its posterior probability, giving higher weight to more confident predictions. This requires networks trained to output probabilities, often employing softmax activation in the final layer.  I found BMA particularly useful in medical image analysis, where understanding the uncertainty of each diagnostic network's prediction is crucial for clinical decision-making.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Weighted Averaging**

```python
import numpy as np

def weighted_average(output1, output2, weight1, weight2):
  """Combines two network outputs using weighted averaging.

  Args:
    output1: Output of the first network (numpy array).
    output2: Output of the second network (numpy array).
    weight1: Weight assigned to the first network (float).
    weight2: Weight assigned to the second network (float).

  Returns:
    The weighted average of the two outputs (numpy array).
  """

  if not (weight1 + weight2) == 1:
    raise ValueError("Weights must sum to 1.")
  return weight1 * output1 + weight2 * output2

# Example usage
output1 = np.array([0.2, 0.8])
output2 = np.array([0.7, 0.3])
weight1 = 0.6  # Higher weight to network 1 due to superior validation performance
weight2 = 0.4
combined_output = weighted_average(output1, output2, weight1, weight2)
print(f"Combined Output: {combined_output}")
```

This example shows a simple weighted averaging. The weights (`weight1`, `weight2`) are determined beforehand based on validation performance. Error handling is included to ensure correct usage.


**Example 2: Stacking**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume model1 and model2 are pre-trained TensorFlow models

# This represents the output of model1
intermediate_representation = model1(input_data)

# The intermediate representation is used as input to model2
final_prediction = model2(intermediate_representation)

# final_prediction now contains the combined output
print(f"Final prediction: {final_prediction}")
```

This example demonstrates a stacking architecture. The output of `model1` serves as input for `model2`.  This implies that the output shape of `model1` is compatible with the input shape of `model2`.  The specifics of `model1` and `model2` (architecture, layers, etc.) would be defined separately depending on the task and data.  This is a skeletal example; actual implementation would require more detailed code.


**Example 3:  Bayesian Model Averaging (Simplified)**

```python
import numpy as np

def bayesian_model_average(output1, output2, probability1, probability2):
  """Combines two probabilistic network outputs using Bayesian Model Averaging.

  Args:
    output1: Output probabilities of the first network (numpy array).
    output2: Output probabilities of the second network (numpy array).
    probability1: Probability of the first network being correct (float).
    probability2: Probability of the second network being correct (float).

  Returns:
    The Bayesian model average of the two outputs (numpy array).
  """

  if not (probability1 + probability2) == 1:
    raise ValueError("Probabilities must sum to 1.")
  return probability1 * output1 + probability2 * output2

# Example usage
output1 = np.array([0.1, 0.9]) # Probabilities for class 1 and class 2 from model1
output2 = np.array([0.6, 0.4]) # Probabilities for class 1 and class 2 from model2
probability1 = 0.7  # Prior probability of model1 being more accurate
probability2 = 0.3
combined_output = bayesian_model_average(output1, output2, probability1, probability2)
print(f"Combined Output: {combined_output}")

```

This simplified BMA example assumes prior probabilities (`probability1`, `probability2`) for each model's accuracy are known or can be estimated. In a more complete implementation, these probabilities would be derived from a more sophisticated Bayesian inference process, perhaps using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of ensemble methods, consult texts on machine learning and pattern recognition.  For a rigorous treatment of Bayesian methods in machine learning, specialized textbooks on Bayesian statistics and machine learning are recommended.  Practical implementations utilizing TensorFlow or PyTorch will benefit from their respective documentation and tutorials. The literature on neural network architectures and their applications in specific domains will provide valuable context-specific insights.  Finally, examining research papers on ensemble methods in the relevant application domain will reveal state-of-the-art techniques and further refine the approach.
