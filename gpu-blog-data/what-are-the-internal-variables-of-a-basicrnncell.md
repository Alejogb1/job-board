The BasicRNNCell in TensorFlow, despite its apparent simplicity, manages internal state through a carefully constructed set of variables, primarily the kernel and bias. These variables, while seemingly few in number, are responsible for governing the temporal dependencies the cell learns within a recurrent neural network. My experience building sequence-to-sequence models, often requiring intricate custom cell configurations, has solidified my understanding of how these core components operate.

The most crucial internal variable is the **kernel**, a weight matrix representing the linear transformation applied to the concatenated inputs and previous hidden state. This matrix fundamentally determines how information from past time steps and the current input is combined. Think of it as a translator: it takes the input and the previous understanding of the sequence and transforms it into a new understanding. This transformation is specific to the RNN cell and what it is designed to capture. The kernelâ€™s dimensions are `[input_size + hidden_size, hidden_size]`. The `input_size` represents the dimensionality of the input at each time step. The `hidden_size` corresponds to the dimensionality of the hidden state, also representing the cell's internal memory. Therefore, each row of the kernel corresponds to a specific feature of either the input or the prior hidden state, and each column corresponds to a feature within the updated hidden state.

The second key variable is the **bias vector**. It adds a constant offset to the linear transformation computed by the kernel. This offset allows the cell to activate even when the weighted sum of the inputs and previous state is zero, preventing neurons from becoming permanently inactive. The bias dimensions are `[hidden_size]`, matching the dimensionality of the hidden state. This parameter is essential for ensuring that the network has the necessary freedom to adapt to data patterns and prevents biases from accumulating over multiple time steps due to the recurrent nature of RNNs.

The absence of other explicit variables within the BasicRNNCell is notable. Unlike more complex cells like LSTMs or GRUs, the BasicRNNCell does not have gating mechanisms or separate forget/update logic. This simplicity is both its strength and limitation. It allows for computationally efficient processing but struggles with long-term dependencies due to the problem of vanishing gradients.

I'll provide three concrete code examples to demonstrate these internal variables:

**Example 1: Inspecting the Variables After Cell Creation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20

cell = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNNCell(units=hidden_size)

print("--- Initial Weights ---")
print(f"Kernel shape: {cell.kernel.shape}")
print(f"Bias shape: {cell.bias.shape}")

# Create dummy inputs to initialize the build and trigger weights to be allocated
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=[1, 1, input_size])  # Batch size 1, Time Step 1
cell(input_tensor, states = [tf.random.normal(shape = [1,hidden_size])])

print("\n--- Weights After Call ---")
print(f"Kernel Value:\n {cell.kernel.numpy()}")
print(f"Bias Value:\n {cell.bias.numpy()}")

```

This code first defines a `SimpleRNNCell`, which behaves as the TensorFlow implementation of the basic RNN. It specifies input size of 10 and hidden size of 20, then prints the initial shape of the kernel and bias. It's important to note that these weights do not get initialized or constructed without an initial call, so a random input of a batch size of 1 is passed to trigger the creation and instantiation of the internal variables. The shapes of the variables match my earlier explanation: kernel has a shape of `[input_size + hidden_size, hidden_size]`, i.e. `[30, 20]` and bias has a shape of `[hidden_size]`, i.e. `[20]`.  After the call, the initialized values are printed. This illustrates that these variables are the core parameters of the cell, ready to be optimized by a gradient descent method.

**Example 2: Custom Cell with Weight Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class CustomRNNCell(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, input_dim, **kwargs):
        super(CustomRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.input_dim = input_dim

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(self.input_dim + self.units, self.units),
                                     initializer=tf.keras.initializers.GlorotUniform(),
                                     name='kernel')
        self.bias = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                   initializer=tf.zeros_initializer(),
                                   name='bias')
        super(CustomRNNCell, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        prev_output = states[0] # Unpack the tuple of states.
        concat_input = tf.concat([inputs, prev_output], axis=1)
        output = tf.tanh(tf.matmul(concat_input, self.kernel) + self.bias)
        return output, [output]

input_size = 5
hidden_size = 8
custom_cell = CustomRNNCell(units=hidden_size, input_dim=input_size)

# dummy data to trigger construction
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=[1,input_size])
states_tensor = [tf.random.normal(shape=[1,hidden_size])]
outputs, updated_state = custom_cell(input_tensor, states=states_tensor)

print("--- Custom Cell Weights ---")
print(f"Kernel Value:\n {custom_cell.kernel.numpy()}")
print(f"Bias Value:\n {custom_cell.bias.numpy()}")

```

Here, a custom RNN cell is explicitly implemented, showing how the kernel and bias are defined within a custom subclass of `tf.keras.layers.Layer`. Notice that the dimensions of the kernel and bias are explicitly specified within the `build` method, matching the expected sizes. Glorot uniform initialization (Xavier) is used for the kernel weights and zero initialization is used for the bias, demonstrating that these initializers are directly used to create the variables. The `call` method implements the forward pass of the basic RNN, showing exactly how the inputs, previous states, kernel, and bias are used to produce the output. This example highlights that even in custom implementations, the core functionality revolves around these two core variables. Note the unpacking of the list of states, where there is only 1 state, the previous hidden state.

**Example 3: Accessing Weights in a RNN Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_size = 4
hidden_size = 6

rnn_layer = tf.keras.layers.RNN(tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNNCell(units=hidden_size), return_sequences = True)
#dummy input to trigger initialization
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=[1,3,input_size]) # Batch 1, Time Steps 3
output = rnn_layer(input_tensor)

print("--- RNN Layer Weights ---")
weights = rnn_layer.weights
for weight in weights:
    print(f"Weight name: {weight.name}, Shape: {weight.shape}")
```
This example wraps the `SimpleRNNCell` within a `tf.keras.layers.RNN` layer, which is a standard way to use an RNN in TensorFlow. It shows how to access the weights that are present in the rnn_layer by accessing its weights property and iterating through them and printing their names and shapes. The shapes of the returned weights will be the same as in example 1, but this shows how to access them when the cell is used in a larger RNN layer. This demonstrates how the internal variables are encapsulated within the higher-level layer and underscores the consistent role these variables play. It should be emphasized that the `SimpleRNNCell` will only create a single state that is an output from the cell. The output will then be fed to the same cell for the next time step. This is important to note as this differs from LSTMs and GRUs that will have a cell state and hidden state.

For further study, I would suggest focusing on understanding how gradient descent works to modify the weights, and how the activation function influences the output, as these concepts apply directly to the described internal variables. Resources such as the TensorFlow documentation on RNNs, and general deep learning theory books that cover recurrent networks, provide a comprehensive background. I would recommend focusing on the theory, as practical implementations will become easier to understand with an understanding of the fundamentals. Understanding the impact of different weight initializers and the implications of choosing specific hidden sizes are additional areas that would improve a deeper understanding of this topic. A foundational understanding of linear algebra also will be useful, as the computations are fundamentally based in matrix multiplications. The variables described here represent the basic building blocks of recurrent networks, and the basic understanding of how they function allows for the study of more complex mechanisms found in modern recurrent cell types.
