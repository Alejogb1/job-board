TensorFlow's memory management differs significantly from Keras's, primarily due to their architectural distinctions and levels of abstraction.  My experience optimizing large-scale deep learning models over the past decade has consistently revealed that apparent memory issues attributed to TensorFlow often stem from a misunderstanding of its underlying graph execution model, not an inherent flaw.  Keras, being a higher-level API, largely abstracts away these complexities, leading to a perception of better memory management.  However, this is a simplification; Keras ultimately relies on TensorFlow (or other backends) for computation, and underlying memory issues can still manifest.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow, at its core, constructs a computational graph before execution. This graph represents the entire computation as a series of operations, allowing for optimizations like graph fusion and parallel execution. However, this graph construction can consume considerable memory, particularly with complex models or large datasets.  The entire graph, including intermediate tensors, is held in memory until execution.  This static nature contrasts sharply with eager execution, where operations are executed immediately.  Early versions of TensorFlow primarily employed graph execution, leading to significant memory overhead.  While TensorFlow 2.x introduced eager execution by default, the ability to switch to graph execution persists, and many production environments still leverage it for performance gains.

Keras, in contrast, operates at a higher level of abstraction.  It offers a user-friendly interface to define and train models without explicit graph management.  While it uses a backend (often TensorFlow), Keras handles much of the underlying graph construction and execution, buffering and releasing memory more efficiently for the user.  The Keras API simplifies memory management by automatically managing tensor lifetimes within its internal framework. This does not mean Keras eliminates memory constraints; rather, it masks many of the intricacies of TensorFlow's memory management from the user.

In essence, memory issues perceived as "Keras" issues are often really latent TensorFlow issues, hidden by Keras's abstraction layer.  If a Keras model using a TensorFlow backend encounters memory problems, it likely indicates a problem with the model's architecture, dataset size, or the underlying TensorFlow configuration, not a fundamental deficiency within Keras itself.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating TensorFlow's Graph Execution Memory Consumption:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a large tensor
large_tensor = tf.random.normal((10000, 10000))

# Perform an operation on the tensor.  Intermediate results are stored in the graph.
result = tf.matmul(large_tensor, large_tensor)

# Even after this operation, large_tensor is likely still in memory if using graph execution (tf.compat.v1.Session)
# because the entire computational graph is held in memory until execution is finalized.

# To see memory usage, use tools like memory_profiler or monitor system memory.  
# This would show high memory consumption even though the result variable is much smaller.
```

This example highlights how, in a traditional graph execution model, even temporary variables are retained until the graph is fully executed.  The significant memory consumption from `large_tensor` persists despite its ultimate contribution to a smaller result.


**Example 2: Keras's Efficient Memory Management:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense

# Define a Keras model
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model. Keras handles memory allocation and deallocation efficiently.
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training loop where Keras manages memory better than the equivalent explicit TensorFlow code.
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

Here, Keras automatically handles memory management during model training.  Intermediate tensors are released as needed, preventing the accumulation of unused data. This is a key difference from explicitly managing memory within TensorFlow.  Note the use of batch_size to further reduce memory footprint by processing the dataset in smaller chunks.


**Example 3:  Illustrating Potential Memory Leaks in Eager Execution (despite Keras):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense

# Define a Keras model (eager execution is the default in TF 2.x)
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Potential memory leak:  Improperly managing large tensors outside the Keras model.
large_tensor = tf.random.normal((100000, 784)) # Large dataset not directly used by model.
# If this is not explicitly deleted after use, it may lead to memory issues although they are unrelated to Keras directly.
# This situation highlights that while Keras helps, it doesn't entirely solve all memory problems.

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
del large_tensor #Crucially, delete this after use.
```

Even with eager execution, improper management of tensors outside the Keras model can result in memory leaks. This demonstrates that while Keras improves memory handling, external factors can still introduce issues.  The crucial `del large_tensor` line demonstrates the need for explicit memory management outside the Keras environment.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation;  a comprehensive guide to TensorFlow internals;  advanced guides on memory profiling in Python;  tutorials on efficient data handling in deep learning.  These resources will provide more detailed insights into TensorFlowâ€™s memory management and techniques for optimizing memory usage in deep learning applications.
