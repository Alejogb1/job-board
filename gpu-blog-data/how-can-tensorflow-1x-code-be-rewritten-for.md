The core shift in migrating from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x centers around the elimination of the `Session` object and the adoption of the eager execution paradigm.  My experience porting large-scale production models from TensorFlow 1.x, primarily in the context of image recognition and natural language processing, highlights this as the most significant hurdle.  The reliance on `tf.compat.v1` for bridging the gap is often insufficient for a complete and efficient transition, necessitating a deeper understanding of TensorFlow 2.x's functional and object-oriented approaches.

**1.  Eager Execution and `tf.function`:**

TensorFlow 1.x relied on building a computation graph and then executing it within a `Session`.  TensorFlow 2.x, by default, executes operations immediately. This "eager execution" simplifies debugging and improves the interactive experience.  However, for performance optimization, especially in large models, the `tf.function` decorator becomes crucial.  It compiles Python functions into TensorFlow graphs, thereby enabling efficient execution.

**2.  Data Handling and Datasets:**

TensorFlow 1.x primarily used `tf.data.Dataset` but often required manual queue management and more complex feeding mechanisms.  TensorFlow 2.x simplifies this substantially.  The `tf.data.Dataset` API remains central but provides more streamlined methods for creating, transforming, and pre-fetching data. The emphasis has shifted towards creating highly optimized pipelines using the functional approach of `Dataset.map`, `Dataset.batch`, and `Dataset.prefetch`.  I've found this significantly reduces memory consumption and improves training speed, especially when dealing with large datasets.  Effectively migrating requires replacing custom queueing logic with the improved capabilities of the `tf.data` API.

**3.  Layer-based Models:**

The `tf.layers` API in TensorFlow 1.x has been deprecated.  TensorFlow 2.x uses the `tf.keras.layers` API extensively. This shift aligns with the Keras integration, which became a core component in TensorFlow 2.x.  This change necessitates rebuilding models using the Keras sequential or functional APIs, replacing custom layer implementations with their Keras equivalents. My experience shows that this refactoring is generally straightforward, but meticulous attention to layer parameters and hyperparameter settings is necessary to ensure functional equivalence.  Custom layers often need careful adaptation to the Keras style, ensuring that they correctly handle variable creation and weight updates within the Keras framework.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Simple Linear Regression (TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x)**

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()  # Essential for TF 1.x
W = tf.compat.v1.Variable(tf.random.normal([1]), name='weight')
b = tf.compat.v1.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name='bias')

def model(x):
    return W * x + b

x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None,1])
y = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None,1])

pred = model(x)
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(pred - y))

optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01)
train = optimizer.minimize(loss)

sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

# ... training loop ...
sess.close()


# TensorFlow 2.x
import tensorflow as tf

W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1]), name='weight')
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name='bias')

@tf.function
def model(x):
  return W * x + b

x = tf.random.normal([100, 1])
y = tf.random.normal([100, 1])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

for i in range(1000):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    pred = model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(pred - y))

  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [W, b])
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [W, b]))

```

Commentary:  The TensorFlow 1.x code relies heavily on `tf.compat.v1`, placeholders, sessions, and explicit variable initialization.  The TensorFlow 2.x equivalent uses eager execution, `tf.Variable` directly, and `tf.function` for optimization. The optimizer and gradient computation are also significantly streamlined.

**Example 2:  Simple CNN (TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x)**

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()
x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 28, 28, 1])
y_ = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10])

conv1 = tf.layers.conv2d(x, 32, 5, activation=tf.nn.relu)
pool1 = tf.layers.max_pooling2d(conv1, 2, 2)
... #more layers

# ... loss function, optimizer, training loop using tf.compat.v1...

#TensorFlow 2.x
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (5, 5), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    # ... more layers ...
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

Commentary: The TensorFlow 1.x example uses `tf.layers`. The TensorFlow 2.x version leverages the `tf.keras.Sequential` API for a more concise and readable model definition, using Keras layers directly.

**Example 3: Custom Layer Migration (TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x)**

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.compat.v1.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__()
        self.W = tf.compat.v1.get_variable("W", shape=[10, 10])

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.W)

# TensorFlow 2.x
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer

class MyLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.W = self.add_weight(shape=(10, 10), initializer='random_normal', name='W')

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.W)
```

Commentary: This shows the adaptation of a custom layer. Note the changes in inheritance, variable creation (`tf.compat.v1.get_variable` vs `self.add_weight`), and the use of Keras's weight initialization mechanisms.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the migration guides and API references for TensorFlow 2.x, are invaluable resources.  Furthermore, exploring the Keras documentation and tutorials is crucial due to the increased integration of Keras into TensorFlow 2.x.  Finally, several well-regarded books cover advanced topics in TensorFlow, providing deeper insights into the framework's functionalities and best practices for model development and deployment.  Consider reviewing materials on graph optimization techniques for TensorFlow 2.x, as these can significantly improve performance.
