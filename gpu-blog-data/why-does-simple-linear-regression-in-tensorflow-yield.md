Linear regression, when implemented naively in TensorFlow without adequate consideration for data scaling, can indeed produce near-zero coefficients, even if a strong linear relationship exists in the input data. This primarily stems from the interaction between the model's learning rate and the scale of the input features.

Specifically, TensorFlow optimizers, particularly gradient-based methods like Adam or SGD, update model weights (the coefficients in linear regression) based on the magnitude of the gradient of the loss function. If the input features have significantly larger magnitudes than the target variable, the gradients with respect to the weights associated with those features will also be correspondingly large. To manage this, we often employ a small learning rate. However, a small learning rate applied to these large gradients results in correspondingly small weight updates. The consequence is that it takes an inordinately long time for the model to converge towards the optimal coefficients, often effectively resulting in coefficients that are close to zero after a typical number of training iterations. In contrast, the bias term, which is independent of input feature scale, may adjust more readily.

The issue is not with TensorFlow’s implementation, nor the theory of linear regression itself, but with the way in which the input data is presented to the model. Consider a situation where you are modelling the relationship between the square footage of a house (ranging from 500 to 5000) and its price (ranging from \$100,000 to \$1,000,000). The input, square footage, is numerically far larger than the output, the price. This difference in scale directly affects the learning process. Even if the underlying relationship is perfectly linear (e.g., price = k*square footage + b), the optimizer struggles to effectively adjust the weight (k) due to the gradient-scaling issue described above.

To address this, the common practice is to scale the input features to a smaller, comparable range. A typical method is standardization, which scales each feature to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This ensures that all features have a similar numerical range, preventing some weights from dominating the learning process simply because of their associated input features' magnitude. Another effective method is min-max scaling, which bounds each feature to range from 0 to 1. While not always necessary, scaling the target variable can also sometimes improve convergence, especially when very large target values are involved.

Let's illustrate this with examples.

**Example 1: No Scaling (Leads to Near-Zero Coefficients)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data with a linear relationship
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 4500 + 500 # House footage, range 500-5000
y = 100 * X + 20000 + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 10000 # House price with some noise

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,), use_bias=True)
])

# Compile the model
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=200, verbose=0) # Reduced verbosity for clarity

# Retrieve the weights and bias
weights = model.get_weights()
print("Weights:", weights[0][0])
print("Bias:", weights[1])
```

In this example, the `X` values (simulating house square footage) range from 500 to 5000, while the `y` values (simulating house price) are significantly lower, initially around 100,000-500,000 with noise added. Running this code produces a weight (the coefficient for the square footage) that's close to zero, even though we’ve designed a clear linear relation between X and y. In my experience, the issue is quite prevalent when first engaging with Tensorflow. Notice the bias, however, adjusts much more significantly.

**Example 2: Standardization (Solves the Issue)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data with a linear relationship (same data as before)
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 4500 + 500
y = 100 * X + 20000 + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 10000

# Standardization of input data
mean_X = np.mean(X)
std_X = np.std(X)
X_scaled = (X - mean_X) / std_X

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,), use_bias=True)
])

# Compile the model
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_scaled, y, epochs=200, verbose=0)

# Retrieve the weights and bias
weights = model.get_weights()
print("Weights:", weights[0][0])
print("Bias:", weights[1])
```

In this adjusted example, I implemented standardization of the input feature `X`. The mean and standard deviation of `X` are calculated and used to scale the input data before training. This results in weights that are not near zero, and therefore correctly reflect the underlying relationship between X and y (scaled, of course). Although the weights are now on a different scale than before, the model is able to converge properly, learning the underlying linear relationship. I've encountered several similar issues where a small amount of feature engineering makes all the difference.

**Example 3: Min-Max Scaling (Alternative Solution)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data with a linear relationship (same data as before)
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 4500 + 500
y = 100 * X + 20000 + np.random.randn(100, 1) * 10000

# Min-Max scaling of input data
min_X = np.min(X)
max_X = np.max(X)
X_scaled = (X - min_X) / (max_X - min_X)

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(1,), use_bias=True)
])

# Compile the model
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_scaled, y, epochs=200, verbose=0)

# Retrieve the weights and bias
weights = model.get_weights()
print("Weights:", weights[0][0])
print("Bias:", weights[1])
```
Example three illustrates another method, min-max scaling. Here, the input `X` is scaled to fit within the range of [0,1]. The model behaves in a similar way to the prior example: the learned weight, while scaled differently, is not near zero. This demonstrates the general principle: input data scaling is critical. While both scaling methods work effectively in this situation, I have found that the optimal method tends to depend on the specific dataset.

In conclusion, encountering near-zero coefficients in linear regression with TensorFlow is not due to a flaw in the algorithm or framework. It almost invariably stems from unscaled input features coupled with a small learning rate, resulting in vanishingly small weight updates during training. Standardizing or min-max scaling the input features resolves this by ensuring all features have a similar numerical range. This allows the optimizer to effectively update the weights and converge to a reasonable model. I would strongly encourage anyone encountering similar behavior to consider applying feature scaling before exploring more complex solutions.

Regarding resources, I recommend exploring documentation specifically related to machine learning preprocessing techniques and numerical optimization. Specifically, materials on gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and variants like Adam are beneficial, as well as discussions of data scaling methods and feature engineering. Additionally, studying case studies or tutorials that focus on handling numerical stability and improving training convergence in deep learning will prove invaluable.
