Windowed datasets significantly enhance time series prediction by transforming the inherently sequential nature of the data into a more readily digestible format for machine learning models.  My experience working on high-frequency financial trading models revealed the critical role this transformation plays in improving both model accuracy and training efficiency.  The core concept lies in converting each time point's prediction problem into a supervised learning task using a preceding segment of the time series as input features. This addresses the temporal dependencies characteristic of time series data, a feature traditional regression models often struggle to capture effectively.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Standard time series prediction often involves directly feeding the entire historical sequence to a model.  This is computationally expensive for long sequences and can lead to overfitting or difficulty capturing relevant temporal patterns. Windowing, conversely, creates a dataset where each row represents a specific time window.  The features are the observations within that window (e.g., the past 10 days of stock prices), and the target variable is the observation at a future time point (e.g., the stock price 1 day ahead).  This framing neatly aligns with the supervised learning paradigm employed by many successful machine learning algorithms.

The size and type of the window are crucial hyperparameters.  A larger window captures more historical context but might obscure recent trends or increase computational demands. Conversely, a smaller window might miss important long-term patterns, resulting in lower prediction accuracy.  Moreover, the choice of how to construct the window (e.g., sliding window, expanding window) influences the resulting dataset.  A sliding window extracts consecutive, overlapping windows, creating a larger dataset but with potential for redundancy. An expanding window uses progressively larger windows for each training example, capturing increasingly more historical information.  The optimal window size and type are highly dependent on the specific time series and the chosen prediction model.

Furthermore, feature engineering within the windowed context is essential.  Simple windowing might only include raw values; however, augmenting the feature space with derived features, such as lagged differences, rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.), or indicators of seasonality or trend, can significantly improve predictive performance. The inclusion of external regressors within the window also strengthens the model's capacity to explain variance in the target variable and improve prediction accuracy.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate windowing techniques using Python and the Pandas library.  I've relied heavily on this combination during my development of various predictive models.  These examples demonstrate different windowing strategies and feature engineering approaches.

**Example 1: Sliding Window with Basic Features**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def create_sliding_window(data, window_size, prediction_horizon):
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - window_size - prediction_horizon + 1):
        X.append(data[i:i + window_size])
        y.append(data[i + window_size + prediction_horizon -1])
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)

# Sample data (replace with your actual time series)
data = pd.Series(np.random.rand(100))

# Define window size and prediction horizon
window_size = 10
prediction_horizon = 1

# Create windowed dataset
X, y = create_sliding_window(data, window_size, prediction_horizon)

print(X.shape, y.shape) #Output will show the shape of the created dataset
```

This code implements a sliding window approach.  It takes the time series `data`, `window_size`, and `prediction_horizon` as input.  The function iterates through the data, creating features `X` (the window) and the target variable `y` (the future value).  The output shapes clearly indicate the number of samples and features.  Note that this example utilizes only raw values within the window.

**Example 2: Expanding Window with Lagged Differences**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def create_expanding_window(data, max_window_size, prediction_horizon):
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(prediction_horizon, len(data)):
        window_size = i
        if window_size > max_window_size:
            window_size = max_window_size
        window = data[i - window_size:i]
        #Calculate lagged differences
        lagged_diff = np.diff(window)
        X.append(np.concatenate((window, lagged_diff))) # Combining raw values and lagged difference
        y.append(data[i + prediction_horizon -1])
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)


data = pd.Series(np.random.rand(100))
max_window_size = 20
prediction_horizon = 1

X, y = create_expanding_window(data, max_window_size, prediction_horizon)
print(X.shape, y.shape)
```

This example utilizes an expanding window, progressively increasing the window size with each data point.  Crucially, it demonstrates feature engineering by calculating lagged differences, thereby capturing the rate of change within the window. Concatenating these lagged differences with the original values significantly enriches the feature set.

**Example 3:  Sliding Window with Rolling Statistics**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

data = pd.Series(np.random.rand(100))
window_size = 10
prediction_horizon = 1

# Calculate rolling statistics
rolling_mean = data.rolling(window=window_size).mean()
rolling_std = data.rolling(window=window_size).std()

# Concatenate features
features = pd.concat([data, rolling_mean, rolling_std], axis=1).dropna()

# Create sliding window from enhanced features
X = []
y = []
for i in range(len(features) - window_size - prediction_horizon + 1):
    X.append(features.iloc[i:i + window_size].values)
    y.append(features.iloc[i + window_size + prediction_horizon - 1][0])


X = np.array(X)
y = np.array(y)
print(X.shape, y.shape)
```

Here, we again use a sliding window, but the features are augmented with rolling mean and standard deviation.  This captures both the level and volatility of the time series within the window, improving the model's ability to account for variations in data behavior. Note the use of `.dropna()` to handle NaN values resulting from the rolling calculations at the beginning of the time series.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control" by Box, Jenkins, and Reinsel; "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos;  "Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting" by Douglas C. Montgomery, Cheryl L. Jennings, and Murat Kulahci.  These provide comprehensive theoretical foundations and practical guidance.  Furthermore, specialized literature on the chosen prediction models (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks, ARIMA models) should be consulted for optimal implementation and parameter tuning.  Finally, careful exploration of the properties of your specific time series data will be instrumental in selecting the appropriate windowing strategy and feature engineering techniques.
