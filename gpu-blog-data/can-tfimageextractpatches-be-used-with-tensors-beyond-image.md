TensorFlow's `tf.image.extract_patches` operation, at its core, performs a sliding window extraction over a tensor. While often associated with image data, the underlying mechanics are independent of the semantic interpretation of the tensor's contents. I've frequently employed this operation in contexts far removed from traditional image processing, leveraging its efficient windowing capability for sequential data and other multi-dimensional tensors. Therefore, the answer is yes; `tf.image.extract_patches` can indeed be used with tensors beyond image data, given careful consideration to the shape and interpretation of the input tensor.

The primary mechanism by which `tf.image.extract_patches` functions is by dividing the input tensor into overlapping or non-overlapping patches based on the defined patch sizes, strides, and rates. The core tensor dimension requirements are a rank of at least 4 and that the second and third dimensions are compatible with the defined patch extraction parameters. The first dimension is typically interpreted as batch size and the fourth represents the channels, feature maps or the like, when working with images. However, these semantic designations are not enforced by the operation; instead they are determined by how the user interprets the tensor's structure. When using the operation on non-image tensors, these dimensions become user-defined data characteristics.

Let's consider a scenario I encountered during a time series analysis project. We had sensor data collected from a complex mechanical system. This data was organized as a tensor of shape `[batch_size, time_steps, num_sensors, num_features]` where each time step contains readings from multiple sensors each generating multiple features. We needed to extract small time-windows from multiple sensors for training our model. `tf.image.extract_patches` provided an efficient mechanism for generating this. Specifically, the `time_steps` axis became equivalent to height and `num_sensors` to width when providing the parameters of the patch extraction. The batch size and feature dimensions are treated in a usual manner. Critically, I utilized strides along the second dimension to define the overlapping or non-overlapping sequences, providing fine control over the sampling rate of our windowed data.

The challenge in employing `tf.image.extract_patches` with non-image data lies in properly configuring the parameters to represent the intended windowing operation. The `sizes` parameter dictates the shape of the extraction window along the second and third dimensions. The `strides` parameter specifies the movement of the window across these dimensions, and `rates` determines how many data points the filter skips when extracting samples. Padding options similarly dictate how to treat samples around boundaries. A misconfigured `sizes`, `strides`, or `rates` parameter results in an extraction that does not reflect the desired temporal or spatial partitioning. Furthermore, the output tensor is a flattened set of patches, requiring a reshape operation to recover a desired structure, which is a common and necessary step.

Let's delve into specific code examples to solidify this concept, highlighting the versatility and the need to handle dimension reshaping.

**Example 1: Sequential Data Windowing**

Consider a time-series tensor representing sensor readings:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor: [batch_size, time_steps, num_sensors, num_features]
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=[1, 100, 4, 2])

# Extract 10-timestep windows with stride 5 along time_steps axis
patches = tf.image.extract_patches(
    images=input_tensor,
    sizes=[1, 10, 1, 1],
    strides=[1, 5, 1, 1],
    rates=[1, 1, 1, 1],
    padding='VALID'
)

# Reshape the output
output_shape = patches.shape.as_list()
window_size = output_shape[2] # Product of patch sizes along 2nd and 3rd axes (10x1 in this case)
num_windows = output_shape[1] # Number of patches extracted from the input tensor
num_sensors = input_tensor.shape[2]
num_features = input_tensor.shape[3]

reshaped_output = tf.reshape(patches, [1, num_windows, window_size, num_sensors, num_features])

print("Original Tensor Shape:", input_tensor.shape)
print("Patches Shape:", patches.shape)
print("Reshaped Output Shape:", reshaped_output.shape)
```
In this example, the `sizes` parameter `[1, 10, 1, 1]` extracts windows of 10 timesteps each, while the `strides` parameter `[1, 5, 1, 1]` moves the window by 5 steps along the second dimension, generating overlapping windows.  The subsequent reshape operation restores the desired output structure by reinterpreting the flattened representation of the patches into a useful output. Note that we set sizes, strides, and rates at 1 along non-relevant dimensions to leave them unchanged. The output tensor will be of shape `[1, (number of windows), 10, 4, 2]`.

**Example 2: Grid-Like Data Extraction**

Now, suppose we have data representing a 2D grid of measurements:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor: [batch_size, height, width, features]
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=[1, 20, 30, 3])

# Extract 5x5 patches with stride 3 along both height and width
patches = tf.image.extract_patches(
    images=input_tensor,
    sizes=[1, 5, 5, 1],
    strides=[1, 3, 3, 1],
    rates=[1, 1, 1, 1],
    padding='VALID'
)
output_shape = patches.shape.as_list()
window_size = output_shape[2] # Product of patch sizes along 2nd and 3rd axes (5x5 in this case)
num_rows = output_shape[1] # Number of rows of patches
num_cols = patches.shape[1]//num_rows # number of cols of patches
num_features = input_tensor.shape[3]
reshaped_output = tf.reshape(patches, [1,num_rows, num_cols, 5, 5, num_features])

print("Original Tensor Shape:", input_tensor.shape)
print("Patches Shape:", patches.shape)
print("Reshaped Output Shape:", reshaped_output.shape)

```

Here, we are not dealing with images directly but using `tf.image.extract_patches` to extract overlapping regions, each of size 5x5, with a stride of 3. This is equivalent to applying a sliding window over a 2D grid, useful for tasks like processing spatial relationships in non-image datasets. Again, we must perform a reshape operation to recover the individual patches. The final reshaped output here will have dimensions `[1, number of rows of extracted patches, number of cols of extracted patches, 5, 5, 3]`.

**Example 3: Multi-Sensor, Multi-Feature Time Series**

In some advanced use cases I've worked with, we needed to extract patches with differing window sizes and strides depending on the sensor type.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# Input tensor: [batch_size, time_steps, num_sensors, num_features]
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=[1, 100, 3, 2]) # Example with 3 sensors and 2 features each
# Sensor 1 patches
sensor1_patches = tf.image.extract_patches(
    images=input_tensor[:, :, 0:1, :], # Select the first sensor
    sizes=[1, 20, 1, 1],
    strides=[1, 10, 1, 1],
    rates=[1, 1, 1, 1],
    padding='VALID'
)

# Sensor 2 patches
sensor2_patches = tf.image.extract_patches(
    images=input_tensor[:,:,1:2,:], # Select the second sensor
    sizes=[1, 10, 1, 1],
    strides=[1, 5, 1, 1],
    rates=[1,1,1,1],
    padding='VALID'
)

# Sensor 3 patches
sensor3_patches = tf.image.extract_patches(
    images=input_tensor[:,:,2:3,:], # Select the third sensor
     sizes=[1, 5, 1, 1],
    strides=[1, 2, 1, 1],
    rates=[1,1,1,1],
    padding='VALID'
)

# Reshaping and output handling (simplified)
s1_output_shape = sensor1_patches.shape.as_list()
s2_output_shape = sensor2_patches.shape.as_list()
s3_output_shape = sensor3_patches.shape.as_list()

print("Original Tensor Shape:", input_tensor.shape)
print("Sensor 1 Patches Shape:", sensor1_patches.shape)
print("Sensor 2 Patches Shape:", sensor2_patches.shape)
print("Sensor 3 Patches Shape:", sensor3_patches.shape)
```
In this advanced scenario, `tf.image.extract_patches` was used independently for each sensor, allowing for different patch extraction strategies and thus, greater versatility for data analysis.

To further enhance understanding, I suggest exploring resources documenting TensorFlow's core tensor operations and their mathematical underpinnings. A thorough grounding in linear algebra principles is useful to grasp how matrix and tensor operations interact in the context of these non-image data applications. Resources detailing data manipulation and shaping in TensorFlow is also very helpful when handling the reshaped patches after using the operation. Specific guides to TensorFlow APIs will provide more detailed explanations of the operation's parameters. With a deeper understanding of these fundamental concepts, leveraging the power of `tf.image.extract_patches` beyond its common image processing usage becomes intuitive.
