The numerical instability of the sigmoid function, particularly when implemented directly in code, often results in Not-a-Number (NaN) outputs when inputs are very large or very small. This is not an inherent flaw in the sigmoid's mathematical definition, but rather an artifact of how floating-point arithmetic handles extreme values within a limited bit representation.

The sigmoid function, defined as Ïƒ(x) = 1 / (1 + e<sup>-x</sup>), squashes any real-valued input into the range (0, 1). This makes it useful in binary classification and neural networks as an activation function. However, its behavior becomes problematic when `x` is either a very large positive number or a very large negative number.

When `x` is a very large positive number, `e^-x` approaches zero. In ideal mathematics, 1 / (1 + 0) simplifies to 1. However, computers represent floating-point numbers using a limited number of bits. For very large `x`, `e^-x` becomes so small that it is rounded down to zero during floating-point operations. Consequently, the expression 1/(1+0) evaluates to 1. While mathematically correct, the intermediate loss of information can cascade into other issues.

The actual issue arises when `x` is a very large *negative* number. In this scenario, `e^-x` becomes a very large *positive* number. Because of memory limitations, the floating-point representation of very large positive values can overflow, particularly before the division operation. This overflow often results in an `infinity` representation which, when added to `1`, is still `infinity`. Consequently, dividing `1` by `infinity` yields `0` in many systems. However, what commonly triggers a NaN is the lack of representation for such extreme values before division, causing undefined mathematical operations that results to `NaN`.

To illustrate this, consider a situation I encountered when developing a custom machine-learning framework. Initially, I implemented the sigmoid function directly as the mathematical definition. I quickly noticed the presence of NaN values during the training phase. The input to the sigmoid activation often grew very large due to unstable weights during backpropagation. Direct implementation of the sigmoid as shown below inevitably results in `NaN` for some inputs.

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid_naive(x):
    """Naive implementation of the sigmoid function."""
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Example with a large negative number, likely to cause overflow
x_large_neg = -750
result_naive = sigmoid_naive(x_large_neg)
print(f"Naive sigmoid with very negative input: {result_naive}")

# Example with a large positive number, where exp(-x) is zero due to underflow
x_large_pos = 750
result_naive_pos = sigmoid_naive(x_large_pos)
print(f"Naive sigmoid with very positive input: {result_naive_pos}")
```

In this example, for a large negative number such as -750, `np.exp(-x)` becomes a tremendously large number exceeding the representation limits for float64 leading to NaN. For a large positive number such as 750, while `e^-x` is close to zero and doesn't directly yield `NaN`, the loss of precision leads to similar numerical issues in backpropagation later on when it needs to compute the derivative of sigmoid.

The most common solution is to modify the computation to avoid large exponentials, thus preventing floating-point overflow. We can leverage the following properties:
- If x is positive, we can compute `1 / (1 + e^-x)` directly.
- If x is negative, we can use the equivalent identity: `e^x / (1 + e^x)` by multiplying both numerator and denominator by `e^x`.

Here's an improved version of the sigmoid function implementing this logic that avoids NaN:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid_stable(x):
    """Numerically stable implementation of the sigmoid function."""
    result = np.where(x >= 0,
                    1 / (1 + np.exp(-x)),
                    np.exp(x) / (1 + np.exp(x)))
    return result

x_large_neg = -750
result_stable_neg = sigmoid_stable(x_large_neg)
print(f"Stable sigmoid with very negative input: {result_stable_neg}")

x_large_pos = 750
result_stable_pos = sigmoid_stable(x_large_pos)
print(f"Stable sigmoid with very positive input: {result_stable_pos}")

```

The `np.where` function creates a branch based on whether `x` is positive or negative, ensuring that the exponential term is always operating within a reasonably representable range. This provides a much stable value, where the intermediate results for very large numbers do not lead to NaN. While not eliminating the rounding errors, this significantly prevents the generation of `NaN`. This is a common pattern to make numerical computations stable.

Another way to handle potential overflow is through clipping or saturation, where you limit the range of input to the exponential function itself:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid_clipped(x, clip_value=700):
    """Sigmoid function with input clipping to prevent overflow/underflow"""
    clipped_x = np.clip(x, -clip_value, clip_value)
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-clipped_x))

x_large_neg = -750
result_clipped_neg = sigmoid_clipped(x_large_neg)
print(f"Clipped sigmoid with very negative input: {result_clipped_neg}")

x_large_pos = 750
result_clipped_pos = sigmoid_clipped(x_large_pos)
print(f"Clipped sigmoid with very positive input: {result_clipped_pos}")
```
In this example, we use `np.clip` to ensure that all values are within the range of -700 to 700. This prevents numerical overflow by bounding the arguments of the `exp` function. It is important to note that even with this approach the derivative of the sigmoid function at these clamped values will be zero (or numerically close to zero), thus preventing gradient updates for such inputs.

In practice, I have found the stable version with the `np.where` condition to be the most robust, although the clipping approach could be useful for quick experimentation. Furthermore, using libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for neural network development is also advisable because these libraries implement the sigmoid with numerically stable functions in low-level code.

For further learning, I recommend reviewing material on the following areas:
1.  Numerical Analysis: Textbooks and courses on numerical analysis delve deeply into the properties of floating-point arithmetic and potential sources of numerical instability.
2.  Machine Learning and Deep Learning Books: Many standard machine learning textbooks, specifically those covering neural networks, will discuss numerical stability within activation functions and gradient descent, offering context of why such issues matter.
3.  Floating-point Arithmetic Standards: Publications detailing the IEEE 754 standard provide a comprehensive insight into how computers represent real numbers. Familiarity with these standards is essential to understanding overflow, underflow, and other numerical issues.
By understanding these principles, you can effectively implement numerical algorithms that are less susceptible to issues arising from limited floating-point precision and avoid those troublesome NaN values.
