The `OSError [Errno 22] Invalid argument` and `_pickle.UnpicklingError: pickle data was truncated` errors, while seemingly disparate, often stem from similar underlying causes related to data handling, specifically when file operations and serialization are involved. I've encountered these issues repeatedly during my tenure building data pipelines, and the root cause typically lies in inconsistencies between how data is written and how it’s subsequently read, especially within the context of Python's `pickle` module.

The `OSError [Errno 22] Invalid argument` error, in the context we're examining, generally occurs when a file descriptor or path passed to a system call (such as `open()`, `read()`, or `write()`) is invalid or does not conform to the operating system's expectations. For instance, if a filename includes reserved characters or becomes too long for the file system to handle, you’d see this error. This is a system-level error; Python itself cannot directly resolve it. It's the operating system telling us it can’t understand the request we've made. The key here is that, while the error message refers to an "invalid argument", the problematic argument is often the filename (or path), file descriptor, or flags used during file handling operations, not a direct data issue itself.

Conversely, `_pickle.UnpicklingError: pickle data was truncated` arises specifically during the deserialization of data using Python's `pickle` module. This indicates that the stream of bytes provided to the `pickle.load()` function is incomplete – that is, it does not contain the full serialized representation of the object. This implies the original `pickle.dump()` operation did not fully save the object, or that the file was somehow corrupted or partially accessed while reading. This error isn't related to the validity of the filename at the system level, but the data’s completeness, or lack thereof, at the serialization level.

The connection between these two errors becomes clearer when considering a common scenario: writing pickled data to a file, and then failing to read that file correctly. If the file is only partially written during the `pickle.dump()` operation due to a file handling error (which can potentially cause an `OSError`) or some other interruption, you'll likely receive a `_pickle.UnpicklingError` later when you attempt to read it. The core problem is that incomplete data will eventually be encountered when you try to `load()`. Let's look at how these issues manifest with concrete code examples.

**Code Example 1: Incomplete File Write Leading to `UnpicklingError`**

```python
import pickle
import time
import os

def write_partial_data(filename, data):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
           for item in data:
               pickle.dump(item, f)
               time.sleep(0.01) # Simulate intermittent writing interruption
    except OSError as e:
        print(f"Error during file write: {e}")

def read_data(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
             while True:
                  try:
                      item = pickle.load(f)
                      print(f"Loaded: {item}")
                  except EOFError: # handle complete file
                      break
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during file read: {e}")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_data = list(range(10))
    partial_filename = "partial_data.pkl"
    write_partial_data(partial_filename,test_data)
    read_data(partial_filename)

    os.remove(partial_filename)

```

In this first example, the `write_partial_data` function simulates a write interruption by introducing a small delay between each `pickle.dump()` call. This is an intentional design to show that if the writing process is interrupted before a complete object is written, the resulting file may become problematic for `pickle.load()`. The `read_data` function then attempts to read data from the partially written file. The first error that we *may* encounter while writing is an OSError. However, even if writing was completed successfully with a partial object, the `pickle.load()` operation within the `read_data` will encounter the `_pickle.UnpicklingError` if it attempts to read a partial pickle stream because the stream is considered truncated. We handle EOFError here because a properly formatted file will reach end of file, but the error being discussed here is _pickle.UnpicklingError.

**Code Example 2: Invalid Filename Causing `OSError`**

```python
import pickle

def write_data_invalid_filename(filename, data):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
           pickle.dump(data,f)
    except OSError as e:
        print(f"Error during file write: {e}")

def read_data_invalid_filename(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
            loaded_data = pickle.load(f)
            print(f"Loaded: {loaded_data}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during file read: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    invalid_filename =  "bad_name/file.pkl" # forward slash invalid in many file systems
    test_data = {"a":1, "b":2}

    write_data_invalid_filename(invalid_filename, test_data)
    read_data_invalid_filename(invalid_filename)
```

Here, `write_data_invalid_filename` attempts to write to a file with an invalid name for most file systems - `bad_name/file.pkl`. While the forward slash might be acceptable on Linux-based systems in some circumstances, it's problematic on Windows and will trigger an `OSError [Errno 22] Invalid argument`. Even if this operation were to proceed without an OSError, if a separate reading operation attempts to handle the generated data, an UnpicklingError may or may not occur, as it would depend on the degree of data loss. In short, the error occurs during the `open()` operation. This highlights that the `OSError` is not directly linked to pickling itself but to the system's inability to handle the provided filename.

**Code Example 3: Ensuring Data Integrity using File Locking and Exception Handling**

```python
import pickle
import os
import fcntl

def atomic_write_data(filename, data):
    try:
       with open(filename, "wb") as f:
          fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX) # acquire exclusive lock before writing
          pickle.dump(data,f)
          fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_UN) # Release lock after writing
    except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error while writing {filename} : {e}")

def atomic_read_data(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, "rb") as f:
           fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_SH) # acquire shared lock before reading
           loaded_data = pickle.load(f)
           fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_UN) # release lock after reading
           return loaded_data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error while reading {filename}: {e}")
        return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    correct_filename = "correct_data.pkl"
    test_data = {"x":10, "y":20}

    atomic_write_data(correct_filename, test_data)
    loaded_data = atomic_read_data(correct_filename)
    if loaded_data:
        print(f"Loaded: {loaded_data}")
    os.remove(correct_filename)
```

In this final example, `atomic_write_data` and `atomic_read_data` demonstrate the usage of file locking using the `fcntl` module (available on Unix systems). Before and after the file read and write operations, a shared or exclusive lock is requested to prevent race conditions that can cause data corruption or other inconsistencies that might lead to the errors discussed previously. This method provides an additional layer of assurance in that only one write operation or more than one read operation occurs at any given time, preventing data corruption during file access, making this one suitable to handle concurrency issues.

In summary, while the `OSError` and the `_pickle.UnpicklingError` messages describe distinct problems, they frequently arise from similar causes associated with inconsistent file handling and the nuances of `pickle` serialization, especially incomplete write operations and invalid filenames. Effective error handling and employing more robust practices can help mitigate such problems.

For additional study, I’d recommend focusing on material that covers:
1. **File I/O:** Review the Python documentation related to file operations, especially the handling of different modes ("rb," "wb," "ab," etc.) and potential operating system-related issues.
2. **Python's `pickle` Module:** Deeply explore the behavior of the `pickle` module, including its limitations and best practices for serialization and deserialization.
3. **Concurrency and File Locking:** Study resources explaining file locking mechanisms and strategies for dealing with concurrent access to files within applications. Understanding these concepts, particularly the use of `fcntl` or similar mechanisms will reduce the risk of data corruption in a multi-threaded application.
4. **Operating System Documentation:** Specifically, research the operating system's file system documentation, to know the limitations on filename length and the list of forbidden characters. This may differ depending on the operating system.
