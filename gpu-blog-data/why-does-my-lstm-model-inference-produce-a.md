The "RuntimeError: stack expects each tensor to be equal size" during LSTM inference typically arises from inconsistencies in the input tensor shapes processed at each time step. Specifically, the error signals that when the LSTM processes sequence data, the hidden state and the cell state, which need to be stacked to propagate across time, are not of compatible dimensions. This often stems from how input sequences are batched and how their variable lengths are handled within the inference loop, leading to misaligned or differently padded sequences. I’ve encountered this firsthand when developing time-series anomaly detection models where input sequences had naturally varying lengths, and the issue only surfaced during deployment when input wasn’t standardized like in training.

The error originates within PyTorch's tensor manipulation logic. When the LSTM cell is called repeatedly during inference (or any other recurrent neural network), it expects consistent shape throughout the sequences within a batch. During training, mini-batches are carefully constructed, possibly with padding or truncation to ensure all sequences are of uniform length; however, when inferring on single sequences or real-time streams, the explicit handling of sequence lengths is frequently overlooked, which creates this error during inference.

To further explain, let's consider how an LSTM operates internally. At every time step, it consumes an input element from the sequence and its previous hidden state and cell state. Mathematically, these states are tensors. When an LSTM is processing a batch of sequences, the hidden and cell state tensors for each sequence within the batch are maintained separately. These tensors are expected to have the same dimensions for each time step within the batch. The `torch.stack` operation, which is often implicitly performed by libraries, combines multiple tensors along a new dimension. In the context of an LSTM, this typically happens to group hidden states or output from multiple time steps. If these tensors have mismatched sizes, the stack operation fails with the noted error because tensors can only be stacked if their shapes, except the stacking dimension, are equal.

The inconsistency arises from several common scenarios:

1.  **Variable Sequence Lengths:** During training, padding or truncation is usually applied to make sequences equal. During inference, with a single sequence or with sequences of differing lengths, the pre-processing step may be missing. This causes each sequence to produce different length hidden and cell states which then cannot be stacked together.

2.  **Incorrect Initial Hidden/Cell State:** Initializing these states with incorrect shape during inference. If the initial hidden and cell states are not initialized or are initialized incorrectly, the LSTM processing would not proceed as expected and produce mismatched states during iterations.

3.  **Batch Size Mismatch:** When batching is used during inference, having sequences of different lengths within the batch or incorrect batch size initialization also causes this. When the LSTM runs, it expects the number of hidden states to match the batch size. If the batch size is set incorrectly, it leads to a shape mismatch during state propagation across time steps.

Here are three code examples that demonstrate the cause of the error and how to fix them:

**Example 1: Basic Error Demonstration**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers):
        super(SimpleLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)

    def forward(self, x, hidden_state, cell_state):
        output, (hidden_state, cell_state) = self.lstm(x, (hidden_state, cell_state))
        return output, hidden_state, cell_state

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
num_layers = 1

model = SimpleLSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers)
model.eval()

#Simulate a sequence of length 5
seq_len_1 = 5
input_seq1 = torch.randn(1, seq_len_1, input_size) # batch size of 1
hidden_state = torch.randn(num_layers, 1, hidden_size) # batch size of 1
cell_state = torch.randn(num_layers, 1, hidden_size) # batch size of 1


with torch.no_grad():
    for i in range(seq_len_1):
        output, hidden_state, cell_state = model(input_seq1[:,i:i+1,:], hidden_state, cell_state)

#Simulate another sequence of length 7
seq_len_2 = 7
input_seq2 = torch.randn(1, seq_len_2, input_size) # batch size of 1
# Hidden and cell states NOT correctly initialized here. Same from previous sequence
# The following line will lead to error
with torch.no_grad():
    for i in range(seq_len_2):
        output, hidden_state, cell_state = model(input_seq2[:,i:i+1,:], hidden_state, cell_state)
```

*   **Commentary:** This example shows the error in a simple setting. The initial hidden and cell states are initialized correctly for the first sequence. But, they are not re-initialized correctly before the second sequence, leading to incompatible shapes. The hidden and cell states are passed through the loop for another sequence without re-initialization, which is why we get the error at the next iteration for input\_seq2 because their shape does not match with input sequence 2 batch size.

**Example 2: Handling Variable Lengths with Padding**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence, pack_padded_sequence

class LSTMWithPadding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers):
        super(LSTMWithPadding, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)

    def forward(self, x, lengths):
      packed_x = pack_padded_sequence(x, lengths, batch_first=True, enforce_sorted=False)
      output, (hidden_state, cell_state) = self.lstm(packed_x)
      return output, hidden_state, cell_state

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
num_layers = 1
model = LSTMWithPadding(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers)
model.eval()

# Simulate variable-length sequences
seq_len_1 = 5
input_seq1 = torch.randn(1, seq_len_1, input_size)
seq_len_2 = 7
input_seq2 = torch.randn(1, seq_len_2, input_size)


# Pad sequences
padded_inputs = pad_sequence([input_seq1[0], input_seq2[0]], batch_first=True)

# Generate sequence lengths, must be passed to model
seq_lengths = torch.tensor([seq_len_1, seq_len_2])

# Make sequences a batch
padded_inputs = padded_inputs.unsqueeze(0)

with torch.no_grad():
    output, hidden_state, cell_state = model(padded_inputs, seq_lengths)
```

*   **Commentary:** This example uses padding to manage variable sequence lengths. The sequences are padded to the length of the longest sequence, ensuring all sequences in the batch have the same temporal dimension. The correct sequence lengths are also passed in as an argument. The `pack_padded_sequence` utility function masks the padding while processing the LSTM. Although this is batched, it's still an example how variable length sequences are handled properly.

**Example 3: Proper Handling of Initial State for Single Sequences**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers):
        super(SimpleLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)

    def forward(self, x, hidden_state, cell_state):
        output, (hidden_state, cell_state) = self.lstm(x, (hidden_state, cell_state))
        return output, hidden_state, cell_state

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
num_layers = 1
model = SimpleLSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers)
model.eval()

#Simulate a sequence of length 5
seq_len_1 = 5
input_seq1 = torch.randn(1, seq_len_1, input_size)

# Initialize hidden and cell states with batch size of 1, re-initialize for new input sequence
hidden_state = torch.randn(num_layers, 1, hidden_size)
cell_state = torch.randn(num_layers, 1, hidden_size)

with torch.no_grad():
    for i in range(seq_len_1):
        output, hidden_state, cell_state = model(input_seq1[:,i:i+1,:], hidden_state, cell_state)


#Simulate another sequence of length 7
seq_len_2 = 7
input_seq2 = torch.randn(1, seq_len_2, input_size)

# Re-initialize states correctly here for new sequence
hidden_state = torch.randn(num_layers, 1, hidden_size) # Re-initialize
cell_state = torch.randn(num_layers, 1, hidden_size) # Re-initialize

with torch.no_grad():
    for i in range(seq_len_2):
        output, hidden_state, cell_state = model(input_seq2[:,i:i+1,:], hidden_state, cell_state)
```

*   **Commentary:** This example re-initializes the hidden and cell states correctly for each new input sequence before passing it into the model. This will avoid the error and correctly process the new sequence. Notice that this example processes one sequence at a time.

For resolving similar issues, several resources can provide in-depth information. Focus on PyTorch documentation regarding the `nn.LSTM` module and the utilities in `torch.nn.utils.rnn`, including `pack_padded_sequence` and `pad_sequence`. These are essential tools for correct sequence handling. Also look at tutorials and guides specific to using LSTMs in PyTorch. Exploring the PyTorch forums and tutorials also gives examples of best practices for managing hidden and cell states within recurrent networks. For example, understanding how mini-batching affects the recurrent layer is very critical. Consulting articles on the mathematics of recurrent networks can also provide valuable insight into the necessity for compatible tensor dimensions and padding. Specific keyword research focused on "LSTM inference variable sequence lengths", "PyTorch LSTM hidden state initialization" and "PyTorch RNN padding techniques" would be productive. These resources, while not a complete list, will provide a fundamental base for debugging these issues.
