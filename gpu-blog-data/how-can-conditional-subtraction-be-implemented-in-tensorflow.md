TensorFlow's lack of a direct `conditional_subtract` operation necessitates a strategic approach leveraging its inherent conditional capabilities.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks frequently involved precisely this scenario: selectively subtracting values based on a boolean mask.  The core principle revolves around employing element-wise multiplication and broadcasting to achieve the desired conditional subtraction effect.

**1.  Explanation:**

The fundamental challenge lies in conditionally applying subtraction across tensors.  A direct subtraction (`tensorA - tensorB`) performs the operation uniformly across all elements.  To introduce conditionality, we require a boolean tensor (mask) indicating which elements participate in the subtraction.  This mask, of the same shape as `tensorA` and `tensorB`, dictates where the subtraction occurs.  Where the mask is `True`, the subtraction proceeds; where it's `False`, the corresponding element in `tensorA` remains unchanged.

This is accomplished by multiplying the boolean mask (converted to floating-point type) with the subtraction result.  Because boolean `True` converts to `1.0` and `False` to `0.0`, the multiplication effectively masks the subtraction result, leaving only the subtracted values where the condition is met.  The unchanged elements from `tensorA` are implicitly preserved by the multiplication's effect on the masked subtraction.

This method avoids explicit conditional branching within TensorFlow, benefiting from optimized vectorized operations for improved performance.  Furthermore, it's crucial to ensure type consistency between the boolean mask and the tensors to prevent unintended type coercion errors.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Conditional Subtraction**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_a = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40], dtype=tf.float32)
tensor_b = tf.constant([5, 10, 15, 20], dtype=tf.float32)
mask = tf.constant([True, False, True, False], dtype=tf.bool)

# Convert boolean mask to float32 for element-wise multiplication
mask_float = tf.cast(mask, tf.float32)

# Perform conditional subtraction
result = tensor_a - (mask_float * tensor_b)

print(result)  # Output: tf.Tensor([5. 20. 15. 40.], shape=(4,), dtype=float32)
```

This example demonstrates the basic principle.  The `mask` determines which elements of `tensor_b` are subtracted from the corresponding elements of `tensor_a`.  The `tf.cast` function is vital for seamless element-wise multiplication.  Notice how the elements where `mask` is `False` retain their original values from `tensor_a`.

**Example 2:  Conditional Subtraction with a More Complex Condition**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=tf.float32)
tensor_b = tf.constant([[0.5, 1], [1.5, 2]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Condition: Subtract only if tensor_a > tensor_b
mask = tf.greater(tensor_a, tensor_b)

# Type conversion and conditional subtraction as before
mask_float = tf.cast(mask, tf.float32)
result = tensor_a - (mask_float * tensor_b)

print(result) # Output: tf.Tensor([[0.5, 1. ], [1.5, 2. ]], shape=(2, 2), dtype=float32)

```

This example showcases conditional subtraction based on a comparison between `tensor_a` and `tensor_b`.  `tf.greater` generates the boolean mask dynamically.  The output reflects the selective subtraction based on the condition.  This approach extends readily to other comparison operators (`tf.less`, `tf.equal`, etc.).

**Example 3: Handling Multi-Dimensional Tensors and Broadcasting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_a = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]], dtype=tf.float32)
tensor_b = tf.constant([1, 2], dtype=tf.float32) #Broadcasting tensor
mask = tf.constant([True, False], dtype=tf.bool)

mask_3d = tf.reshape(tf.tile(mask, [2, 2]), tensor_a.shape[:-1]) # Expand mask to match shape of tensor_a
mask_float = tf.cast(mask_3d, tf.float32)

result = tensor_a - (mask_float * tensor_b)

print(result) #Output will reflect the conditional subtraction across the 3D tensor.

```

This demonstrates the application to higher-dimensional tensors and the use of broadcasting.  `tensor_b`, a smaller tensor, is implicitly broadcasted to match the dimensions of `tensor_a` during subtraction.  Crucially, the boolean mask also needs to be properly reshaped and broadcasted to ensure correct element-wise operation.  This highlights the importance of understanding TensorFlow's broadcasting rules for efficient tensor manipulation.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections on tensor manipulation and broadcasting, provide essential information.  Exploring examples within the TensorFlow API documentation is extremely helpful.  A thorough understanding of NumPy's array operations is also beneficial, as many TensorFlow concepts build upon NumPy's foundational principles.  Finally, reviewing resources on boolean masking and vectorization techniques within numerical computing will aid in formulating efficient solutions for complex conditional operations.
