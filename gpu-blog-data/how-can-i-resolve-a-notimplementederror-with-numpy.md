TensorFlow 2.4.1, when used with NumPy array operations within a TensorFlow graph, can sometimes raise a `NotImplementedError`, signaling that a particular NumPy operation isn't directly supported by TensorFlow's graph execution engine. This typically arises because TensorFlow, when building a computation graph, needs to handle numerical computations using its own optimized kernels instead of directly relying on NumPy's runtime. I've encountered this issue particularly when integrating legacy code relying on NumPy functions with newer TensorFlow models, often during data preprocessing steps embedded within a custom layer or function.

The core of the problem stems from TensorFlow’s graph building process. When you execute a TensorFlow operation, it's not instantly evaluated. Instead, TensorFlow creates a symbolic representation of the computation (the graph) which is then optimized and potentially parallelized for execution on CPUs or GPUs. If you use NumPy operations directly within this graph construction phase (e.g., `tf.function`-decorated functions, custom layers), TensorFlow attempts to incorporate those NumPy operations into its own computational framework. If a direct analog of the NumPy operation doesn't exist within TensorFlow, or the implementation hasn't been mapped, the `NotImplementedError` is triggered. Resolving this requires shifting the computation away from NumPy and towards TensorFlow equivalent operations.

The first strategy involves migrating direct NumPy calls to TensorFlow's own numerical functions, often found within the `tf.math` module. This approach preserves the graph's integrity and permits TensorFlow to execute the calculation efficiently. This is preferred when dealing with core mathematical operations like array manipulation, trigonometric functions, or basic arithmetic. For instance, if you use `np.mean` to compute the average of an array, you would want to switch to `tf.reduce_mean`. This avoids the graph compilation issues.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Example of NumPy usage causing NotImplementedError (in a tf.function context)
@tf.function
def numpy_mean_attempt(x):
    # This will raise a NotImplementedError
    return np.mean(x.numpy(), axis=1)

# Corrected TensorFlow implementation
@tf.function
def tensorflow_mean(x):
    return tf.reduce_mean(x, axis=1)


# Demonstration using a tensor
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# The following will result in an error if you try to execute it
# numpy_mean_attempt(input_tensor)

output_tensor = tensorflow_mean(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor)  # Output: tf.Tensor([2. 5.], shape=(2,), dtype=float32)
```
The `numpy_mean_attempt` function, when wrapped in `@tf.function` and used with a TensorFlow tensor, will generate the error during graph construction. However, the corrected `tensorflow_mean` function directly employs `tf.reduce_mean`, which TensorFlow's graph can process and compute. Notice the use of `x.numpy()` inside the numpy implementation. While this line will actually run fine as is, because it executes in "eager" mode, when it is compiled in to a `tf.function` the numpy call will result in the `NotImplementedError`. Eager mode is the default mode when writing a function, but `@tf.function` forces tensorflow to construct a computation graph for execution. This is what leads to problems with numpy calls.

A second technique is to utilize TensorFlow's `tf.numpy_function` wrapper. This function allows you to execute a Python function, potentially containing NumPy calls, within a TensorFlow graph. However, it should be used with caution as it introduces a CPU-bound operation within the graph. It bypasses TensorFlow’s optimizations and graph execution environment, impacting performance. This method is useful when you have NumPy operations not readily translatable to TensorFlow (e.g., certain image processing steps) or when dealing with pre-existing library dependencies. Using this wrapper also requires careful consideration for gradient calculations. TensorFlow cannot automatically differentiate through the wrapped Python function, thus potentially creating issues if the wrapped NumPy code is part of a trainable model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


# Using tf.numpy_function to wrap a NumPy operation
@tf.function
def numpy_function_example(x):
    def numpy_op(x):
        return np.clip(x, 0, 1)
    # Note that you must specify the output shape and type.
    return tf.numpy_function(numpy_op, [x], tf.float32)

input_tensor = tf.constant([-1.0, 0.5, 2.0], dtype=tf.float32)
output_tensor = numpy_function_example(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor) # Output: tf.Tensor([0.  0.5 1. ], shape=(3,), dtype=float32)
```
In this example, the `np.clip` operation is executed inside a TensorFlow graph via `tf.numpy_function`. The `numpy_op` function applies the NumPy clip function. Note the explicit specification of the output type `tf.float32`. If the output shape is not consistent, an error will be thrown.  While this method works, understand its impact on performance and gradient calculation if used within a deep learning model.

The third, often most performant strategy involves transforming your data-processing pipeline so that the NumPy operations are performed outside of the core TensorFlow graph. This would usually mean pre-processing your data on the CPU before it's passed as input to the TensorFlow layers. This approach ensures all operations within the TensorFlow graph are handled efficiently by TensorFlow. This method is most pertinent when handling large datasets, as it ensures that most of the processing is not done within a compiled tensorflow graph.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


# NumPy pre-processing outside the TensorFlow graph
def numpy_preprocess(x):
    return np.array(np.round(x), dtype=np.float32)


# TensorFlow model input
class Model(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='relu')

    def call(self, x):
        return self.dense(x)


model = Model()

# Data pre-processing using NumPy
input_data = tf.constant(
    [0.1, 1.4, 2.7, 3.5, -0.5], dtype=tf.float32
)  # Tensor

numpy_processed = numpy_preprocess(input_data.numpy())  # Conversion and NumPy pre-processing


# Input into TensorFlow model
output = model(numpy_processed)
print(output)
```
Here, the `numpy_preprocess` function rounds the inputs and changes the type, then creates a new array using NumPy, outside of the TensorFlow model. The final model input is passed into the TensorFlow model from the preprocessed data. This approach allows TensorFlow to operate solely on preprocessed data. Preprocessing with numpy outside the model ensures both the performance of numpy and tensorflow are maximized.

In summary, a `NotImplementedError` when using NumPy within a TensorFlow graph points towards a need to transition from NumPy to TensorFlow equivalents or to move NumPy operations outside the TensorFlow graph’s scope. Prefer `tf.math` and other TensorFlow modules for direct numerical operations within your TensorFlow code. Use `tf.numpy_function` as a last resort when direct replacements aren't feasible, understanding the implications for performance and gradient computation. Structuring your code such that NumPy operations occur outside the critical path of graph execution can often provide a balance between code clarity and performance.

For further guidance, I recommend studying the TensorFlow API documentation, particularly focusing on `tf.math`, `tf.numpy_function`, and how to use the `tf.function` decorator effectively. The TensorFlow official tutorials provide example usages of these tools. Finally, reviewing the specific error message and traceback closely can usually indicate precisely which NumPy call is problematic.
