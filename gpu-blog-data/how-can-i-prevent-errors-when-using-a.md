The core issue in employing linear expressions within quadratic forms in DocPlex stems from the fundamental incompatibility of their underlying mathematical structures.  A linear expression represents a first-order polynomial, while a quadratic form necessitates a second-order polynomial.  Direct substitution often leads to unexpected behavior or outright errors, primarily due to DocPlex's internal handling of expression types and constraint generation.  Over my years working with optimization models in CPLEX and its Python API, DocPlex, I've encountered this problem repeatedly, particularly when dealing with complex model formulations involving both linear and quadratic components.  This necessitates a careful and methodical approach to prevent errors.

My experience indicates three primary strategies for mitigating these errors.  The first focuses on leveraging DocPlex's built-in functionalities for constructing quadratic expressions correctly. The second involves restructuring the model to avoid the problematic direct substitution. The third centers around meticulous validation and error handling throughout the model building process.

**1.  Correct Construction of Quadratic Expressions:**

DocPlex provides specific methods for defining quadratic expressions.  Avoid attempting to construct them by simply multiplying linear expressions directly.  This often results in misinterpretations by the solver. Instead, employ the appropriate functions designed to handle quadratic terms. For instance, if you have two decision variables, `x` and `y`, and need to incorporate the term `x*y` in a quadratic objective function or constraint, you should not write `x * y`.  This will likely be treated as a linear term instead of a bilinear term within a quadratic form.  Instead, you should use DocPlex's `quadratic_expression()` method to explicitly define the quadratic component.

**Code Example 1: Correct Quadratic Expression Construction**

```python
from docplex.mp.model import Model

mdl = Model(name='quadratic_example')

x = mdl.continuous_var(name='x', lb=0, ub=10)
y = mdl.continuous_var(name='y', lb=0, ub=10)

# Correct way to define a quadratic term
quadratic_term = mdl.quadratic_expression(x, y, coeff=2) # coefficient of 2 for xy

# Incorporate into objective function
mdl.minimize(x + y + quadratic_term)

# Or into a constraint
mdl.add_constraint(quadratic_term <= 100)

mdl.solve()
print(mdl.solution)
```

This code snippet demonstrates the correct method.  The `quadratic_expression` function explicitly defines the quadratic term `2xy`, ensuring it's correctly interpreted by the solver.  The use of `coeff=2` demonstrates how to handle coefficients within the quadratic expression. Omitting this would implicitly set the coefficient to 1.  Incorrect usage, such as `mdl.minimize(x + y + x*y)`, would misrepresent the intended quadratic nature of the objective function, likely leading to suboptimal solutions or solver errors.


**2. Model Restructuring:**

Sometimes, the most effective strategy involves redesigning the model to avoid the direct inclusion of linear expressions within quadratic components.  This may involve introducing auxiliary variables or reformulating constraints. Consider situations where a linear expression is multiplied by a decision variable.  You could introduce a new variable representing the product and subsequently constrain it to equal the desired linear expression multiplied by the decision variable.  This creates a separate linear constraint that clearly separates linear and quadratic elements within the model.

**Code Example 2: Model Restructuring with Auxiliary Variable**

```python
from docplex.mp.model import Model

mdl = Model(name='restructured_example')

x = mdl.continuous_var(name='x', lb=0, ub=10)
y = mdl.continuous_var(name='y', lb=0, ub=10)
z = mdl.continuous_var(name='z', lb=0) # Auxiliary variable

# Linear expression
linear_expression = 2*x + 3*y

# Restructure to avoid direct multiplication
mdl.add_constraint(z == x * linear_expression)  #Auxiliary variable equals the product.

# Now use 'z' in the quadratic expression correctly
quadratic_term = mdl.quadratic_expression(z, y)

mdl.minimize(quadratic_term)

mdl.solve()
print(mdl.solution)
```

In this example, instead of directly including `x * (2*x + 3*y)` in the objective function, which would be incorrect, we introduce an auxiliary variable `z` to represent this product.  The constraint ensures `z` correctly reflects the value of the product.  The quadratic term now uses `z`, maintaining the integrity of the quadratic expression.


**3. Validation and Error Handling:**

A robust approach always involves thorough validation of the model's structure and components.  Before solving, check the types of expressions used within the quadratic components.  DocPlex provides methods to inspect the types and properties of expressions, enabling you to identify potential issues early.  Furthermore, incorporate error handling mechanisms to catch exceptions during model building and solving.


**Code Example 3:  Type Validation and Error Handling**

```python
from docplex.mp.model import Model
from docplex.mp.utils import is_linear_expr

mdl = Model(name='validation_example')
x = mdl.continuous_var(name='x')
y = mdl.continuous_var(name='y')

#Attempt to create a quadratic expression incorrectly
potentially_erroneous_expression = x * (2*x + y)

if is_linear_expr(potentially_erroneous_expression):
    print("Warning: The expression is linear. Potential error in quadratic context.")
else:
    print("Expression Type Check Passed")


try:
    #Use it incorrectly within a quadratic expression to see if error is caught.
    quadratic_term = mdl.quadratic_expression(potentially_erroneous_expression,y)

    mdl.minimize(quadratic_term)
    mdl.solve()
    print(mdl.solution)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

This code snippet demonstrates the principle. We use `is_linear_expr` to check the type of an expression before using it in a quadratic context.  The `try-except` block is crucial for catching potential errors during the solving process.  This proactive approach minimizes runtime surprises.

**Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend reviewing the DocPlex documentation thoroughly, paying close attention to sections covering quadratic programming, expression types, and constraint modeling.  Consult the CPLEX documentation for a deeper understanding of the underlying solver capabilities and limitations regarding quadratic programming.  Furthermore, a solid understanding of linear algebra and optimization theory will greatly benefit your efforts in formulating and solving complex optimization models.  Consider exploring academic texts on mathematical optimization for a more fundamental grasp of the subject matter.  Finally, test your models extensively with varied data inputs and solution verification techniques.
