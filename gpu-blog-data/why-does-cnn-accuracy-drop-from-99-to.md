The precipitous drop in CNN accuracy from 99% to 50% during training, often observed later in the epoch or across multiple epochs, almost invariably points to a problem with either the training data itself or the training process, rather than an inherent limitation of the convolutional neural network architecture.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous image classification projects, this phenomenon rarely stems from a fundamental flaw in the network's design.

My initial investigations into this issue typically focus on three crucial areas: overfitting, data imbalance, and optimization instability.  Let's examine each in detail, supported by illustrative code examples using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

**1. Overfitting:**  A CNN achieving 99% accuracy early in training suggests that the network is memorizing the training data rather than learning generalizable features.  This is a classic overfitting scenario.  The high initial accuracy is a deceptive indicator of performance; the model hasn't learned robust, transferable patterns. When presented with unseen data, its memorized representations fail, leading to the significant accuracy drop.

**Explanation:** Overfitting arises when the model's complexity (number of layers, neurons, etc.) exceeds the information content in the training data. The model learns noise and idiosyncrasies present only in the training set, thereby failing to generalize to new, unseen data.  This usually manifests as a large gap between training accuracy and validation accuracy, with the validation accuracy stagnating or even decreasing.

**Code Example 1: Addressing Overfitting with Regularization and Dropout**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1), kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.001)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.001)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5), # Dropout for regularization
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))
```

This example incorporates L2 regularization (`kernel_regularizer`) to penalize large weights, preventing the model from becoming overly complex.  Dropout (`Dropout(0.5)`) randomly deactivates neurons during training, further reducing overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust features.  The use of a validation set (`x_val`, `y_val`) allows for monitoring the model's performance on unseen data.


**2. Data Imbalance:** An imbalanced dataset, where one class significantly outnumbers others, can lead to misleadingly high initial accuracy followed by a sharp drop.  The model might initially achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class.  As training progresses and the model encounters more samples from the minority class, its accuracy plummets.

**Explanation:**  If 99% of the training data belongs to one class, a naive model predicting that class for all inputs will achieve 99% accuracy. However, this model has learned nothing useful. The subsequent accuracy drop reflects the model's inability to classify the minority classes.

**Code Example 2: Addressing Data Imbalance with Class Weighting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.utils import class_weight

class_weights = class_weight.compute_class_weight('balanced',
                                                 classes=np.unique(y_train),
                                                 y=y_train)

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, class_weight=class_weights, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to address data imbalance using class weights. `class_weight.compute_class_weight` calculates weights inversely proportional to class frequencies.  During training, samples from minority classes are given higher weight, compensating for their underrepresentation.


**3. Optimization Instability:** The choice of optimizer, learning rate, and other hyperparameters significantly impacts training stability.  An improperly configured optimizer might lead to oscillations in accuracy, initially achieving high values before plummeting.  This is particularly relevant in deep networks where optimization landscapes are complex and prone to local minima.

**Explanation:**  A learning rate that's too high can cause the optimizer to overshoot optimal parameter values, leading to unstable training dynamics.  Conversely, a learning rate that's too low might result in slow convergence and getting stuck in suboptimal regions.

**Code Example 3: Addressing Optimization Instability with Learning Rate Scheduling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

initial_learning_rate = 0.01

lr_schedule = tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay(
    initial_learning_rate,
    decay_steps=10000,
    decay_rate=0.96,
    staircase=True)

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=lr_schedule)

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer,
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))
```

This example employs an exponential learning rate decay schedule.  The learning rate starts at `initial_learning_rate` and gradually decreases over time. This prevents the optimizer from overshooting optimal weights, promoting stability and potentially improving convergence.


**Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting comprehensive texts on deep learning, specifically those focusing on practical aspects of model training and hyperparameter tuning.  Examining papers on CNN architectures for image classification will also offer valuable insight.  Finally, detailed documentation on the chosen deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch) provides essential information on optimization techniques and regularization methods.  Careful examination of these resources, coupled with rigorous experimentation, will aid in diagnosing and resolving the accuracy drop.
