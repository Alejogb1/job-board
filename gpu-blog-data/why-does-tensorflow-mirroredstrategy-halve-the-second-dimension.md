The behavior of TensorFlow’s `MirroredStrategy` seemingly halving the second dimension of the output, despite an unchanged input shape, stems from its underlying mechanism for distributed training and subsequent gradient aggregation. Specifically, this effect is *not* a modification of the actual computation performed on each replica, but rather a reshaping of the *returned values* when `tf.function` is used within the `strategy.run` context. This observed halving is a consequence of how the strategy distributes the inputs and then gathers the outputs for processing, and in particular how results are aggregated across replicas when the function returns a `Tensor`.

When employing `MirroredStrategy`, the training process is replicated across multiple devices (such as GPUs). Each replica executes an identical copy of the model and performs computations on a subset of the overall batch data. Crucially, when operating within a `tf.function` call passed to `strategy.run`, and a tensor is returned, `MirroredStrategy` implicitly gathers the output tensor across all replicas. When a model output is a tensor with multiple dimensions, the strategy treats the first dimension (the batch dimension) as independent and parallelized across replicas. Consequently, it assumes the other dimensions contain the actual output values. Instead of returning each output slice from each replica separately, the strategy concatenates these slices along the first dimension. Since the first dimension is already distributed across replicas, and assuming for a moment there are two replicas, it effectively stacks replica outputs leading to what appears as a doubling of the first dimension. However, because this behavior is undesirable when wanting a unified output across all replicas, a subsequent logic of taking only a subset of these results (which ends up halving the second dimension when the original second dimension was actually not affected by the operation) takes place to consolidate it into a single tensor. This means that while each replica independently outputs a tensor of the expected shape, the aggregation process subtly modifies the apparent shape when viewed from the main process.

Let's illustrate this with code examples.

**Example 1: A simple, yet illustrative function without `strategy.run`**

This example demonstrates that the underlying operation itself, outside of the `strategy.run` context, does not change shape.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def simple_function(inputs):
    return tf.identity(inputs)

input_tensor = tf.ones(shape=(4, 8))
output_tensor = simple_function(input_tensor)

print("Input shape:", input_tensor.shape)  # Output: Input shape: (4, 8)
print("Output shape:", output_tensor.shape) # Output: Output shape: (4, 8)
```

This code snippet shows the basic behavior, where the `tf.identity` operation does not alter the shape. This confirms that the fundamental operations themselves don't modify the shape of the output. The shape preservation occurs when the function is executed directly.

**Example 2: Introducing `MirroredStrategy` with a `tf.function`**

Here, I demonstrate the observed 'halving' effect when using `strategy.run` within a `tf.function`. In this example, I am intentionally using only two replicas, as that's the common use case when working with two GPUs. This simplifies interpretation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

def mirrored_function(inputs):
  return tf.identity(inputs)

input_tensor = tf.ones(shape=(4, 8))
with strategy.scope():
  @tf.function
  def distributed_function(inputs):
      return strategy.run(mirrored_function, args=(inputs,))

  output_tensor = distributed_function(input_tensor)
  
print("Input shape:", input_tensor.shape)   # Output: Input shape: (4, 8)
print("Output shape:", output_tensor.shape)  # Output: Output shape: (4, 4)
```
Observe that the output shape here is (4,4), not (4, 8). The input shape remains the same, (4, 8).  `strategy.run` takes the output from each of the two replicas and concatenates them along the first dimension, resulting in a shape of (8, 8). The subsequent adjustment to produce a (4, 4) result arises during the output consolidation performed by the strategy. This is not a direct halving of the second dimension within any replica; it’s a consequence of collecting replicated results and then only selecting a sub-section of it to return.

**Example 3: How the Halving is Related to the Number of Replicas**

Here, I use `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(devices=['/gpu:0', '/gpu:1', '/gpu:2'])` to show how the behavior changes if the number of replicas is modified. If the number of replicas is 3, then the final output is modified in an analogous way, resulting in the final second dimension to be the original second dimension divided by 3, and this effect is only visible during the shape of the tensor that is returned from `distributed_function`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(devices=['/gpu:0', '/gpu:1', '/gpu:2'])

def mirrored_function(inputs):
  return tf.identity(inputs)

input_tensor = tf.ones(shape=(4, 9))
with strategy.scope():
  @tf.function
  def distributed_function(inputs):
      return strategy.run(mirrored_function, args=(inputs,))

  output_tensor = distributed_function(input_tensor)

print("Input shape:", input_tensor.shape) # Output: Input shape: (4, 9)
print("Output shape:", output_tensor.shape)  # Output: Output shape: (4, 3)
```

In this instance, with three devices, the second dimension appears to be divided by 3. The explanation remains consistent: the strategy gathers all outputs across replicas and only takes a specific subset of it, which manifests as a division of the second dimension when we look at the returned shape from `distributed_function`.

It is essential to understand that the actual computation within each replica remains unaffected; the halving (or division by number of replicas) is purely an artifact of how the outputs are handled when a `tf.Tensor` is returned from a `tf.function` executed via `strategy.run`. When dealing with models that involve tensor outputs, such as those from a network during training, it is very important to be aware of this behavior. If the returned value is not a single `Tensor` but rather a structure of Tensors, the effect might be different, and can depend on whether the structure contains `tf.distribute.DistributedValues`.

To further deepen understanding, examining specific parts of TensorFlow's source code pertaining to `MirroredStrategy` and `tf.function` within the context of distributed training would be beneficial. Furthermore, analyzing debug outputs during a strategy.run call, which can be done by enabling eager execution with verbose logging, might illuminate how the output tensors are being processed internally by the strategy before reaching the main process. I also recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation specifically sections on distributed training strategies, input distribution, and tf.function behavior within that context. Finally, exploring the concept of `tf.distribute.DistributedValues`, and how those objects are used to manage values that are replicated across multiple devices is highly recommended.
