The performance degradation of a text classifier upon increasing the number of classes is often rooted in the curse of dimensionality and the inherent sparsity of high-dimensional data, exacerbated by insufficient training data per class.  This isn't merely a matter of adding more classes; itâ€™s about the interaction between data volume, feature representation, and the chosen classification algorithm's capacity to effectively separate increasingly nuanced categories.  In my experience troubleshooting classification systems for natural language processing (NLP) tasks over the past decade, this phenomenon has been consistently encountered.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core issue lies in the relationship between the number of classes (K), the dimensionality of the feature space (D), and the size of the training dataset (N).  As K increases, the required number of training examples per class to maintain a given level of accuracy increases exponentially.  This is particularly true in high-dimensional spaces, common in text classification where feature vectors often represent word frequencies, TF-IDF scores, or word embeddings.  With a limited dataset, adding more classes effectively dilutes the available training data per class, leading to overfitting on some classes while other classes remain under-represented and poorly classified.

This effect is amplified by the inherent sparsity of text data.  Documents rarely utilize the entire vocabulary; many features (words) will have zero or very low counts.  As the number of classes grows, the likelihood of encountering sparsely represented classes increases, making effective discrimination between them challenging. Consequently, the classifier may struggle to learn meaningful patterns distinguishing the subtle differences between these poorly represented classes.  The model might default to classifying these under-represented classes inaccurately, or it might overfit to noisy data within the few examples it does have.

Furthermore, the choice of classifier impacts the sensitivity to the number of classes.  Algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with linear kernels might struggle with highly overlapping classes in high-dimensional space, while more complex models like deep neural networks might require significantly more data to avoid overfitting as the number of classes and parameters increase.  The complexity of the model should be carefully chosen based on the available training data and the inherent separability of the classes.  Improper model selection can also mask the underlying data limitations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate the problem using Python and scikit-learn.  These are simplified for illustrative purposes; real-world scenarios often involve more sophisticated pre-processing and feature engineering.

**Example 1:  Naive Bayes with increasing classes**

```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample data (replace with your own)
documents = [
    "This is a positive document.",
    "Another positive example.",
    "This is negative.",
    "A very negative sentiment.",
    "Neutral statement.",
    "Slightly positive.",
    "Extremely negative review.",
    "Positive feedback.",
    "Negative comment.",
    "Neutral opinion."
]

labels_2 = ["positive", "negative"]
labels_5 = ["positive", "negative", "neutral", "slightly positive", "slightly negative"]

vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

# Two Classes
X_2 = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)
y_2 = labels_2 * 5

X_train_2, X_test_2, y_train_2, y_test_2 = train_test_split(X_2, y_2, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
clf_2 = MultinomialNB()
clf_2.fit(X_train_2, y_train_2)
y_pred_2 = clf_2.predict(X_test_2)
accuracy_2 = accuracy_score(y_test_2, y_pred_2)
print(f"Accuracy with 2 classes: {accuracy_2}")


# Five Classes
X_5 = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)
y_5 = labels_5 * 2

X_train_5, X_test_5, y_train_5, y_test_5 = train_test_split(X_5, y_5, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
clf_5 = MultinomialNB()
clf_5.fit(X_train_5, y_train_5)
y_pred_5 = clf_5.predict(X_test_5)
accuracy_5 = accuracy_score(y_test_5, y_pred_5)
print(f"Accuracy with 5 classes: {accuracy_5}")

```

This demonstrates a simple scenario.  Observe that even with a small dataset, increasing the number of classes can lead to a decrease in accuracy.  The sparsity of the data becomes more impactful as classes are added.


**Example 2:  Impact of Dataset Size**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Simulate data with varying dataset sizes
def simulate_data(num_classes, samples_per_class):
    X = np.random.rand(num_classes * samples_per_class, 10) #10 features
    y = np.repeat(np.arange(num_classes), samples_per_class)
    return X, y


# Experiment with different numbers of classes and samples per class
num_classes_list = [2, 5, 10]
samples_per_class_list = [10, 50, 100]

for num_classes in num_classes_list:
    for samples_per_class in samples_per_class_list:
        X, y = simulate_data(num_classes, samples_per_class)
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
        clf = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
        clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
        y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
        print(f"Num Classes: {num_classes}, Samples per Class: {samples_per_class}")
        print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

This example uses simulated data to clearly highlight the effect of dataset size on classification accuracy as the number of classes increases.  Increasing samples_per_class significantly improves performance across all numbers of classes.


**Example 3: Dimensionality Reduction (Feature Selection)**

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, chi2
# ... (previous code from Example 1) ...

# Apply feature selection
selector = SelectKBest(chi2, k=1000) # Select top 1000 features

#Two Classes
X_2_selected = selector.fit_transform(X_2, y_2)
clf_2_selected = MultinomialNB()
clf_2_selected.fit(X_2_selected, y_2)
y_pred_2_selected = clf_2_selected.predict(selector.transform(X_test_2))
accuracy_2_selected = accuracy_score(y_test_2, y_pred_2_selected)
print(f"Accuracy with 2 classes and feature selection: {accuracy_2_selected}")

#Five Classes
X_5_selected = selector.fit_transform(X_5, y_5)
clf_5_selected = MultinomialNB()
clf_5_selected.fit(X_5_selected, y_5)
y_pred_5_selected = clf_5_selected.predict(selector.transform(X_test_5))
accuracy_5_selected = accuracy_score(y_test_5, y_pred_5_selected)
print(f"Accuracy with 5 classes and feature selection: {accuracy_5_selected}")
```

This example demonstrates dimensionality reduction using chi-squared feature selection. Reducing the dimensionality can improve performance by mitigating the curse of dimensionality, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional, sparse text data and numerous classes.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  "Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman.
*  "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop.
*  A comprehensive textbook on natural language processing.  Any reputable NLP textbook will cover feature engineering, classification techniques, and evaluation metrics.  Pay particular attention to chapters on text classification and model selection.
*  Scikit-learn documentation.  The documentation provides detailed explanations of various classifiers and their parameters.  Thoroughly understanding the different parameters and their impact on performance is crucial.



In summary, the observed performance degradation is likely due to a combination of insufficient data per class, high dimensionality, and potential model mismatch.  Addressing these issues through data augmentation, feature engineering (including dimensionality reduction), and careful model selection will significantly improve your text classifier's accuracy as the number of classes increases.  Remember that evaluating various classifiers and hyperparameters is essential, and rigorous cross-validation is a must.
