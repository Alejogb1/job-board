The core mismatch lies in the dimensionality of the input data provided to the Keras model compared to the dimensionality it was configured to accept. My experience building sequence-to-sequence models for time-series forecasting, specifically with stock market data, often throws this particular issue into sharp relief. The (None, 50) input shape implies a model expecting batches of 50-dimensional vectors, whereas (None, 1, 512) signals batches of sequences where each sequence has length one and consists of 512-dimensional vectors. This discrepancy usually stems from either preprocessing steps not aligning with the model architecture or inconsistencies during data loading. The 'None' dimension signifies the batch size, which Keras dynamically handles and isn’t the point of contention here.

The first number, 50, represents the expected input feature vector length in the model’s input layer. In my previous work, this might have corresponded to 50 different financial indicators, for instance, the past five days of open, close, high, low and volume – ten features * five days. The (None, 1, 512) signifies, by contrast, an input where each data point is considered a sequence of one element, with each element itself having 512 dimensions. This commonly arises in scenarios like language models using pre-trained embeddings where 512 might be the embedding dimension or with time series data that have been reshaped to a 3D tensor to support some specific data processing within a model such as an LSTM layer.

To further clarify, I’ve encountered this issue while adapting older models to handle richer data. Initially, a model might have been configured to process 50 independent numerical features, fed directly into a dense layer or similar. When adapting it to handle sequence data or when introducing embeddings from another model, like using a pre-trained Word2Vec model with a 512 dimension for each token, the input shape can suddenly shift, creating the mismatch you are seeing. The problem isn’t necessarily in the data itself, but in how the data is prepared before being passed to the neural network.

To illustrate, consider these code examples:

```python
# Example 1: Model expecting (None, 50)
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

#Input dimensions match with input data
input_shape_50 = (50,)
model_50 = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=input_shape_50),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model_50.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate a sample input with a shape of (None,50)
import numpy as np
sample_input_50 = np.random.rand(100, 50)
sample_labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)
sample_labels_one_hot = tf.one_hot(sample_labels, depth=10)

model_50.fit(sample_input_50, sample_labels_one_hot, epochs=2)
```
In this first example, the `layers.Input(shape=(50,))` explicitly defines that the model accepts batches of 50-dimensional vectors. This matches the input data created. Therefore, this would not produce a mismatch error. I'm using this first example to set the stage for what a matching input layer would look like, before demonstrating mismatches.

```python
# Example 2: Incorrect Data Preparation leading to (None, 1, 512)

input_shape_50 = (50,)
model_50 = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=input_shape_50),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model_50.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Sample input data reshaped to (None, 1, 512) from something like embeddings
sample_input_incorrect = np.random.rand(100, 512) #imagine this is word embedding
sample_input_incorrect_reshaped = np.reshape(sample_input_incorrect, (100, 1, 512)) #adding a sequence dimension
sample_labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)
sample_labels_one_hot = tf.one_hot(sample_labels, depth=10)


try:
  model_50.fit(sample_input_incorrect_reshaped, sample_labels_one_hot, epochs=2)
except ValueError as error:
  print(f"Error Message: {error}")
```

In this second example, even though the model is still configured to accept `(None, 50)`, the data preparation transforms the input into `(None, 1, 512)`. Initially, you might create input data as an embedding space of (None, 512), where 512 represents the dimension of the vectors themselves and not a sequence length or any other feature dimension, then you might reshape it, imagining you need a sequence dimension to feed into a more complex model. When this is passed to the model from the first example you will get a ValueError which will give an error message as shown, clearly indicating the shape mismatch problem. The reshaped input contains an additional dimension (sequence length of 1) that the model is not expecting.

```python
# Example 3: Model updated to expect (None, 1, 512)
input_shape_512 = (1, 512)

model_512 = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=input_shape_512),
    layers.Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=1, activation='relu'), #A 1-D conv layer
    layers.Flatten(),  #Flattens to (None, 64)
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model_512.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Sample input, now matching (None, 1, 512)
sample_input_incorrect = np.random.rand(100, 512)
sample_input_incorrect_reshaped = np.reshape(sample_input_incorrect, (100, 1, 512))
sample_labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)
sample_labels_one_hot = tf.one_hot(sample_labels, depth=10)

model_512.fit(sample_input_incorrect_reshaped, sample_labels_one_hot, epochs=2)

```
In the third example, the model's input layer is modified using `layers.Input(shape=(1, 512))`. This now matches the shape of the reshaped input data, allowing the training to proceed correctly. Note that the use of a Conv1D layer here is merely illustrative to show how the model can now incorporate some sort of sequence processing, it does not actually matter if this part is changed for the purpose of resolving the shape mismatch. The key point is that the `layers.Input` parameter has been modified. You can now use the new model with the new input data shapes.

Resolving this discrepancy involves a careful review of your data preprocessing pipeline, and how you are preparing the input for your model. Double-checking the `input_shape` parameter within the Keras model and comparing it to your data structure before fitting is critical. If the input data needs to be reshaped, ensure this transformation is correctly implemented, which might also need modifications to the model architecture itself. If your input data was originally (None, 512), but you now require the sequence dimension, consider if adding the additional dimension makes sense, and if not, what you can do to remove it. Alternatively, it could be your model is not suited for your data, and you need to re-evaluate your model design from scratch.

For further understanding, I would recommend exploring the official Keras documentation on input layers and working with sequence data. Additionally, tutorials on handling different data types with deep learning models – particularly those focusing on time series and NLP examples often cover these types of issues in detail. Resources that provide comprehensive explanations of tensor dimensions and how they impact neural network architectures, are also invaluable. Finally, a good book that is focused on applied deep learning would provide you with more of an overview to understand these issues within the larger context of a Deep Learning application.
