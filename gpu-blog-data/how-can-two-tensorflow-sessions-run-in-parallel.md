TensorFlow's session management, particularly concerning multi-session operation on a single GPU, necessitates a nuanced understanding of its underlying execution model.  My experience optimizing deep learning pipelines for large-scale image processing highlighted a crucial limitation:  Directly running two independent TensorFlow sessions in parallel on a single GPU is inherently problematic due to the nature of GPU memory allocation and kernel execution.  While TensorFlow's internal mechanisms may allow for some degree of concurrency *within* a single session, achieving true parallelism across separate sessions on the same GPU requires a different approach, focusing on resource management and potentially task decomposition.

**1. Clear Explanation: The Bottleneck of Shared Resources**

The primary obstacle to parallel session execution on a single GPU is contention for GPU memory and computational resources.  Each TensorFlow session creates its own computational graph and allocates memory on the GPU to store variables, intermediate results, and the graph itself.  These allocations are not inherently aware of other sessions. Consequently, attempting to run two sessions simultaneously often results in memory exhaustion or severe performance degradation due to constant context switching and resource contention.  The GPU scheduler, while sophisticated, cannot efficiently manage the overlapping needs of independent sessions without explicit coordination. This issue stems not from a flaw in TensorFlow itself, but from the fundamental hardware constraints of a single GPU.

Several strategies can mitigate this problem, but achieving true parallelism necessitates either distributing the workload across multiple GPUs or employing techniques to control memory usage and task scheduling within a single session.  Directly forcing parallel execution of independent sessions on a shared GPU will likely lead to unpredictable behavior, errors, and significantly slower overall performance compared to optimized single-session execution or a multi-GPU setup.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate approaches to manage resource usage and demonstrate why directly running two independent sessions in parallel on the same GPU is impractical.  Note that these examples focus on demonstrating the concepts and potential pitfalls; actual implementation specifics will vary based on the TensorFlow version and hardware configuration.

**Example 1:  Illustrating Resource Contention (Unsuccessful Parallelism):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Session 1
with tf.Session() as sess1:
    a = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([1000, 1000]), name="a_sess1") #Large variable
    b = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([1000, 1000]), name="b_sess1")
    sess1.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    # Perform computations with a and b... (e.g., matrix multiplication)

# Session 2 (Attempting parallel execution)
with tf.Session() as sess2:
    c = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([1000, 1000]), name="c_sess2") #Large variable
    d = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([1000, 1000]), name="d_sess2")
    sess2.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    # Perform computations with c and d...
    #Likely to result in memory exhaustion or significant slowdown due to resource contention.
```

This example attempts to create two large variables in separate sessions.  The combined memory footprint of these variables may exceed the GPU's capacity, resulting in `ResourceExhaustedError`.  Even if the memory is sufficient, the kernel launches from both sessions will compete for GPU execution units, leading to performance degradation.


**Example 2:  Single Session with Multiple Queues (Improved Concurrency):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import threading

# Create input queues
q1 = tf.FIFOQueue(capacity=100, dtypes=[tf.float32], shapes=[(100,)])
q2 = tf.FIFOQueue(capacity=100, dtypes=[tf.float32], shapes=[(100,)])

# Enqueue data into queues (potentially from different threads)
enqueue_op1 = q1.enqueue(tf.random_normal([100]))
enqueue_op2 = q2.enqueue(tf.random_normal([100]))

#Dequeue and process data
data1 = q1.dequeue()
data2 = q2.dequeue()

# Process data
result1 = tf.reduce_sum(data1)
result2 = tf.reduce_sum(data2)

with tf.Session() as sess:
  coord = tf.train.Coordinator()
  threads = tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess=sess, coord=coord)
  # Run enqueue operations in separate threads (simulating parallelism)
  thread1 = threading.Thread(target=lambda: sess.run(enqueue_op1))
  thread2 = threading.Thread(target=lambda: sess.run(enqueue_op2))
  thread1.start()
  thread2.start()
  
  # Process the data
  r1, r2 = sess.run([result1, result2])
  print("Results:", r1, r2)
  coord.request_stop()
  coord.join(threads)
```

This example demonstrates how to leverage TensorFlow's queueing mechanisms within a single session to process independent datasets concurrently. While not true parallel session execution, it achieves concurrent processing within a single session, enhancing efficiency.  The use of separate threads simulates parallel data input.


**Example 3:  Model Parallelism (Advanced Approach):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Split the model into parts
with tf.variable_scope("model_part1"):
    # Define part 1 of the model (e.g., convolutional layers)
    ...

with tf.variable_scope("model_part2"):
    # Define part 2 of the model (e.g., fully connected layers)
    ...

# Input data
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 784])

# Process model parts sequentially (but independently) within a single session
output1 = model_part1(x)
output2 = model_part2(output1)


with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    # ... process data with the complete model (model_part1 and model_part2) ...
```

This example illustrates model parallelism, where a large model is split into smaller parts, potentially reducing the memory footprint of each part.  Even within a single session, this approach can help mitigate the constraints of a single GPU by decomposing the workload.  It doesn't achieve parallel session execution but offers a path to improved GPU utilization for large models.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's execution model and resource management, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections covering graph execution, variable management, and the use of queues.  Furthermore, exploring advanced topics like model parallelism and distributed TensorFlow will provide valuable insights into handling complex deep learning workloads efficiently across multiple resources, including multiple GPUs.  Study of asynchronous programming concepts in Python will aid in optimizing the coordination and management of concurrent operations. Finally, analyzing GPU profiling tools will prove invaluable in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing resource usage within a single GPU.
