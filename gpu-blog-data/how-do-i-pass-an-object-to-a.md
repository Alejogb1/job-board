In Sails.js, the most efficient method for transferring data, including objects, to a layout view involves leveraging the `res.view()` function's second argument. This argument accepts a dictionary where keys become available as variables within the view. I’ve found this pattern to be robust in various applications I've developed, particularly those with complex data dependencies. The layout itself is fundamentally just another view, so the same logic applies when rendering it within an action.

The core principle is that Sails’s `res.view()` function manages the view rendering process and, crucially, the data injection. Rather than attempting to manipulate request or session objects directly within layout code (a practice I would actively discourage for maintainability reasons), we define the data required by the layout view in the controller action. This approach keeps the logic for data preparation centralized and separates view presentation from action handling. Sails then takes care of propagating the data down through the view hierarchy.

Here is how I typically structure a controller action to achieve this:

```javascript
// api/controllers/UserController.js

module.exports = {
  profile: async function(req, res) {
    const user = await User.findOne({ id: req.params.id });
    if (!user) {
      return res.notFound();
    }

    const pageTitle = `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}'s Profile`;
    const layoutData = {
        siteName: 'My Application',
        currentUser: req.session.user,
        pageTitle: pageTitle,
    };


    return res.view('pages/user/profile', { user: user, layout: layoutData });
  }
};
```

In this example, the `profile` action retrieves a user record based on the ID in the URL parameters. After verifying the user exists, we construct a `layoutData` object. This contains data relevant to the overall site structure like the site's name, current user information (typically from a session), and a page-specific title, which I find essential for browser tab displays. The `res.view()` function is then called. The first argument specifies the view file (in this case, ‘pages/user/profile’), and the second argument is a dictionary. Importantly, I’ve included not only the `user` data for the main view, but also a `layout` property; this layout property contains all of the data I intend for the layout to have available.

Within the layout view (likely `views/layouts/main.ejs`), we can access the `layoutData` properties:

```html
<!-- views/layouts/main.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title><%= layout.pageTitle %> - <%= layout.siteName %></title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <nav>
            <!-- Navigation elements here, potentially including links customized based on layout.currentUser -->
            <% if(layout.currentUser) { %>
                <a href="/profile">My Profile</a>
                <a href="/logout">Logout</a>
             <% } else { %>
                <a href="/login">Login</a>
                <a href="/register">Register</a>
            <% } %>

        </nav>
    </header>

    <main>
        <%- body %>
    </main>

    <footer>
        <p>&copy; <%= layout.siteName %></p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Here, the `<%= layout.pageTitle %>` and `<%= layout.siteName %>` directives inject data from the `layoutData` object I sent from the controller. The conditional logic in the header demonstrates how to adapt the user interface based on the `currentUser` information, also retrieved via the object. I also include the `<%- body %>` tag which is vital, as it is the directive which injects the content of the main view into the layout. It's also worth mentioning the importance of using `<%- body %>` rather than `<%= body %>`; the `-` is necessary to prevent the content of the view from being encoded as HTML entities.

Now, let’s examine how to handle situations with deeply nested objects which may be needed by the layout view:

```javascript
// api/controllers/SettingsController.js

module.exports = {
  index: async function(req, res) {
        const settings = await Setting.find({}).limit(1);
        const company = await Company.findOne({id: 1});

         const layoutData = {
            siteName: 'Admin Panel',
            currentUser: req.session.user,
            pageTitle: 'Settings',
            companyInformation: {
                name: company.name,
                address: company.address,
                contact: company.contactInformation, // Assuming this is also an object
           },
          siteSettings: settings[0] // Assuming we only want the first found setting
        };

    return res.view('pages/admin/settings', { layout: layoutData });
    }
};
```
In this revised example, the `layoutData` now includes a `companyInformation` object, which itself contains potentially nested data. Additionally, I’ve also included site-specific settings. It highlights how nested objects can be passed and accessed in layouts, provided they're constructed in the controller.

The final example focuses on using async operations within the controller action to retrieve data for the layout.

```javascript
// api/controllers/DashboardController.js

module.exports = {
  index: async function(req, res) {
     const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
    const pendingTasks = await Task.count({ status: 'pending' });
    const completedTasks = await Task.count({ status: 'completed' });
     const latestNews = await News.find({}).sort('createdAt DESC').limit(5);

        const layoutData = {
            siteName: 'Dashboard',
            currentUser: req.session.user,
            pageTitle: 'Overview',
            stats: {
                pending: pendingTasks,
                completed: completedTasks,
                year: currentYear
             },
             newsFeed: latestNews
        };

    return res.view('pages/dashboard', { layout: layoutData });
    }
};
```

This `index` action for the `Dashboard` controller demonstrates how to asynchronously gather data from the database via model queries. The returned `layoutData` object includes a `stats` object containing task counts, and a `newsFeed` array. This is a pattern I routinely employ in dashboards where live data from the database is needed.

To reinforce, within each action, the core principle is the same: the controller action is responsible for preparing the layout’s data by creating the ‘layout’ property in the object sent to res.view(). This separates concerns, leading to cleaner, more manageable code.

For those looking for further resources on this topic, the official Sails.js documentation provides exhaustive details on view rendering and data management. Specific sections concerning rendering views within actions would be particularly helpful. Furthermore, exploring introductory articles and tutorials on Model-View-Controller architecture and its application within Node.js web frameworks can provide a deeper understanding of the patterns involved. Finally, looking at general articles on effective patterns in full stack development will further broaden the knowledge required to perform such task in a performant manner. There are also many community forums where developers share experiences, though I caution to carefully vet advice from untrusted sources.
