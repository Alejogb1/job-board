TensorFlow's `tf.function` decorator, while invaluable for optimizing performance, presents unique challenges when dealing with the creation of dynamically shaped or arbitrarily sized 2D arrays.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines highlighted the need for careful consideration of array creation within the `tf.function` context, particularly concerning the handling of tensor shapes and data types.  The core issue lies in the need for compile-time shape information, which frequently clashes with the dynamic nature of many array creation tasks.  Simply passing Python lists or NumPy arrays directly into a `tf.function` will often lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.  The solution involves using TensorFlow's own tensor manipulation functions to create arrays within the graph compilation process.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Creating a custom 2D array inside a `tf.function` necessitates leveraging TensorFlow operations that are compatible with the graph compilation process.  This differs significantly from standard Python array creation techniques.  The key is to avoid relying on Python control flow or Python-based array manipulation within the `@tf.function` decorated function. Instead, leverage TensorFlow's `tf.Tensor` objects and functions like `tf.reshape`, `tf.fill`, `tf.range`, and `tf.tile` to construct the desired arrays.  The shape of the resulting tensor must be known or inferable at compile time, or a `tf.TensorShape` object must be used to specify the shape explicitly. This ensures TensorFlow can efficiently optimize the computational graph. Dynamic shape determination requires using `tf.Variable` objects or employing `tf.cond` statements for conditional array creation, but this often sacrifices some level of graph optimization.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Creating a 2D array of zeros with a known shape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def create_zero_array(rows, cols):
  """Creates a 2D array filled with zeros."""
  return tf.zeros([rows, cols], dtype=tf.float32)

# Usage:
rows = 5
cols = 10
zero_array = create_zero_array(rows, cols)
print(zero_array)
```

This example showcases the simplest approach.  The `tf.zeros` function directly creates a tensor of zeros with the specified dimensions.  The `dtype` argument explicitly sets the data type to `tf.float32`, which is important for clarity and potential performance optimization.  The function's inputs (`rows`, `cols`) are integers, ensuring compile-time shape determination.

**Example 2: Creating a 2D array using `tf.range` and `tf.reshape`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def create_sequential_array(size):
  """Creates a 2D array with sequentially increasing values."""
  total_elements = size * size
  sequential_values = tf.range(total_elements, dtype=tf.int32)
  return tf.reshape(sequential_values, [size, size])

#Usage:
size = 4
sequential_array = create_sequential_array(size)
print(sequential_array)
```

Here, we utilize `tf.range` to generate a sequence of integers and then `tf.reshape` to transform it into a square 2D array.  The use of a single input parameter, `size`, elegantly handles the shape definition. This approach is suitable when you need a 2D array populated with a predictable sequence of values. The `dtype` is explicitly set to `tf.int32` to reflect the integer nature of the data.

**Example 3:  Creating a 2D array with conditional logic and `tf.cond`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def create_conditional_array(rows, cols, condition):
  """Creates a 2D array based on a conditional input."""
  def create_ones():
    return tf.ones([rows, cols], dtype=tf.float32)

  def create_twos():
    return tf.fill([rows, cols], 2.0)

  return tf.cond(condition, create_ones, create_twos)

# Usage:
rows = 3
cols = 4
condition = tf.constant(True) # Or tf.constant(False)
conditional_array = create_conditional_array(rows, cols, condition)
print(conditional_array)
```

This example demonstrates the use of `tf.cond` for conditional array generation.  This is crucial for scenarios where the array's contents depend on runtime conditions.  The nested functions, `create_ones` and `create_twos`, clearly delineate the array creation logic for each branch of the conditional statement. The `condition` variable is a TensorFlow constant, ensuring that the conditional logic is resolved during graph compilation. However, this approach may introduce some limitations on optimization compared to purely statically shaped arrays.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on `tf.function` and tensor manipulation, provides the most comprehensive and up-to-date information.  Furthermore, I found that exploring examples within the TensorFlow tutorials, specifically those involving custom layers or models, greatly aided my understanding of tensor manipulation within the `tf.function` context.  Finally,  reviewing the TensorFlow API reference for functions related to tensor creation and manipulation is a valuable resource.  A deep understanding of TensorFlow's graph execution model is also highly recommended to troubleshoot issues efficiently. My own experience taught me that thorough comprehension of these aspects is crucial for writing efficient and correct TensorFlow code.
