The observation that gradients are zero after calling `score.backward()` often stems from a misunderstanding of PyTorch's computational graph and the lifecycle of tensors within it.  Specifically, the issue arises when the tensor `score` is not part of a dynamically constructed computational graph, meaning its history of operations that led to its creation has been detached.  This prevents PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine from tracing back through the necessary operations to compute gradients. My experience debugging this in large-scale neural network training pipelines frequently revealed this root cause.


**1. Understanding PyTorch's Autograd Mechanism**

PyTorch employs automatic differentiation via its `autograd` package.  When operations are performed on tensors that have `requires_grad=True`, PyTorch constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the sequence of operations. This DAG tracks the dependencies between tensors, enabling the efficient calculation of gradients during the backward pass.  The crucial point is that this graph is dynamic; it's built as you perform operations and is discarded once gradients are computed.  If the tensor's history is lost, there's nothing for `backward()` to work with.

This history is commonly lost through several mechanisms, the most frequent being detaching the tensor from the computational graph explicitly or implicitly.  Explicit detachment is done using `.detach()`, while implicit detachment occurs when operations are performed on tensors whose `requires_grad` attribute is `False`, or when operations create tensors outside the active computational graph context, such as loading data from a file directly into a tensor without any preceding graph operations.

**2. Code Examples Illustrating the Problem and Solutions**

**Example 1: Implicit Detachment due to `requires_grad=False`**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
w = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=False) # crucial point: detached from the graph
b = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)

score = torch.dot(x, w) + b

score.backward()

print(x.grad) #Will likely show None or nan if not initialized.
print(w.grad) #Always None; w is detached.
print(b.grad) #Will have a value if score.backward() computed it.
```

In this example, `w` has `requires_grad=False`.  Therefore, the operation `torch.dot(x, w)` doesn't add `w` to the computational graph.  The gradient calculation for `w` is impossible because there's no path in the DAG connecting it to the `score`. Consequently, `w.grad` will remain `None`.  The gradients for `x` and `b`, however, should be calculated correctly assuming `score.backward()` is being called within a `with torch.no_grad():` block which is not the case here.


**Example 2: Explicit Detachment using `.detach()`**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
w = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)

intermediate_result = torch.dot(x, w) + b
score = intermediate_result.detach() # Explicitly detached

score.backward()

print(x.grad) # None or nan
print(w.grad) # None or nan
print(b.grad) # None or nan
```

Here, `.detach()` explicitly creates a new tensor that's independent of the computational graph.  Therefore, the backward pass from `score` cannot propagate gradients back to `x`, `w`, or `b`. This is a common mistake when manipulating tensors within a model.  It is possible that gradients may be nan, however, this should only happen during the accumulation of gradients in a model with incorrect implementation.


**Example 3: Correct Implementation**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
w = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)

score = torch.dot(x, w) + b

score.backward()

print(x.grad) # Gradient for x
print(w.grad) # Gradient for w
print(b.grad) # Gradient for b
```

This example demonstrates the correct usage.  All tensors have `requires_grad=True`, and no detachment occurs.  The `backward()` call will successfully compute and assign gradients to `x`, `w`, and `b`.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I'd suggest reviewing the official PyTorch documentation on `autograd`, specifically the sections on computational graphs and gradient computation.  A thorough understanding of tensor operations and their impact on the graph is essential.  Furthermore, exploring advanced topics such as gradient accumulation and custom autograd functions will further clarify the intricate workings of automatic differentiation within PyTorch.  Finally, working through introductory and intermediate tutorials focusing on building neural networks from scratch can solidify practical understanding and help you anticipate issues concerning gradient calculation. These tutorials often delve into the inner workings of the backpropagation algorithm and demonstrate best practices for handling tensor gradients.  A deeper understanding of these fundamentals will greatly assist in avoiding this type of error.
