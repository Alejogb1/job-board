Determining the input tensors of a TensorFlow operation requires a nuanced understanding of the TensorFlow graph structure and its internal representation.  My experience debugging complex TensorFlow models has taught me that a direct approach, relying solely on readily accessible attributes, is often insufficient.  The complexity arises from the dynamic nature of TensorFlow execution, especially with eager execution enabled, and the abstraction layers provided by higher-level APIs like Keras.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in accessing the underlying TensorFlow graph. While high-level APIs abstract away much of the graph management, the information about input tensors is intrinsically tied to the graph's structure.  TensorFlow operations are nodes within this graph, and their input tensors are represented as edges connecting preceding nodes.  Therefore, the method for identifying input tensors depends heavily on whether you're working with a static graph (defined beforehand and then executed) or an eager execution environment.

In a static graph context, the graph itself can be traversed using TensorFlow's graph traversal utilities.  Each operation node contains information about its inputs, allowing direct retrieval.  However, in eager execution, the graph is constructed and executed dynamically, making direct inspection more challenging.  The information might be implicitly held within the TensorFlow runtime, requiring different techniques.

Further complicating the matter is the potential use of control dependencies.  These dependencies don't represent data flow but rather control the order of execution.  An operation might depend on another without directly using its output tensor as an input.  Therefore, a comprehensive solution must consider both data and control dependencies.

Finally, the specific method will also depend on the level of abstraction you are working with.  Lower-level APIs provide more direct access to graph structures, while higher-level APIs might require indirect approaches through introspection or by carefully observing the data flow during execution.  My experience includes working extensively with both `tf.function`-decorated functions and raw TensorFlow operations, which have significantly different approaches.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Static Graph with `tf.Graph`**

This example demonstrates retrieving input tensors for a simple operation within a static graph. This approach is robust for models built using the lower-level TensorFlow API.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a simple graph
g = tf.Graph()
with g.as_default():
    a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], name='a')
    b = tf.constant([4, 5, 6], name='b')
    c = tf.add(a, b, name='c')

with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=g) as sess:
    # Access the graph's operations
    add_op = g.get_operation_by_name('c')
    # Retrieve input tensors
    input_tensors = [input_tensor for input_tensor in add_op.inputs]
    print(f"Input tensors of 'c': {[tensor.name for tensor in input_tensors]}")
    # Verify by running the operation
    result = sess.run(c)
    print(f"Result of the operation: {result}")

```

**Commentary:** This code explicitly creates a graph, defines operations within it, and then uses `get_operation_by_name` to access the specific operation ('c' in this case).  `add_op.inputs` directly provides a list of input tensors.  The loop iterates through this list, printing their names. The session run at the end serves as a confirmation that the identified tensors are indeed the inputs to the operation.


**Example 2:  Eager Execution with `tf.GradientTape`**

In eager execution, directly accessing the graph is less straightforward. We can use `tf.GradientTape` to indirectly infer the input tensors based on their usage in computing gradients. This is useful when dealing with models defined using Keras or other high-level APIs.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable([1.0, 2.0])
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = x * x

dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)

print(f"Input tensor (x): {x.name}")
print(f"Gradient w.r.t x: {dy_dx}")

```

**Commentary:** This code utilizes `tf.GradientTape` to track the computation. While it doesn't directly show the input tensor of the multiplication, we infer that `x` is the input because the gradient is computed with respect to `x`. This approach is indirect but effective when direct graph inspection isn't readily available.


**Example 3:  Custom Operation within a `tf.function`**

This example shows how to handle input tensors within a custom operation decorated with `@tf.function`.


```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_op(a, b):
  return tf.add(a, b)

a = tf.constant([1, 2])
b = tf.constant([3, 4])
result = my_op(a, b)

#ConcreteFunction inspection (Requires TensorFlow 2.x or later)
concrete_func = my_op.get_concrete_function(a,b)
print(f"Input tensors: {[tensor.name for tensor in concrete_func.inputs]}")
print(f"Output tensor: {concrete_func.outputs[0].name}")


```

**Commentary:**  The `@tf.function` decorator compiles the Python function into a TensorFlow graph.  The `get_concrete_function` method retrieves a concrete representation of this graph for specific input types. This concrete function then allows access to input and output tensors.  This method handles the compilation performed by `tf.function`, allowing access to information about the underlying graph structure.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on graph manipulation and eager execution, is essential.  Furthermore, a deep dive into the TensorFlow source code, specifically focusing on the graph data structures and execution mechanisms, would provide invaluable insights.  Finally, exploring advanced debugging tools provided by TensorFlow, if available within your version, can assist in visualizing and inspecting the graph structure and tensor flow during runtime.  Understanding the distinction between static and dynamic graph computation, alongside the concepts of control dependencies and graph traversal, are crucial to mastering this task.
