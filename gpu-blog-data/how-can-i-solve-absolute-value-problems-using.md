Gekko's strength lies in its ability to handle non-linear equations, including those involving absolute values, through clever reformulation.  The key is to recognize that the absolute value function, |x|, can be expressed as a piecewise function:  x if x ≥ 0, and -x if x < 0.  Directly implementing this piecewise definition within Gekko, however, can lead to numerical difficulties due to the discontinuity at x = 0.  Instead, I've found that introducing auxiliary variables and constraints yields robust and efficient solutions.  My experience, spanning several optimization projects involving complex process simulations, points to this approach as the most reliable.


**1.  Clear Explanation**

The method involves replacing the absolute value term |x| with a new variable, say `y`, and imposing constraints that ensure `y` equals |x|.  We accomplish this using two inequalities:

* `y ≥ x`
* `y ≥ -x`

These constraints force `y` to be greater than or equal to both `x` and `-x`.  Consequently, `y` will always take on the magnitude of `x`.  Gekko's solver efficiently handles these inequality constraints, providing a more numerically stable solution compared to directly employing a conditional statement within the model.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Minimizing the Absolute Deviation**

This example demonstrates minimizing the absolute difference between a calculated value and a target value. This is a common scenario in data fitting and parameter estimation.

```python
from gekko import GEKKO

m = GEKKO()
x = m.Var() # Variable to optimize
target = 10 # Target value
y = m.Var(lb=0) # Absolute deviation (must be non-negative)

m.Equation(y >= x - target) # Constraint 1
m.Equation(y >= target - x) # Constraint 2
m.Minimize(y) # Objective: Minimize absolute deviation

m.options.SOLVER = 3 # IPOPT solver
m.solve()

print('x:', x.value[0])
print('Absolute Deviation:', y.value[0])
```

*Commentary*:  The code introduces an auxiliary variable `y` representing the absolute deviation.  The two equations ensure `y` correctly reflects the absolute difference between `x` and `target`. The solver minimizes `y`, effectively minimizing the absolute deviation.  The lower bound on `y` (lb=0) prevents negative values, which are meaningless in this context.


**Example 2:  Absolute Value Constraint in a System of Equations**

Here, an absolute value constraint is integrated into a system of simultaneous equations. This is more representative of real-world problems I've encountered in chemical process control and optimization.

```python
from gekko import GEKKO

m = GEKKO()
x = m.Var()
y = m.Var()
z = m.Var(lb=0) # Absolute value representation

m.Equation(x + 2*y == 5) # Equation 1
m.Equation(z >= x - 2) # Constraint 1
m.Equation(z >= 2 - x) # Constraint 2
m.Equation(y == z)     # Absolute value constraint

m.solve()

print('x:', x.value[0])
print('y:', y.value[0])
```

*Commentary*:  This illustrates incorporating the absolute value into a more complex system. The absolute value of (x-2) is represented by `z`, with constraints mirroring those in Example 1. Note how the `z` variable effectively represents the magnitude of (x - 2) within the context of the system of equations. The solver simultaneously satisfies both the equations and the absolute value constraint.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Absolute Values**

This example expands the technique to handle multiple absolute value terms within a single objective function.  This demonstrates scalability and general applicability.

```python
from gekko import GEKKO

m = GEKKO()
x = m.Var()
y = m.Var()
z1 = m.Var(lb=0)
z2 = m.Var(lb=0)

m.Equation(z1 >= x - 3)
m.Equation(z1 >= 3 - x)
m.Equation(z2 >= y + 1)
m.Equation(z2 >= -y - 1)

m.Minimize(z1 + z2)  # Minimize sum of absolute values

m.solve()

print('x:', x.value[0])
print('y:', y.value[0])
print('Absolute value of (x-3):', z1.value[0])
print('Absolute value of (y+1):', z2.value[0])
```

*Commentary*:  This example extends the approach to handle two separate absolute value terms, |x - 3| and |y + 1|. Each term is replaced by an auxiliary variable (`z1` and `z2`), and appropriate constraints are added. The objective function then minimizes the sum of these absolute values. This approach scales effectively to numerous absolute value expressions, making it suitable for complex optimization scenarios.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of APOPT and IPOPT solvers within Gekko, I recommend consulting the official Gekko documentation.  Furthermore, reviewing introductory materials on nonlinear programming and constraint optimization will enhance your comprehension of the underlying mathematical principles involved in solving these problems.   Finally, exploring examples from the Gekko repository can provide valuable insights and practical guidance.
