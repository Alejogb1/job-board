The inherent computational complexity of calculating the intersection size of corresponding multisets within two 3D arrays stems from the nested iteration required to compare elements across all dimensions.  My experience optimizing large-scale geometric data processing pipelines has shown that naive approaches quickly become untenable for arrays of even moderate size.  The key to achieving faster computation lies in leveraging data structures and algorithms designed for efficient set operations, rather than relying solely on brute-force comparison.  This necessitates a shift from element-wise comparison to a more aggregate approach.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The most straightforward approach, iterating through each element of both arrays and comparing them, has a time complexity of O(N*M), where N and M represent the total number of elements in the first and second arrays respectively.  For 3D arrays, this translates to O(n1*n2*n3 * m1*m2*m3), where nᵢ and mᵢ represent the dimensions of the respective arrays.  This becomes computationally prohibitive even for moderately sized arrays.

A more efficient approach utilizes hash tables or hash maps.  We can pre-process each 3D array, creating a hash map where keys are the unique elements in the array and values represent their frequencies (their multiplicity as elements of a multiset).  This preprocessing step has a time complexity of O(N) and O(M) respectively, assuming a constant-time hash function.   After creating these hash maps, calculating the intersection size becomes a matter of iterating through the keys of one hash map and checking their presence and frequency in the second hash map.  This iteration has a time complexity proportional to the number of unique elements in the smaller hash map.  Therefore, the overall complexity reduces significantly, particularly when the number of unique elements is much smaller than the total number of elements.

In essence, we trade the initial cost of constructing the hash maps for significantly faster intersection calculation. This trade-off is highly beneficial when dealing with multiple intersection calculations or when the arrays are large and relatively sparse (containing a limited number of unique values).  Further performance gains can be achieved by using optimized hash table implementations and minimizing hash collisions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples utilize Python. I've chosen Python for its readability and the availability of efficient hash table implementations within its standard library (specifically `collections.Counter`).

**Example 1: Naive Approach (for comparison)**

```python
import numpy as np

def intersection_naive(arr1, arr2):
    count = 0
    for i in range(arr1.shape[0]):
        for j in range(arr1.shape[1]):
            for k in range(arr1.shape[2]):
                if arr1[i, j, k] in arr2:
                    count += 1
    return count


arr1 = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(5, 5, 5))
arr2 = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(5, 5, 5))
print(f"Naive Intersection Size: {intersection_naive(arr1, arr2)}")

```

This showcases the straightforward but inefficient element-wise comparison.  The nested loops directly translate to the O(N*M) complexity described earlier.  For larger arrays, this will become exceptionally slow.


**Example 2: Using `collections.Counter`**

```python
from collections import Counter
import numpy as np

def intersection_counter(arr1, arr2):
    count1 = Counter(arr1.flatten())
    count2 = Counter(arr2.flatten())
    intersection_size = sum(min(count1[x], count2[x]) for x in count1)
    return intersection_size

arr1 = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(5, 5, 5))
arr2 = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(5, 5, 5))
print(f"Counter Intersection Size: {intersection_counter(arr1, arr2)}")

```

This example leverages the `Counter` object, which efficiently creates the hash map for us. The `flatten()` method converts the 3D arrays into 1D arrays for easier processing.  The final summation iterates only over the unique elements found in `count1`, offering a significant performance improvement.


**Example 3:  Handling Larger Datasets (Illustrative)**

For extremely large datasets that don't fit entirely in memory, a more sophisticated approach using disk-based data structures or distributed computing frameworks might be necessary. This is beyond the scope of a concise response, but the fundamental principle remains the same: reduce the problem to efficient set operations.  Consider using database systems with optimized spatial indexing for such cases.  The following pseudocode hints at the strategy.


```
// Pseudocode for handling extremely large datasets
function intersection_large(arr1_path, arr2_path):
  // Load arrays in chunks from disk (arr1_path, arr2_path are file paths)
  count1 = initializeEmptyCounter() // Use a disk-backed or distributed counter
  count2 = initializeEmptyCounter()

  //Process each chunk:
  for chunk1 in loadChunks(arr1_path):
    updateCounter(count1, chunk1)

  for chunk2 in loadChunks(arr2_path):
    updateCounter(count2, chunk2)


  intersection_size = calculateIntersection(count1, count2) // Optimized distributed calculation

  return intersection_size
```

This pseudocode emphasizes the need for techniques capable of handling data exceeding available RAM.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

"Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.  This comprehensive text provides detailed coverage of algorithms and data structures, including hash tables and their applications.

"Algorithms" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.  Another excellent resource covering a wide range of algorithms with a practical focus.

"Programming Pearls" by Jon Bentley.  This book offers valuable insights into algorithm design and optimization techniques for practical problems.  It emphasizes efficiency and problem-solving.


By utilizing these resources and the approaches outlined in the code examples, you can significantly improve the efficiency of calculating the intersection size of corresponding multisets in two 3D arrays.  The key is to move beyond naive iteration and leverage the power of efficient data structures designed for set operations. Remember to profile your code to identify bottlenecks and guide further optimization efforts based on the characteristics of your specific data.
