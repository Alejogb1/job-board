Tensor concatenation in TensorFlow 2.0 hinges on understanding the underlying data structure and the `tf.concat` function's requirements.  My experience optimizing deep learning models for large-scale image processing frequently necessitated efficient tensor manipulation, and thus I gained considerable expertise in this area.  Crucially, the success of concatenation depends entirely on aligning tensor dimensions appropriately prior to the operation.  Failure to do so will result in a `ValueError`.

**1.  Explanation of Tensor Concatenation in TensorFlow 2.0:**

TensorFlow tensors are multi-dimensional arrays. Concatenation involves joining tensors along a specified axis.  This axis must be consistent across all tensors involved in the operation.  Consider tensors as stacks of arrays; concatenation adds more arrays to the stack (axis 0), or extends existing arrays (axis 1 or higher).  The `tf.concat` function facilitates this. Its primary arguments are a list of tensors and the axis along which the concatenation should occur.

The axis parameter is zero-indexed.  An axis of 0 implies concatenation along the first dimension (typically the batch size in machine learning contexts).  An axis of 1 implies concatenation along the second dimension (often the feature dimension or spatial dimensions for images). Higher-order axes follow this pattern.  Before invoking `tf.concat`, it is essential to verify the dimensionality and shape compatibility of all input tensors concerning the chosen concatenation axis.  Mismatched dimensions along any axis other than the specified concatenation axis will lead to the aforementioned `ValueError`.

During my work on a project involving temporal data analysis using recurrent neural networks, I encountered a scenario where I needed to concatenate sequences of varying lengths.  Addressing this required careful padding of the shorter sequences to match the length of the longest sequence before concatenation, otherwise the `tf.concat` function would fail.  This padding ensures that all sequences contribute equally to the final tensor.  Similar considerations apply to image data; if concatenating images of different resolutions, pre-processing to standardize dimensions is crucial.

Furthermore, the data types of the tensors must be compatible. Implicit type coercion is limited; if tensors have different data types, an explicit type conversion using `tf.cast` is required before concatenation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Concatenating tensors along axis 0 (batch dimension):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor_b = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

concatenated_tensor = tf.concat([tensor_a, tensor_b], axis=0)

print(concatenated_tensor)
# Output: tf.Tensor(
# [[1 2]
#  [3 4]
#  [5 6]
#  [7 8]], shape=(4, 2), dtype=int32)
```

This example demonstrates the simplest case. Two tensors of shape (2, 2) are concatenated along axis 0, resulting in a tensor of shape (4, 2).  The first dimension increases while the second remains unchanged.

**Example 2: Concatenating tensors along axis 1 (feature dimension):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_c = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
tensor_d = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

concatenated_tensor = tf.concat([tensor_c, tensor_d], axis=1)

print(concatenated_tensor)
# Output: tf.Tensor(
# [[1 2 5 6]
#  [3 4 7 8]], shape=(2, 4), dtype=int32)
```

Here, the same tensors are concatenated along axis 1. The second dimension increases, while the first dimension stays constant, resulting in a (2, 4) shaped tensor. Note that this is only possible because the first dimension (2) is identical in both `tensor_c` and `tensor_d`.

**Example 3: Concatenating tensors with different data types (requiring type conversion):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_e = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=tf.float32)
tensor_f = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]], dtype=tf.int32)

tensor_f_casted = tf.cast(tensor_f, dtype=tf.float32) #Type conversion is crucial here.

concatenated_tensor = tf.concat([tensor_e, tensor_f_casted], axis=0)

print(concatenated_tensor)
# Output: tf.Tensor(
# [[1. 2.]
#  [3. 4.]
#  [5. 6.]
#  [7. 8.]], shape=(4, 2), dtype=float32)
```

This example highlights the necessity of data type consistency.  `tensor_f` is explicitly cast to `tf.float32` to match the data type of `tensor_e` before concatenation.  Attempting to concatenate without type conversion would raise an error.  This type conversion step is vital for preventing unexpected behavior and ensuring the correctness of the final concatenated tensor.  In my experience, neglecting this often led to subtle bugs that were difficult to debug.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation itself provides extensive and detailed information on tensor manipulation and the `tf.concat` function.  Understanding the specifics of tensor shapes and data types from the official documentation is fundamental.  Furthermore, exploring introductory materials on linear algebra will significantly enhance the understanding of tensor operations.  Finally, studying the design and implementation of convolutional neural networks, which frequently leverage tensor manipulation, will provide practical context and examples.
