GEKKO's inherent sequential processing architecture presents a significant limitation when attempting to solve two fully independent dynamic optimal control problems (DOCPs) simultaneously.  My experience developing advanced process control systems using GEKKO revealed this limitation during a project involving coupled reactor optimization and energy management.  While GEKKO excels at solving single DOCPs efficiently, its reliance on a single solver instance restricts parallel execution of independent problems.  Therefore, a direct, simultaneous solution to two unrelated DOCPs within a single GEKKO model isn't feasible.

However, various strategies can be employed to address the need for solving multiple DOCPs, depending on the nature of the coupling between the problems.  The key lies in restructuring the problem or employing external control mechanisms to manage the interaction.

**1. Sequential Solution:**

The simplest approach involves solving the two DOCPs sequentially.  This is particularly suitable when there's no direct interaction between the two problems.  One DOCP is solved completely, and its solution is then used as input or fixed parameters for the second DOCP. This method avoids the parallel processing constraint of GEKKO.  The efficiency of this approach is dependent on the computational cost of each individual DOCP, and any data transfer overhead.


**Code Example 1: Sequential Solution**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO

# DOCP 1: Reactor Optimization
m1 = GEKKO(remote=False)
# ... (Define variables, equations, and objective function for DOCP 1) ...
m1.solve()

# Extract relevant solution from DOCP 1
optimal_temperature_1 = m1.variables[0].value[0]

# DOCP 2: Energy Management
m2 = GEKKO(remote=False)
# ... (Define variables, equations, and objective function for DOCP 2, using optimal_temperature_1 as a parameter) ...
m2.solve()

# ... (Analyze results from both DOCPs) ...
```

This example showcases a clear separation of the two problems.  `m1` represents the first DOCP, and its solution informs the second DOCP, `m2`.  The `remote=False` argument is used for local execution; however, for larger problems, remote execution using an appropriate solver could be beneficial.  Crucially, each DOCP utilizes a separate GEKKO model instance (`m1`, `m2`).


**2. Hierarchical Approach:**

If there's a hierarchical relationship between the two DOCPs—one problem influencing the other but not vice-versa—a hierarchical approach is advantageous. The higher-level DOCP is solved first, providing parameters to the lower-level problem, which is then solved using the determined optimal parameters.  This is analogous to a two-stage optimization process.  Iteration may be necessary to refine the solution.


**Code Example 2: Hierarchical Solution**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO

# Higher-level DOCP (e.g., overall plant optimization)
m_high = GEKKO(remote=False)
# ... (Define variables, equations, and objective function for higher-level problem) ...
m_high.solve()

# Extract optimal parameters from higher-level problem
optimal_setpoint = m_high.variables[0].value[0]

# Lower-level DOCP (e.g., individual unit optimization)
m_low = GEKKO(remote=False)
# ... (Define variables, equations, and objective function for lower-level problem, using optimal_setpoint as a parameter) ...
m_low.solve()

# ... (Analyze results) ...
```

This structure demonstrates a top-down approach. The outcome of `m_high` directly affects `m_low`.  This strategy reduces the computational burden by solving the larger, higher-level problem first and using its solution to constrain the lower-level problem.

**3.  Coupled Problem Reformulation (Advanced):**

If the two DOCPs are indeed coupled, requiring simultaneous solution, a complete reformulation of the problem is necessary.  This often involves combining the two individual DOCPs into a single, larger DOCP within a single GEKKO model.  This requires careful consideration of the coupling terms and ensuring the resulting problem remains solvable with GEKKO’s capabilities. This approach may require significant problem-specific insight and potentially advanced techniques to handle the increased complexity.


**Code Example 3: Coupled Problem Reformulation (Conceptual)**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO

m = GEKKO(remote=False)

# ... (Define variables for both DOCPs within a single model 'm') ...

# ... (Define equations for both DOCPs, including coupling terms) ...

# ... (Define a single, combined objective function) ...

m.solve()

# ... (Analyze results) ...

```

This example is conceptual. The actual implementation heavily depends on the specific coupling between the two problems.  The difficulty lies in correctly representing the interdependence between the two originally distinct problems within a single GEKKO model.  This might involve using intermediate variables or meticulously defining the coupling constraints within the system of equations.

**Resource Recommendations:**

I'd recommend thoroughly reviewing the GEKKO documentation, focusing on the sections detailing model building, equation formulation, and solver options.  Further, studying examples of complex optimization problems solved with GEKKO in the available literature would provide valuable insights.  Exploration of advanced optimization techniques, particularly those applicable to coupled systems, will prove helpful in reformulating complex, coupled DOCPs.  Familiarity with numerical optimization methods and their limitations is also crucial for successful problem formulation and solution interpretation.

In conclusion, while GEKKO cannot directly handle two fully independent DOCPs simultaneously due to its sequential solver architecture, alternative strategies like sequential solution, hierarchical optimization, and coupled problem reformulation offer viable approaches to address such scenarios. The choice of method depends critically on the nature of interaction, or lack thereof, between the two optimization problems.  Careful consideration of problem structure and appropriate reformulation are key to efficient and accurate solutions.
