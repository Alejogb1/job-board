The inherent structure of JSON, as a self-describing data format, necessitates a strategy that considers both its hierarchical nature and the desired granularity of splitting.  Simply dividing the file size is insufficient; a sensible approach requires understanding the logical groupings within the data.  My experience working on large-scale geospatial datasets has highlighted the importance of splitting based on meaningful data partitions, rather than arbitrary file sizes.  This ensures data integrity and facilitates efficient processing of subsets.

**1. Data Structure Analysis and Partitioning Strategy:**

Before implementing any splitting mechanism, a thorough analysis of the JSON dataset's structure is paramount.  This involves identifying the logical units within the data â€“  whether it's based on individual records, geographical regions, time intervals, or any other relevant attribute.  For instance, in my work with climate data, splitting by geographical coordinates (latitude/longitude bounds) was far more practical than splitting by the number of bytes.  This analysis guides the selection of the appropriate splitting algorithm and determines the optimal size and number of output files.  Incorrect partitioning can lead to inefficient processing and data inconsistencies.


**2. Algorithm Selection and Implementation:**

Several approaches exist for splitting JSON data, each suitable for different scenarios.  A common approach involves iterating through the JSON data, grouping records based on the chosen partitioning key, and writing each group to a separate file.  This method is efficient for datasets that can be readily divided into logically cohesive subsets.  Another approach, more suitable for datasets with no clear internal structure, might involve splitting the file based on a fixed number of records per file.  For extremely large files where even reading the entire file into memory is infeasible, a streaming approach, processing the JSON data line by line, becomes necessary.

**3. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different splitting strategies using Python.  I've avoided external libraries for maximum clarity and to highlight fundamental concepts.  Assume the input JSON data is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing a data record.

**Example 1: Splitting by Number of Records:**

```python
import json

def split_by_records(input_file, output_prefix, records_per_file):
    """Splits a JSON dataset into multiple files based on the number of records per file."""
    try:
        with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{input_file}' not found.")
        return
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print(f"Error: Invalid JSON format in '{input_file}'.")
        return

    num_records = len(data)
    num_files = (num_records + records_per_file - 1) // records_per_file  # Ceiling division

    for i in range(num_files):
        start_index = i * records_per_file
        end_index = min((i + 1) * records_per_file, num_records)
        subset = data[start_index:end_index]
        output_file = f"{output_prefix}_{i+1}.json"
        with open(output_file, 'w') as outfile:
            json.dump(subset, outfile, indent=4)
        print(f"File '{output_file}' created successfully.")

#Example Usage
split_by_records("input.json", "output", 1000) #Splits into files with 1000 records each
```

This function directly addresses the problem by dividing the input JSON list into chunks of a specified size. Error handling ensures robustness.  The `indent` parameter in `json.dump` improves readability of the output files.


**Example 2: Splitting by a Key Field:**

```python
import json
from collections import defaultdict

def split_by_key(input_file, output_prefix, key_field):
    """Splits a JSON dataset into multiple files based on unique values of a specified key field."""
    try:
        with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{input_file}' not found.")
        return
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print(f"Error: Invalid JSON format in '{input_file}'.")
        return

    grouped_data = defaultdict(list)
    for record in data:
        key_value = record.get(key_field) #Handles potential missing keys gracefully
        if key_value is not None:
            grouped_data[key_value].append(record)
        else:
            print(f"Warning: Record missing key '{key_field}', skipping.")

    for key, value in grouped_data.items():
        output_file = f"{output_prefix}_{key}.json"
        with open(output_file, 'w') as outfile:
            json.dump(value, outfile, indent=4)
        print(f"File '{output_file}' created successfully.")

#Example Usage:
split_by_key("input.json", "output_by_city", "city") #Splits by the 'city' field

```

This function groups records based on a specific key field (e.g., city, date, ID).  The use of `defaultdict` simplifies the grouping process and handles cases where the key field might be missing in some records.


**Example 3: Streaming Approach for Very Large Files:**

```python
import json
import os

def split_large_json(input_file, output_dir, records_per_file):
    """Splits a very large JSON file using a streaming approach."""
    if not os.path.exists(output_dir):
        os.makedirs(output_dir)

    try:
        with open(input_file, 'r') as f:
            file_count = 1
            records_in_current_file = 0
            current_file = open(os.path.join(output_dir, f"part_{file_count}.json"), 'w')
            for line in f:
                try:
                    record = json.loads(line)
                    json.dump(record, current_file)
                    current_file.write('\n')
                    records_in_current_file += 1
                    if records_in_current_file >= records_per_file:
                        current_file.close()
                        file_count += 1
                        current_file = open(os.path.join(output_dir, f"part_{file_count}.json"), 'w')
                        records_in_current_file = 0
                except json.JSONDecodeError:
                    print(f"Warning: Invalid JSON in line: {line.strip()}")

            current_file.close()
            print(f"Large JSON file split into {file_count} parts.")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{input_file}' not found.")
        return

#Example Usage:
split_large_json("very_large_input.json", "output_parts", 5000) #Splits into files with 5000 records each

```

This approach is designed for exceptionally large files that cannot be loaded entirely into memory. It reads and processes the JSON data line by line, writing each chunk to a separate file. This significantly reduces memory requirements and improves scalability.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For further study, I recommend consulting standard textbooks on data structures and algorithms, focusing on file I/O and JSON processing.  Additionally, exploring the documentation for your chosen programming language's JSON library will prove invaluable.  Consider examining literature on distributed computing and parallel processing for handling extremely large datasets beyond the capacity of a single machine.  Finally, reviewing best practices for data storage and management will help ensure long-term data integrity and accessibility.
