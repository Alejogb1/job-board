TensorFlow 2.0's handling of symbolic tensors, particularly when it comes to printing their values during debugging, differs significantly from its eager execution counterpart.  My experience debugging complex graph-based models has highlighted the crucial role of `tf.print` and the strategic placement of these print operations within the computational graph.  Directly printing a symbolic tensor's value outside of a `tf.function` context typically yields a symbolic representation rather than the numerical value.  This is because symbolic tensors represent computations, not concrete numerical data until they're executed within a session or eager context.


1. **Clear Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in the distinction between symbolic and concrete tensors.  A symbolic tensor is a placeholder representing a computation; its value isn't defined until the computation is executed.  In contrast, a concrete tensor holds numerical data directly. TensorFlow's graph execution model necessitates printing the values within the graph's execution flow, leveraging `tf.print` as the primary mechanism.  Naive attempts to print a symbolic tensor using standard Python `print()` will output a representation like `<tf.Tensor '...' shape=() dtype=...>`, revealing the tensor's operational context but not its numerical value.

`tf.print` is designed for this purpose.  It's an operation that's added to the computational graph.  During graph execution, this operation intercepts the tensor's value at the specified point and prints it to the standard output.  Crucially, the `tf.print` operation does not affect the subsequent flow of the computation. The output appears in the console during runtime, providing a snapshot of the tensor's value at that precise stage of the computation.


2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic `tf.print` usage within a `tf.function`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_function(x):
  x = tf.add(x, 1)
  tf.print("Value of x after addition:", x)
  x = tf.multiply(x, 2)
  return x

x = tf.constant(5.0)
result = my_function(x)
print("Final result:", result) # This prints the symbolic tensor, use tf.print for the value
```

This code demonstrates the basic usage of `tf.print`. The `tf.print` statement is embedded within the `@tf.function`-decorated function, ensuring that the print operation is included in the generated graph.  The output will show the value of `x` after the addition operation, providing a valuable debug snapshot without disrupting the computation. Note that the final `print()` statement still only prints the symbolic tensor representation.


**Example 2:  `tf.print` with multiple tensors and formatting:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def complex_computation(a, b):
  c = tf.add(a, b)
  d = tf.multiply(a, b)
  tf.print("Sum (c):", c, "; Product (d):", d, output_stream=sys.stderr)  # Output to stderr
  e = tf.subtract(c, d)
  return e

a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
result = complex_computation(a, b)
print(result) # Again, this prints the symbolic tensor.  The values are printed by tf.print.
import sys
```

This illustrates the capability to print multiple tensors within a single `tf.print` statement, utilizing different formatting options for clarity.  The `output_stream` argument allows directing the output to standard error (`sys.stderr`), which can be useful to distinguish debug information from the main program output.


**Example 3:  Handling conditional printing with `tf.cond`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def conditional_print(x):
  def print_positive():
    tf.print("x is positive:", x)
    return x

  def print_negative():
    tf.print("x is negative:", x)
    return x

  result = tf.cond(tf.greater(x, 0), print_positive, print_negative)
  return result

x = tf.constant(-2.5)
result = conditional_print(x)
print(result) # Symbolic tensor; the numerical value is printed by tf.print inside the tf.cond branch.
```

This example shows how to incorporate conditional printing within a `tf.function`.  The `tf.cond` operation selectively executes either `print_positive` or `print_negative` based on the value of `x`.  This allows for targeted debugging, focusing on specific conditions within the computation.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is an invaluable resource for understanding the intricacies of graph execution and debugging techniques.  Focus on sections pertaining to `tf.function`, control flow operations (`tf.cond`, `tf.while_loop`), and debugging strategies within the context of graph execution.  Exploring advanced TensorFlow debugging tools, such as TensorBoard, will significantly enhance your ability to visualize and understand the flow of data and computations within complex models.  Reviewing materials on computational graphs and their execution mechanisms will provide a theoretical foundation for effectively leveraging `tf.print`.  Finally, studying examples and case studies of complex TensorFlow models will illustrate practical applications of debugging techniques, including the strategic placement of `tf.print` statements.  Understanding the lifecycle of tensors within a TensorFlow graph is key to solving issues related to printing their values.  Thoroughly reading through the TensorFlow API documentation related to tensor manipulation and debugging will greatly assist in refining your debugging workflow.
