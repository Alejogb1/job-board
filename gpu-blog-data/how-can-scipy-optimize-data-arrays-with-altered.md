SciPy's optimization capabilities extend beyond simple scalar minimization; they can effectively handle data arrays with dynamically altered shapes by cleverly leveraging functions that return not just a single value, but a structured array or a scalar representing an array-derived metric. This approach allows the optimizer to indirectly manipulate the data array's shape by modifying the parameters which influence the construction or transformation of the array, thus optimizing toward a desired state. The core principle revolves around defining an objective function that processes a dynamically shaped array and returns a scalar value that represents the fitness or "cost" of that array state according to some criteria. I've had to implement this in the past when working on computational fluid dynamics simulations, and managing adaptive mesh refinements.

The key lies in the objective function. Rather than attempting to directly minimize a multi-dimensional array, one uses an objective function that: (1) accepts parameters, (2) uses these parameters to generate or alter an array, and (3) then computes a scalar value from this altered array that the optimizer tries to minimize (or maximize). SciPy's optimization algorithms work with scalar values, hence the crucial conversion from the array's state to a single number. This can be a simple sum of the array, a more complex statistical metric, or even a physically meaningful quantity extracted from the array. The shape of the array isn’t explicitly defined as something to be optimized; it’s the *parameters* that generate that array whose values are adjusted by the optimizer. If the shape change is implicitly tied to these parameters, then indirectly we are optimizing the array’s shape as well.

Consider a scenario where I needed to optimize the point spread function (PSF) in a simulated imaging system. The PSF was represented as a 2D array. The optimization parameters were not directly the PSF's elements, but rather the parameters of a Gaussian blur applied to a seed image. I used the following process.

First, I defined a function to generate the PSF based on the adjustable parameters.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage import gaussian_filter

def generate_psf(seed_image, sigma_x, sigma_y):
    """Generates a PSF from a seed image and Gaussian blur parameters."""
    blurred_image = gaussian_filter(seed_image, sigma=(sigma_x, sigma_y))
    # Normalize to sum to 1.0 to maintain correct interpretation as a PSF
    return blurred_image / np.sum(blurred_image)
```

Next, I define the objective function. This function generates a PSF from parameters, and then calculates some quality metric of the PSF.

```python
def objective_function(params, seed_image, target_psf):
    """Calculates the sum of squared differences between the generated PSF and target PSF."""
    sigma_x, sigma_y = params
    generated_psf = generate_psf(seed_image, sigma_x, sigma_y)
    return np.sum((generated_psf - target_psf)**2)
```

Finally, I invoke SciPy's optimizer using the function, initial parameter values, and the target data.

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Assuming seed_image and target_psf are already defined as 2D numpy arrays.
seed_image = np.ones((51,51))
target_psf = np.zeros((51, 51))
target_psf[25,25] = 1.0

initial_params = [1.0, 1.0]
result = minimize(objective_function, initial_params,
               args=(seed_image, target_psf), method='Nelder-Mead')

print(f"Optimized Sigma X: {result.x[0]:.4f}")
print(f"Optimized Sigma Y: {result.x[1]:.4f}")

optimized_psf = generate_psf(seed_image, result.x[0], result.x[1])
```

In the above, the `seed_image` and `target_psf` are numpy arrays of shape 51x51. The parameters `sigma_x` and `sigma_y` are used to *indirectly* shape the resultant `generated_psf`. While the array itself is always the same shape (51x51), its *content* is altered through the optimization of these parameters. The optimizer changes `sigma_x` and `sigma_y` to bring the *content* of the generated PSF array closer to that of the target PSF.

Consider another scenario where I needed to fit a variable number of Gaussian functions to a signal. The signal was represented by a 1D array. I needed to vary the number of Gaussians as a parameter of the system, in addition to adjusting the Gaussian centers, amplitudes, and widths. This required a more complicated parameter and function definition.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def gaussian(x, amplitude, center, width):
    """Defines a single Gaussian function."""
    return amplitude * np.exp(-0.5 * ((x - center) / width)**2)

def sum_of_gaussians(x, params):
    """Calculates the sum of multiple Gaussian functions."""
    num_gaussians = len(params) // 3
    total_gaussian = np.zeros_like(x)
    for i in range(num_gaussians):
        amplitude = params[3*i]
        center = params[3*i + 1]
        width = params[3*i + 2]
        total_gaussian += gaussian(x, amplitude, center, width)
    return total_gaussian

def objective_function_gaussians(params, x, target_signal):
    """Calculates sum of squared differences between the sum of gaussians and the target."""
    generated_signal = sum_of_gaussians(x, params)
    return np.sum((generated_signal - target_signal)**2)
```

In this setup, the `params` array is not a direct representation of the signal itself, but rather contains values that indirectly control the shape of the resultant signal. The number of parameters passed to the function effectively alters the number of gaussians contributing to the generated signal.

```python
# Example usage with a synthetic signal.

x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
#Example target signal composed of two gaussians
target_signal = gaussian(x, 3, -1, 1) + gaussian(x, 2, 2, 0.5)

#Initial guesses for the parameters. Here we are trying to fit two Gaussians initially.
initial_params = [2.0, -2, 0.8, 1.5, 1.5, 0.6]

result = minimize(objective_function_gaussians, initial_params,
               args=(x, target_signal), method='Nelder-Mead')

print(f"Optimized Amplitudes: {result.x[0::3]}")
print(f"Optimized Centers: {result.x[1::3]}")
print(f"Optimized Widths: {result.x[2::3]}")

optimized_signal = sum_of_gaussians(x, result.x)
```

Here, the initial guess for parameters encodes that two Gaussians should be used to fit the `target_signal`. This is not a static setting, because one can alter the number of parameters passed, which also alters the number of gaussians contributing to the signal. Thus, indirectly, this alters the shape of the generated signal.

Finally, consider a case in which I used a grid of points that were perturbed by an optimization algorithm. The grid’s initial shape was defined, but its final shape was dictated by the movement of the points.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from scipy.spatial import Delaunay

def calculate_area(points):
    """Calculates the total area of the Delaunay triangulation defined by the points."""
    tri = Delaunay(points)
    total_area = 0.0
    for simplex in tri.simplices:
        p1 = points[simplex[0]]
        p2 = points[simplex[1]]
        p3 = points[simplex[2]]
        area = 0.5 * abs(p1[0]*(p2[1]-p3[1]) + p2[0]*(p3[1]-p1[1]) + p3[0]*(p1[1]-p2[1]))
        total_area += area
    return total_area

def objective_function_points(params, initial_points):
    """Calculate the negative area of a shape defined by perturbed points."""
    # Reshape the params into the form of a set of x and y perturbations to the point grid.
    num_points = len(initial_points)
    perturbations = np.reshape(params, (num_points, 2))
    perturbed_points = initial_points + perturbations
    # Minimizing the negative of the area to maximize the area.
    return -calculate_area(perturbed_points)
```

The code above calculates the area of a triangulation defined by a set of points.

```python
# Example of an initial point grid and optimization.
initial_points = np.array([[0,0], [1,0], [0,1], [1,1], [0.5, 0.5]])

# Parameters are the dx and dy perturbations for each point.
initial_perturbations = np.zeros(len(initial_points)*2)

result = minimize(objective_function_points, initial_perturbations,
                args=(initial_points), method='Nelder-Mead')

print(f"Optimized Point perturbations: {result.x}")
optimized_points = initial_points + np.reshape(result.x, (len(initial_points), 2))
print(f"Optimized Point positions: {optimized_points}")
```

Here, the `initial_points` array has the shape of Nx2, however its configuration is changed through the optimization of the parameter `initial_perturbations`. This optimization is done to maximize the total area of the triangles defined by the perturbed point positions.

In summary, SciPy’s optimization tools, when used in conjunction with carefully constructed objective functions, can be used to indirectly optimize the shape of data arrays. The optimizer works on the parameters that define or transform the array and does not directly alter the data array itself.

For further reading and understanding of these methods, consider exploring textbooks on numerical optimization and scientific computing. Publications focusing on data fitting methods, such as those from the SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics), are also invaluable resources. Scientific Python documentation, particularly the SciPy user guide, is a critical reference as well.
