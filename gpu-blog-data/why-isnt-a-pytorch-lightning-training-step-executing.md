The most common reason a PyTorch Lightning training step fails to execute stems from incorrect implementation of the `training_step` method, specifically concerning the return value and its interaction with the underlying PyTorch Lightning architecture.  Over the years of working with PyTorch Lightning for large-scale model training, I've debugged countless instances where seemingly correct code failed to progress beyond the initialization phase due to subtle errors in this critical function.  The training step isn't simply about executing the forward and backward pass; it needs to adhere to the Lightning framework's expectations regarding output structure and data flow.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `training_step` method within a PyTorch Lightning `LightningModule` is the core of the training process. It's responsible for performing a single step of training on a batch of data.  Its correct implementation hinges on two crucial aspects:  returning a dictionary containing the loss and potentially other metrics, and ensuring proper handling of the input batch data.  Failures often arise from incorrectly formatted return values, failing to handle exceptions during forward/backward passes, or inconsistencies between the input data structure and the model's expectations. PyTorch Lightning uses this dictionary to track progress, log metrics, and manage the optimization process.  If the dictionary is missing the loss, or the loss is not properly computed (e.g., NaN values), the training loop will halt or produce nonsensical results. Furthermore, issues with data pre-processing or inconsistencies in data loaders can manifest as training step failures, often masked as problems originating within the `training_step` itself.  Therefore, a systematic investigation of data loaders, preprocessing, and the `training_step` method is typically required for effective debugging.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Return Value**

```python
class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        y_hat = self(x)
        loss = F.mse_loss(y_hat, y)
        #INCORRECT: Missing return statement, or returns an incorrect value.
        return None  

```

This example fails because it doesn't return the loss in a dictionary as expected. PyTorch Lightning expects a dictionary with at least a 'loss' key.  The training loop will not receive the loss and will consequently fail to perform backpropagation or update model weights.  The correct implementation is:

```python
class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        y_hat = self(x)
        loss = F.mse_loss(y_hat, y)
        return {'loss': loss}
```


**Example 2: Unhandled Exception**

```python
class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        try:
            y_hat = self(x)  #Potential for exception here
            loss = F.mse_loss(y_hat, y)
            return {'loss': loss}
        except RuntimeError as e:
            print(f"Error during forward pass: {e}")  # This won't stop the training
            return {'loss': torch.tensor(float('inf'))} #Should return a loss

```

This example demonstrates a scenario where an exception might occur during the forward pass (e.g., due to an invalid input shape or an operation error).  The `try-except` block catches the exception; however, simply printing the error message is insufficient. The training loop needs to receive a valid loss value.  Returning a large loss value, such as infinity, signals to the optimizer that something went wrong, which allows the training process to continue but logs the error as a potential problem.  Alternatively, you could raise a custom exception to halt training and pinpoint the problematic data batch.

**Example 3:  Data Loader Mismatch**

```python
class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch # Assumes batch is (x,y)
        y_hat = self(x)
        loss = F.mse_loss(y_hat, y)
        return {'loss': loss}


train_loader = DataLoader(...) #Incorrectly configured DataLoader

trainer = pl.Trainer(...)
trainer.fit(MyModel(), train_loader)

```


This example, though seemingly correct in the `training_step` implementation, can fail if the `train_loader` doesn't provide batches in the expected format.  For instance, if the `train_loader` returns batches containing only `x` but the `training_step` expects `(x, y)`, a `ValueError` or `IndexError` will occur during unpacking, halting the training. Thorough verification of the `train_loader`'s output structure is crucial for preventing such failures.  Careful consideration of batch size, data augmentation, and dataset preprocessing are vital for data loader robustness.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch Lightning documentation is invaluable for understanding the nuances of the framework, especially the specifics of the `training_step` method and its interaction with the trainer. Carefully examining examples provided in the documentation is a highly effective approach to understanding best practices and avoiding common pitfalls.  In addition, studying the source code of well-established PyTorch Lightning projects can give insights into robust implementation patterns. Finally, leveraging the debugging tools available within PyTorch itself – such as breakpoints and detailed error messages – coupled with careful logging of intermediate values within the `training_step` function are essential parts of a robust debugging strategy.  Effective debugging requires systematically examining all aspects of the training pipeline, from data loading to model architecture.
