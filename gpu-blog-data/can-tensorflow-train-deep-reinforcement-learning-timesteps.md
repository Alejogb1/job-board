Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, specifically those trained on time-series data, can indeed leverage TensorFlow to learn from sequences of observations, thus effectively training across timesteps. This is not an inherent limitation of the framework; rather, it’s a matter of implementation and understanding how TensorFlow's computational graph and data handling can be adapted to the specific needs of RL algorithms.

The core challenge in applying TensorFlow to RL lies in the fact that RL agents operate in an environment, receiving observations, taking actions, and receiving rewards—a dynamic process that unfolds over time. Traditional supervised learning, for which TensorFlow was initially designed, deals with static datasets. The temporal dependencies inherent in RL require us to explicitly model the sequence of interactions. Instead of treating each data point as independent, we must consider the interplay of past observations, actions, and resulting rewards when updating the model's parameters.

TensorFlow provides the necessary tools, primarily through its `tf.data` API and its automatic differentiation capabilities, to construct and train models that can handle sequential data. The essential approach is to frame the problem as a sequential prediction task where each timestep's training signal is dependent on previous timesteps. We achieve this by representing the environment’s interaction as a sequence, storing the (observation, action, reward, next_observation, done) tuple for each time-step, and utilizing recurrent or temporal convolutional layers within the model architecture. Furthermore, policy gradient methods, for instance, require a different approach than value-based techniques. We must carefully compute policy gradients that appropriately consider the temporal nature of the transitions.

Consider, for example, a simple Q-learning scenario within an episodic environment. The basic idea is to learn an action-value function, Q(s, a), which estimates the expected cumulative reward of taking action *a* in state *s*. To apply TensorFlow for this, we would implement the Q-function as a neural network. Here is an initial, basic illustration:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class QNetwork(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, num_actions):
        super(QNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
        self.output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_actions)

    def call(self, state):
      x = self.dense1(state)
      x = self.dense2(x)
      return self.output_layer(x)

# Parameters for the environment
num_states = 4 # Let's pretend we have 4-dimensional state space
num_actions = 2  # Let's say we can perform 2 actions

# Create the Q-network and the optimizer
q_network = QNetwork(num_actions)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
```
This example demonstrates the basic structure for representing the Q-function as a neural network in TensorFlow. However, a fundamental part of applying Q-learning is storing experiences and sampling batches for updates. Here is how we might construct a simple replay buffer and a training loop:

```python
import random
# Replay Buffer
class ReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, buffer_size):
      self.buffer_size = buffer_size
      self.buffer = []

    def add(self, transition):
        self.buffer.append(transition)
        if len(self.buffer) > self.buffer_size:
          self.buffer.pop(0)

    def sample(self, batch_size):
      if len(self.buffer) < batch_size:
        return None
      return random.sample(self.buffer, batch_size)

# Training Loop (simplified)
def train_step(states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones, discount_factor = 0.99):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    q_values = q_network(states)
    next_q_values = q_network(next_states)

    max_next_q = tf.reduce_max(next_q_values, axis=1)
    target_q = rewards + discount_factor * max_next_q * (1-dones)
    one_hot_actions = tf.one_hot(actions, num_actions)
    q_values_selected = tf.reduce_sum(q_values * one_hot_actions, axis = 1)

    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(target_q - q_values_selected))

  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, q_network.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, q_network.trainable_variables))
  return loss

# Main loop
buffer_size = 10000
batch_size = 32
episodes = 100
replay_buffer = ReplayBuffer(buffer_size)
epsilon = 0.2 #Epsilon greedy

for episode in range(episodes):
    state = np.random.random((1,num_states)).astype(np.float32) # Initial State
    done = False
    total_loss = 0
    steps = 0
    while not done and steps < 200:
      if random.random() < epsilon:
        action = np.random.choice(num_actions)
      else:
        q_values = q_network(state)
        action = np.argmax(q_values.numpy())
      next_state = np.random.random((1,num_states)).astype(np.float32) # Simulating env return
      reward = np.random.normal() # Simulating reward
      done = random.random() < 0.1 #Simulating random done
      replay_buffer.add((state, action, reward, next_state, done))
      state = next_state
      batch = replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
      if batch:
        states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*batch)
        states = np.concatenate(states)
        actions = np.array(actions)
        rewards = np.array(rewards)
        next_states = np.concatenate(next_states)
        dones = np.array(dones,dtype=np.float32)
        loss = train_step(states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones)
        total_loss += loss.numpy()
      steps +=1
    print(f"Episode {episode+1}, Loss: {total_loss}")

```
Here, the replay buffer is used to collect transitions from agent’s interaction with the environment. These transitions are then sampled to update the Q-network. Notably, the update rule for Q-learning is constructed manually within the `train_step` function. This is a common characteristic when implementing RL algorithms.

The code above, however, does not leverage the sequential information to it’s potential. Consider a scenario in which observations need to be processed over time: we might require recurrent layers. If we are dealing with a policy gradient method, the training process is different from value based techniques. Let's implement a simple recurrent policy network to highlight how this may be implemented.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class PolicyNetwork(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, num_actions, hidden_size=64):
        super(PolicyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(hidden_size)
        self.dense_policy = tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_actions, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
      x = self.lstm(inputs)
      return self.dense_policy(x)

# Parameters for the environment
num_states = 4
num_actions = 2
# Create the Policy network
policy_network = PolicyNetwork(num_actions)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

# Training Loop (simplified)
def train_policy_step(states, actions, advantages, discount_factor=0.99):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        action_probs = policy_network(states)
        one_hot_actions = tf.one_hot(actions, num_actions)
        log_probs = tf.math.log(tf.reduce_sum(action_probs * one_hot_actions, axis = 1) + 1e-8) #To avoid log(0)

        policy_loss = -tf.reduce_mean(log_probs*advantages)

    gradients = tape.gradient(policy_loss, policy_network.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, policy_network.trainable_variables))
    return policy_loss


# Main loop
episodes = 100
gamma = 0.99

for episode in range(episodes):
  state_sequence = []
  action_sequence = []
  reward_sequence = []

  state = np.random.random((1,1,num_states)).astype(np.float32)
  done = False
  total_reward = 0
  steps = 0
  while not done and steps < 200:
      action_probs = policy_network(state)
      action = np.random.choice(num_actions, p = action_probs.numpy()[0])
      next_state = np.random.random((1,1,num_states)).astype(np.float32) #Simulating next state
      reward = np.random.normal() #Simulating reward
      done = random.random() < 0.1 #Simulating random done

      state_sequence.append(state)
      action_sequence.append(action)
      reward_sequence.append(reward)

      state = next_state
      total_reward += reward
      steps +=1

  state_sequence = np.concatenate(state_sequence,axis=1)
  action_sequence = np.array(action_sequence)
  reward_sequence = np.array(reward_sequence)
  G = np.zeros_like(reward_sequence, dtype=np.float32)
  cumulative = 0
  for i in reversed(range(len(reward_sequence))):
      cumulative = reward_sequence[i] + gamma * cumulative
      G[i] = cumulative

  G = (G- np.mean(G)) / (np.std(G) + 1e-8) # Normalize G
  loss = train_policy_step(state_sequence, action_sequence, G)

  print(f"Episode {episode+1}, Reward: {total_reward}, Loss {loss.numpy()}")
```

In this policy gradient example, the network uses an LSTM layer to process states sequentially. We compute the advantage by using return, G. And finally, the training step updates the policy to maximize expected return. Each episode is treated as a single sequence. The important point here is how the sequence data is processed with TensorFlow: we use `concatenate` to put all the sequence observations in the same batch.

These examples demonstrate that training deep RL models across timesteps is feasible within TensorFlow. Key to success is understanding how to properly represent temporal dependencies, compute appropriate gradients, and utilize TensorFlow's data handling and computation engine.

For further learning, I would recommend exploring publications by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto; they provide a thorough overview of RL principles. Additionally, resources detailing the theoretical underpinnings of policy gradient methods are essential. Specifically, material concerning the Generalized Advantage Estimation can provide greater insights into the training of these models. Moreover, diving into open source RL libraries built on top of TensorFlow such as stable-baselines3 will also prove invaluable. Careful understanding of these resources alongside practical experimentation with toy problems will aid any engineer working in RL with TensorFlow.
