The root cause of a Keras custom layer only being invoked once typically stems from incorrect placement within the model's architecture, specifically related to how Keras handles layer execution during the `fit()` method.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image recognition projects highlights the crucial role of layer placement within sequential and functional API models.  Incorrect usage of `trainable` attributes further compounds this problem, leading to seemingly arbitrary behavior.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Keras, at its core, builds computational graphs representing the model's forward and backward passes.  The order in which layers are added to the model dictates the sequence of operations during training.  When a custom layer is inadvertently positioned in a way that doesn't necessitate its repeated invocation during each batch or epoch, it's only executed once – often during the initial model compilation or graph building phase.

This occurs frequently when the layer's output is not directly contributing to the final loss function's computation, or when its intended functionality is misaligned with its position within the model.  For instance, a custom layer designed for data augmentation should typically be placed *before* the core processing layers.  If it's placed after the main processing layers (e.g., before the final dense layer), its output won't influence the gradient updates, leading to its single execution.

Furthermore, setting the `trainable` attribute of a custom layer to `False` explicitly prevents Keras from backpropagating gradients through it. While this can be useful for certain functionalities like feature extraction from pre-trained models, accidental disabling of this attribute in a layer intended for training will prevent it from being called during gradient descent, resulting in only a single call during model compilation.

Another less common but equally important consideration lies in the layer's internal state. If a custom layer has internal variables that are only updated during the first call and not subsequently reset or updated, it might appear as though it's only called once, when in reality, its internal state is simply not changing.  Proper initialization and state management within the `call()` method are essential to mitigate such instances.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Incorrect Placement in a Sequential Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()

    def call(self, inputs):
        print("Custom layer called!")  # Debugging statement
        return inputs * 2

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    MyCustomLayer(),  # Incorrect placement – Should be earlier for data augmentation-like effects
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

In this example, `MyCustomLayer` is placed after the core processing layer.  Its output is used only to feed the final dense layer. If `MyCustomLayer` is intended to perform some transformation, the output from this layer does not impact the training of earlier layers, leading to a single execution.  Moving it earlier in the sequence will resolve this.


**Example 2:  `trainable=False` Misuse**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(10,10), initializer='random_normal', trainable=False) #Incorrectly set to False

    def call(self, inputs):
        print("Custom layer called!")
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

model = keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

Here, the `trainable` attribute is set to `False`.  The weights `self.w` will not be updated during training, thus the layer’s effect will appear static across epochs and might lead to the impression of a single execution.  Setting `trainable=True` rectifies this.


**Example 3: Functional API and State Management Issue**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.counter = tf.Variable(0, trainable=False)

    def call(self, inputs):
        self.counter.assign_add(1)
        print(f"Custom layer called! Counter: {self.counter.numpy()}")
        return inputs

input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = MyCustomLayer()(input_tensor)
output = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates a potential issue with internal layer state.  Although the `call` method is executed repeatedly, the output remains the same.   The `counter` variable is updated each time, confirming the layer is called. However, if the layer's logic depended on some improperly managed internal state reset, it might incorrectly give the impression of a single call.  This showcases the importance of carefully managing internal variables and states within custom layers.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official Keras documentation provides comprehensive guides on creating and utilizing custom layers.  Explore the documentation sections on the sequential and functional APIs to understand layer interactions thoroughly.  Furthermore, consult advanced TensorFlow tutorials which delve into custom layer implementation and debugging techniques.  A strong understanding of automatic differentiation and backpropagation within deep learning frameworks will significantly aid in diagnosing such problems.  Finally, carefully examine the error messages and warnings generated during model compilation and training; these often point to the precise location and nature of the issue.
