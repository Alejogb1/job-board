The `docker inspect` command's omission of certain environment variables frequently stems from the manner in which those variables are set within the container's runtime environment.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous microservice deployments has consistently pointed to a crucial distinction between environment variables directly defined during container creation and those subsequently injected or altered within the container's lifecycle.  `docker inspect` primarily reflects the initial configuration at container creation, not dynamic runtime changes.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `docker inspect` command provides a comprehensive JSON representation of a container's configuration, including its initial state.  Crucially, this state reflects the environment variables explicitly defined during the `docker run` or `docker create` command using the `-e` flag or equivalent methods in a `docker-compose.yml` file.  However, environment variables set *within* the container itself, through processes like scripts executed at startup or during runtime manipulation of the environment, are not reflected in the output of `docker inspect`.  This is because `docker inspect` interrogates the container's configuration as initially understood by the Docker daemon, not its dynamically changing internal state.

Therefore, if a script within your container modifies or adds environment variables, those changes are confined to the container's process space.  The Docker daemon, and consequently `docker inspect`, remains unaware of these internal modifications. This behavior aligns with Docker's principle of container immutability at the configuration layer, promoting predictable and reproducible deployments.

Furthermore, environment variables inherited from the host system during container creation (often crucial in development but potentially problematic in production due to security and portability concerns) are also not always directly reflected in the `docker inspect` output. The daemon might not explicitly list inherited variables, especially if overridden within the container's configuration.

Finally, security contexts and limitations within the container, such as those imposed by SELinux or AppArmor, can restrict access to certain environment variables, leading to their apparent absence from the `docker inspect` output for security reasons.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Environment variables set during container creation:**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

ENV MY_VAR="Hello from Dockerfile"
ENV ANOTHER_VAR=123

CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo $MY_VAR; echo $ANOTHER_VAR; env"]
```

This Dockerfile explicitly defines `MY_VAR` and `ANOTHER_VAR`. `docker inspect` will show these variables.  The `CMD` instruction utilizes `env` to verify that these variables exist within the containerâ€™s environment at runtime.  This demonstrates the intended behavior; variables set in the Dockerfile are visible to `docker inspect`.

**Example 2: Environment variables set within the container:**

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu bash -c 'export MY_RUNTIME_VAR="Set at runtime"; env'
```

Here, `MY_RUNTIME_VAR` is set *inside* the running container.  `docker inspect` *will not* show this variable. The `env` command within the container proves it's present during the container's execution, but it's outside the scope of `docker inspect`.  This highlights the key difference: `docker inspect` observes the initial settings, not runtime changes.

**Example 3:  Environment variables inherited but masked:**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

ENV MY_VAR="Defined in Dockerfile"

CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo $MY_VAR; env"]
```

Assume the host machine has an environment variable `MY_VAR="Host Value"`. When running the container with this Dockerfile, `MY_VAR` will be "Defined in Dockerfile" inside the container, masking the host value.  `docker inspect` will show only "Defined in Dockerfile" because it represents the explicit container settings, overriding any potential inheritance.  Accessing the host value from within the container would depend on specific host-to-container mechanisms beyond the scope of environment variables directly managed via `docker inspect`.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Docker's environment variable handling, I strongly recommend consulting the official Docker documentation.  Thorough examination of the `docker run` and `docker-compose` specifications will clarify the intricacies of environment variable injection.  Finally, review advanced container management techniques, including those related to security contexts and process management, for a more comprehensive perspective on the subject.  A robust grasp of shell scripting and the nuances of environment variable inheritance within Linux systems will further enhance your troubleshooting abilities. These resources, when studied carefully, provide the crucial context missing from a superficial understanding of `docker inspect`'s limitations.
