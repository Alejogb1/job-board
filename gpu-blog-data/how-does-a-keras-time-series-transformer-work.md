The core functionality of a Keras Time Series Transformer hinges on its ability to leverage the inherent sequential nature of time series data through the attention mechanism, unlike recurrent architectures which suffer from vanishing gradients and computational limitations at long sequences.  My experience working on high-frequency trading models underscored this advantage; the Transformer's parallel processing significantly improved prediction speed for complex market dynamics compared to LSTMs.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

The Keras implementation of a Time Series Transformer builds upon the architecture proposed in the seminal "Attention is All You Need" paper, adapting it specifically for sequential data with temporal dependencies.  Instead of relying on recurrent connections, it utilizes self-attention to weigh the importance of different time steps within a given input sequence. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies more effectively.  The input time series data is typically processed as a sequence of vectors, each representing a time step's features.  These vectors are then passed through an embedding layer to project them into a higher-dimensional space suitable for the attention mechanism.

The self-attention mechanism calculates attention weights for each time step, indicating the relevance of other time steps in predicting the current one.  This involves computing query, key, and value matrices from the embedded input sequence.  The dot product of the query matrix and the transposed key matrix provides the attention scores, which are then scaled down and passed through a softmax function to obtain normalized attention weights.  These weights are then used to compute a weighted sum of the value matrix, resulting in a context vector for each time step that incorporates information from the entire sequence.

Multiple self-attention layers can be stacked to capture increasingly complex relationships within the data.  Each layer processes the output of the previous layer, allowing the model to learn hierarchical representations.  After the self-attention layers, a feed-forward network is typically applied to further process the contextualized embeddings.  Finally, a linear layer and an activation function (e.g., sigmoid for binary classification or linear for regression) generate the output, representing the model's prediction for the time series. Positional encoding is crucial; it adds information about the temporal order of the input sequence, as self-attention is permutation-invariant without it.  This is often implemented using sinusoidal functions.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Time Series Forecasting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def create_transformer_model(input_shape, output_units):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = layers.Embedding(input_dim=100, output_dim=64)(inputs) # Example embedding
    x = layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=8, key_dim=64)(x, x)
    x = layers.LayerNormalization()(x)
    x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
    x = layers.LayerNormalization()(x)
    outputs = layers.Dense(output_units)(x)
    return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

model = create_transformer_model((100,1),1) #100 timesteps, 1 feature, 1 output
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.summary()
```

This example demonstrates a basic time series forecasting model. The `Embedding` layer converts integer inputs (e.g., representing different features) into dense vectors. The `MultiHeadAttention` layer is the core of the transformer, followed by layer normalization for stability.  The final `Dense` layer outputs the forecast.  Note that the input shape dictates the length of the time series and the number of input features.  The output units would depend on the forecasting task (e.g., single value prediction vs. multivariate).

**Example 2:  Multivariate Time Series Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def create_transformer_classifier(input_shape, num_classes):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)(inputs) #Normalize multivariate inputs
    x = layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=4, key_dim=input_shape[-1])(x, x)
    x = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)(x)
    x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(x)  #Aggregate temporal information
    x = layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)
    outputs = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)
    return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

model = create_transformer_classifier((50, 3), 2) #50 timesteps, 3 features, 2 classes
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

This illustrates a classifier for multivariate time series.  Multiple features are processed simultaneously. `GlobalAveragePooling1D` aggregates the temporal information from the attention mechanism's output.  A softmax activation provides class probabilities.

**Example 3: Incorporating Positional Encoding**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def positional_encoding(length, depth):
  depth = depth //2
  positions = tf.range(length)[:, tf.newaxis]
  depths = tf.range(depth)[tf.newaxis, :]
  angle_rads = positions / tf.pow(10000, (2 * depths / depth))
  angle_rads = tf.cast(angle_rads,dtype=tf.float32)
  pos_encoding = tf.concat([tf.sin(angle_rads), tf.cos(angle_rads)], axis=-1)
  return pos_encoding

def create_transformer_with_positional_encoding(input_shape, output_units):
  inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
  pos_encoding = positional_encoding(input_shape[0], input_shape[1])
  x = inputs + pos_encoding
  x = layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=4, key_dim=input_shape[1])(x, x)
  x = layers.LayerNormalization()(x)
  x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
  x = layers.LayerNormalization()(x)
  outputs = layers.Dense(output_units)(x)
  return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

model = create_transformer_with_positional_encoding((50,128), 1)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.summary()
```

This example explicitly shows the addition of positional encoding to the input sequence.  This is crucial for the model to understand the temporal order of data points.  The `positional_encoding` function computes the positional embeddings which are then added to the input embeddings.
