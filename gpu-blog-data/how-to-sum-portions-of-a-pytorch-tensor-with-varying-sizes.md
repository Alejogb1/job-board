Tensor summation in PyTorch, particularly when dealing with slices of variable dimensions, requires a careful approach to ensure correct element selection and prevent shape mismatches. I've often encountered this in sequence processing tasks where padding is used, or in situations where data segmentation creates non-uniform batch entries. Standard `torch.sum()` isn't directly applicable without preprocessing when you need to sum along the same dimension but with different ranges for different rows or higher-dimensional elements within the tensor.

The crux of this problem lies in how to dynamically specify the portions to be summed. Directly slicing with Python's list-based indexing often fails because you can’t vectorize selection of varying lengths. PyTorch operations are highly optimized for tensor operations and explicit for loops over the tensor will be inefficient and often lead to errors when trying to backpropagate for gradient calculations in training processes. Thus, a masking or indexing-based approach is typically more efficient and idiomatic. It also leverages PyTorch’s optimized functions to handle these operations, maximizing processing speed and efficient resource management.

The most effective way to accomplish partial summation is through a combination of index tensors and `torch.gather()`, or by creating masks with `torch.arange()`, `torch.where()`, and broadcasting. The decision to use a specific technique largely depends on how the variable sizes are defined. If the size information is given as lengths along the axis to be summed, then masking will be more efficient. If the size information is provided by start and end indices, then the indexing approach is more natural and readable.

Let's examine each scenario with some practical examples:

**Example 1: Summation using Masking based on Lengths**

Consider the scenario where we have a tensor representing a batch of sequences with different lengths, padded to a maximum sequence length. Our goal is to sum the actual content in the sequences, ignoring the padded zeros. Let’s simulate such a tensor and the sequence lengths.

```python
import torch

# Example tensor with padded sequences
tensor = torch.tensor([
    [1, 2, 3, 0, 0],
    [4, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 7, 8, 9, 1]
], dtype=torch.float32)

# Lengths of each sequence
lengths = torch.tensor([3, 2, 5])

# Create a mask to exclude padded values
max_length = tensor.size(1)
mask = torch.arange(max_length).unsqueeze(0) < lengths.unsqueeze(1)

# Apply the mask to zero out unwanted values
masked_tensor = tensor * mask

# Sum along dimension 1 (the sequence dimension)
sums = torch.sum(masked_tensor, dim=1)

print("Original Tensor:\n", tensor)
print("Mask:\n", mask)
print("Masked Tensor:\n", masked_tensor)
print("Summed Values:", sums)

```

In this example, `torch.arange(max_length)` generates a sequence representing the column indices from 0 to 4. `lengths.unsqueeze(1)` transforms the `lengths` tensor into a column vector suitable for broadcasting. The comparison `torch.arange(max_length).unsqueeze(0) < lengths.unsqueeze(1)` creates a boolean mask. Applying this mask element-wise using multiplication, sets the padded values to zero. The final summation is straightforward with `torch.sum()` along `dim=1`. This method is particularly efficient when the length information is explicitly available because broadcasting greatly simplifies the construction of the mask.

**Example 2: Summation using Indexing with Start and End Positions**

Now, let's imagine the task is to sum portions defined by specific start and end indices along a given dimension. This arises when you need to perform localized pooling, attention, or variable window computations. Suppose we have a tensor and index ranges defined as start and end points.

```python
import torch

# Example tensor
tensor = torch.arange(20, dtype=torch.float32).reshape(4, 5)

# Start and end indices
start_indices = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2, 0])
end_indices = torch.tensor([3, 4, 4, 5])

# Initialize an empty tensor to store results
sums = torch.zeros(tensor.size(0), dtype=torch.float32)

# Iteratively sum sections based on start and end
for i in range(tensor.size(0)):
    sums[i] = torch.sum(tensor[i, start_indices[i]:end_indices[i]])

print("Original Tensor:\n", tensor)
print("Start Indices:", start_indices)
print("End Indices:", end_indices)
print("Summed Values:", sums)
```

Here, a manual loop is used because the range is not uniform. While the above implementation is explicit and relatively easy to understand, using a loop is not very efficient, especially with large batches. In such cases, combining `torch.arange()` with `torch.gather()` can enhance the efficiency for some applications although not as universally applicable as masking. However, for demonstration purposes, this makes the process of manually summing different portions more understandable.

**Example 3: Summation with Gather and Indices**

In scenarios where the indices represent positions for elements to be summed rather than contiguous ranges, `torch.gather()` provides a vectorised approach. Let's consider an example where we want to sum the elements at specific column positions for each row.

```python
import torch

# Example tensor
tensor = torch.arange(20, dtype=torch.float32).reshape(4, 5)

# Indices to be gathered and summed
indices = torch.tensor([[0, 2, 4], [1, 3], [0, 1, 2, 3], [4]])

# Initialize empty output tensor
sums = torch.zeros(indices.size(0), dtype=torch.float32)

for i, idx in enumerate(indices):
    sums[i] = torch.sum(torch.gather(tensor[i], 0, idx))
    
print("Original Tensor:\n", tensor)
print("Indices:\n", indices)
print("Summed Values:", sums)
```

This method is adaptable if the location to be summed is given in the indices and does not need to be contiguous. The loop is still needed to gather the different indexes for each row.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further learning on tensor manipulation in PyTorch, I recommend exploring the official PyTorch documentation. Specifically, the sections on basic tensor operations, indexing, and broadcasting provide an essential foundation. Tutorials and examples on advanced indexing techniques, especially on using `torch.gather()` and `torch.masked_select()` are also helpful for tackling similar tensor summation tasks. Additionally, the documentation pertaining to masking, and the use of functions like `torch.where()` and `torch.arange()` will facilitate efficient masking applications. Textbooks and articles focusing on deep learning and tensor computations can also deepen your understanding of the underlying concepts and their efficient implementations. Investigating the community forum can also give you insight into practical usage and the common problems faced by users and the solutions adopted.
