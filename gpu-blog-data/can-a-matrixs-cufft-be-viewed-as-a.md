The core misconception underlying the question of viewing a matrix's cuFFT as a 1D transformation of its rows or columns lies in the inherent dimensionality of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its implementation within the cuFFT library. While cuFFT can *process* matrices efficiently, the underlying operation remains a multi-dimensional transform, not a series of independent 1D transforms on rows or columns.  My experience optimizing large-scale simulations for astrophysical modeling has underscored this distinction repeatedly.  Failing to understand this leads to incorrect assumptions about computational complexity and potential performance bottlenecks.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The cuFFT library is designed to compute Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs.  It supports multi-dimensional transforms directly.  When you provide a two-dimensional matrix to cuFFT, you're not instructing it to perform separate 1D FFTs on each row and then each column (or vice versa).  Instead, you're specifying a two-dimensional DFT. The underlying algorithm is a highly optimized version of the Cooley-Tukey algorithm adapted for parallel processing on GPUs, exploiting the inherent parallelism of the FFT algorithm itself.  This multi-dimensional approach leverages sophisticated data layouts and optimized kernel launches for superior performance compared to a naive row-column approach.

A row-column approach would involve several separate kernel launches: one for each row transformation, followed by another set of launches for column transformations. This introduces significant overhead due to data transfers between the GPU's global memory and the fast shared memory, negating much of the performance benefit of using the GPU in the first place.  Furthermore, it would not produce the correct result for a two-dimensional DFT. The two-dimensional DFT considers the relationships between all elements in the matrix, not just those within a single row or column.  A row-wise then column-wise 1D FFT approach only captures one-dimensional correlations within each row and column separately; crucial inter-row and inter-column correlations are lost.

To illustrate, consider a 2x2 matrix. A row-wise then column-wise 1D FFT is fundamentally different from a 2D FFT.  The 2D FFT considers all four entries and their interactions in the frequency domain, which is crucial in image processing, signal processing, and other applications.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples showcase the differences between directly invoking a 2D cuFFT and attempting to simulate it using successive 1D transforms. Note that these examples are simplified for illustrative purposes and lack comprehensive error handling for brevity.

**Example 1: Direct 2D cuFFT**

```c++
#include <cufft.h>
// ... other includes and declarations ...

int main() {
    cufftHandle plan;
    int nx = 1024;
    int ny = 1024;
    cufftComplex *data;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&data, nx * ny * sizeof(cufftComplex));

    // Initialize data...

    cufftPlan2d(&plan, nx, ny, CUFFT_C2C); // Create 2D plan
    cufftExecC2C(plan, data, data, CUFFT_FORWARD); // Execute 2D FFT
    
    // Process transformed data...

    cufftDestroy(plan);
    cudaFree(data);
    return 0;
}
```

This example directly uses the cuFFT library's `cufftPlan2d` to create a plan for a 2D transform and `cufftExecC2C` to execute it.  This is the correct and efficient way to perform a 2D FFT using cuFFT.  The library handles the underlying complexities of the algorithm and data management efficiently.

**Example 2:  Simulated 2D FFT (Row-wise then Column-wise 1D FFTs)**

```c++
#include <cufft.h>
// ... other includes and declarations ...

int main() {
    cufftHandle plan_row, plan_col;
    int nx = 1024;
    int ny = 1024;
    cufftComplex *data;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&data, nx * ny * sizeof(cufftComplex));

    // Initialize data...


    cufftPlan1d(&plan_row, nx, CUFFT_C2C, 1); //Plan for rows
    for (int i = 0; i < ny; ++i) {
        cufftExecC2C(plan_row, data + i * nx, data + i * nx, CUFFT_FORWARD); // Row-wise FFT
    }

    cufftPlan1d(&plan_col, ny, CUFFT_C2C, 1); // Plan for columns
    for (int i = 0; i < nx; ++i) {
        cufftComplex *col = data + i;
        for (int j = 0; j < ny; ++j) {
           col += nx;
        }
        cufftExecC2C(plan_col, col, col, CUFFT_FORWARD); //Column-wise FFT
    }

    // Process (INCORRECT) transformed data...

    cufftDestroy(plan_row);
    cufftDestroy(plan_col);
    cudaFree(data);
    return 0;
}
```

This example attempts to mimic a 2D FFT using two sets of 1D FFTs.  It's significantly slower due to the repeated kernel launches and data access patterns. Crucially, the result is *not* a true 2D DFT; it is a different mathematical operation, producing an incorrect outcome.  The transposition needed for the column-wise FFT further contributes to performance degradation.

**Example 3:  Addressing potential confusion with matrix transposes**

```c++
#include <cufft.h>
// ... other includes and declarations ...

int main(){
  // ...data allocation and initialization...

  cufftHandle plan;
  cufftPlan2d(&plan, nx, ny, CUFFT_C2C);
  cufftExecC2C(plan, data, data, CUFFT_FORWARD);
  // ... processing ...

  //To perform FFT on transposed data, you would need to allocate and copy the transposed matrix to a new location in GPU memory. cuFFT does not directly handle in-place transpositions.

  cufftComplex *transposed_data;
  cudaMalloc((void**)&transposed_data, nx * ny * sizeof(cufftComplex));

  //Copy transposed data here - ideally through an optimized cuBLAS routine

  cufftPlan2d(&plan_transposed, ny, nx, CUFFT_C2C); //Note the swapped dimensions
  cufftExecC2C(plan_transposed, transposed_data, transposed_data, CUFFT_FORWARD);

  //...processing...

  cudaFree(transposed_data);
  cufftDestroy(plan);
  cufftDestroy(plan_transposed);
  cudaFree(data);
  return 0;
}
```

This highlights that while you can perform FFTs on transposed data, you must explicitly manage data transposition and create a new cuFFT plan with the dimensions swapped. This is again, a separate 2D FFT and not a sequence of 1D transformations.  The use of optimized transposition routines, like those within cuBLAS, is highly recommended for best performance.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official cuFFT library documentation, a comprehensive text on the Discrete Fourier Transform, and a relevant publication focusing on parallel FFT algorithms.  Furthermore, NVIDIA's CUDA programming guide offers valuable insights into GPU programming and memory management.  Careful study of these resources is paramount for mastering the nuances of multi-dimensional FFTs.
