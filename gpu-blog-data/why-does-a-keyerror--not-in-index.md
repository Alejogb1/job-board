A `KeyError: '[...] not in index'` during TensorFlow v1 DNN model training typically arises from a mismatch between the input data provided to the model and the expected feature names during the model's construction. Specifically, this error signifies that the model, expecting features based on names it was configured with during its definition, cannot find a column or field corresponding to that name within the data you are feeding it during the training process. This is most commonly observed when using feature columns or when the model definition is tied closely to the names of input features.

In my experience, this problem rarely originates from an internal TensorFlow bug. Instead, it's a symptom of inconsistent data handling, typically falling into a few key scenarios that I will outline below.

Firstly, consider the situation where feature columns are defined using the `tf.feature_column` API. This API is foundational in TensorFlow v1 for defining how your raw data fields should be transformed and input into the model. Each feature column essentially specifies a mapping between a particular column name in your input data and how TensorFlow should interpret it. For instance, you might have a numerical column that you want to treat as a continuous numeric value or a categorical column that needs to be converted to one-hot encoding. Critically, the string passed into the `tf.feature_column` function, be it `tf.feature_column.numeric_column`, `tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list`, or any others, must match exactly the names used as keys when providing your input data during training. If your dataset uses different names or is structured inconsistently, this KeyError will result.

Secondly, a variation of this problem occurs when utilizing placeholders and constructing the model architecture yourself outside the feature column API. In that scenario, the placeholder's dictionary keys used when feeding data during a training step must also match the names used to retrieve those placeholder tensors during model building. If your input `feed_dict` contains keys that the model isn't programmed to expect, the `KeyError` will manifest itself.

Thirdly, issues can surface due to inconsistent data preparation. If data is preprocessed, transformed, or renamed after the model has been constructed, the mismatch between the model's expected names and the dataset's actual names will trigger the error. I have seen this occur in data pipelines where renaming operations, performed on Pandas dataframes for example, were not applied consistently throughout the training pipeline.

To clarify the above, here are concrete examples with commentary.

**Example 1: Feature Column Mismatch**

In this instance, the feature columns are defined with the name 'age,' but the data supplied uses a different name, 'user_age'.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define feature columns
feature_columns = [tf.feature_column.numeric_column('age')]

# Example data (incorrect name)
data = {'user_age': [25, 30, 35]}
labels = [0, 1, 0]

# Build the input function
def input_fn(features, labels, batch_size):
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((dict(features), labels))
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    return dataset.make_one_shot_iterator().get_next()


# Build the estimator (DNNClassifier)
classifier = tf.estimator.DNNClassifier(
    feature_columns=feature_columns,
    hidden_units=[32, 16],
    n_classes=2,
    optimizer=tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001)
)

# Train the model (This WILL RAISE KeyError)
try:
    classifier.train(input_fn=lambda: input_fn(data, labels, 2), steps=5)
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"KeyError caught: {e}")
```
The fix requires ensuring the data key matches the feature column name: replace `'user_age'` with `'age'` in the data dictionary, or, less preferably, change the feature column name to `'user_age'`.

**Example 2: Placeholder Input Mismatch**

Here, placeholder tensors are used directly, but a mistake is made with `feed_dict` when training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define placeholders
input_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1], name='input_data')
label_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None], name='labels')

# Build a simple model
hidden_layer = tf.layers.dense(input_placeholder, units=32, activation=tf.nn.relu)
output_layer = tf.layers.dense(hidden_layer, units=2)
loss = tf.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy(labels=label_placeholder, logits=output_layer)
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001).minimize(loss)

# Example data
data = [[25], [30], [35]]
labels = [0, 1, 0]

# Training loop
with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    for i in range(5):
      # (incorrect feed dict keys) This will RAISE KeyError
      try:
        _, l = sess.run([optimizer, loss], feed_dict={'input_data_wrong': data, 'label_wrong': labels})
      except KeyError as e:
          print(f"KeyError caught: {e}")
```

Correct the `feed_dict` to use the placeholder names, specifically `'input_data'` and `'labels'`.

**Example 3: Inconsistent Data Renaming**

This illustrates a data pipeline issue.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd
# Data Creation
data = {'age_in_years': [25, 30, 35], 'gender':['male', 'female', 'male']}
labels = [0, 1, 0]
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Feature Column Definition
feature_columns = [tf.feature_column.numeric_column('age'), tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list('gender', ['male', 'female'])]
input_feature_names = ['age', 'gender']

# Input Function
def input_fn(features, labels, batch_size):
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((dict(features), labels))
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    return dataset.make_one_shot_iterator().get_next()

# Preprocessing (incorrect - not renaming for feeding to the input function)
df.rename(columns={'age_in_years':'age'}, inplace=True)
# df now has an 'age' column
# But 'features' dictionary passed to input_fn still has original column names

# Build DNNClassifier
classifier = tf.estimator.DNNClassifier(
    feature_columns=feature_columns,
    hidden_units=[32, 16],
    n_classes=2,
    optimizer=tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001)
)

# Training step (This WILL RAISE KeyError)
try:
    classifier.train(input_fn=lambda: input_fn(df[input_feature_names], labels, 2), steps=5)
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"KeyError caught: {e}")
```
The issue is that the Pandas dataframe is modified, but the `input_fn` receives dataframe columns with differing names. The `input_fn` should receive the same names used in feature column definitions or a mapping must be done before passing in the data.

To resolve such `KeyError`s, meticulously inspect the following in your TensorFlow v1 code:

1.  **Feature Column Definitions:** If using `tf.feature_column`, double check that the string names used for feature columns precisely match the keys in the input data you provide. There should be a one-to-one correspondence.

2. **Placeholder Names:** If you directly construct models using placeholders and feed dictionaries, confirm that keys in your `feed_dict` during the training loop exactly correspond to the placeholder names used in the TensorFlow graph.

3.  **Data Transformation Consistency:** Ensure that any data preprocessing, transformation or renaming of columns is consistent throughout your pipeline, from data loading through to feeding the model. Avoid operations that change data names after the model architecture is built.

4. **Input function arguments:** Verify that the function passed to the `input_fn` argument in the estimator calls is structured to receive correct keys. Verify correct column selection or mapping when passing the input features.

For deeper understanding and improved practices, I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically on the `tf.feature_column` API and data ingestion methods. Furthermore, exploring examples of TensorFlow v1 models utilizing `Estimator` classes and placeholder-based implementations would be helpful. Several excellent online courses that cover data preparation for machine learning in Tensorflow v1 might be worth investigating. Finally, reviewing and testing smaller segments of your code is a proven method to isolate these issues.
