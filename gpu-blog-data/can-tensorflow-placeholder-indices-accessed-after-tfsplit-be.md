TensorFlow's `tf.split()` operation, when applied to placeholder tensors, generates a list of tensors.  Crucially, the indices of these resulting tensors are *not* directly transferable to index other, independent placeholder tensors.  This stems from the fundamental difference between the indices generated within the context of the `tf.split()` operation and the independent indexing of distinct tensors in the TensorFlow graph.  My experience debugging complex multi-agent reinforcement learning models, where parallel data streams were split and then individually processed before being recombined, illuminated this critical distinction.

Let me clarify with a precise explanation.  `tf.split()` partitions a tensor along a specified axis. The indices within the returned list simply represent the order of these partitions.  These are ordinal positions within *that specific list*, not general-purpose indices for accessing elements within other, unrelated tensors.  Attempting to use them to index a separate placeholder, even if that placeholder has a compatible shape, will lead to an error because TensorFlow's graph execution treats them as entirely distinct entities. The indices are bound to the output of `tf.split()` and lack the broader scope needed to address other tensors.

Consider the following scenario. Suppose we have two placeholders: one representing a batch of images (`image_placeholder`) and another for corresponding labels (`label_placeholder`).  Splitting the image placeholder does not inherently establish a relationship between the resulting image partitions and the labels. The split image partitions are numbered sequentially (0, 1, 2...), and these indices are only meaningful within the context of the `tf.split()` output list.  It is incorrect to assume these indices can be used to directly access corresponding label subsets from `label_placeholder`.

To illustrate this, let’s explore some code examples.

**Example 1: Incorrect Indexing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

image_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 64, 64, 3])
label_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None])

split_images = tf.split(image_placeholder, num_or_size_splits=4, axis=0)

# INCORRECT: This will raise an error.
try:
  subset_labels = tf.gather(label_placeholder, split_images[0])
  #The error stems from trying to use a tensor from tf.split (split_images[0], which is a Tensor) as an index for tf.gather, which expects an integer tensor.
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}")

sess = tf.Session()
#Further execution would result in error regardless of feed_dict.
sess.close()
```

This example demonstrates the error.  `split_images[0]` is a tensor representing the first partition of the images, *not* an index.  `tf.gather` expects integer indices, not tensors.  Attempting this operation will result in a type error during graph execution.

**Example 2: Correct Concatenation and Parallel Processing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

image_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 64, 64, 3])
label_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None])

split_images = tf.split(image_placeholder, num_or_size_splits=4, axis=0)
split_labels = tf.split(label_placeholder, num_or_size_splits=4, axis=0)


# Correct way to process independently:
processed_images = [tf.reduce_mean(image, axis=[1, 2]) for image in split_images] #Example processing

#Combine results later if needed
combined_result = tf.concat(processed_images, axis=0)

sess = tf.Session()
#Appropriate feeding and execution for independent processing
image_data = [[[1]*64]*64]*3*16
label_data = [1]*16
feed_dict = {image_placeholder: image_data, label_placeholder:label_data}
result = sess.run(combined_result, feed_dict=feed_dict)
sess.close()
```

Here, we correctly split both images and labels.  Subsequent processing happens independently on each partition. Note that  indexing is not used to connect the split tensors.  The split indices are only relevant within their respective lists.  This ensures each part of the data is processed correctly.


**Example 3:  Using tf.slice for controlled indexing**


```python
import tensorflow as tf

image_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[100, 64, 64, 3])
label_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[100])

batch_size = 25

for i in range(4):
    begin = i * batch_size
    end = (i + 1) * batch_size
    image_slice = tf.slice(image_placeholder, [begin, 0, 0, 0], [batch_size, 64, 64, 3])
    label_slice = tf.slice(label_placeholder, [begin], [batch_size])

    # Process image_slice and label_slice together
    # ... your processing logic here ...

sess = tf.Session()
#Feeding and execution happens appropriately
image_data = [[[1]*64]*64]*3*100
label_data = [1]*100
feed_dict = {image_placeholder: image_data, label_placeholder:label_data}
# Execution requires running each slice separately or creating a loop.
sess.close()
```

This example uses `tf.slice` to extract consistent subsets of both placeholders.  We explicitly define the start and end indices for both image and label data, ensuring that related parts of the data are processed together. This avoids the problem of mismatched indices entirely.


In summary, while you can split a placeholder in TensorFlow using `tf.split`,  the resulting indices are local to that specific split operation and cannot be used to index other, independent tensors. To process related data segments from multiple placeholders, methods such as parallel processing with independent index management or explicit slicing using functions like `tf.slice` are necessary to maintain data integrity and avoid indexing errors.

For further reading, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on tensor slicing, splitting, and the intricacies of graph construction and execution.  A deep understanding of TensorFlow's graph operations and data flow is fundamental to avoiding these types of errors in more complex models. Understanding the distinction between tensor indices within a specific operation’s context and global indices across the computational graph is crucial.
