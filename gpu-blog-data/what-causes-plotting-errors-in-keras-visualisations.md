In my experience debugging deep learning models, plotting errors within Keras visualizations often stem from a disconnect between the expected data format and the actual data being fed to the plotting functions, or inconsistencies in the underlying libraries upon which Keras relies. These are frequently not immediately obvious, manifesting as blank plots, garbled images, or outright errors in the console. I've encountered these issues enough to recognize recurring patterns which can usually be traced to a handful of key areas.

Firstly, the dimensionality of the data is paramount. Keras plotting functions, such as those used to display convolutional filters or intermediate layer activations, anticipate specific tensor shapes. For instance, when visualizing convolutional filters, the function typically expects a 4D tensor of shape (filter_height, filter_width, input_channels, output_channels). If your model’s filter weights are, say, flattened into a 2D tensor, or if you incorrectly retrieve only a subset of the filter weights (perhaps by selecting an individual filter rather than all filters), the plotting will fail because the function does not recognize the provided shape. This mismatch leads to errors either within the plotting function itself, or silently produces a malformed output. The problem is compounded by Keras’ dynamic graph creation, which doesn’t always throw an explicit error if the data isn't of the correct shape; it might just silently misinterpret the data, leading to a visually meaningless or blank plot. Similar issues apply to visualizing activation maps where the expected shape typically aligns with the output of a convolutional layer—a 4D tensor of shape (batch_size, height, width, channels). If we inadvertently pass the output from a dense layer, which has only two dimensions (batch_size, units), or even incorrectly reshape our data using tensor manipulation methods, the visualizations will be incorrect, if they appear at all.

Secondly, the data range and type significantly impact visualization accuracy. Keras, alongside matplotlib (or the visualization backend being used), generally expects data values to be within a specific range, often normalized between 0 and 1, or at least representable within the float data type it utilizes. If the data contains extremely large or small values, particularly after some numerical instability issue within your model calculations, they may be compressed into a singular color value, resulting in a uniform and effectively blank plot. Alternatively, negative values, if not correctly handled by the plotting function, can be clipped to zero or cause errors. Moreover, inconsistencies between the data type of the tensors and the expectations of the visualization function can also cause issues; for instance if the tensor is cast as an integer type rather than float, you may not obtain the full dynamic range of colour that would enable a meaningful visualisation. These data type and range errors may not be directly indicated by a traceback, but can instead appear as plots that have been interpreted using the wrong data format. It becomes essential to both ensure that the data range is normalised and that the type is correct, pre-processing the data before inputting to the visualisation code.

Thirdly, problems can arise due to errors in data indexing and selection. When retrieving data for visualization (such as specific activations or kernel weights), it's common to slice or index tensors incorrectly. A common error is accidentally selecting only one image or channel from a multi-dimensional tensor, leading to plotting a single slice rather than the entire tensor. The visualization function might then either error out, or if the slicing results in a tensor of the correct dimensionality it may still produce misleading plots, as its shape has been reduced without the user being aware, resulting in the visualisations misinterpreting what they are plotting. Similar errors arise when plotting time series data, where the expected time dimension is misinterpreted, causing a plot of one time step rather than the full time series. Often, errors here stem from misunderstandings regarding the way tensors are structured, and this typically demands that the user double-check the way they are selecting data for display, and carefully checking against the expected dimensions in the relevant documentation.

Here are three code examples that illustrate these common plotting errors:

**Example 1: Incorrect Tensor Shape for Filter Visualization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Simplified model for demonstration
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten()
])

# Get the weights of the convolutional layer
conv_layer = model.layers[0]
filters = conv_layer.get_weights()[0]  # Shape: (3, 3, 1, 32)

# Incorrectly trying to plot a single filter
# Below will display the data correctly as it is already 4D (3,3,1,32)
single_filter = filters[:, :, :, 0]  # Shape: (3, 3, 1)
plt.imshow(single_filter)
plt.show()
# The correct way to display the filters would be to iterate through all output channels:
num_filters= filters.shape[-1]
for i in range(num_filters):
    single_filter = filters[:, :, :, i]  # Shape: (3, 3, 1)
    plt.imshow(single_filter)
    plt.show()
#The user might attempt to flatten this data, resulting in an error, or incorrect visualisations.
flattened_filter = single_filter.flatten() #Shape: (9,)
#plt.imshow(flattened_filter) #This will cause an error if attempted
```
*Commentary:*  In this example, if the user attempts to visualise the flattened tensor, a plotting error would occur due to the plotting library expecting image data rather than a vector of pixel values. Likewise, the attempt to display a single filter, by selecting an output channel from the 4D tensor, produces a misleading plot, displaying only a single kernel’s weights rather than the full set. The correct solution is to display the full set of filters.

**Example 2: Data Range and Type Issues with Activation Maps**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Simplified model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPool2D(2, 2)
])
input_img = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1) # Shape: (1, 28, 28, 1)
# Extract activations
activation_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=model.layers[0].output)
activations = activation_model.predict(input_img)  # Shape: (1, 26, 26, 16)
# Error 1: Incorrect Range
scaled_activations = activations * 1000  # Large values
plt.imshow(scaled_activations[0, :, :, 0])
plt.show()
# Error 2: Incorrect Data Type
int_activations = activations.astype(int)
plt.imshow(int_activations[0, :, :, 0])
plt.show()
# Correct way to visualize: normalising to [0,1]
min_val = tf.reduce_min(activations).numpy()
max_val = tf.reduce_max(activations).numpy()
norm_activations = (activations - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)
plt.imshow(norm_activations[0, :, :, 0])
plt.show()
```

*Commentary:*  Here, initially the activations are scaled by a large value, making them either saturate, or cause issues with the plotting library. Converting to integer values truncates the dynamic range of data being displayed, showing a flat display. The correct way is to rescale the activations to the range \[0, 1] before display, as is done by a typical image plotting function.

**Example 3: Indexing Errors with Time Series Data**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample Time Series Data (batch_size, timesteps, features)
time_series_data = np.random.rand(1, 100, 5)

# Assume model output was this shape
model_output = tf.convert_to_tensor(time_series_data)
# Incorrectly selecting a specific time step, may cause misinterpretation if user was looking for the time series visual
plt.plot(model_output[0, 0, :])
plt.show()
# Correct approach, loop through features and plot
for i in range(model_output.shape[-1]):
    plt.plot(model_output[0, :, i])
    plt.show()
```

*Commentary:*  In this case, the incorrect approach would only display the data at one specific timestep rather than the entire time series data. By looping through the feature dimension, the correct plots are visualised.

For further learning, I suggest exploring official documentation for Keras, TensorFlow, and matplotlib. These documents outline the expected tensor shapes, data types, and common pitfalls. Moreover, studying examples related to visualizing convolutional neural networks will provide crucial insight into the data handling practices that are expected when visualising results from these types of models. Textbooks on deep learning also offer thorough explanations of layer types and tensor manipulations, which prove invaluable in avoiding the described plotting pitfalls. Lastly, while libraries may change over time, understanding fundamental concepts of data representation and tensor operations will make you a better debugging and visualising machine learning models, regardless of which backend, Keras or otherwise, you are using.
