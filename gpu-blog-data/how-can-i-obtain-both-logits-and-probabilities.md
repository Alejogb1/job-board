Obtaining both logits and probabilities from a custom neural network hinges on understanding the fundamental relationship between these two representations: logits are the raw, unnormalized outputs of the network's final layer, while probabilities are the normalized logits, representing the confidence of the network's prediction for each class.  My experience building and deploying numerous classification models, ranging from simple image recognition tasks to complex sequence modeling for natural language processing, has repeatedly emphasized the critical distinction and the straightforward process for their simultaneous extraction.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The final layer of a classification neural network, typically a dense layer with a number of units equal to the number of classes, produces logits.  These logits are real numbers, potentially spanning a wide range and lacking direct probabilistic interpretation.  To obtain probabilities, a softmax function is applied to these logits. The softmax function transforms the logits into a probability distribution over the classes, ensuring that the probabilities sum to one.  Crucially, while the logits maintain information about the relative confidence of different classes, only the probabilities offer a directly interpretable measure of the predicted class likelihood.

The softmax function operates element-wise, taking a vector of logits, *z*, and transforming it into a probability vector, *p*, according to the following formula:

```
p_i = exp(z_i) / Σ_j exp(z_j)
```

Where *p_i* is the probability of class *i*, *z_i* is the logit for class *i*, and the summation in the denominator is over all classes *j*. This normalization ensures that  0 ≤ *p_i* ≤ 1 for all *i*, and Σ_i *p_i* = 1.  Failure to apply the softmax function results in uninterpretable outputs that do not represent a probability distribution.

Therefore, obtaining both requires two distinct steps:  first, access the output of the final layer (logits), and then apply the softmax function to these outputs to derive the probability distribution.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate this process using three common deep learning frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, and JAX.  Each example assumes a pre-trained model; adapting these snippets to your specific model architecture should be relatively straightforward.


**Example 1: TensorFlow/Keras**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'model' is a compiled Keras model
logits = model(input_data) # Obtain logits from the model
probabilities = tf.nn.softmax(logits) # Apply softmax to obtain probabilities

# Access individual elements
print("Logits:", logits.numpy())
print("Probabilities:", probabilities.numpy())
```

This Keras example leverages TensorFlow's built-in `tf.nn.softmax` function for efficient and numerically stable softmax computation. The `numpy()` method is used to convert TensorFlow tensors to NumPy arrays for easier handling and printing. The `model(input_data)` line assumes you've already defined your input `input_data`.


**Example 2: PyTorch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Assume 'model' is a PyTorch model
logits = model(input_data) # Obtain logits from the model
probabilities = F.softmax(logits, dim=1) # Apply softmax, dim=1 for class probabilities

# Access individual elements
print("Logits:", logits.detach().numpy())
print("Probabilities:", probabilities.detach().numpy())
```

In PyTorch, the `torch.nn.functional` module provides the `softmax` function.  The `dim=1` argument specifies that the softmax operation should be applied across the columns (classes), assuming your logits tensor has shape (batch_size, num_classes).  The `.detach().numpy()` method is crucial for converting PyTorch tensors to NumPy arrays for printing and further processing.  Again, `input_data` should be pre-defined.


**Example 3: JAX**

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import flax.linen as nn

# Assume 'model' is a Flax model, and 'params' contains its parameters
logits = model.apply(params, input_data)  # Obtain logits from the model
probabilities = jax.nn.softmax(logits)   # Apply softmax

# Access individual elements (requires jax.device_put for printing)
print("Logits:", jax.device_put(logits))
print("Probabilities:", jax.device_put(probabilities))
```

JAX requires slightly different handling.  This example assumes the use of Flax, a high-level library for JAX.  The `jax.nn.softmax` function performs the softmax operation on the JAX arrays.  Note that direct printing of JAX arrays might require `jax.device_put` to transfer them to the host.  The specific way to obtain logits depends on the setup of the Flax model and how `model.apply` is implemented.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding of neural networks and probability distributions, I recommend consulting standard machine learning textbooks.  A thorough grasp of linear algebra and calculus is also beneficial.  Finally, the official documentation for TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX provides detailed information on their respective APIs and functionalities.  Exploring tutorials and examples within these documentations is highly recommended for practical application.
