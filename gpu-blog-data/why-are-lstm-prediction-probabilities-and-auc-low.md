Low prediction probabilities and Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks often indicate a fundamental mismatch between the model’s learned representations and the underlying structure of the data. I’ve encountered this numerous times in various time-series forecasting and sequence classification projects, and the reasons, while nuanced, generally fall into specific categories related to data quality, model architecture, and training dynamics. Specifically, an LSTM may learn to predict values close to the mean or mode of the training data because it fails to capture long-range dependencies effectively. The consequence of this is a set of predictions that lack confidence, hence low probabilities, and poor discrimination, leading to a lower AUC score.

The primary cause of low prediction probabilities, which are often observed as values clustered around 0.5 for binary classification or near the mean in regression tasks, stems from a model that is effectively outputting uncertainty. An LSTM’s internal state, designed to remember long-term patterns, might not be capturing the relevant temporal dependencies. When this occurs, the model’s output becomes a smoothed average of observed data, rather than a high-probability assignment to a specific class or precise prediction of a continuous value. This smoothing behavior translates to low probabilities because the model lacks a strong signal to confidently push its predictions closer to either extreme (0 or 1 for classification). In turn, AUC is a measure of a classifier’s ability to rank positive samples higher than negative samples. The model struggles with this when its output probabilities are indistinguishable between classes, resulting in a poor ability to rank samples correctly, reflected by a low AUC.

There are a variety of interrelated factors that can induce this behavior: insufficient data, particularly if the time series or sequences have high variability; inappropriate pre-processing methods; inadequate network architecture; and flawed training routines. Let's explore some of these further with specific code examples.

First, consider data pre-processing. If the input time-series data has not been appropriately scaled or normalized, the LSTM might struggle to converge. I've observed LSTMs behaving poorly if fed raw time-series data that had dramatically different scales across the features. Here is an example of why feature scaling can have a dramatic impact:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Generate some random data, with varying scales
np.random.seed(42)
data_raw_feature_1 = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 1000
data_raw_feature_2 = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 0.001
target = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Combine into single feature array
data_raw = np.hstack((data_raw_feature_1,data_raw_feature_2))

# Reshape for LSTM input (samples, time steps, features)
data_raw = data_raw.reshape(100, 1, 2)


# Without scaling
model_unscaled = Sequential([
    LSTM(32, input_shape=(1, 2)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model_unscaled.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['AUC'])
model_unscaled.fit(data_raw, target, epochs=10, verbose=0)
_, auc_unscaled = model_unscaled.evaluate(data_raw, target, verbose=0)

# With scaling
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(data_raw.reshape(100, 2)).reshape(100, 1, 2)


model_scaled = Sequential([
    LSTM(32, input_shape=(1, 2)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model_scaled.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['AUC'])
model_scaled.fit(data_scaled, target, epochs=10, verbose=0)
_, auc_scaled = model_scaled.evaluate(data_scaled, target, verbose=0)


print(f"AUC without scaling: {auc_unscaled:.4f}")
print(f"AUC with scaling: {auc_scaled:.4f}")
```

In this example, raw data has features with highly different ranges, which results in a much lower AUC. When the data is scaled with MinMaxScaler, the model converges significantly faster and gives better AUC. This highlights how features on different scales can prevent gradients from moving in meaningful directions, hampering the model's capacity to capture significant patterns.

Second, the architecture itself can be limiting. A single LSTM layer might not be deep enough to capture complex patterns, especially with long time dependencies. Stacking multiple LSTM layers can help in these cases. This is very often the cause of low probabilities, as the model struggles to find more abstract and meaningful representations of the input sequences. Here is an example:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Generate random sequence data
np.random.seed(42)
num_sequences = 100
sequence_length = 20
num_features = 1
data = np.random.rand(num_sequences, sequence_length, num_features)
target = np.random.randint(0, 2, num_sequences)

# Single LSTM layer
model_single = Sequential([
    LSTM(32, input_shape=(sequence_length, num_features)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_single.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['AUC'])
model_single.fit(data, target, epochs=10, verbose=0)
_, auc_single = model_single.evaluate(data, target, verbose=0)

# Stacked LSTM layers
model_stacked = Sequential([
    LSTM(32, input_shape=(sequence_length, num_features), return_sequences=True),
    LSTM(32),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_stacked.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['AUC'])
model_stacked.fit(data, target, epochs=10, verbose=0)
_, auc_stacked = model_stacked.evaluate(data, target, verbose=0)

print(f"AUC with single LSTM: {auc_single:.4f}")
print(f"AUC with stacked LSTM: {auc_stacked:.4f}")
```

In this case, the model using a single layer has lower performance than the model using stacked LSTM layers. It may seem intuitive that more layers means more parameters to optimize, but often with sequence data, the first layer may extract lower-level patterns and the second or third layer may extract higher-level patterns resulting in significantly better performance and better AUC scores.

Thirdly, the optimization process itself can contribute to the issue. If the learning rate is too high, the model may oscillate and never converge to an optimal solution; if it's too low, the model may take an extremely long time to train. Also, if the training data is imbalanced, the model may be biased towards the majority class. I often use techniques like class weighting or oversampling techniques when imbalanced data is an issue. Here is an example of the impact of an inappropriate learning rate on training:

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Generate random sequence data
np.random.seed(42)
num_sequences = 100
sequence_length = 10
num_features = 1
data = np.random.rand(num_sequences, sequence_length, num_features)
target = np.random.randint(0, 2, num_sequences)

# Model with high learning rate
model_high_lr = Sequential([
    LSTM(32, input_shape=(sequence_length, num_features)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
optimizer_high_lr = Adam(learning_rate=0.1)
model_high_lr.compile(optimizer=optimizer_high_lr, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['AUC'])
model_high_lr.fit(data, target, epochs=10, verbose=0)
_, auc_high_lr = model_high_lr.evaluate(data, target, verbose=0)

# Model with appropriate learning rate
model_low_lr = Sequential([
    LSTM(32, input_shape=(sequence_length, num_features)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
optimizer_low_lr = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
model_low_lr.compile(optimizer=optimizer_low_lr, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['AUC'])
model_low_lr.fit(data, target, epochs=10, verbose=0)
_, auc_low_lr = model_low_lr.evaluate(data, target, verbose=0)

print(f"AUC with high learning rate: {auc_high_lr:.4f}")
print(f"AUC with appropriate learning rate: {auc_low_lr:.4f}")
```

As shown above, using an inappropriately high learning rate results in poor model convergence and low AUC. In practice, finding the appropriate learning rate may require the use of a learning rate scheduler or hyperparameter optimization techniques.

To recap, low prediction probabilities and low AUC from LSTM models can often be attributed to data-related issues, a poorly designed architecture, or inadequate optimization during training. Experimentation is key to identifying the root cause. Further resources that I would recommend for improving understanding include those offered in the online documentation for TensorFlow and Keras, which often have practical examples. Additionally, academic papers focusing on recurrent neural network architectures and their training dynamics would be beneficial. Standard textbooks on deep learning that cover time series analysis are also excellent resources.
