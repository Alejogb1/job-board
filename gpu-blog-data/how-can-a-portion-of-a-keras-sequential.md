The ability to extract intermediate outputs from a Keras Sequential model is a crucial technique, often employed in complex architectures or feature reuse scenarios. Specifically, instead of relying solely on the final prediction layer, one might want the activations from a specific layer deeper within the network. This allows for building upon an existing representation learned by the model, or directly observing the learned features. This isn't a standard prediction task, so the model isn't used in its entirety.

My primary experience with this originated from a project involving transfer learning for image classification. We trained a large convolutional neural network (CNN) on a massive dataset and wished to leverage its feature extraction capabilities without retraining the whole model. This meant discarding the classification layers at the end and treating the intermediate convolutional layers as a feature extractor which we would then feed into a new, smaller classifier. The challenge then, was to get the activations of an intermediate layer.

The fundamental approach revolves around creating a new Keras Model object that encapsulates a subset of the original Sequential model. Instead of inputting data directly to the sequential model, one feeds data to a truncated version, stopping at the desired intermediate layer. The output of this truncated model will then represent the activations of that chosen layer. This new model shares the weights of the original but is structurally different, acting as a function that outputs the desired intermediate representation.

Consider this common situation: we have a model trained on some dataset:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
  layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
  layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  layers.Flatten(),
  layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Assume the model is trained on some data
# ...
```

To extract features from the second convolutional layer (the one with 64 filters), we don't modify the original 'model'. Instead, we define a new model that takes the original model's input and outputs the activation of this specific convolutional layer. This can be accomplished using the Keras Functional API, which is more flexible when handling the extraction of intermediate layers from Keras models.

```python
intermediate_layer_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=model.layers[3].output)

# Suppose we have some input data 'input_data' with shape (batch_size, 28, 28, 1)
# Use the intermediate model to get the output activations
intermediate_output = intermediate_layer_model.predict(input_data)

# The variable intermediate_output will have the shape (batch_size, 12, 12, 64), representing the activations
# for the second conv layer
```

Here, `model.input` specifies the input layer of the original sequential model and `model.layers[3].output` is the output of the fourth layer (indexed from zero) which corresponds to our 64-filter convolutional layer, after pooling. Thus, the intermediate model maps data through the original network until that point and provides the activations of that layer as output.

Alternatively, if the original model had named layers, we can use these names instead of indices for clarity and avoiding potential errors if the model's structure changes. Suppose that we had constructed a model with layer naming:

```python
named_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1), name='input_layer'),
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', name='conv_1'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name='pool_1'),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', name='conv_2'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name='pool_2'),
    layers.Flatten(name='flatten'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='output_layer')
])
```

Then the extraction of the second convolutional layer's output becomes:

```python
intermediate_layer_model_named = tf.keras.Model(inputs=named_model.input, outputs=named_model.get_layer('conv_2').output)
intermediate_output_named = intermediate_layer_model_named.predict(input_data)

# 'intermediate_output_named' now contains the activation maps after the second conv layer with shape (batch_size, 12, 12, 64)
```

This approach provides a more robust and readable solution, especially in models with a large number of layers, and is more resilient to architectural modifications. If layers are renamed, accessing them through their string identifier avoids index tracking.

A final illustration involves extracting activations from a layer that follows a batch normalization operation. In situations where a batch normalization layer immediately follows another layer, the output of the preceding layer is no longer directly accessible through the same method because that output is transformed by the batch normalization layer. Consider the following modification:

```python
model_batchnorm = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.BatchNormalization(), # New batch norm
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

To get activations of the first convolutional layer *before* batch normalization, we again define a model:

```python
intermediate_layer_model_pre_batchnorm = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model_batchnorm.input, outputs=model_batchnorm.layers[1].output)
intermediate_output_pre_batchnorm = intermediate_layer_model_pre_batchnorm.predict(input_data)
# intermediate_output_pre_batchnorm now contains the output of the first conv layer before the BatchNormalization
# this will have the shape (batch_size, 26, 26, 32).
```

Here, accessing `model_batchnorm.layers[1].output` is crucial, since it represents the output of the convolutional layer. Directly indexing `model_batchnorm.layers[2].input` would be incorrect because it's the input *to* the batch normalization layer not *from* the convolutional layer. This distinction becomes especially important in more complex models where the data path might be less straightforward.

In all cases, the extracted activations are then available to be used as features for other machine learning tasks, or can be further analyzed for model interpretability purposes.

In regards to further learning resources, I highly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections pertaining to Keras Models and the Functional API. Additionally, exploring research papers focusing on transfer learning would provide context for why one might need this capability. Finally, online courses dealing with practical deep learning in TensorFlow can reinforce these concepts with hands-on examples.
