The discrepancy between correctly printed PyTorch model gradients and their seemingly incorrect values when copied stems from a misunderstanding of how PyTorch handles computational graphs and tensor memory management, specifically concerning the distinction between in-place operations and tensor copying.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects involving large-scale neural networks has highlighted this critical point.  The printed gradients are typically correct *within the computational graph's context*, but attempts to access them outside this context, via direct copying, often yield unexpected results. This is due to several factors, including asynchronous computations, automatic differentiation's reliance on retained computational history, and the subtleties of tensor cloning.

**1. Clear Explanation**

PyTorch's autograd system builds a dynamic computational graph as computations are performed. Gradients are calculated through backpropagation, a process that traces the graph backward from the loss function to the model parameters.  The printed gradients represent the calculated values within this active graph. However, this graph is not a static structure; it's constantly being updated and potentially even deallocated.  When you copy a gradient, you're not copying a snapshot of a stable value; you're essentially copying a reference or a view into a part of the computational graph that may be modified or even deleted subsequently.

Consider a scenario where gradient calculations are performed asynchronously (common in multi-GPU training).  By the time your copy operation completes, the gradient tensor might have been updated by another process or even released from memory, resulting in stale or erroneous values in the copy. This often manifests as zero values or values different from those printed during the immediate aftermath of the backward pass.

Furthermore, PyTorch utilizes in-place operations extensively for efficiency.  Functions like `x.add_(y)` modify the tensor `x` directly, rather than creating a new tensor.  If you copy a gradient after an in-place operation, the copy might not reflect the changes made in-place unless it's a deep copy (creating entirely new memory).  A shallow copy, which is the default behavior for many tensor copying methods, merely creates a new reference pointing to the same underlying data. Any modification to the original will therefore be reflected in the copy.

Finally, the computational graph itself is garbage-collected. After a backward pass, the graph is no longer needed for the next iteration; PyTorch reclaims the memory.  If your copy operation occurs after this garbage collection, the copied tensor will point to deallocated memory, leading to undefined behavior or errors.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Illustrating In-Place Modification and Shallow Copy Issues**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 3
z = y.sum()
z.backward()

print("Gradient of x:", x.grad) # Correct gradient printed within the graph

x_copy = x.grad #Shallow copy, only reference to data in graph

x.grad.zero_()  #In-place modification

print("Gradient of x after zeroing:", x.grad) #Changed in place
print("Copied Gradient:", x_copy)          # Still retains the original value


```

This example showcases how an in-place operation (`x.grad.zero_()`) alters the original gradient, reflecting in the printed value but leaving the shallow copy unchanged as the original underlying memory was not duplicated.

**Example 2: Demonstrating Asynchronous Computations and Race Conditions**

```python
import torch
import threading

x = torch.tensor([2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 3

def backward_pass():
    y.sum().backward()

thread = threading.Thread(target=backward_pass)
thread.start()

# Simulate some delay before copying the gradient
# This delay could represent additional computations in a more realistic scenario.
import time
time.sleep(0.1)

x_copy = x.grad.clone() #Clone ensures a deep copy, avoiding the memory problems
thread.join()

print("Gradient of x:", x.grad)
print("Copied Gradient:", x_copy)
```

In this example, we use threading to simulate asynchronous gradient computation.  The `clone()` method creates a deep copy, safeguarding against data races; without it, the copy might reflect an inconsistent or partial gradient calculation. The delay increases the probability of observing inconsistent data between the printed and copied gradients.

**Example 3:  Demonstrating the Importance of `detach()`**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 3
z = y.sum()
z.backward()

print("Gradient of x:", x.grad)

x_detached = x.grad.detach().clone() # detach from the computational graph and deep copy

x.grad.zero_()

print("Gradient of x after zeroing:", x.grad)
print("Detached Gradient:", x_detached)
```

This example employs `detach()` to explicitly separate a copy of the gradient from the computational graph *before* making a deep copy via `clone()`.  This ensures the copied gradient is independent of any subsequent modifications to the original gradient tensor within the computational graph. The `clone()` is crucial to create a new, independent tensor in memory.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of PyTorch's automatic differentiation, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation, particularly sections on autograd and tensor manipulation.  Furthermore, explore advanced tutorials focusing on multi-GPU training and efficient tensor operations.  Familiarizing yourself with the intricacies of Python's memory management and garbage collection will also prove beneficial.  Finally, studying papers on advanced optimization techniques employed in deep learning will provide valuable context regarding gradient calculation and handling.
