The root cause of timing inconsistencies observed in OpenCL's `clEnqueueNDRangeKernel` frequently stems from unpredictable variations in kernel execution time across work-items, coupled with the inherent complexities of managing heterogeneous computing resources.  My experience optimizing computationally intensive simulations for seismic imaging consistently highlighted this issue.  While the specification promises parallel execution, achieving perfectly consistent timing across multiple invocations proves challenging, especially for complex kernels.  This variability isn't solely a bug; it's a consequence of the underlying hardware and software interactions.

**1. Explanation of Timing Inconsistencies**

The `clEnqueueNDRangeKernel` function initiates the execution of a kernel across a specified range of work-items.  However, the actual execution time is not guaranteed to be constant across multiple calls.  Several factors contribute to this:

* **Work-item Dependencies:**  If work-items within a single kernel invocation exhibit dependencies (e.g., one work-item's output is the input for another), the execution time becomes dependent on the order of execution, which is not strictly defined by the OpenCL specification.  This leads to unpredictable timing, as the order might change based on hardware load and scheduling decisions.

* **Data Transfer Overhead:**  The time required to transfer data between the host and the device (GPU or other accelerator) can significantly influence the overall execution time.  This overhead is unpredictable due to memory bandwidth limitations, cache coherency, and competing processes.  Furthermore, the location of data in device memory (global, local, constant) dramatically impacts access times.  Efficient memory management is crucial, yet rarely results in perfectly consistent execution times.

* **Hardware Resource Contention:**  Multiple kernels, or even other processes running concurrently on the same device, can contend for resources like processing cores, memory bandwidth, and caches. This contention introduces unpredictable delays, causing variations in kernel execution time.  The scheduler's decisions regarding resource allocation further contribute to timing inconsistencies.

* **Kernel Complexity and Branch Divergence:**  A complex kernel with extensive branching (conditional statements) can introduce significant performance variations due to branch divergence.  If different work-items take different execution paths, the overall execution time will not be uniform.  This becomes particularly problematic for large work-groups where divergent execution paths impact many work-items concurrently.

* **Compiler Optimizations:** The OpenCL compiler's optimization strategies can influence the final kernel code and consequently, the execution time.  Different compiler versions or optimization levels can yield different performance characteristics, contributing to timing variations across different builds or execution environments.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

These examples illustrate potential sources of timing inconsistency and demonstrate methods to measure and potentially mitigate them.  Note that perfect consistency is unlikely; these examples focus on identifying and minimizing variations.


**Example 1: Work-item Dependencies**

```c++
__kernel void dependentKernel(__global float* input, __global float* output, int size) {
  int i = get_global_id(0);
  if (i > 0) {
    output[i] = input[i] + output[i-1]; // Dependency on previous work-item
  } else {
    output[i] = input[i];
  }
}
```

This kernel showcases a clear dependency.  The execution time of `output[i] = input[i] + output[i-1];` directly depends on the completion of the previous work-item.  Timing inconsistencies will be substantial here, even with a relatively small `size`.  Optimizing this requires restructuring the algorithm to minimize or eliminate the dependencies.


**Example 2:  Data Transfer Overhead**

```c++
__kernel void dataTransferKernel(__global float* input, __global float* output, int size) {
  int i = get_global_id(0);
  if (i < size) {
    output[i] = input[i] * 2.0f;
  }
}

// Host-side code (simplified)
clEnqueueReadBuffer(...); // Read from host memory to device memory
clEnqueueNDRangeKernel(...);
clEnqueueWriteBuffer(...); // Write from device memory to host memory
```

The time taken by `clEnqueueReadBuffer` and `clEnqueueWriteBuffer` introduces variability depending on the available memory bandwidth and system load.  Minimizing data transfers, potentially using pinned memory or asynchronous data transfers, can improve consistency.


**Example 3:  Addressing Branch Divergence**

```c++
__kernel void branchDivergenceKernel(__global float* input, __global float* output, int size) {
  int i = get_global_id(0);
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    output[i] = input[i] * 2.0f; // One branch
  } else {
    output[i] = input[i] + 1.0f; // Another branch
  }
}
```

This example highlights branch divergence.  Half the work-items follow one path, while the other half follows a different path.  This can lead to inconsistent execution times as the scheduler manages different execution paths within work-groups.  Strategies to reduce branch divergence include algorithm restructuring or using techniques like predicated execution.

For all examples, measuring execution time requires careful consideration.  Using OpenCL's profiling capabilities (e.g., `clGetEventProfilingInfo`) allows for granular timing measurements at various stages.  Subtracting the data transfer times from the overall kernel execution time offers a clearer picture of the kernel's actual execution consistency.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a more comprehensive understanding, I recommend consulting the official OpenCL specification, focusing on chapters related to kernel execution, event management, and profiling.  A deep dive into the OpenCL programming guide, especially sections detailing memory management and optimization techniques, is crucial.  Finally, exploring advanced topics in parallel computing and GPU architectures will greatly enhance your ability to identify and address the root causes of timing inconsistencies in your OpenCL applications.  Understanding the nuances of the specific hardware architecture you are targeting is essential for effective optimization.
