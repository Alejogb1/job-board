PyTorch's `state_dict` typically stores model parameters as key-value pairs, where the keys are the parameter names derived from the module structure. However, there are specific scenarios, particularly when dealing with custom modules or low-level manipulations, where one might want to store parameters without explicit names. This isn't a standard practice, and working with such a state dictionary requires understanding the underlying PyTorch mechanism and accepting some trade-offs in terms of model loading and manipulation.

The primary challenge is that PyTorch relies on the module tree's structure to generate the keys for the parameters when extracting or loading the `state_dict`. Thus, parameters created independently of the standard module structure will not automatically acquire named keys in the `state_dict`. This typically arises when directly manipulating `torch.nn.Parameter` instances or creating tensors and attaching them to modules without registering them via standard methods like `nn.Linear`, `nn.Conv2d` etc. Consequently, bypassing PyTorch's parameter management system requires manual intervention when building and accessing the `state_dict`. My experience building custom optimization routines and experimenting with novel layer architectures exposed me to this limitation. I found it essential to manipulate parameters directly at times for efficient memory use and customized updates, and this necessarily led to dealing with nameless parameters.

The core technique revolves around two primary steps: first, create and store your parameters outside of standard module registration within a module (or outside a module if you're using it for non-model objects), and second, manually populate the `state_dict` with these parameters using user-defined keys. While bypassing the name generation system can be useful in niche situations it makes the model very brittle and increases the risk of mistakes in the future. Here's how it’s implemented.

**First, Consider Parameters inside a Module:**

In this example, we create a custom module that maintains a parameter tensor without registration to the module.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, param_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.custom_param = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(param_size))
        self.linear = nn.Linear(param_size, 10) # A standard parameter to compare

    def forward(self, x):
        output = torch.matmul(x, self.custom_param)
        output = self.linear(output) # Using the linear registered parameter
        return output

    def named_params(self): # This function will show the named parameter generated by the nn.Linear module
        return [param_name for param_name, _ in self.named_parameters()]

    def manually_add_to_state_dict(self, state_dict, key_prefix="unnamed_param"):
        state_dict[key_prefix] = self.custom_param
        return state_dict

# Example Usage
param_size = 5
model = CustomModule(param_size)

print(f"Named parameters from the module: {model.named_params()}")

state_dict = {}
state_dict = model.manually_add_to_state_dict(state_dict)

# The following will print keys with standard named params and the manually added parameter
print(f"Keys from state_dict: {list(state_dict.keys())}")
print(f"State_dict values:{[x.shape for x in state_dict.values()]} ")

```

In this snippet, `CustomModule` holds a `custom_param` created using `torch.nn.Parameter`. This parameter is not automatically included in the module’s `state_dict` because it's not registered through standard module methods. The `named_params` method show the names of the registered parameters in the module. The `manually_add_to_state_dict` function provides the manual mechanism to add this nameless parameter to a user-defined state_dict. When we retrieve the state dict by calling the `manually_add_to_state_dict` we see that it only contains our manually added parameter, and the parameter defined using the `nn.Linear` module is not automatically stored in the state_dict unless it is done manually or by calling the `model.state_dict` directly. This illustrates that to have complete control of the state dict, we must build and manage its storage and retrieval mechanism. This approach can be helpful when a more direct manipulation of parameters and low-level access is required.

**Second, Consider Parameters Outside a Module:**

Here, we showcase parameter creation outside any `nn.Module` and demonstrate how to store them in a manually built `state_dict`.

```python
import torch

# Creating standalone parameters
param1 = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(10, 10))
param2 = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(5))

# Manually construct the state_dict
state_dict = {
    "param1": param1,
    "param2": param2
}

# Verification
print(f"Keys from state_dict: {list(state_dict.keys())}")
print(f"State_dict values:{[x.shape for x in state_dict.values()]} ")

```

In this case, both parameters are created using `torch.nn.Parameter` without being bound to any module. This makes them 'nameless' in the sense that they lack association with a module's parameter naming scheme. By manually creating the `state_dict` and assigning user-defined keys, we can include these parameters. When we retrieve the state_dict we see the keys and the shapes of the parameters we have saved which proves that the method of manually creating the state_dict works outside modules as well.

**Third, Considerations for Loading Parameters:**

Loading such `state_dict` requires careful coordination because the standard `load_state_dict` will expect parameters to be tied to registered module attributes, and will only handle the parameters registered through the module. We must perform this operation manually, which is prone to errors. Let's demonstrate:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, param_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.custom_param = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(param_size))
        self.linear = nn.Linear(param_size, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        output = torch.matmul(x, self.custom_param)
        output = self.linear(output)
        return output

    def manually_load_from_state_dict(self, state_dict, key_prefix="unnamed_param"):
        self.custom_param.data = state_dict[key_prefix].data # Loading the custom parameter data from the state_dict
        return self

param_size = 5
model = CustomModule(param_size)

# Save the state dict with the manual mechanism
state_dict_save = {}
state_dict_save = model.manually_add_to_state_dict(state_dict_save)

# Load the state dict with the manual mechanism
model = model.manually_load_from_state_dict(state_dict_save)

print(f"Loaded custom param: {model.custom_param}") # Printing the tensor value, should be random initialized from the saved state_dict
```

Here, the `manually_load_from_state_dict` method directly loads the tensor data from the loaded state_dict to the previously uninitialized random tensor. The `state_dict` we created is used to replace data inside the model. This highlights the manual nature of both saving and loading such parameters. The key element is the direct access and assignment of the tensor values using `.data`. Note that this operation does not track gradients. While this is useful for controlled weight setting, it should be avoided during training. We can verify the state of the loaded parameter to see that the operation was succesful.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of PyTorch internals, I suggest examining the source code, specifically: the modules within the `torch.nn` package for parameter registration methods, and the `torch.serialization` modules for how `state_dict` are processed internally. The official PyTorch documentation is also extremely valuable for grasping the general concepts, especially the sections on parameter management and custom module creation. Also, delving into publications and discussions on model quantization and low-level optimization can provide more insights into cases where nameless parameter storage is useful.
