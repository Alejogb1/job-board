The discrepancy in Deep SARSA performance between PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations, both using Adam optimization, often stems from subtle differences in automatic differentiation mechanisms and the handling of gradients during the update step, particularly concerning the target network updates.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous reinforcement learning projects has revealed that seemingly minor inconsistencies in the implementation details can drastically alter the convergence behavior of SARSA, especially in the deep learning context.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Deep SARSA, unlike Q-learning, utilizes the same policy for both action selection and target value calculation. This requires careful management of the temporal difference (TD) error. The core update rule involves bootstrapping from the next state-action pair sampled from the same policy.  The algorithm's stability hinges on accurately calculating and propagating the gradients through this process.  PyTorch and TensorFlow, while both employing automatic differentiation, have different underlying graph representations and gradient accumulation strategies.  TensorFlow's eager execution mode, while offering a more Pythonic feel, can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior compared to PyTorch's more explicit graph construction.  Furthermore, differences in how these frameworks handle operations involving detached tensors or preventing gradient flow through specific parts of the network can impact the stability of the target network updates. Incorrectly detaching the target network's output, for instance, can prevent the necessary gradient flow, leading to non-convergence or erratic behavior. In contrast, PyTorch's strong emphasis on explicit tensor operations often provides clearer control and helps avoid these pitfalls, resulting in a more robust training process.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: PyTorch Implementation (Functional)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... Define the environment and agent (omitted for brevity) ...

class DeepSARSA(nn.Module):
    # ... network architecture ...

model = DeepSARSA()
target_model = DeepSARSA() # Target network
target_model.load_state_dict(model.state_dict()) # Initialize target network

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    action = select_action(state, model) # Epsilon-greedy policy

    while True:
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        next_action = select_action(next_state, model)

        with torch.no_grad():
            target_q = target_model(torch.tensor(next_state, dtype=torch.float32))[next_action] # Target value from target network

        q_value = model(torch.tensor(state, dtype=torch.float32))[action] # Q-value from main network

        td_error = reward + gamma * target_q - q_value # Temporal difference error

        loss = criterion(q_value, q_value + td_error)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        state = next_state
        action = next_action

        # Target network update (e.g., soft update)
        for target_param, param in zip(target_model.parameters(), model.parameters()):
            target_param.data.copy_(tau * param.data + (1.0 - tau) * target_param.data)

        if done:
            break
```

**Commentary:** This PyTorch implementation leverages the `nn.Module` and `optim.Adam` classes for efficient model definition and optimization.  The explicit `torch.no_grad()` context manager prevents gradient calculations for the target network's output, ensuring the target network's parameters are only updated through the soft update mechanism. The use of `torch.tensor` explicitly defines the data type, crucial for ensuring consistency.  The soft update prevents drastic changes in the target network, contributing to stability.


**Example 2: TensorFlow/Keras Implementation (Sequential)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# ... Define the environment and agent ...

model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... layers ...
])

target_model = keras.models.clone_model(model) # Target network

optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate)

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    action = select_action(state, model)

    while True:
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        next_action = select_action(next_state, model)

        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            q_value = model(tf.convert_to_tensor([state], dtype=tf.float32))[0][action]
            with tf.stop_gradient(): # Prevents gradient flow through target network
                target_q = target_model(tf.convert_to_tensor([next_state], dtype=tf.float32))[0][next_action]
            td_error = reward + gamma * target_q - q_value
            loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(td_error)) # MSE loss

        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

        state = next_state
        action = next_action

        # Target network update (e.g., periodic update)
        if episode % target_update_freq == 0:
            target_model.set_weights(model.get_weights())

        if done:
            break
```

**Commentary:** This Keras example demonstrates a sequential model.  The `tf.GradientTape()` context manager is used for automatic differentiation.  `tf.stop_gradient()` prevents gradient updates for the target network output.  The target network is updated periodically instead of using a soft update, which can sometimes lead to instability in deep SARSA if not tuned meticulously.  Note the explicit conversion to TensorFlow tensors using `tf.convert_to_tensor`.


**Example 3: TensorFlow/Keras Implementation (Functional, addressing potential issues)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# ... Define environment and agent (omitted for brevity) ...

def create_model(state_size, action_size):
    # ... more robust functional model definition for better control
    model = tf.keras.Model(...)
    return model

model = create_model(state_size, action_size)
target_model = create_model(state_size, action_size)
target_model.set_weights(model.get_weights())

optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

# ... training loop similar to Example 2 but with more carefully managed target updates and error handling ...

```

**Commentary:**  This example introduces a functional approach in TensorFlow/Keras for finer-grained control over the network architecture and allows easier handling of potential issues related to the gradient flow and target network updates.  A more robust architecture and improved target update strategy often enhance stability.  Careful consideration of the hyperparameters remains crucial for success.

In conclusion, the apparent disparity in Deep SARSA performance between PyTorch and TensorFlow implementations using Adam is not inherently due to one framework's superiority but often reflects differences in automatic differentiation, gradient handling, and the nuances of target network updates.  Careful attention to these details, as demonstrated in the provided code examples, is essential for achieving stable and effective training.  The choice of soft versus hard target network updates, hyperparameter tuning, and model architecture also play a significant role in mitigating convergence issues.  Rigorous testing and careful consideration of these aspects are vital for successful implementation regardless of the chosen deep learning framework.
