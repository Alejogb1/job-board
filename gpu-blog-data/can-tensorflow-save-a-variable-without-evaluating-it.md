TensorFlow's ability to save a variable without evaluating it hinges on the distinction between a TensorFlow `Variable` object and its value.  The `Variable` itself holds metadata and operational information, distinct from the actual numerical tensor representing its current value.  This separation allows for saving the variable's definition and state – including its shape, data type, and potentially its initial value – without necessarily computing its value at the point of saving.  My experience working on large-scale model deployment for a financial institution heavily relied on this nuanced behavior to streamline checkpointing and restore procedures.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow employs a computational graph structure.  Variables are nodes within this graph.  The act of "evaluating" a variable refers to the execution of the operations that determine its numerical value.  This evaluation typically occurs during a TensorFlow session's `run()` or `eval()` method.  However, the `tf.saved_model` library, and earlier checkpointing mechanisms, can serialize the variable's definition without forcing computation. This means the saved model retains enough information to reconstruct the variable's structure and initial state, but its final value upon restoration depends on subsequent execution within a session.  It is crucial to understand that while the variable's *value* might not be explicitly calculated at save time, the process may involve operations that indirectly compute intermediate values needed to define the variable's state;  for instance, if the variable's initialization involves another operation.  It’s not strictly a "no computation" scenario, but rather a deferred computation.

The key is that the variable's *definition*, not its *evaluated value*, is what gets stored. This definition includes the variable's name, type, shape, and possibly its initializer. The initializer might be a constant, a random number generator, or the result of another computation, but its evaluation can be deferred until the variable is loaded and used in a session.  This approach allows for significant computational efficiency, especially with large models and complex initializations.  In my experience, saving model checkpoints without evaluating every variable at each checkpoint substantially reduced the training time.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Saving a variable with a constant initializer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a variable with a constant initializer
v = tf.Variable(tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]), name='my_variable')

# Save the model (this does not evaluate v)
save_path = './my_model'
tf.saved_model.save(v, save_path)

# Later, restore and evaluate
restored_v = tf.saved_model.load(save_path)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    print(sess.run(restored_v.my_variable)) # Evaluates the variable here
```
In this example, `tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])` is the initializer.  While the constant is defined, its value isn't explicitly used until the restoration and subsequent evaluation in the session. The saving process itself doesn't trigger this evaluation.

**Example 2: Saving a variable with a more complex initializer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a variable with a complex initializer
initializer = tf.random.normal([2, 3], mean=0, stddev=1)
v = tf.Variable(initializer, name='complex_variable')

# Save the model
save_path = './complex_model'
tf.saved_model.save(v, save_path)


# Later, restore and evaluate
restored_v = tf.saved_model.load(save_path)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    print(sess.run(restored_v.complex_variable)) # Evaluation happens during session run.
```

Here, the initializer involves a random number generation. This generation happens when the variable is used (during restoration and execution), not at the `tf.saved_model.save` step. The saved model only stores the definition that instructs TensorFlow to generate random numbers according to the specified parameters when needed.  This is crucial for reproducibility, as the random seed is implicitly part of the variable's definition.


**Example 3:  Saving a variable that depends on other operations:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.Variable([1.0, 2.0], name='a')
b = tf.Variable([3.0, 4.0], name='b')
v = tf.Variable(tf.add(a, b), name='dependent_variable') # v depends on a and b

# Save the model
save_path = './dependent_model'
tf.saved_model.save([a,b,v], save_path)

#Later, restore and evaluate
restored_vars = tf.saved_model.load(save_path)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    print(sess.run(restored_vars.dependent_variable)) #Evaluation happens when running restored_vars.dependent_variable
```

This example shows a variable (`v`) whose value depends on other variables (`a` and `b`).  Saving the model stores the dependency graph.   When restored, TensorFlow will execute the addition operation (`tf.add(a,b)`) to determine the value of `v` only when it's accessed during the session's run.  Again, saving the model does not directly trigger the computation.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on saving and restoring models.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning that covers TensorFlow's internals.  Advanced TensorFlow tutorials that focus on model deployment and checkpointing strategies.  Peer-reviewed publications on efficient model saving techniques in large-scale machine learning.


In conclusion, TensorFlow adeptly handles the saving of variables without necessitating immediate evaluation.  The key is the distinction between the variable's definition and its evaluated numerical tensor.  This capability is crucial for managing computational resources, particularly in large-scale model training and deployment where efficient checkpointing significantly reduces overhead.  My experience underscores the importance of understanding this separation for building robust and scalable machine learning systems.
