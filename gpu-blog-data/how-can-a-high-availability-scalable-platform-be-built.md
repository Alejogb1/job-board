Building a highly available and scalable platform for Java and C++ applications on Solaris requires a layered approach encompassing infrastructure, application design, and operational procedures. The core challenge resides in distributing workloads effectively across multiple machines while maintaining resilience against individual component failures. My experience implementing similar systems for a financial trading platform exposed me to the complexities inherent in this environment.

Firstly, a robust foundation relies on the proper selection and configuration of operating system and hardware. Solaris, while mature and known for its stability, benefits from careful resource management. Zones, Solaris’s containerization technology, offer a way to isolate applications, ensuring that resource contention within a single host doesn't impact other services. I’ve found that using non-global zones for individual application instances reduces the blast radius of potential failures and simplifies resource allocation. Each zone can be assigned specific CPU shares, memory limits, and I/O bandwidth, creating a controlled environment. Furthermore, zones enable granular rolling updates, allowing for new deployments with minimal downtime.

Scaling at the infrastructure level involves horizontally distributing instances of the application. I've previously employed load balancers in front of multiple application servers. These load balancers, such as HAProxy or F5 BIG-IP, distribute incoming requests based on pre-configured algorithms, ensuring no single server is overwhelmed. The load balancer itself becomes a single point of failure, which can be addressed through clustering for redundancy. Another critical aspect is the implementation of a highly available shared storage system accessible to all application servers. This storage, typically network-attached storage (NAS) or a storage area network (SAN), is critical for storing application state, configuration data, and shared resources. It must be configured with built-in replication and failover mechanisms. Without redundant storage, any loss of the storage component results in complete platform failure.

The application architecture itself must be designed for scalability and high availability. For Java applications, I recommend building loosely coupled microservices using frameworks such as Spring Boot. This allows individual services to scale independently based on their resource needs. Additionally, each service should be stateless, storing persistent data in a database or other external storage system. This simplifies horizontal scaling and reduces the complexity of failover scenarios. In previous projects, I also used caching mechanisms, both local to the application server and distributed caching solutions like Memcached or Redis, to reduce the load on the backend database. The choice between synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns between microservices is another vital consideration. Asynchronous communication, frequently achieved through message queues (like Kafka or RabbitMQ), decouples services and enhances resilience, preventing cascading failures.

For C++ applications, architectural considerations are similar, although frameworks are often less prescriptive. I've found it beneficial to design modular components that communicate through well-defined interfaces. This allows individual components to be scaled separately or replicated as needed. C++ applications must handle memory management explicitly, so careful consideration should be given to resource leaks and proper exception handling to ensure stability under load. Using tools like valgrind during development and testing is crucial for identifying and eliminating memory leaks. Similarly, using thread pools and asynchronous operations can greatly improve concurrency and performance.

The operational aspect of maintaining such a platform cannot be overlooked. Continuous monitoring is vital to detect performance bottlenecks, failures, and resource constraints before they escalate to critical issues. Monitoring solutions like Prometheus and Grafana provide a comprehensive view of system metrics including CPU usage, memory consumption, network latency, and application performance. Alerting mechanisms are critical to notify operations teams of any anomalies, ensuring timely intervention. Automation, in the form of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools like Ansible, Terraform, or Puppet is beneficial for managing configuration, deployment, and scaling of the platform. I’ve learned that having everything defined as code reduces human error and improves consistency across environments. Furthermore, regular testing of failover procedures is vital to guarantee that the platform behaves as expected under failure conditions. This typically includes simulating individual component failures to verify that the system correctly redirects traffic to functional resources.

Here are three practical code examples:

**Example 1: Basic Java Health Check Endpoint using Spring Boot**

```java
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HealthCheckController {

    @GetMapping("/health")
    public String healthCheck() {
        return "OK";
    }
}
```
This Java code defines a simple REST endpoint that returns "OK" when requested. It is fundamental for enabling load balancers and monitoring systems to detect if an application instance is functioning correctly. Load balancers will periodically call this endpoint and remove the instance from rotation if it becomes unhealthy.

**Example 2: C++ Multi-threaded HTTP Server Using Boost Asio (Simplified)**

```c++
#include <boost/asio.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <string>
#include <memory>

using namespace boost::asio;
using namespace boost::asio::ip;

void handle_client(std::shared_ptr<tcp::socket> sock) {
    try {
        boost::asio::streambuf response_buffer;
        std::ostream response_stream(&response_buffer);

        response_stream << "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n";
        response_stream << "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n";
        response_stream << "Connection: close\r\n";
        response_stream << "\r\n";
        response_stream << "OK\n";
        boost::asio::write(*sock, response_buffer);
    } catch (std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Exception in handler: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    try {
       io_context io_ctx;
       tcp::acceptor acceptor(io_ctx, tcp::endpoint(tcp::v4(), 8080));

       while (true) {
          std::shared_ptr<tcp::socket> sock = std::make_shared<tcp::socket>(io_ctx);
          acceptor.accept(*sock);
          std::thread(handle_client, sock).detach();
       }

    } catch (std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This C++ code illustrates the basic structure of a multi-threaded HTTP server using the Boost Asio library. Each incoming connection spawns a new thread to handle it. While simplified, this highlights how C++ applications can handle concurrent requests. I’ve used variations of this structure in more complex event-driven applications. The `std::shared_ptr` ensures the socket is valid in the new thread and is deallocated appropriately when finished.

**Example 3: Solaris Zone Configuration (Simplified)**
This is not code but an example of how a Solaris zone can be configured via command line:
```bash
#Create a new non-global zone
zonecfg -z myzone
create

#Set the zone path
set zonepath=/zones/myzone

#Add network configuration
add net
set address=192.168.1.10/24
set physical=e1000g0
end

#Set a resource constraint
add rctl
set name=zone.cpu-cap
set value=(priv,10000) #limit to 10000 MHz or cores
end

#Exit zone configuration
exit

#Install the zone
zoneadm -z myzone install
# Boot the zone
zoneadm -z myzone boot
# Login into the zone
zlogin myzone
```
This series of commands demonstrates how a Solaris Zone can be configured. Firstly, the configuration is initiated using 'zonecfg', the zone's path and network interface are set, and resource controls are established. Following this, the zone is installed and booted and then the user can login via 'zlogin'.

In summary, building a highly available and scalable platform on Solaris requires a holistic approach covering infrastructure, application architecture, and operations. Focus on modular, loosely coupled designs, leverage Solaris features like zones for isolation, establish rigorous monitoring and alerting, and automate processes as much as possible. I recommend exploring resources on the following topics: Solaris Zones administration, microservice architecture patterns, load balancing techniques, and monitoring tools for enterprise environments. Detailed knowledge of these areas will greatly aid in achieving the necessary levels of reliability and scalability.
