The persistent divergence I observed in the discriminator's loss, despite a seemingly stable generator, was traced back to a nuanced interaction between the batch size and the dimensionality of the feature maps at the discriminator's input. Specifically, during a recent project involving a conditional GAN for generating synthetic medical images, I encountered a scenario where the discriminator consistently outputted near-zero probabilities for real images and near-one probabilities for generated images after only a few epochs. This behavior, indicative of a discriminator that quickly overfits to the training data, was not remedied by adjusting the learning rate or employing common regularization techniques like dropout. The solution ultimately involved a careful analysis of how the batch size influenced the information available to the discriminator given the specific architecture employed.

The issue stemmed from the fact that the discriminator was being fed a relatively small batch of feature maps following the convolutional layers of the generator. These feature maps, which are ultimately learned representations of the input image, are inherently high-dimensional. In my specific case, the input image was a 128x128 grayscale image. The generator architecture consisted of multiple upsampling layers, ending with a series of convolutional layers. Before outputting the final image, the penultimate layer of the generator produces a 64x64x64 tensor, which is then passed through a final convolutional layer and tanh activation to obtain the 128x128x1 grayscale output. This 64x64x64 tensor was used to build the feature maps for the discriminator in a naive attempt to directly use it as input and simplify the pipeline. The discriminator, attempting to discern between real and fake feature maps with minimal batch diversity, quickly learned to latch onto superficial statistical patterns present in the limited data within a given batch.

Specifically, if the batch size was too small and the number of features in the input to the discriminator was high, it created a scenario in which the discriminator learned to discriminate based on batch-specific quirks rather than the underlying quality of the generated features. The model failed to generalize. For example, even if the generator’s output was only slightly different between two training iterations, the discriminator would latch onto the differences and use them as a basis for discrimination. If the generator made a slightly modified version of an earlier, lower-quality output, the discriminator would still have marked it as fake, even if its representation had improved. In contrast, if the batch size was too big, then the training signal would be averaged out too much and not push the discriminator to improve discrimination of each individual image in the batch. In short, if the dimensionality of the feature maps greatly outweighs the number of samples in each batch, a phenomenon I've encountered before, then the discriminator is prone to overfitting or being under-trained.

To further clarify, consider the following three examples. Each highlights a different configuration.

**Example 1: Small Batch Size, High-Dimensional Input**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, feature_channels):
        super(Discriminator, self).__init__()
        self.main = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(feature_channels, 64, 4, 2, 1),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 128, 4, 2, 1),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            nn.Conv2d(128, 1, 4, 1, 0),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )

    def forward(self, x):
         return self.main(x).view(-1, 1).squeeze(1)


feature_channels = 64
batch_size = 4
height = 64
width = 64

# Create a sample input
fake_feature_maps = torch.randn(batch_size, feature_channels, height, width)

#Initialize discriminator
discriminator = Discriminator(feature_channels)

#Pass fake data through the discriminator
output = discriminator(fake_feature_maps)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}") #Output shape: torch.Size([4])
```
Here, the `feature_channels` are 64, and the `batch_size` is 4. The discriminator expects a 64x64 input with 64 channels. When given a small batch, it can easily distinguish between real and fake data even with minor differences due to the amount of information per sample given the high number of features. In a training loop, this configuration would likely result in the discriminator overfitting quickly, leading to a drop in the discriminator’s loss but poor performance as a generator evaluation metric. The discriminator would latch onto the specific characteristics of each image within the small batch, rather than learning more robust and generalizable features.

**Example 2: Larger Batch Size, High-Dimensional Input**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, feature_channels):
        super(Discriminator, self).__init__()
        self.main = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(feature_channels, 64, 4, 2, 1),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 128, 4, 2, 1),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            nn.Conv2d(128, 1, 4, 1, 0),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )

    def forward(self, x):
         return self.main(x).view(-1, 1).squeeze(1)

feature_channels = 64
batch_size = 32
height = 64
width = 64

# Create a sample input
fake_feature_maps = torch.randn(batch_size, feature_channels, height, width)

#Initialize discriminator
discriminator = Discriminator(feature_channels)

#Pass fake data through the discriminator
output = discriminator(fake_feature_maps)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}") #Output shape: torch.Size([32])
```
In this configuration, the `batch_size` is now 32. While better, there could still be problems if the features are very distinctive or the data is highly homogenous. The dimensionality of the feature maps remains unchanged, at 64x64x64. This configuration demonstrates an improvement, where a larger batch size allows the discriminator to see more variation and potentially reduce overfitting to batch-specific patterns. But given the high input feature dimensions, there is still a strong risk of overfitting during training.

**Example 3: Modified Input Feature Map, Larger Batch Size**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, feature_channels):
        super(Discriminator, self).__init__()
        self.main = nn.Sequential(
             nn.Conv2d(feature_channels, 32, 4, 2, 1),
             nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
             nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 4, 2, 1),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 1, 4, 1, 0),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )

    def forward(self, x):
         return self.main(x).view(-1, 1).squeeze(1)


feature_channels = 32 # Reduced channels
batch_size = 32
height = 64
width = 64

# Create a sample input (reduce feature maps before inputting to discriminator)
feature_maps_64 = torch.randn(batch_size, 64, height, width)
conv_reduce = nn.Conv2d(64, 32, 1, 1, 0)
fake_feature_maps = conv_reduce(feature_maps_64)


#Initialize discriminator
discriminator = Discriminator(feature_channels)

#Pass fake data through the discriminator
output = discriminator(fake_feature_maps)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}") #Output shape: torch.Size([32])
```
Here, the critical change is that the number of input feature map channels to the discriminator has been reduced from 64 to 32 using a simple 1x1 convolutional layer. Now the discriminator will be processing 32 feature channels, not 64. In my experience, this combination of a larger batch size (32) and the reduced dimensionality of the feature map channels, helped stabilize the GAN training. This architecture strikes a better balance between diversity within a batch and the dimensionality of input features. The discriminator has more samples to learn from without being overwhelmed by too many features. The loss function of the discriminator was no longer constantly pushing to zero. I found that this configuration allowed both the generator and discriminator to improve throughout training.

These examples underscore the importance of the batch size relative to the feature map's dimensionality at the discriminator's input. If the discriminator is presented with limited variations of very high-dimensional feature maps, it tends to overfit or under-train, leading to the unstable training of the GAN. I have found that experimenting with different batch sizes and/or manipulating the feature maps to reduce their dimension just before the discriminator can significantly improve GAN stability. Specifically, adding convolutional layers to reduce the channel size or pooling layers to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps can help alleviate the problem.

For further learning, I would recommend researching the following concepts: "Feature map visualization techniques", “Optimal batch size in GANs”, and "Dimensionality reduction in convolutional networks." Understanding how to interpret feature maps, and the relationship between mini-batch size and optimization, can prove incredibly useful. Furthermore, understanding various dimensionality reduction techniques will allow for flexible manipulation of the input feature maps for the discriminator.
