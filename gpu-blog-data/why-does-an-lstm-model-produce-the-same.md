The observation of a static final hidden state in a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, particularly when processing sequences, often points to a mismatch between how the model is architected and how the input data is structured, or to a training process that failed to converge. I've encountered this situation several times while working with recurrent networks for time-series analysis and natural language processing. The core issue isn't a fundamental flaw in LSTMs, but a consequence of their design in conjunction with specific operational contexts.

The LSTM architecture is explicitly designed to maintain state across a sequence of inputs. At each time step, the LSTM cell ingests an input, a previous hidden state, and a previous cell state. These inputs are processed through a series of gates (input, forget, and output gates) and the current cell and hidden states are updated. Crucially, these states encapsulate the model's understanding of the sequential information up to that time step. The final hidden state of an LSTM represents the culmination of this information processing. When this final state appears to be static across different input sequences, it’s often due to one of the following primary reasons: a saturation of hidden states or an insufficient representational capacity relative to the information complexity.

Saturation occurs when the internal memory cells become unable to store any further unique information. This can happen when the input sequences do not actually provide relevant variance towards the end of the sequence, or the model is not trained sufficiently to discriminate between the different input patterns. Imagine an LSTM trained to predict stock prices where the last few days' data is consistently flat or noisy. The LSTM’s gates will eventually prioritize forgetting new information and maintaining the status quo. In such scenarios, the model's internal state will reach a stable point where any incoming data has minimal influence. Additionally, if the input sequence contains a repeating pattern, the LSTM might latch onto this pattern, reaching a final state that merely captures the repeated aspect rather than the nuances of each input.

Insufficient representation capacity presents another common cause. The dimensionality of the hidden state (number of hidden units) sets an upper bound on the complexity the LSTM can model. If this is significantly less than the dimensionality of the input sequence and the underlying relationship between the sequential elements, the LSTM will be unable to encode sufficient information during the temporal progression, leading to a converging hidden state. It simply does not have enough parameters to keep track of the different possible evolutions of sequences. A common symptom here is an LSTM with a high bias - that is, it can generalize to the same predictions regardless of different input sequences.

Furthermore, the way the network is initialized and trained plays a vital role. Poor initial weight distributions or a learning rate that is too high can cause unstable training dynamics. This can lead to a saturation early in the training process, which often locks the final hidden state to a sub-optimal point. Finally, if the network is trained on a dataset with insufficient diversity or too small, it may not have the necessary exposure to a variety of situations and variations, resulting in a poorly-generalizing model with a static final state.

Let’s illustrate this with some code examples using a simplified Python implementation via a deep learning framework, to highlight the problem and how it can be addressed.

**Code Example 1: Saturation due to Insufficient Information**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(SimpleLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, (h, c) = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :]) #Only use the last hidden state
        return out, h

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
model = SimpleLSTM(input_size, hidden_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_function = nn.MSELoss()

# Create input sequences with a constant last section
seq_len = 30
batch_size = 3

inputs = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, input_size)
inputs[:, 20:, :] = 0.1  # Last 10 elements of each sequence are same
targets = torch.randn(batch_size, 1)

for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs, h = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_function(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

final_hidden_states = h.detach().numpy()
print(final_hidden_states)
#Expect to see all final hidden states to be very similar across the batch
```
This example sets up a basic LSTM. Crucially, the final 10 elements of each input sequence within the batch are made constant. As expected, the final hidden states produced by this model are almost identical across the batch. The consistent nature of the inputs towards the end overwhelms any earlier differences in the sequences, causing the hidden states to converge to a singular representation of the constant final portion.

**Code Example 2: Saturation Due to Limited Hidden State Size**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class LimitedLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(LimitedLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, (h, c) = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :]) #Only use the last hidden state
        return out, h

input_size = 50
hidden_size = 5 # Significantly smaller than input
model = LimitedLSTM(input_size, hidden_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_function = nn.MSELoss()

# Create random input sequences
seq_len = 30
batch_size = 3
inputs = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, input_size)
targets = torch.randn(batch_size, 1)

for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs, h = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_function(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

final_hidden_states = h.detach().numpy()
print(final_hidden_states)
#Expect to see all final hidden states to be very similar across the batch
```
Here, the dimensionality of the hidden layer (`hidden_size = 5`) is severely restricted compared to the input layer (`input_size = 50`). Consequently, the network cannot fully capture the complexity present within the input sequences.  The final hidden states again show convergence and a lack of representational differentiation between sequences.

**Code Example 3: Increasing Hidden State Size and Input Variance**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class ImprovedLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(ImprovedLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        out, (h, c) = self.lstm(x)
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :]) #Only use the last hidden state
        return out, h

input_size = 50
hidden_size = 128 #Larger hidden state
model = ImprovedLSTM(input_size, hidden_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_function = nn.MSELoss()

# Create diverse input sequences
seq_len = 30
batch_size = 3
inputs = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, input_size)
targets = torch.randn(batch_size, 1)

for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs, h = model(inputs)
    loss = loss_function(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

final_hidden_states = h.detach().numpy()
print(final_hidden_states)
#Expect to see the final hidden states to have a higher degree of variance
```
In this improved case, we increased the hidden state size and ensure each input sequence is unique. This results in final hidden states which display greater variance. This example underscores that choosing an appropriate hidden state size and ensuring adequate input diversity are crucial for ensuring the LSTM is able to learn different representation for each input sequence.

Based on my experience, when facing these issues, I’d recommend starting by examining the input data. The final elements of the sequences should be diverse and meaningful. Secondly, experiment with varying hidden state dimensionality, adding additional LSTM layers, using attention mechanisms, or using dropout to regularize the network. Furthermore, a careful investigation into the learning rate and weight initialization methods can uncover potential issues. Regarding resources, books covering recurrent neural networks and specifically LSTMs provide detailed explanations on the underlying mechanisms and potential pitfalls and is recommended. Additionally, scholarly articles detailing architectural modifications, attention mechanisms, and other improvements to sequential modeling architectures should be reviewed. Finally, practical guides and code examples from respected online courses are particularly valuable for seeing how these issues are addressed during implementation.
