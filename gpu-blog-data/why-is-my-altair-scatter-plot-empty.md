The most frequent cause of an empty Altair scatter plot stems from data type mismatches or inconsistencies between the specified data fields and the visual encoding parameters.  I've encountered this numerous times during my work on large-scale data visualization projects, often involving geospatial data and time series analysis.  The issue rarely lies within Altair itself; rather, it points to a problem within the data being passed to the chart.  This response will detail the common culprits and demonstrate corrective actions through code examples.


**1. Data Type Mismatches:**

Altair, like most visualization libraries, relies on explicit data type recognition for proper chart construction.  If the data fields you intend to map to X and Y coordinates are not of a numerical type (e.g., integer, float), the plot will remain empty.  String values, for instance, are unsuitable for quantitative plotting without prior conversion. Similarly, datetime objects require explicit handling to be correctly represented on the axes.  Incorrectly formatted dates can lead to empty plots, as Altair cannot interpret them as numerical values representing time.


**2. Missing or Null Values:**

The presence of missing values (`NaN`, `None`, `NULL`) within the data fields assigned to X and Y axes frequently results in empty plots.  Altair's default behavior is to exclude rows containing null values during rendering.  This behaviour can be subtly misleading, as an empty chart doesn’t immediately scream "missing data". The issue is compounded when datasets include large numbers of missing values in either the X or Y columns, leading to a seemingly empty plot even if some data points exist.


**3. Incorrect Data Field Names:**

Typos or inconsistencies between the field names in your data source and those used in the Altair chart specification are a common source of errors.  Altair's encoding system is case-sensitive, meaning 'ColumnA' and 'columna' are treated as distinct fields.  If the field names in your chart specification don't match the column headers in your data, no data will be plotted.  This is often overlooked, especially in larger datasets with many variables.


**4. Data Filtering Issues:**

If you're employing filtering or transformations on your dataset prior to passing it to Altair, the filter might unintentionally exclude all data points, thus leading to an empty plot.  A faulty filter condition, even a seemingly minor oversight, will silently remove all data intended for display.  Careful examination of filtering logic is crucial.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**


**Example 1: Addressing Data Type Mismatches**

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

# Sample data with string-type 'x' and 'y' values.
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': ['1', '2', '3'], 'y': ['4', '5', '6']})

# Incorrect plot; empty due to string data type.
chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(x='x', y='y')

# Correction: Convert 'x' and 'y' columns to numeric.
data['x'] = pd.to_numeric(data['x'])
data['y'] = pd.to_numeric(data['y'])

# Correct plot; data is now plotted as numeric values.
correct_chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(x='x', y='y')
```

This example highlights how converting string representations of numbers to actual numeric types is vital for proper plotting.  The initial attempt yields an empty chart due to the incompatible string data types.  `pd.to_numeric()` effectively addresses this.


**Example 2: Handling Missing Values**

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample data with missing values.
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, np.nan, 4], 'y': [5, np.nan, 7, 8]})

# Plot showing only non-null rows; some data points missing.
chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(x='x', y='y')

# Handling missing values: using imputation.
data['x'] = data['x'].fillna(data['x'].mean())  # Fill with mean.
data['y'] = data['y'].fillna(data['y'].mean())

# Plot showing imputed values; all data points included.
imputed_chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(x='x', y='y')
```

This example demonstrates how missing values (`np.nan`) lead to an incomplete plot.  We use imputation—replacing missing values with the mean—to ensure all data points are included.  Alternative imputation methods like median or forward fill may be better suited depending on the data characteristics.


**Example 3: Checking Data Field Names**

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

# Sample data with correct column names.
data = pd.DataFrame({'X_Value': [1, 2, 3], 'Y_Value': [4, 5, 6]})

# Incorrect plot; capitalization mismatch.
chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(x='x_value', y='y_value') #Case-sensitive!

# Correct plot; using the actual column names.
correct_chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(x='X_Value', y='Y_Value')
```

Here, a simple case-sensitivity issue prevents plotting. Altair is strict in matching field names, so a lower-case specification fails to map to the upper-case columns.


**Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official Altair documentation. Explore the Pandas documentation for data manipulation and cleaning.  Familiarize yourself with common data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.  A solid understanding of data types in Python is essential for effective data visualization.  Review the documentation of any data import libraries you’re using to confirm the structure and data types of your loaded dataset.  Thoroughly inspect the data itself before creating the chart.  Finally, consider using a debugger or print statements to track the data as it passes through the code.  Debugging tools are invaluable in pinpointing the precise point where data inconsistencies arise.
