The undefined reference to `TensorShapeBase` during TensorFlow compilation or runtime often stems from inconsistencies in the TensorFlow build environment or mismatched library versions. I’ve encountered this precise issue multiple times while maintaining deep learning infrastructure, and it typically boils down to a few core culprits related to the interplay between TensorFlow's C++ and Python APIs and underlying Bazel build system. Let’s break it down systematically.

The `TensorShapeBase` class, defined within the core TensorFlow C++ library, provides the fundamental structure for describing the dimensions of tensors. This class is extensively used throughout the TensorFlow codebase, both in C++ and as a basis for Python representations. Its importance explains why an undefined reference to it results in catastrophic failure. The Python side often interacts with this C++ type indirectly via shared objects and compiled kernels. This interaction is where versioning and build discrepancies become problematic. When the Python binding attempts to use a TensorFlow kernel compiled against a different header version, or a different API specification of `TensorShapeBase`, a symbol resolution failure occurs. This failure manifests as the undefined reference.

The most common reason for this error is a mismatch between the TensorFlow C++ library version used to compile custom kernels or extensions and the TensorFlow Python library version you're using in your environment. This mismatch can occur in various scenarios. You might be compiling a custom TensorFlow operator using a different version of the TensorFlow headers than the pre-built TensorFlow Python package. Or, in containerized environments, it's possible that different libraries are loaded at runtime, leading to the same sort of versioning conflict. Additionally, Bazel, the build system TensorFlow relies on, can sometimes become corrupted or have incorrect configuration cached, leading to builds that aren't compatible with the current Python bindings. Another possibility, though less common with recent releases, is a corrupt installation of the TensorFlow C++ libraries themselves, requiring reinstallation to resolve symbol lookup problems.

Here are three code examples which exemplify the problem and its debugging. The first code example will simulate a scenario of incompatible version by showing that two different headers containing the `TensorShapeBase` can be created, and demonstrate that their structure might be different. This situation, when mirrored in the TensorFlow build system, causes runtime problems. The second example uses a simple custom operator that can be used in TensorFlow graph, showing how a mismatch during custom compilation could lead to the undefined reference. The third shows how a container can experience the problem from mismatched versions in the container image.

```cpp
// Example 1: Demonstrating potential header incompatibility.
// This is a simplified demonstration to illustrate conceptual mismatch
// and does not directly mirror the TensorFlow C++ implementation.

// In a hypothetical environment, let's assume two versions of TensorShapeBase.

// header_v1.h
#ifndef TENSOR_SHAPE_BASE_V1_H
#define TENSOR_SHAPE_BASE_V1_H

class TensorShapeBaseV1 {
public:
  int num_dims;
  int* dims;
};

#endif


// header_v2.h
#ifndef TENSOR_SHAPE_BASE_V2_H
#define TENSOR_SHAPE_BASE_V2_H
#include <vector>

class TensorShapeBaseV2 {
public:
    std::vector<int> dims;
};

#endif

// main.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include "header_v1.h"
#include "header_v2.h"


int main() {
  TensorShapeBaseV1 shape1;
  shape1.num_dims = 2;
  shape1.dims = new int[2]{1,2};
  std::cout << "Shape V1 dims: " << shape1.dims[0] << "," << shape1.dims[1] <<  std::endl;


  TensorShapeBaseV2 shape2;
  shape2.dims.push_back(3);
  shape2.dims.push_back(4);
  std::cout << "Shape V2 dims: " << shape2.dims[0] << "," << shape2.dims[1] <<  std::endl;


    // Imagine a scenario where shared library expects type from v1, but the
    // compiled C++ uses v2. This results in an undefined reference during symbol lookup.

  return 0;
}

// Compile with: g++ -o main main.cpp
// Run: ./main

```

This first example illustrates the conceptual issue by defining two different headers for the `TensorShapeBase`, in this case `TensorShapeBaseV1` and `TensorShapeBaseV2`. The C++ files `header_v1.h` and `header_v2.h`, mimic versions with different implementations. If a compiled library expects one of those, say `TensorShapeBaseV1`, and is passed the other at runtime, this situation can lead to errors similar to the undefined reference, if the layout or naming of members are different.  This is not exactly how TensorFlow’s `TensorShapeBase` versions would differ, but the principle of structure mismatches stands.

```cpp
// Example 2:  Simplified custom TensorFlow op that might cause problems if compiled incorrectly
// custom_op.cc

#include "tensorflow/core/framework/op.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/shape_inference.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.h"

using namespace tensorflow;

REGISTER_OP("CustomOp")
    .Input("input: float")
    .Output("output: float")
    .SetShapeFn([](::tensorflow::shape_inference::InferenceContext* c) {
      c->set_output(0, c->input(0)); //Output shape is the same as the input
      return Status::OK();
    });


class CustomOpKernel : public OpKernel {
public:
  explicit CustomOpKernel(OpKernelConstruction* context) : OpKernel(context) {}

  void Compute(OpKernelContext* context) override {
    // Get input tensor
    const Tensor& input_tensor = context->input(0);
    const TensorShape& input_shape = input_tensor.shape(); // This could cause an undefined ref

    //Create output tensor
    Tensor* output_tensor = nullptr;
    OP_REQUIRES_OK(context, context->allocate_output(0, input_shape, &output_tensor));

    //Copy data
    output_tensor->flat<float>() = input_tensor.flat<float>();
  }
};

REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("CustomOp").Device(DEVICE_CPU), CustomOpKernel);

// Compile with:  Assuming TensorFlow include paths are set correctly.
// This will require Bazel or a manual g++ compilation specifying the right header paths
// g++ -std=c++11 -I/path/to/tensorflow/include -shared -fPIC custom_op.cc -o custom_op.so -ltensorflow_framework

```

This example demonstrates a simple TensorFlow custom operator. If this `custom_op.so` is compiled against one version of TensorFlow’s header files (those which contain the `TensorShapeBase` definition) but is used in an environment with another version of TensorFlow Python binding, it can result in a runtime error regarding an undefined reference to `TensorShapeBase`. The line `const TensorShape& input_shape = input_tensor.shape();` is where this problem would likely manifest. The `input_tensor.shape()` method returns a type that's tied to the underlying C++ header files, specifically, it would likely be of type `TensorShapeBase`. Any mismatch between the compiled `custom_op.so` and the Python TensorFlow bindings can lead to the undefined reference.

```python
# Example 3:  Python code demonstrating the load of a custom operator that was compiled against an incorrect version of tensorflow
import tensorflow as tf

#Assume custom_op.so has been compiled with a mismatched version of TensorFlow
# this might happen in a container or other environments
try:
  custom_op = tf.load_op_library('/path/to/custom_op.so')
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error loading custom operator: {e}")
  exit()


input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
# If there are version issues with the custom op, this next line will likely trigger the runtime error
output_tensor = custom_op.custom_op(input = input_tensor)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(output_tensor)
    print(f"Result: {result}")

# Running this may trigger an undefined reference error at the `custom_op.custom_op` call if the shared object
# is incompatible due to the incorrect Tensorflow headers when it was built.
```

This example demonstrates a very common scenario. In the python script, `tf.load_op_library` is used to load the custom operator shared library. If the underlying `custom_op.so` has been compiled against a different version of the TensorFlow C++ API than the currently installed TensorFlow Python version, the runtime will result in an error citing that it can’t find the `TensorShapeBase`. The usage of the custom operator `output_tensor = custom_op.custom_op(input = input_tensor)` then causes the runtime to attempt to instantiate the class, leading to failure.

To address this issue, several strategies are necessary. First, ensure consistency across your development environment. Verify that the version of the TensorFlow C++ headers and libraries used for any custom compilation matches the version of the TensorFlow Python library installed. This often means compiling your C++ code in the same environment (e.g., a Docker container) where your Python code is running. If using custom operators compiled outside your main project's development environment, you may need to rebuild them targeting the version of TensorFlow that will be used. Similarly, check that your build tools and build system (Bazel) are compatible with your TensorFlow installation. Cleaning Bazel cache can be a step towards ensuring a compatible build. If your environment is containerized, make sure that the docker image has a properly installed and compatible version of TensorFlow Python bindings as well as the C++ libraries. Finally, carefully review any changes to your build environment or TensorFlow installation before deploying code.

For further reading, consult the TensorFlow documentation on building custom operators, the Bazel documentation, and discussions within the TensorFlow issue tracker, as these resources contain a wealth of information regarding build intricacies, dependency management, and troubleshooting common problems. The TensorFlow GitHub repository also offers specific details about C++ structures and API changes across different releases. Additionally, consulting the TensorFlow installation and configuration documentation will provide context and solutions related to dependency conflicts and installation problems which are critical to preventing such issues. This multi-pronged approach can be vital in resolving the underlying cause and eliminating the dreaded `undefined reference to TensorShapeBase`.
