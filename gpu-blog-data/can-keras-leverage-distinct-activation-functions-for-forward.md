No, Keras, at its core, does not allow for distinct activation functions during forward and backward propagation within a single layer. The chosen activation function is intrinsically tied to both the computation of the layer's output (forward pass) and the gradient calculation (backward pass). This arises from the fundamental principles of automatic differentiation and how Keras, built upon TensorFlow or other backends, constructs computational graphs. The activation function is a non-linear operation that sits within the computational path of the layer. Its derivative is essential for the backpropagation algorithm to determine the gradients of the loss with respect to the layer's weights and biases. Changing the activation function between forward and backward propagation breaks this relationship, rendering backpropagation ineffective and resulting in incorrect training.

I encountered this limitation during a research project involving sparse autoencoders, several years back. Initially, I was exploring methods to introduce more aggressive sparsity constraints directly during backpropagation, while maintaining a smooth response during the forward pass. My initial thought was to use a rectified linear unit (ReLU) for the forward pass, which would introduce sparsity by zeroing out negative values. Then, for backward pass, I was hoping to use something akin to a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) to push the gradients to a consistent range and avoid the dead neuron problem often associated with ReLUs. This approach, while conceptually interesting, is incompatible with Keras’ structure. Backpropagation expects that the derivative of the *same* function used in the forward pass will be used in its calculations.

To illustrate this, consider a simplified view of a single dense layer in Keras, along with the associated computations. During the forward pass, a weighted sum of the inputs, `z`, is calculated:

`z = W * x + b`

where `W` is the weight matrix, `x` is the input vector, and `b` is the bias vector. Then, the activation function, `f`, is applied:

`a = f(z)`

`a` represents the layer's activation output. During backpropagation, the derivative of the loss with respect to `a`, `d(Loss)/da`, is calculated by preceding layers, then passed to this layer. The crucial step involves finding the derivative of `z` with respect to the weights and biases, which requires the derivative of the activation function, `f'(z)`:

`d(Loss)/dW =  d(Loss)/da * f'(z) * x^T`

`d(Loss)/db = d(Loss)/da * f'(z)`

If the activation function `f` used in the forward pass is different from the function implicitly used during the calculation of `f'(z)` in backpropagation, these gradients would be computed incorrectly, making learning impossible. It's the same function's derivative required for gradient propagation, not different ones for forward and backward passes.

Let me demonstrate with a few code examples and commentary.

**Example 1: Standard Dense Layer with ReLU Activation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define a simple sequential model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Print model summary
model.summary()

# Example input
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10))

# Forward pass
output = model(dummy_input)
print("Forward output shape:", output.shape)


# Backpropagation is implicit during training (requires loss and optimizer)
# This code would not allow separate activations for backpropagation
```

In this example, the `Dense` layer employs the `relu` activation function. This function is used both during the calculation of the layer's output and during the backpropagation process when gradients are calculated. TensorFlow's automatic differentiation engine handles the `relu`’s derivative calculation automatically. Attempting to explicitly change how that derivative is computed, or using another function, is not something we control at the layer level using standard Keras.

**Example 2: Custom Activation Function Class**

While you cannot define distinct forward and backward activation *functions* in Keras itself, you can potentially write a custom activation function using TensorFlow operations, or implement the entire layer, including backpropagation, using TensorFlow’s lower level primitives. Here I illustrate a custom activation function which, although it seems like an attempt at custom backprop, it still doesn't let us use a different function in backprop. The backprop will still use the derivative of the `call` function.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

class CustomActivation(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
      super(CustomActivation, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def call(self, x):
      # This would be our "forward" activation (ReLU-like)
      return K.maximum(x, 0)

    # There is no separate backprop function for custom activations
    # TensorFlow will automatically compute the derivatives needed during
    # backpropagation based on operations in 'call', and the input passed to 'call'

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, input_shape=(10,)),
    CustomActivation(),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])


dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10))

# Forward pass
output = model(dummy_input)
print("Forward output shape:", output.shape)

# Backpropagation is implicit during training
# The derivative of the `call` function is used
```

In this example, the `CustomActivation` layer defines its forward activation in the `call` method. While you could add additional logic or computation within `call`, and even use TensorFlow gradients with `tf.GradientTape`, the backpropagation process relies on the derivatives generated from that specific `call` method.  You cannot specify a different behavior explicitly for backpropagation. The framework handles derivative calculations using the operations performed in `call`.

**Example 3: Experimenting with Gradient Tape (Not a Solution)**

The following example *demonstrates why* the default behavior is necessary. It attempts to use GradientTape to modify the gradients, but this would only change the gradient being passed to *previous* layers. This does not modify the derivatives being calculated *inside* the custom layer. If you want a different behavior for backpropagation *inside a layer*, you need to implement the entire layer from scratch, not only an activation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define a simple dense layer and a loss function for demonstration
dense = layers.Dense(1)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Sample data
x = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y_true = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]], dtype=tf.float32) # Linear relationship

# Training step
def train_step(x, y_true):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = dense(x)
        loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)

    # Default Backpropagation
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, dense.trainable_variables)
    # Trying to change the gradient (This will not work the way I initially wanted to)
    # This is only modifying the gradient *before* reaching our activation layer!
    modified_gradients = [g*2 for g in gradients] # Not the derivative of the activation function, but previous layer

    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(modified_gradients, dense.trainable_variables))
    return loss

# Training loop
epochs = 10
for epoch in range(epochs):
    loss = train_step(x, y_true)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")


```

As shown in this example, the gradient tape allows us to influence the gradients before the optimization step. However, we can't intercept or replace the activation function's derivative *within* the `Dense` layer. This demonstrates why altering the gradient after the activation function is not a valid approach in Keras.

In conclusion, achieving distinct activation functions for forward and backward propagation within the standard Keras framework is not directly feasible. The backpropagation process relies on the derivative of the same function used during the forward pass. Introducing a different function would compromise gradient calculation and lead to poor learning.  The architecture of Keras, built on computational graphs, necessitates this constraint. It is crucial to understand this limitation when working with neural network libraries and to explore alternative methods of achieving desired learning behavior.
