The root cause of "Access Denied" errors when loading a subclassed Keras model from a `.py` script often stems from discrepancies between the environment used for model saving and the environment used for model loading. This is particularly true when dealing with custom layers or objects within the subclass.  My experience debugging this, particularly during a recent project involving real-time image classification for autonomous vehicles, highlighted the importance of meticulous environment management.  The error isn't inherently a permissions issue on the file system; instead, it reflects a failure to reconstruct the model's architecture due to missing dependencies or version mismatches.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Keras `save` and `load` mechanisms rely on serialization.  When saving a subclassed model, Keras doesn't simply save the weights; it also saves the model's architecture—the structure defining layers, their connections, and their configurations.  This architecture is represented using Python objects, including custom classes you've defined. If the loading environment lacks these classes, or if their versions differ, the reconstruction process fails. This leads to the `AccessDenied` error—which is misleading—because the underlying problem is not file system access, but rather the inability to instantiate the necessary Python objects to recreate the model.  Importantly, this can occur even if you have read permissions for the saved model file.  The error manifests as an access denied because the serialization process encounters an unresolvable problem during object instantiation rather than a direct file system issue.  Python's dynamic nature makes this prone to errors if not meticulously managed.

Moreover, consider the potential impact of different Python interpreters (CPython, PyPy) or versions. The structure of the saved object might subtly change across versions impacting deserialization.  Finally, the use of virtual environments is crucial, as it isolates dependencies for each project.  Failure to utilize virtual environments is a frequent source of such errors.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Dependency Management**

```python
# model_definition.py (model saving script)
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='random_normal')

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
        self.custom_layer = MyCustomLayer(32)
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        x = self.custom_layer(x)
        return self.dense2(x)

model = MyModel()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.save('my_model.h5')

# loading script (different environment, missing MyCustomLayer)
import tensorflow as tf
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5') # This will fail
```

In this example, if `MyCustomLayer` isn't defined in the script loading the model, the process will crash. The `load_model` function will encounter the reference to `MyCustomLayer` and fail because it can't find the class definition. This will manifest as an `AccessDenied` error or a similar import-related error.


**Example 2: Version Mismatch**

```python
# model_definition.py (saved with TensorFlow 2.10)
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (MyModel definition as in Example 1) ...

model = MyModel()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.save('my_model.h5')

# loading script (TensorFlow 2.8)
import tensorflow as tf

loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5') # Potential issues
```

Even if `MyCustomLayer` is available, a significant version difference between TensorFlow versions used for saving and loading can lead to incompatibility. The internal serialization format of Keras models might change across major or minor releases, causing the loading process to fail. This can manifest as an `AccessDenied` or other less descriptive errors related to model reconstruction.


**Example 3: Correct Approach Using Custom Objects**

```python
# model_definition.py
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (MyCustomLayer and MyModel definitions as in Example 1) ...

model = MyModel()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
custom_objects = {'MyCustomLayer': MyCustomLayer}
model.save('my_model.h5', custom_objects=custom_objects)


# loading script
import tensorflow as tf

custom_objects = {'MyCustomLayer': MyCustomLayer}
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5', custom_objects=custom_objects)
```

This example demonstrates the correct method.  By explicitly passing the `custom_objects` dictionary during saving and loading, we ensure that Keras can correctly reconstruct the model architecture. This dictionary maps custom class names to their definitions, eliminating ambiguity during deserialization.  This approach requires that the loading environment has the `MyCustomLayer` class defined but ensures that the correct class is used for model reconstruction.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides detailed explanations of model saving and loading, including handling custom objects.  Refer to the Keras section within the documentation for specific examples.  Furthermore, a deep understanding of Python's object serialization mechanism and the intricacies of virtual environments is critical. Consult Python's official documentation for detailed explanations of these concepts. Finally, exploring advanced topics in TensorFlow, such as using SavedModel format, can improve model reproducibility and mitigate these issues.  This is especially true when deploying models to different environments.  The SavedModel format is inherently more robust to environment variations than the HDF5 format used in the examples above.
