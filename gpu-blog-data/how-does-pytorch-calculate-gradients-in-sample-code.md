The core mechanism behind PyTorch's gradient calculation relies on its computational graph and automatic differentiation capabilities.  Specifically, PyTorch leverages reverse-mode automatic differentiation, also known as backpropagation, to efficiently compute gradients.  My experience optimizing deep learning models at a previous research lab heavily involved understanding and manipulating this process, particularly when dealing with complex custom loss functions and non-standard network architectures. This understanding is crucial for debugging, optimizing, and generally improving the performance of any PyTorch-based model.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's automatic differentiation operates through the construction and traversal of a dynamic computation graph.  Each operation performed on a PyTorch tensor is implicitly recorded as a node in this graph. The graph isn't explicitly stored as a static structure; rather, it's constructed on-the-fly during the forward pass of your model.  Each node represents a tensor operation, storing the input tensors, the operation itself, and the resulting output tensor.

The forward pass proceeds as usual, performing the computations necessary to generate model predictions.  Crucially, during this pass, PyTorch maintains a record of all operations and their corresponding input tensors. This record implicitly defines the computation graph.

The backward pass, initiated by calling `.backward()` on a tensor (typically the loss), traverses this computational graph in reverse.  It uses the chain rule of calculus to efficiently compute gradients for all tensors involved in the forward pass.  The chain rule allows PyTorch to compute gradients recursively, starting from the output tensor (the loss) and propagating the gradients backward through the graph.  Each node's gradient is calculated based on the gradients of its successors and the derivative of the operation represented by that node. This process continues until the gradients for all parameters in the model are calculated.  The gradients are then stored as attributes of the corresponding tensor objects, making them readily available for optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

Crucially, PyTorch's dynamic nature means the computational graph is recreated for every forward pass, providing flexibility for handling varying input sizes and dynamic control flow within the model.  This differs from static computational graphs used in some other frameworks, where the graph is compiled once and reused for all forward passes.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Linear Regression**

```python
import torch

# Input data
x = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]], requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([[2.0], [4.0], [5.0]])

# Model parameters
w = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)

# Forward pass
y_pred = w * x + b
loss = torch.mean((y_pred - y)**2) # Mean Squared Error

# Backward pass
loss.backward()

# Gradients
print("Gradient of w:", w.grad)
print("Gradient of b:", b.grad)
```

*Commentary:* This example showcases a basic linear regression model. The `requires_grad=True` flag indicates that we want to track gradients for these tensors. The `backward()` function triggers the automatic differentiation process, calculating and storing gradients for `w` and `b`.


**Example 2:  Gradient Calculation with Custom Function**

```python
import torch

def my_custom_function(x):
    return torch.exp(x) * torch.sin(x)

x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = my_custom_function(x)
y.backward()

print("Gradient of x:", x.grad)
```

*Commentary:* This illustrates gradient calculation for a custom function. PyTorch automatically computes the derivative of `my_custom_function` using its automatic differentiation capabilities, even without explicitly defining the derivative.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Outputs and Dependencies**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=True)
a = x.pow(2)
b = torch.sin(x)
loss = a + b

loss.backward()
print("Gradient of x:", x.grad)
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates how PyTorch handles gradients when the output is a function of multiple intermediary tensors. The gradients are correctly accumulated using the chain rule. Note that the final gradient of `x` is the sum of the gradients contributed by both `a` and `b`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I'd recommend reviewing the official PyTorch documentation, focusing on the sections detailing automatic differentiation and tensor operations.  The PyTorch tutorials offer excellent practical examples demonstrating various aspects of gradient calculation.  Furthermore, a comprehensive deep learning textbook would provide a solid theoretical foundation to supplement the practical aspects.  Finally, exploring the source code of some open-source PyTorch projects can be invaluable for gaining a deeper understanding of the internal mechanisms.  This approach has been my preferred method for gaining advanced knowledge in the past.
