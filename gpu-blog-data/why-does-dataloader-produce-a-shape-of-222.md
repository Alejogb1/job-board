The root cause of the discrepancy between the expected output shape of [150, 2, 2] and the observed shape of [2, 2, 2] from your DataLoader likely stems from an incorrect understanding or misapplication of how the `__getitem__` method within your custom dataset class interacts with the DataLoader's batching mechanism.  My experience debugging similar issues over years of working with PyTorch datasets points to this specific interaction as the most probable source of error.  The DataLoader's batching process aggregates data samples returned by `__getitem__`, and if this method returns data with inconsistent dimensions or the wrong number of samples, the resulting batch shapes will be unexpected.

Let's analyze this systematically.  The DataLoader expects your custom dataset's `__getitem__` method to return a single data sample.  This sample should have a shape consistent with your expectation â€“ in your case, (2, 2).  The DataLoader, configured with a `batch_size`, then collates several of these individual samples into batches. Thus, with a `batch_size` of 150, one would anticipate a final batch shape of (150, 2, 2).  A deviation implies that the `__getitem__` method isn't supplying the expected number of samples or their shape is incorrect. The observed [2, 2, 2] strongly suggests that your DataLoader is processing only two samples, each having a shape of (2, 2), then incorrectly creating a batch of those two samples instead of expected 150.


**Explanation:**

The problem lies in how your dataset is structured and how it interacts with the DataLoader.  My experience has shown several typical mistakes that lead to this:

1. **Incorrect `__len__` implementation:** The `__len__` method of your custom dataset class defines the total number of samples in your dataset. If this method returns 2 instead of 150, the DataLoader will only iterate through the first two samples. This would directly result in a batch size of 2, leading to the observed output.

2. **Incorrect indexing within `__getitem__`:**  Errors in how you index your data within the `__getitem__` method can restrict the number of samples accessed.  For example, if you have a list of 150 arrays of shape (2, 2), but you only access the first two within `__getitem__`, you'll only get two samples. Incorrect slicing or loop bounds are common culprits here.

3. **Data corruption or inconsistency:** It's possible your dataset itself contains an unexpected number of elements or samples with inconsistent shapes. Before using the DataLoader, thorough checks should be implemented to validate the integrity of your dataset.

4. **Collate function issues:** While less likely in the specific [2,2,2] case, a custom collate function might be unexpectedly modifying the tensor shapes, creating this situation.  However, the default collate function usually handles numerical tensors correctly, making this less likely.


**Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect `__len__` implementation:**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = [torch.randn(2, 2) for _ in range(150)]  # Correct data size

    def __len__(self):
        return 2  # Incorrect: should be len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]

dataset = MyDataset()
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=150)

for batch in dataloader:
    print(batch.shape) # Output: torch.Size([2, 2, 2])
```

This example explicitly shows how an incorrect `__len__` method can lead to the observed issue. The DataLoader only processes the first two elements.


**Example 2: Incorrect indexing in `__getitem__`:**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = [torch.randn(2, 2) for _ in range(150)]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        if idx > 1: # Incorrectly limiting the indices
            return torch.randn(2,2) # this will return a dummy value instead of raising an IndexError
        return self.data[idx]

dataset = MyDataset()
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=150)

for batch in dataloader:
    print(batch.shape) #Output likely to be  [2, 2, 2]
```

Here, the indexing within `__getitem__` is flawed, limiting the data access to only the first two samples, leading again to the incorrect batch shape.  Note: a more robust implementation would handle out-of-bounds indexes with a `try-except` block to prevent unexpected behavior.


**Example 3:  Correct Implementation:**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = [torch.randn(2, 2) for _ in range(150)]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]

dataset = MyDataset()
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=150)

for batch in dataloader:
    print(batch.shape) # Output: torch.Size([150, 2, 2])
```

This demonstrates the correct implementation, yielding the expected batch shape.  The `__len__` method correctly returns the dataset size, and `__getitem__` accesses each sample correctly.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation on datasets and DataLoaders.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning with a focus on PyTorch implementation details.  A reputable online tutorial series focusing on practical aspects of PyTorch data handling.  Reviewing these resources will provide a solid foundation for understanding and troubleshooting similar data handling issues.
