In my experience, `cudaGetDevice()` failing during Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model initialization almost universally points to an issue with the CUDA runtime environment's context, particularly regarding how it’s initialized or shared across different parts of the application. This usually isn't a problem with the CUDA device itself being physically absent but rather its accessibility within the application’s process.

The core of the problem lies in the implicit nature of CUDA context creation and management. When a CUDA API call is made, a context – essentially a per-process workspace on the GPU – is implicitly created if one doesn't already exist. This works smoothly in many cases, but complications arise when multiple threads or processes try to interact with the GPU, or when the context gets lost or corrupted, which is common during library interactions.

Essentially, `cudaGetDevice()` is a function that retrieves the currently active device for the calling thread. If no CUDA context has been established for the current thread, or if the context is somehow invalid or corrupted, `cudaGetDevice()` returns an error. The returned error code is typically `cudaErrorNoDevice` or `cudaErrorInitializationError`, which aren’t especially helpful on their own, but point to the broader context problem. The CNN model initialization, which usually involves memory allocation on the GPU and kernel launches, cannot proceed without a valid CUDA device context, resulting in the observed failure.

Several common scenarios contribute to this error, and they typically center on initialization sequence, multi-threading, or the unexpected behavior of supporting libraries.

First, libraries that use CUDA internally (e.g., deep learning frameworks, linear algebra libraries) might not have fully initialized CUDA when the CNN model constructor begins execution. Some frameworks prefer explicit CUDA initialization, expecting the user to initialize the context prior to creating any GPU-bound entities. If the framework or the application is relying on implicit CUDA context initialization by the first CUDA call, and that first call is `cudaGetDevice()`, then its failure isn't unexpected.

Second, multi-threading can also be problematic. Each thread usually requires its own separate CUDA context to prevent conflicts. Improper initialization or sharing of contexts across threads can lead to errors. For instance, a parent thread might initialize a CUDA context, but that context may not be accessible to a child thread that is responsible for initializing the CNN model. If this is not handled correctly, `cudaGetDevice()` in the child thread can fail. Similarly, if the CUDA runtime has not been initialized for that specific thread before calling `cudaGetDevice()` this error will manifest itself.

Third, other external libraries using CUDA could cause issues if they perform operations that change the current context unexpectedly. I've seen instances where a seemingly unrelated helper library call made in a parent process sets the CUDA device context in an unexpected way, leading to the context becoming invalid when the CNN model is initialized within another part of the application.

Now, let's examine a few code examples to make this clearer.

**Code Example 1: Implicit Context Failure**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int deviceId;
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetDevice(&deviceId);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaGetDevice() failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    std::cout << "CUDA Device ID: " << deviceId << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This simple code illustrates the problem where no previous CUDA calls have been made that implicitly create the initial context. In most environments, this code snippet should run fine, but if no other CUDA operation happened before this block, for example, memory allocation, this can fail. The `cudaGetDevice` is the first CUDA call in this example. The first call should create the necessary context, but the order of calls matters. If any library calls `cudaFree` before creating the first context by memory allocation for example, this can cause a context initialization error.

**Code Example 2: Multi-Threaded Context Issue**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void initializeModel(){
    int deviceId;
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetDevice(&deviceId);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaGetDevice() failed in thread: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return;
    }
    std::cout << "CUDA Device ID in thread: " << deviceId << std::endl;
}


int main() {
    int deviceId;
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetDevice(&deviceId);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaGetDevice() failed in main: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    std::cout << "CUDA Device ID in main: " << deviceId << std::endl;

    std::thread modelThread(initializeModel);
    modelThread.join();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, a new thread is launched to handle the initialization of the CNN model. The main thread is initializing the context but the context initialization is not inherited by new threads automatically. Even if the main thread successfully executes `cudaGetDevice()`, the newly created thread does not have its own valid context.  The main thread's initialized context is not automatically available in the newly created thread. This will lead to `cudaGetDevice()` failing in the `initializeModel` function because there’s no valid CUDA context in that thread.

**Code Example 3: Explicit Context Creation (Workaround)**
```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void initializeModel(){
    int deviceId = 0;
    cudaError_t err;
    //Explicitly initialize the CUDA context
    err = cudaSetDevice(deviceId);
    if(err != cudaSuccess){
        std::cerr << "cudaSetDevice() failed in thread: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return;
    }

    err = cudaGetDevice(&deviceId);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaGetDevice() failed in thread after set device: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
         return;
    }
    std::cout << "CUDA Device ID in thread: " << deviceId << std::endl;

}


int main() {
    int deviceId = 0;
    cudaError_t err;

    //Explicitly initialize the CUDA context
    err = cudaSetDevice(deviceId);
    if(err != cudaSuccess){
        std::cerr << "cudaSetDevice() failed in main: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

     err = cudaGetDevice(&deviceId);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaGetDevice() failed in main: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    std::cout << "CUDA Device ID in main: " << deviceId << std::endl;


    std::thread modelThread(initializeModel);
    modelThread.join();

    return 0;
}
```

This code shows the recommended solution. By explicitly setting the CUDA device for each thread using `cudaSetDevice()`, a new context is created in each thread. This prevents the failures shown previously. The device id passed is the same for each call and this will cause each thread to use the same CUDA device, just in separate contexts. This way each thread has its own valid CUDA context, and `cudaGetDevice()` will return a valid device ID.

Debugging this issue typically involves scrutinizing the code for the aforementioned scenarios. Tools like NVIDIA’s `Nsight` can be helpful in inspecting CUDA API calls and device contexts.

To summarize, resolving this issue requires a careful examination of the order of CUDA calls, proper handling of context in multi-threaded applications, and awareness of external libraries and their CUDA usage. I recommend consulting resources like the CUDA programming guide and the documentation for the deep learning framework you are using. Books covering CUDA architecture and programming offer insights into context management, while articles detailing common CUDA troubleshooting techniques are beneficial for resolving tricky issues with context initialization. Thoroughly understanding how CUDA contexts are created and managed is crucial for developing stable and performant applications that utilize GPUs.
