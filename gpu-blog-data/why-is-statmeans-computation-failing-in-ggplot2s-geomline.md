The failure of `stat_means` within `ggplot2`'s `geom_line` when employing a numeric x-axis frequently stems from a misunderstanding of how `stat_summary` functions, specifically its interaction with grouping and the inherent assumptions of line plots.  `stat_means` itself is not a built-in `ggplot2` stat; it's a common user-defined function, or a mistaken usage of `stat_summary`.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous data analysis projects reveals that the problem usually lies in the data structure, the specification of grouping variables, or the implicit expectations of `geom_line`.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`geom_line` connects observations sequentially based on the order of the x-axis variable.  When using a numeric x-axis, this order is generally determined by the numerical value.  `stat_summary`, often used in lieu of a nonexistent `stat_means`, calculates summary statistics for groups of data.  The critical point here is that the x-axis values are *not* inherently considered grouping variables by default.  If your intent is to calculate and plot the mean for each unique x-value, you're not correctly defining the grouping.  Instead, `stat_summary` might be calculating means across the entire dataset, regardless of the x-value, leading to a single point or an unexpected line.  Alternatively, if you have a grouping variable (e.g., treatment groups, time points within a subject), failing to specify it correctly will lead to incorrect averaging across all groups.

Furthermore, the success of `stat_summary` heavily relies on the data being structured appropriately.  Wide data frames, where each column represents a variable, are often problematic.  The preferred structure for statistical summaries within `ggplot2` is a long-format data frame, where a single column designates the x-variable, another the y-variable, and additional columns define grouping variables.  Conversion to this long format is often necessary for correct operation.  Finally, overlooking missing data can also contribute to errors, requiring careful handling prior to plotting.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect usage leading to a single point**

```R
library(ggplot2)
# Incorrect data structure and stat usage
data <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3), y = c(10, 12, 15, 11, 13, 14))

ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(stat = "summary", fun = "mean")

# This will likely produce a single point representing the overall mean of y,
# because stat_summary is applied to the entire dataset without grouping.
```

**Example 2: Correct usage with proper grouping**

```R
library(ggplot2)
# Correct data structure and stat usage
data <- data.frame(x = rep(c(1, 2, 3), each = 3), y = c(10, 12, 15, 11, 13, 14, 9, 10, 12), group = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), 3))

ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y, group = group, color = group)) +
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "line", aes(group = group), size = 1.2) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.2) #Adds error bars for clarity

# This code plots the mean for each x value, grouped by the 'group' variable.
# The use of stat_summary with fun="mean" and geom="line" ensures line plotting of means.
#  The addition of `mean_se` provides error bars, illustrating the uncertainty around the mean.
```


**Example 3:  Handling missing data and transformations**

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
# Handling missing data and transformations
data <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), y = c(10, 12, NA, 15, 18), group = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "B"))

data <- data %>% drop_na() #remove NA values

ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = log(y), group = group, color = group)) + # log transformation
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", geom = "line", aes(group = group), size = 1.2) +
  scale_y_continuous("Log(y)") # Label change to reflect transformation.


#This example showcases data cleaning (removing NA values) and transformation (log)
# before applying stat_summary.  Appropriate labeling is crucial for clarity.

```

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" by Hadley Wickham (book).  This provides comprehensive coverage of `ggplot2`'s capabilities and underlying principles.  The official `ggplot2` documentation is also invaluable for detailed function explanations and examples.  A good understanding of data manipulation techniques using packages like `dplyr` and `tidyr` is highly beneficial in preparing data for effective use within `ggplot2`. Consulting online forums dedicated to R programming and data visualization can provide additional support in troubleshooting specific issues.  Finally, working through tutorials and examples focused on statistical visualization in R strengthens practical understanding.


In summary, the apparent failure of `stat_means` (or the misuse of `stat_summary`) in `geom_line` with numeric x-axes usually arises from incorrect data structuring, a lack of explicit grouping, or inadequate handling of missing data.  Careful attention to data preparation and a clear understanding of how `stat_summary` interacts with `geom_line` are key to successful visualization.  The examples provided highlight these aspects and demonstrate appropriate usage. Remember that diligent data manipulation and precise specification of aesthetic mappings are crucial for accurate and informative visualizations using `ggplot2`.
