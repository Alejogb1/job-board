The execution location of PyTorch kernels is fundamentally determined by the underlying hardware and the chosen execution mode.  My experience optimizing large-scale deep learning models has consistently highlighted that this isn't a simple "here" or "there" answer; rather, it's a complex interplay of CPU, GPU, and potentially specialized hardware accelerators.  The kernel's execution environment directly impacts performance, and understanding this nuance is crucial for efficient model training and inference.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's flexibility stems from its ability to seamlessly transition between CPU and GPU computations.  The default execution environment is the CPU. However, leveraging the power of GPUs, which excel at parallel processing, is often essential for reasonable training times with large datasets. When utilizing GPUs, PyTorch kernels are executed on the CUDA cores of the NVIDIA GPU.  This offloading is transparent to a large extent, thanks to PyTorch's automatic differentiation and optimized tensor operations.  However, explicit control over kernel placement is achievable through specific functions and context managers.

The process begins with the definition of a computation graph, representing the operations performed on tensors. This graph, implicitly or explicitly defined, is then compiled and optimized by PyTorch's backend.  This optimization process involves selecting appropriate kernels, scheduling their execution, and managing data transfer between CPU and GPU memory. The selection criteria consider factors such as tensor size, data type, available hardware resources, and the specific operation being performed.  For instance, matrix multiplication on a GPU will utilize highly optimized CUDA kernels, while simpler element-wise operations might be handled by more generalized routines, even on the GPU, depending on the overall performance optimization performed by the backend.

For scenarios involving multiple GPUs or distributed training, the execution environment further expands.  PyTorch's distributed data parallel (DDP) functionality distributes the computation graph across multiple devices.  Each GPU then executes a portion of the kernels, requiring efficient inter-GPU communication for data synchronization.  In such setups, understanding the communication overhead is paramount to optimizing performance; this often involves strategic data partitioning and careful selection of communication protocols.

Furthermore, emerging hardware accelerators like TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) offer specialized kernels optimized for specific deep learning tasks.  PyTorch's support for TPUs, though not as mature as its CUDA support, allows the execution of kernels on these accelerators, potentially yielding significant speed improvements for suitable tasks.  The specific execution environment in such cases would be the TPU's processing units.

In summary, while the default is CPU execution, PyTorch's design allows and frequently necessitates GPU or specialized hardware acceleration, making the precise location of kernel execution dependent on the computational context.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: CPU Execution (Default):**

```python
import torch

# Create a tensor on the CPU (default)
x = torch.randn(1000, 1000)
y = torch.randn(1000, 1000)

# Perform matrix multiplication; kernel executes on CPU
z = torch.matmul(x, y)

print(z.device)  # Output: cpu
```

This code demonstrates the default CPU execution.  The `torch.randn()` function, without specifying a device, creates tensors residing in CPU memory.  Consequently, the `torch.matmul()` operation, a kernel, is executed on the CPU. The `z.device` call confirms the tensor's location.


**Example 2: GPU Execution (Explicit):**

```python
import torch

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")  # Check for GPU availability
    x = torch.randn(1000, 1000).to(device)
    y = torch.randn(1000, 1000).to(device)

    # Perform matrix multiplication; kernel executes on GPU
    z = torch.matmul(x, y)

    print(z.device)  # Output: cuda:0 (or similar)
else:
    print("CUDA is not available.")
```

This example explicitly moves the tensors to the GPU using `.to(device)`.  This ensures the `torch.matmul()` kernel runs on the GPU.  The `torch.cuda.is_available()` check is crucial for robust code; it prevents errors if a GPU isn't present.  The output confirms GPU execution.


**Example 3:  Mixing CPU and GPU (Illustrative):**

```python
import torch

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    x = torch.randn(1000, 1000)
    y = torch.randn(1000, 1000).to(device)

    # x remains on CPU, y on GPU; efficient data transfer depends on the operation
    z = torch.matmul(x, y)

    print(z.device) # Output: cuda:0 (or similar). PyTorch handles data transfer
else:
    print("CUDA is not available.")

```

This illustrates a scenario where one tensor resides on the CPU and another on the GPU.  PyTorch's autograd system automatically handles the necessary data transfer to perform the operation on the GPU, showcasing implicit data movement based on computation requirements.  Note that the efficiency of this approach heavily depends on the operation and the size of tensors; excessive data transfer can negate GPU acceleration.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation, specifically the sections on CUDA programming and distributed training, are essential.  Furthermore, any comprehensive textbook on deep learning or parallel computing will offer valuable background information on the underlying principles of GPU programming and distributed systems.  Lastly, studying the source code of PyTorch itself (while advanced) provides unparalleled insight into the internals of its kernel execution mechanisms.
