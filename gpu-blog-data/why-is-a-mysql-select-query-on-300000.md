The primary reason a MySQL `SELECT` query exhibits poor performance when operating on 300,000 rows often stems from inefficient index usage or a lack thereof, especially if the query involves filtering or sorting operations. A full table scan, where MySQL reads every row regardless of search conditions, becomes exceedingly costly at this data volume. I've personally witnessed this bottleneck multiple times, most notably when optimizing a legacy reporting system that suffered from queries taking upwards of 30 seconds, even for seemingly simple data retrievals.

Let's break down the contributing factors. When a query is executed, MySQL's query optimizer attempts to determine the most efficient execution plan. This involves selecting the appropriate indexes to use, if any, based on the `WHERE` clause, `JOIN` conditions, and `ORDER BY` or `GROUP BY` specifications. Without a suitable index, the engine resorts to a full table scan, sequentially examining each row in the table, comparing it against the specified conditions, and returning the matching ones.  This scan operation becomes directly proportional to the table's row count, leading to linear performance degradation.  Additionally, even with an index, if the index is not properly configured, MySQL might choose a suboptimal execution path, such as using the index for some columns but performing a full table scan for others.

Furthermore, the query structure itself significantly impacts performance. Queries with complex `WHERE` clauses using multiple `OR` conditions, or with wildcard (`%`) patterns at the beginning of `LIKE` clauses, often prevent effective index utilization. These scenarios often force the database to evaluate the condition on each row, rather than leveraging the quick lookup capabilities of an index. Similarly, aggregate functions like `COUNT(*)`, when not specifically indexing required columns, can force full table reads.

Another crucial point is data type consideration. Comparing a string column to a numeric value, even if the column contains numbers represented as strings, typically inhibits index use. MySQL might need to implicitly convert data types during the comparison, which again results in full scans. Joins between tables also deserve careful consideration. If join conditions do not use indexed columns, the database may perform nested-loop joins, which require reading data from the tables in a nested fashion for each matching condition, drastically affecting performance, particularly when large tables are involved. Finally, the lack of up-to-date statistics can mislead the query optimizer, resulting in an ineffective query plan, which is easily overlooked.

Here are three concrete code examples to demonstrate these points:

**Example 1: Lack of Index on Filter Column**

```sql
-- Consider the 'users' table with columns 'id', 'name', and 'email' (among others)
-- Assume 'id' is indexed but 'email' is not.

-- A poorly performing query:
SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE email = 'john.doe@example.com';
```

**Commentary:** In this case, without an index on the `email` column, MySQL will perform a full table scan, reading every record to evaluate the `WHERE` condition. This will be slow even with 300,000 rows, and the performance will continue to worsen as the number of rows increases. The fix here is to create an index on the `email` column. Adding `CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);` significantly improves the query execution speed.

**Example 2: Inefficient 'LIKE' Clause and Incorrect Data Type Comparison**

```sql
-- Assuming there is an index on the 'order_id' column, which is TEXT.
-- However, in some cases, numbers were incorrectly inserted as text strings.

-- A poorly performing query:
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id LIKE '%123'  OR order_id = 123;

```

**Commentary:** This example showcases two problems.  First, the `LIKE '%123'` clause with a leading wildcard negates any benefit from using an index on `order_id` as the engine must look at every string to find matches.  Second, the implicit type conversion caused by comparing a text field to the integer 123 may also hinder index usage, as MySQL will have to consider converting the string to integers. The fix here would involve restructuring the query, and ensuring consistent data types on the table. If `order_id` should be an integer, updating the column type and any related application logic will reduce the overhead. An alternative may be a full-text index (if the field is actually text). If the `order_id` is truly a text value, then one may refactor the query, perhaps with application code, to use `order_id LIKE '123%'`, when possible.

**Example 3:  Complex Filtering and a sub-optimal Execution Plan**

```sql
-- Assume a table named 'products' with 'category_id', 'price' and 'name'.
-- Also assume only an index on primary key, and no composite index.

SELECT name, price FROM products
WHERE category_id = 5
  OR (price > 100 AND price < 500);
```

**Commentary:** Even if `category_id` and `price` are indexed, the `OR` clause in the `WHERE` condition often causes MySQL to perform a full table scan or to use multiple index scans with the results combined, an inefficient operation. The query may choose to use the `category_id` index, then scan rows, then the price index, and merge results, which would lead to reading rows more than once. An optimal solution involves creating a composite index, encompassing both `category_id` and `price` when it is frequently required for such query patterns. For instance, `CREATE INDEX idx_cat_price ON products(category_id, price);` allows the optimizer to use this index directly for the complete query. In some cases, rewriting a query with `UNION` might give better performance in such scenarios by running two separate, simpler queries and then combining the results.

To address these performance issues, consider these resource recommendations:

1.  **MySQL Documentation on Indexing**: The official MySQL documentation offers an in-depth understanding of indexing strategies and their impact on query performance.  Specific sections on index types (B-Tree, Hash, etc.) are very useful, especially when learning different indexing strategies.

2.  **Performance Tuning Books**: Books that focus specifically on MySQL performance tuning offer comprehensive guidance, covering topics like query optimization, schema design, and server configuration. These resources provide real-world scenarios and recommended approaches to avoid common performance pitfalls.

3.  **Online Database Performance Tools**: Some online resources may be of help by showcasing tools for analyzing query execution plans which are often very helpful to understand how the database is processing queries. They also provide valuable insights into slow query logs, enabling developers to identify and resolve performance issues systematically. They may be a source of ideas on how to use `EXPLAIN` to analyze queries.

In summary, achieving acceptable performance with a `SELECT` query on 300,000 rows in MySQL generally involves careful consideration of indexing, query structure, data types, and join methodologies.  Effective index design coupled with a strong understanding of query execution plans enables databases to quickly retrieve data, avoiding full table scans that lead to poor performance.  Analyzing performance, using `EXPLAIN`, and continuously monitoring database usage will lead to an optimized and performant system.
