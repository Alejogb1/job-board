The inherent ambiguity in attempting to directly recover tokens from BERT encoder weights necessitates a nuanced approach.  My experience working on multilingual question answering systems revealed that while the encoder doesn't explicitly store tokens, its learned representations encode contextual information enabling probabilistic token reconstruction, albeit indirectly.  This reconstruction isn't a deterministic mapping; it's a process of inferring the most likely sequence given the encoded representation.  Therefore, the method involves leveraging techniques from probability and generative modelling.

**1.  Explanation of the Approach**

The core idea lies in viewing the BERT encoder's output as a compressed representation of the input sequence. Each hidden state vector in the final encoder layer is a dense vector embedding carrying semantic information about the corresponding token in the input.  However, this embedding is not a one-to-one mapping; the transformation is highly non-linear and involves interactions between all tokens in the sequence.  Directly inverting this transformation to recover the original tokens is computationally intractable and ill-posed.

Instead, we can train a separate decoder network to learn the inverse mapping, probabilistically. This decoder would take the encoder's output as input and predict the probability distribution over the vocabulary for each token position.  The most probable token at each position is then selected as the reconstructed token.  This process is akin to autoencoding, where the encoder compresses the data and the decoder reconstructs it.  The effectiveness relies heavily on the decoder's architecture and training data.

Crucially, this approach hinges on the quality of the pre-trained BERT weights.  If the weights reflect a well-learned contextual understanding, the resulting reconstruction will be more accurate.  Furthermore, using a larger contextual window during the fine-tuning of the decoder network can improve its performance.  The architecture choice for the decoder is also vital. Recurrent networks (RNNs) and Transformers themselves can be suitable candidates; the choice would depend on the size of the vocabulary and the desired trade-off between computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy.

**2. Code Examples**

The following examples illustrate different aspects of the process.  These are simplified for illustrative purposes and wouldn’t be directly production-ready without significant refinement and scaling.  They are based on PyTorch, assuming familiarity with the framework.

**Example 1:  Simplified Decoder with a Linear Layer**

This example employs a simple linear layer as a decoder.  It’s computationally inexpensive but lacks the ability to capture complex relationships between tokens.


```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume 'bert_encoder' is a pre-trained BERT encoder
# 'hidden_size' is the BERT encoder's output dimension
# 'vocab_size' is the size of the vocabulary

class SimpleDecoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, vocab_size):
        super(SimpleDecoder, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, encoder_output):
        logits = self.linear(encoder_output)
        return logits

decoder = SimpleDecoder(768, 30522) # Example dimensions

# Example usage:
# Assuming 'encoder_output' is the output of the BERT encoder
logits = decoder(encoder_output)
probabilities = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
_, predicted_tokens = torch.max(probabilities, dim=-1)

```

**Example 2:  Decoder with an RNN**

This example leverages an RNN (LSTM) for better sequential modelling.  The RNN captures dependencies between tokens, leading to potentially improved reconstruction accuracy.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class RNNDecoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, vocab_size, embedding_dim):
        super(RNNDecoder, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_size)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, encoder_output, initial_state=None):
        # Assuming encoder_output is a sequence of hidden states
        outputs = []
        for i in range(len(encoder_output)):
            embedded = self.embedding(encoder_output[i])
            output, hidden = self.lstm(embedded, initial_state)
            logits = self.linear(output)
            outputs.append(logits)
            initial_state = hidden
        return outputs

# Example usage (requires adaptation based on encoder_output structure):
decoder = RNNDecoder(768, 30522, 256)
decoded_sequence = decoder(encoder_output)
```

**Example 3:  Masked Language Modelling with the Decoder**

This example adapts masked language modelling principles.  We mask parts of the encoder output and train the decoder to predict the masked tokens.  This is a more sophisticated method, requiring masked tokens to be defined during the training phase.


```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# ... (SimpleDecoder or RNNDecoder definition from previous examples) ...

# Create a masked version of the encoder output
masked_encoder_output = encoder_output.clone()
mask_indices = torch.randint(0, len(masked_encoder_output), (len(masked_encoder_output) // 5,)) # Mask 20% of tokens
masked_encoder_output[mask_indices] = 0 # Or a special masking token

# ... Training loop ...
logits = decoder(masked_encoder_output)
loss = F.cross_entropy(logits.view(-1, logits.size(-1)), target.view(-1)) # 'target' are the original masked tokens

# ... Backpropagation and optimization ...

```


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration, I recommend studying advanced topics in sequence-to-sequence models, autoencoders, and variational autoencoders.  Familiarizing oneself with different attention mechanisms and their applications in sequence generation would prove invaluable.  Finally, a thorough understanding of probabilistic modelling and Bayesian inference techniques is crucial for fully grasping the inherent uncertainties in this task.  Consulting research papers on BERT and related models, particularly those focusing on its generative capabilities, will enhance understanding.  Exploring different decoder architectures beyond those shown would lead to more robust results.
