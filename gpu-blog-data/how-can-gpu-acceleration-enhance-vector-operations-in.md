Direct memory access latency is the fundamental bottleneck for high-throughput vector computations in MATLAB. By moving these operations to the GPU, we bypass the central processing unit’s (CPU) relatively slow memory pathways, achieving significant performance gains for sufficiently large datasets. Specifically, GPUs excel in Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) parallelism, allowing numerous identical operations to be performed simultaneously on different data elements. This contrasts sharply with a CPU's focus on a smaller number of complex instructions handled sequentially or through limited multi-threading.

The core principle underpinning MATLAB’s GPU acceleration revolves around offloading vector and matrix operations to the CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) framework provided by NVIDIA GPUs. MATLAB leverages its `gpuArray` class to represent data residing in the GPU's memory. When computations are performed on `gpuArray` objects, MATLAB automatically translates the high-level operations into the appropriate CUDA kernels, transparently handling data transfer and synchronization between the host (CPU) and the device (GPU). This abstraction is essential for usability; we can write code resembling standard MATLAB while harnessing the GPU’s power. Crucially, this approach is advantageous only when the time to transfer data to the GPU and back is less than the time it would have taken the CPU to execute the same operation. Therefore, there’s a trade-off: small vectors may benefit less from GPU acceleration.

To illustrate, consider a simple vector addition. When performing this on the CPU, MATLAB iterates through the elements. However, when using the GPU, the vector is copied to GPU memory, and multiple additions are performed in parallel. Here’s a simplified code example demonstrating this difference:

```matlab
% Example 1: CPU vs GPU vector addition

% Vector size
n = 10000;

% Generate two random vectors
a = rand(1, n);
b = rand(1, n);

% CPU execution
tic;
c_cpu = a + b;
t_cpu = toc;
fprintf('CPU time: %f seconds\n', t_cpu);

% Transfer data to GPU
a_gpu = gpuArray(a);
b_gpu = gpuArray(b);

% GPU execution
tic;
c_gpu = a_gpu + b_gpu;
t_gpu = toc;

% Bring the result back to the CPU for further processing
c_gpu = gather(c_gpu);
fprintf('GPU time: %f seconds\n', t_gpu);

assert(isequal(c_cpu, gather(c_gpu)), 'Results should match.');
```

In this first example, the execution time for both CPU and GPU operations is timed. The vectors are created in the CPU memory, converted to `gpuArray` objects for the GPU calculation, and converted back for verification. The `gather` function is the inverse of `gpuArray`, moving data from the GPU back to the host CPU. For vector sizes this small, the GPU might show very little speedup because transfer time will dominate the actual computation time. However, increasing the size of ‘n’ to, for example, one million reveals the significant advantages of the GPU.

Beyond simple element-wise operations, we can effectively accelerate matrix multiplication as well. Matrix multiplication involves numerous floating-point operations, making it a prime candidate for GPU processing. Consider a case where large matrices are multiplied:

```matlab
% Example 2: CPU vs GPU matrix multiplication

% Matrix size
m = 2048;
n = 2048;
p = 1024;

% Create random matrices
A = rand(m, n);
B = rand(n, p);

% CPU matrix multiplication
tic;
C_cpu = A * B;
t_cpu = toc;
fprintf('CPU matrix mult time: %f seconds\n', t_cpu);

% Transfer matrices to the GPU
A_gpu = gpuArray(A);
B_gpu = gpuArray(B);

% GPU matrix multiplication
tic;
C_gpu = A_gpu * B_gpu;
t_gpu = toc;

% Bring the result back to the CPU
C_gpu = gather(C_gpu);
fprintf('GPU matrix mult time: %f seconds\n', t_gpu);


% Verify correctness
assert(norm(C_cpu - C_gpu, 'fro') < 1e-6, 'Matrix multiplication results should be close.');
```

The second example highlights the speedup obtainable with matrix multiplication. We measure time on the CPU and GPU. Note the `norm` function with the 'fro' parameter used for verification, calculating the Frobenius norm, which represents the magnitude of the difference between the matrices. The tolerance of 1e-6 is used to accommodate for potential small precision differences. With matrices of size 2048x2048 and 2048x1024, the time savings achieved through GPU acceleration become substantial due to its high parallel processing capability.

Furthermore, complex algorithms using linear algebra operations benefit significantly. Consider the solution to a linear system which commonly uses matrix factorization techniques like LU decomposition. While these can be implemented naively, MATLAB and its accelerated computation libraries are specifically optimized for such cases.

```matlab
% Example 3: CPU vs GPU linear system solution

% Matrix size
n = 2048;

% Generate random matrix and right hand side vector
A = rand(n, n);
b = rand(n, 1);

% CPU solution
tic;
x_cpu = A \ b;
t_cpu = toc;
fprintf('CPU linear solve time: %f seconds\n', t_cpu);

% Transfer data to GPU
A_gpu = gpuArray(A);
b_gpu = gpuArray(b);

% GPU solution
tic;
x_gpu = A_gpu \ b_gpu;
t_gpu = toc;

% Bring the result back to the CPU
x_gpu = gather(x_gpu);
fprintf('GPU linear solve time: %f seconds\n', t_gpu);


% Verify the result
assert(norm(A*x_cpu - b) < 1e-6, 'CPU Linear solve is not accurate');
assert(norm(A*x_gpu - b) < 1e-6, 'GPU Linear solve is not accurate');

% Compare the results
assert(norm(x_cpu - x_gpu) < 1e-6, 'Solution vectors should match.');
```

This final example showcases a linear system solution. Again, we see timing differences and verification. Here, the backslash operator ‘\’ employs optimized algorithms on both the CPU and GPU environments to solve the linear equation system ‘Ax = b’. The core of the computation remains the same, but the execution path is different. In most scenarios, the GPU is substantially faster for matrix sizes of 1000x1000 or more. These algorithms benefit from the optimized CUDA kernels provided by NVIDIA. Additionally, this highlights an important point: the algorithms are the same, but MATLAB's implementation automatically calls optimized library implementations optimized for GPU execution.

For further learning, consulting official MATLAB documentation relating to Parallel Computing Toolbox, and CUDA integration is a must. This material will provide details on `gpuArray` class, CUDA kernel creation, advanced data management, and optimization techniques. Further, books covering numerical computing, specifically those focused on linear algebra techniques are excellent supplementary resources. Finally, examining scholarly publications detailing GPU acceleration of scientific computing algorithms will grant insight into best practices and common challenges in this domain. Accessing well-structured MATLAB examples, especially those from the community on online forums, also proves incredibly useful for practical implementation and understanding. This combination of theoretical and practical exploration should provide a solid foundation for developing GPU accelerated MATLAB applications.
