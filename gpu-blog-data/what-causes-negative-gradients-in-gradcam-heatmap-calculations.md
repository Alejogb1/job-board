The appearance of negative gradients within GradCAM heatmaps, despite the final classification score being a positive value, directly stems from the nature of the gradient calculation within backpropagation, specifically in relation to the ReLU activation function prevalent in convolutional neural networks. These negative values are not indicators of model failure, but rather a nuanced reflection of how the model diminishes certain feature activations to achieve the correct classification.

Fundamentally, GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) leverages the gradients of the target class with respect to the feature maps of a convolutional layer to produce a heatmap highlighting regions of the input that are most important for the classification. The process involves three key steps: extracting feature maps from a convolutional layer, calculating gradients of the score with respect to these feature maps, and finally, computing a weighted sum of the feature maps using the global-average-pooled gradients.

During backpropagation, gradients are computed using the chain rule, essentially propagating the derivative of the loss function backwards through the network. The derivative calculation at each layer depends on the activation function used. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), defined as `f(x) = max(0, x)`, introduces a critical asymmetry: the derivative is 1 for positive inputs and 0 for negative inputs. This behavior means that when a feature map element's activation is negative, the gradient passed through ReLU will be zero, thus contributing nothing to the overall gradient calculation for that location. However, this does not mean the model considers the location unimportant; rather, it suggests it’s not positively contributing to the score.

The crucial aspect that can create negative gradients in the GradCAM weights, therefore, arises from the gradients **before** the ReLU function within that feature map. Consider the gradient of the score with respect to a given feature map at a point (i, j) before ReLU, denoted as ∂score/∂feature_map(i,j). If this value is negative, then ReLU may or may not cause the gradient to be zero, depending on the sign of the feature map at (i, j). Because GradCAM works with the global average pooled gradients, some individual negative gradients can persist when averaged over the entire feature map, leading to a negative weight in the heatmap. Importantly, this doesn’t imply the feature map is harmful to the classification; it merely indicates a decreasing relationship between that feature map’s activations and the output score.

Further, the weighted combination in the final GradCAM heatmap often doesn't restrict the values to the positive domain. After obtaining the averaged gradient for each feature map channel, they are used as weights to multiply the corresponding feature maps and then summed together. If these weights are negative, areas of high activation in their feature maps will contribute negatively to the final heatmap. This is why a positive score can be produced even when certain areas of an image generate a negative heatmap value - the network diminishes their influence, indicating that the class score would be lower if these areas were more present.

Here are three code examples illustrating this concept with specific scenarios:

**Example 1: Basic Negative Weight**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.autograd import Variable

class DummyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DummyModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 1, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.avgpool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1,1))

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.relu1(x)
        feature_maps = x  # Capture feature maps
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.avgpool(x)
        return x, feature_maps

# Dummy input and target
dummy_input = Variable(torch.randn(1, 3, 28, 28), requires_grad=True)
dummy_target = Variable(torch.tensor([[1.0]]), requires_grad=False)

# Instantiating model and optimizer
model = DummyModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
model.zero_grad()

# Forward pass
output, feature_maps = model(dummy_input)
loss = F.mse_loss(output, dummy_target)
loss.backward()

# Gradient Calculation
gradients = torch.autograd.grad(output, feature_maps, grad_outputs=torch.ones_like(output), retain_graph=True)[0]
pooled_gradients = torch.mean(gradients, dim=(2, 3), keepdim=True) #Average gradients for each feature map

gradcam = torch.sum(pooled_gradients * feature_maps, dim=1, keepdim=True)
#The above step shows how feature maps can have a negative impact when multiplied with negative pooled gradients, as seen in real GradCAM implementations

print("Example 1: Gradcam values (before Relu): \n", gradcam.detach().numpy()) #This prints the raw gradcam heatmaps
```
In this simple model, `gradcam` values will be negative in some locations, demonstrating how negative gradients contribute to the final result when multiplied with feature maps. These negative values are still informative about model's decision making.

**Example 2: Effect of ReLU on Gradients**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.autograd import Variable

class DummyModelRelu(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DummyModelRelu, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        before_relu = self.linear(x)
        after_relu = self.relu(before_relu)
        return after_relu, before_relu

# Input and target
dummy_input = Variable(torch.randn(1, 10), requires_grad=True)
dummy_target = Variable(torch.tensor([[1.0]]), requires_grad=False)

# Model and optimizer
model = DummyModelRelu()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
model.zero_grad()

# Forward and Backwards
output, before_relu = model(dummy_input)
loss = F.mse_loss(output, dummy_target)
loss.backward()

# Gradient Calculation and display
grad_before_relu = torch.autograd.grad(output, before_relu, grad_outputs=torch.ones_like(output), retain_graph=True)[0]
print("Example 2: Gradients before ReLU :", grad_before_relu.detach().numpy())

```

This example shows the gradients computed before ReLU. Even if the final classification score `output` is positive, the gradients flowing back before ReLU might have negative values, depending on the linear transformation.

**Example 3: Visualizing GradCAM (Conceptual)**

```python
# Conceptual GradCAM Heatmap Generation (Illustrative)
import numpy as np

def conceptual_gradcam_heatmap(feature_maps, pooled_gradients):
    gradcam_heatmap = np.sum(pooled_gradients * feature_maps, axis=0)
    return gradcam_heatmap

# Assume feature_maps and pooled_gradients are numpy arrays after some processing
feature_maps_example = np.array([[[1,2],[3,4]], [[-1,0],[2,-3]]]).astype(float) #Example two feature maps
pooled_gradients_example = np.array([0.5, -0.8]).reshape((2,1,1)).astype(float) #Positive and negative weights

gradcam_heatmap = conceptual_gradcam_heatmap(feature_maps_example, pooled_gradients_example)
print("Example 3: Conceptual GradCAM Heatmap: \n", gradcam_heatmap)
```

This third example demonstrates how negative pooled gradients influence the conceptual gradcam heatmap generation. The example results in several negative locations that might be considered as ‘unimportant areas’ by a human eye.

In my experience working on various image classification and object detection tasks, I have consistently observed that these negative gradients are not anomalies. They are expected behavior, particularly in networks utilizing ReLU. They show regions where the model is actively diminishing feature activation to reach a decision. It’s crucial to analyze these values within the context of overall heatmap, not individually. A negative value in a heat map doesn't mean that part of the image is unimportant. It means that activation of features in this area negatively correlate with the class output score, the model actively suppresses them.

For deeper understanding of convolutional network behaviour, I strongly recommend consulting textbooks covering deep learning fundamentals, paying particular attention to backpropagation and activation functions, especially ReLU. Material focusing on interpretability techniques like GradCAM is also beneficial. Furthermore, practical implementations within deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow will offer insights into the actual computation of gradients within a complex network, including their implications on heatmap generation. Investigating the mathematical background of backpropagation using calculus textbooks or tutorials can also help further enhance one's understanding.
