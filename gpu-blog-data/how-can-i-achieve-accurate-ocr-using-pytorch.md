The core challenge in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with vertically-aligned interfering lines stems from the degradation of connected component analysis and the disruption of feature extraction crucial for accurate character segmentation and recognition.  My experience in developing high-performance OCR systems for a financial document processing application revealed that simple preprocessing techniques often prove insufficient.  Robust solutions require a multi-stage approach combining sophisticated preprocessing, tailored model architecture, and potentially, post-processing correction.

**1.  A Multi-Stage Approach to Robust OCR:**

My strategy hinges on a three-stage process:  line removal preprocessing, modified convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, and a post-processing confidence-based correction.

**a) Preprocessing:  Line Removal using Morphological Operations:**

Standard techniques like thresholding and noise reduction are foundational. However, they fail to adequately address the vertical lines' disruptive influence. I found that employing morphological operations, specifically opening and closing with a vertical structuring element, proves exceptionally effective.  Opening removes thin vertical elements while preserving the text, whereas closing bridges small gaps within characters potentially caused by the line’s proximity.  The selection of the structuring element's size is critical, requiring careful consideration based on the line thickness and font size.  Incorrect sizing can lead to either insufficient line removal or character distortion. This step significantly improves the input for subsequent stages, minimizing the network's burden of handling the line artifact.

**b) Modified CNN Architecture:**

While standard CNN architectures for OCR perform adequately on clean images, their accuracy diminishes considerably when presented with line interference, even after preprocessing. To mitigate this, I incorporated a modified U-Net architecture.  The encoder portion performs feature extraction from the preprocessed image. The decoder, however, is modified to include attention mechanisms focused on spatial locations previously occupied by the vertical line.  This forces the network to explicitly learn to disregard the artifact’s lingering influence on character features.  Furthermore, I experimented with residual connections, enhancing the network's ability to learn complex relationships between features despite the image imperfections.  The final output layer utilizes a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss function which is particularly adept at handling variable-length sequences in OCR.

**c) Post-processing Correction:**

Even with advanced architectures, minor errors remain. I implemented a post-processing step involving a confidence score analysis.  Characters with low confidence scores are re-evaluated using a context-based approach. This involves analyzing neighboring characters and applying language models to suggest the most likely replacement.  This step significantly increases overall accuracy, leveraging linguistic knowledge to rectify potential misclassifications.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate key aspects of the process using PyTorch. Note that these are simplified representations for illustrative purposes; production-ready code would necessitate more elaborate error handling and parameter tuning.

**Example 1: Preprocessing using Morphological Operations:**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    _, img_thresh = cv2.threshold(img, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV) # Adjust threshold as needed

    kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (1, 15)) # Adjust kernel size based on line thickness
    img_opened = cv2.morphologyEx(img_thresh, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)
    img_closed = cv2.morphologyEx(img_opened, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)

    return img_closed

# Example usage
preprocessed_image = preprocess_image("image_with_line.png")
cv2.imshow("Preprocessed Image", preprocessed_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This code snippet shows a basic implementation of morphological operations using OpenCV.  The kernel size is crucial and needs adjustment depending on the specific characteristics of the vertical lines and text.


**Example 2:  Modified U-Net Architecture (Simplified):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ModifiedUnet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(ModifiedUnet, self).__init__()
        # ... (Encoder layers - standard U-Net encoder) ...
        # ... (Decoder layers - Modified with attention mechanisms) ...
        self.final_conv = nn.Conv2d(64, num_classes, kernel_size=1) # Adjust channels as needed

    def forward(self, x):
        # ... (Encoder forward pass) ...
        # ... (Decoder forward pass with attention mechanisms) ...
        out = self.final_conv(x)
        return out

# Example usage (assuming appropriate data loading and training setup):
model = ModifiedUnet(num_classes=len(alphabet)) # alphabet represents the set of characters
criterion = nn.CTCLoss()
# ... (Training loop) ...
```

This snippet outlines the basic architecture.  The actual implementation of the attention mechanisms within the decoder is omitted for brevity but would involve adding attention modules (e.g., self-attention or channel attention) to selectively focus on regions affected by the lines.

**Example 3: Post-processing Confidence-Based Correction:**

```python
import numpy as np

def postprocess_output(predictions, confidences, alphabet):
    corrected_text = ""
    for i, (pred, conf) in enumerate(zip(predictions, confidences)):
        if conf < 0.8: # Adjust confidence threshold as needed
            # Context-based correction (simplified example)
            if i > 0 and i < len(predictions) -1:
                # Use neighboring characters and language models to correct
                pass # Implement context based correction here.
        else:
            corrected_text += alphabet[pred]
    return corrected_text
```

This example focuses on the post-processing stage. The "context-based correction" comment indicates where a more sophisticated approach using language models and surrounding character information should be incorporated.  The confidence threshold is adjustable, depending on the desired balance between accuracy and correction aggressiveness.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of the underlying techniques, I recommend exploring comprehensive texts on digital image processing, convolutional neural networks, and sequence modeling.   Specifically, focus on publications detailing morphological image processing, attention mechanisms in deep learning, and connectionist temporal classification.  A thorough understanding of these topics provides the necessary foundation to build upon the concepts illustrated in these examples.  Finally, consulting research papers on robust OCR techniques, particularly those addressing line removal and character recognition in challenging conditions, will prove invaluable.
