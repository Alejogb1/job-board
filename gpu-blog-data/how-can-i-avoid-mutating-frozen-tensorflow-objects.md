TensorFlow, especially when used within the confines of a Bazel build system, presents unique challenges in maintaining the immutability of objects, particularly when those objects are integral to the computational graph or are being serialized for efficient inter-process communication. Mutation of frozen TensorFlow objects often manifests as unpredictable behavior, graph inconsistencies, and errors during training or inference pipelines. My experience within large-scale model development projects has shown that careful adherence to TensorFlow’s object management principles and explicit handling of Bazel’s build context are paramount to circumvent these issues.

The core problem stems from the dual nature of TensorFlow objects. Some, such as `tf.Tensor` instances or `tf.Variable` instances after the graph is finalized, are intended to be immutable representations of data flow or model parameters. However, they exist within a Python environment which, by default, favors mutable objects. This creates potential for accidental modification during the build or runtime. Bazel, in its pursuit of deterministic builds, further complicates the situation as object serialization and deserialization during the build process can unknowingly expose non-frozen instances leading to mutation.

Avoiding these mutations necessitates a multi-pronged approach focused on both TensorFlow practices and Bazel build setup. I will delve into strategies I have found effective based on real-world projects. Firstly, never directly modify the output of TensorFlow graph construction functions once they have been generated. This means avoiding operations such as assignments directly to `tf.Variable` instances after graph definition, or applying destructive operations on tensors after they are used as input to other operations. Treat these objects as read-only; any change to the state of the graph should happen through construction of new operations and new tensors. Secondly, carefully structure Bazel rules to avoid passing unfrozen TensorFlow objects across different targets or build actions. This often includes serializing and deserializing objects using TensorFlow’s built-in mechanisms, ensuring that new copies are created from the serialized representations and any mutation occurs only within the scope of a specific process. Lastly, if using more dynamic features of the TensorFlow API, always copy values rather than passing references, ensuring immutability.

Let’s look at some specific examples. Consider a scenario where we construct a simple model using a shared embedding layer and a feed-forward network. The goal is to build this model within a Bazel context for later export.

```python
# example_model.py
import tensorflow as tf

def build_embedding_layer(vocab_size, embedding_dim):
    embedding = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([vocab_size, embedding_dim]), name="embedding")
    return embedding

def build_feedforward_network(input_tensor, hidden_units):
    dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(hidden_units, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
    output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(dense1)
    return output

def build_model(vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_units):
    embedding = build_embedding_layer(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
    inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(1,))
    embedded_inputs = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embedding, inputs)
    model_output = build_feedforward_network(embedded_inputs, hidden_units)
    return tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=model_output)
```

This code defines the core architecture of the model. While it appears correct, the important thing is *how* this is incorporated into a larger Bazel build process. A mistake I often saw was to import this `build_model` function into the Bazel build files and execute it directly, leading to mutations when build actions reused the same objects. This was often revealed through seemingly random issues in the outputs of build targets.

The solution requires a strategy of *encapsulation*. We need to ensure that the model creation process is separate from any Bazel build action that depends on the model itself. Instead of directly using the `build_model` in bazel, we write a thin script that creates and saves the model to disk:

```python
# export_model.py
import tensorflow as tf
import example_model
import argparse
import os

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--output_dir", type=str, required=True)
    args = parser.parse_args()

    model = example_model.build_model(vocab_size=1000, embedding_dim=64, hidden_units=128)
    tf.saved_model.save(model, os.path.join(args.output_dir, "saved_model"))
```

This `export_model.py` script ensures that the model is constructed within its own execution context and the exported saved model representation is what is exposed to the wider Bazel build system. Crucially, `tf.saved_model.save` serializes the model parameters and graph structure ensuring no further mutations will occur unless we load and modify the graph using tools specifically designed to do that.

Here’s how this could be reflected in a Bazel BUILD file:

```python
# BUILD
load("@rules_python//python:defs.bzl", "py_binary")

py_binary(
    name = "export_my_model",
    srcs = ["export_model.py"],
    deps = [":example_model"],
    args = [
      "--output_dir",
      "$(location model_output)",
      ],
    data = [":example_model"],
)

py_library(
  name = "example_model",
  srcs = ["example_model.py"],
)

filegroup(
    name = "model_output",
    srcs = [],
)
```

Here the `py_binary` target, `export_my_model`, executes the model building and export script, passing the required output path via the command-line argument and importantly ensuring the model building happens in a single execution context. The resulting `model_output` is a `filegroup` which could be consumed by other Bazel targets which might load the model for evaluation or inference.

The second critical point involves situations where data used in the model is itself generated or transformed by build actions. Consider an example where a vocabulary file, essential for text processing, needs to be generated in the build process itself. In such a case we need to be extremely careful about how we use the generated vocabulary in the model building process itself. It should not be done in a way that allows accidental mutations. Here's a naive (incorrect) example of how one might attempt this:

```python
# vocab_generator.py
import random
import string
import argparse
import os

def generate_vocab(size):
    vocab = [''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase) for _ in range(5)) for _ in range(size)]
    return vocab

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--output_file", type=str, required=True)
    parser.add_argument("--vocab_size", type=int, required=True)
    args = parser.parse_args()

    vocab = generate_vocab(args.vocab_size)
    with open(args.output_file, "w") as f:
        for v in vocab:
            f.write(v + "\n")

# incorrect_model_builder.py (DO NOT USE THIS APPROACH)
import tensorflow as tf
import argparse

if __name__ == "__main__":
  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
  parser.add_argument("--vocab_file", type=str, required=True)
  args = parser.parse_args()

  with open(args.vocab_file, "r") as f:
    vocab = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines()]

  # Assume some function that turns vocab to lookup table.
  # This would often modify some underlying object. (for example
  # an embedding tensor. This is bad
  lookup_table_obj = create_lookup_table(vocab) # This will use the vocab data
  # Build rest of the graph from lookup_table_obj.
  model = build_model_with_table(lookup_table_obj) # DO NOT MUTATE lookup_table_obj here.
  # Model is saved.
```

Here the issue arises if `create_lookup_table` or anything within `build_model_with_table` mutates the object or any underlying resources. It should not be happening, but could occur without rigorous code inspection. Instead of directly passing the vocab object, we can serialize it and treat it as an immutable configuration to pass to the graph. I've found this to be a common pattern. The corrected model builder might look like this:

```python
# corrected_model_builder.py
import tensorflow as tf
import argparse
import os
import json

if __name__ == "__main__":
  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
  parser.add_argument("--vocab_file", type=str, required=True)
  parser.add_argument("--output_path", type=str, required=True)
  args = parser.parse_args()

  with open(args.vocab_file, "r") as f:
      vocab = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines()]

  # Serialize the vocab to a JSON file for safer transport
  with open(os.path.join(args.output_path, "vocab.json"), "w") as outfile:
    json.dump(vocab, outfile)

  # When building the model, reload from JSON.
  # This will have the effect of passing a copy.
  with open(os.path.join(args.output_path, "vocab.json"), "r") as infile:
    loaded_vocab = json.load(infile)

  lookup_table_obj = create_lookup_table(loaded_vocab)
  model = build_model_with_table(lookup_table_obj)

  tf.saved_model.save(model, os.path.join(args.output_path,"saved_model"))
```

The corresponding Bazel BUILD file would look similar to the earlier example, utilizing `py_binary` for both the vocabulary generation and the model export.

These strategies require meticulous attention to detail in both the code and the build configuration. Some recommendations to further investigate include reading the TensorFlow API documentation thoroughly, paying special attention to the lifecycle of `tf.Variable` and how they are managed by saved model. Studying best practices in serialized data handling and avoiding deep copying of TensorFlow objects unless absolutely required. There are also several papers covering the benefits of static graphs and the issues around dynamism that can provide additional background. For a more hands-on learning, consider looking at the test suites within the TensorFlow repository, which demonstrate best practices around object management and serialization. It may also be useful to investigate the use of TF Lite as this will force stricter handling of the model.
