Bash's `if/else` statement failures often stem from subtle issues in command execution, variable assignment, or a misunderstanding of how bash evaluates conditional expressions.  My experience troubleshooting numerous scripts over the years points to three common culprits: incorrect return code interpretation, improper string comparison, and neglecting the impact of whitespace.

**1. Return Code Misinterpretation:**

The core of bash's conditional logic relies on the return code of commands.  A command's exit status is an integer, conventionally 0 indicating success and non-zero signaling an error.  The `if` statement evaluates this return code.  Many novice programmers mistakenly assume that an output string implies success.  For example, a command might print "Success!" to standard output, yet return a non-zero exit status, indicating an internal failure.

A frequent error is checking the output of a command rather than its exit status.  Consider this erroneous example:

```bash
# Incorrect: Checks output, not return code
command_output=$(my_command)
if [[ "$command_output" == "Success!" ]]; then
  echo "Command successful"
else
  echo "Command failed"
fi
```

This code is flawed because `[[ ]]` only examines the string value. Even if `my_command` failed (returning a non-zero exit code), the condition might still be true if it happens to print "Success!".  The correct approach checks the return code directly:

```bash
# Correct: Checks the command's return code
my_command
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
  echo "Command successful"
else
  echo "Command failed"
fi
```

Here, `$?` accesses the exit status of the previously executed command (`my_command`).  This is crucial for reliable conditional logic.  Remember, always prioritize checking `$?` when evaluating a command's success or failure within an `if/else` block.  My work on a large-scale system administration script highlighted the importance of this: a seemingly successful command was silently failing, causing cascading problems, and the problem was pinpointed only after focusing on the return code rather than visual output.


**2. String Comparison Errors:**

String comparison within `[[ ]]` requires careful attention to quoting and word splitting.  An unquoted variable might undergo word splitting, leading to unexpected results.  Furthermore, the `==` operator performs pattern matching, not strict equality.  For literal string comparison, use the `=~` operator with a regular expression (ensure it only matches the exact string) or the `==` operator with strict quoting.

Here's an example illustrating an error in string comparison:

```bash
# Incorrect:  Unquoted variable, susceptible to word splitting and pattern matching.
my_variable="value with spaces"
if [[ $my_variable == "value with spaces" ]]; then
  echo "Match found"
else
  echo "No match"
fi
```

If `my_variable` contains multiple words, this code will likely fail because of word splitting.  This happened to me while working on a script that processed filenames, resulting in unpredictable behavior depending on the filename.  The correct implementation is to use proper quoting:

```bash
# Correct:  Uses proper quoting for exact string matching
my_variable="value with spaces"
if [[ "$my_variable" == "value with spaces" ]]; then
  echo "Match found"
else
  echo "No match"
fi
```

Alternatively, using `=~` with a regular expression anchored to the start and end of the string achieves the same exact match:

```bash
# Correct: Using =~ with an anchored regular expression
my_variable="value with spaces"
if [[ "$my_variable" =~ ^value with spaces$ ]]; then
  echo "Match found"
else
  echo "No match"
fi
```

The use of regular expressions is powerful, but overusing them without precise anchor points may also introduce unexpected behaviour.  Sticking to proper quoting in simple cases is often safer.


**3. Whitespace Sensitivity:**

Bash is sensitive to whitespace, especially around operators and keywords. An extra space or missing space can alter the script's behavior. This often manifests in `if/else` statements as syntax errors or illogical comparisons.  The location of the `then` and `else` keywords relative to the brackets is crucial, and a misplacement can lead to parsing errors that are difficult to identify.

An example of a whitespace-related error:

```bash
# Incorrect: Incorrect spacing around `then`
if [[ "$variable" == "value" ]] then
  echo "Incorrect spacing"
fi
```

This lacks the mandatory space after `]]` before `then`. The correct format is:

```bash
# Correct:  Correct spacing around `then`
if [[ "$variable" == "value" ]]; then
  echo "Correct spacing"
fi
```

Similarly, neglecting the required spacing around `else` and `fi` would also cause a failure. Such subtle errors have been the cause of many frustrating debugging sessions for me, and itâ€™s something that often requires a careful review of each line to find.


In conclusion, mastering bash's `if/else` constructs necessitates a deep understanding of command return codes, proper string comparison techniques, and strict adherence to whitespace rules. By paying attention to these details, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of encountering unexpected behavior.
