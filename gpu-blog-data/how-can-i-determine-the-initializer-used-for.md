Determining the initializer used for a Keras/TensorFlow model variable requires a nuanced understanding of the framework's internal workings and variable management.  My experience debugging complex, production-level models has highlighted the importance of carefully tracing variable creation to ascertain the initialization strategy employed.  Simply inspecting the model's summary won't suffice; a more direct approach is necessary.  The key lies in accessing the variable's attributes directly.

**1. Explanation:**

Keras, built upon TensorFlow, abstracts away much of the low-level variable management.  However, the initialization strategy—the method by which a variable's initial values are assigned—is a crucial aspect of model behavior and performance.  Different initializers, such as `glorot_uniform`, `truncated_normal`, or `zeros`, lead to varying convergence properties and potentially impact the model's ability to learn effectively.  While Keras provides high-level methods for defining layers and their associated variables, the underlying TensorFlow variables retain information about their initialization.  Therefore, to determine the initializer, we must access the underlying TensorFlow `Variable` object associated with each Keras layer's weights or biases.

This access is achieved through the layer's `kernel` (for weights) and `bias` (for biases) attributes, which are TensorFlow variables. Each TensorFlow variable possesses an attribute called `initializer`, holding a reference to the initializer object used during its creation.  This object, in turn, contains information defining the initialization scheme (e.g., distribution, mean, standard deviation).  Inspecting the initializer's attributes allows one to definitively identify the used method.

One crucial point to note:  custom layers or models might not directly expose the initializer in the same manner.  In such cases, tracing the variable creation within the custom layer's `build` method becomes necessary.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Dense Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,))
])

# Access the initializer for the kernel (weights) of the first layer
initializer_kernel = model.layers[0].kernel.initializer

# Print the type of initializer
print(f"Kernel Initializer Type: {type(initializer_kernel)}")

# Extract and print initializer parameters if applicable (varies by initializer)
if hasattr(initializer_kernel, 'gain'):
    print(f"Kernel Initializer Gain: {initializer_kernel.gain}")  #Example attribute

# Access the initializer for the bias of the first layer
initializer_bias = model.layers[0].bias.initializer

# Print the type of initializer
print(f"Bias Initializer Type: {type(initializer_bias)}")
```

This example demonstrates the straightforward approach for a standard Keras layer.  We directly access the `kernel` and `bias` attributes and examine their `initializer` attribute to determine the initialization method. The conditional check handles the case of initializers having specific attributes.


**Example 2:  Custom Layer with Explicit Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, initializer='glorot_uniform', **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.initializer = keras.initializers.get(initializer)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer=self.initializer,
                                  trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                  initializer='zeros',
                                  trainable=True)
        super().build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b

model = keras.Sequential([MyCustomLayer(10, input_shape=(5,))])

# Access initializer directly from the layer's weight and bias attributes
print(f"Weight Initializer: {model.layers[0].w.initializer}")
print(f"Bias Initializer: {model.layers[0].b.initializer}")
```

This illustrates how to handle a custom layer. The initializer is explicitly set within the `build` method, and we access it similarly to the previous example.  Note the use of `keras.initializers.get()` for flexible initializer specification.


**Example 3:  Layer with a custom initializer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyInitializer(tf.keras.initializers.Initializer):
    def __call__(self, shape, dtype=None):
        return tf.random.normal(shape, mean=1.0, stddev=0.5, dtype=dtype)

my_initializer = MyInitializer()

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,), kernel_initializer=my_initializer)
])

print(f"Kernel Initializer: {model.layers[0].kernel.initializer}")
```

This example leverages a custom initializer class, demonstrating the flexibility of Keras in handling custom initialization procedures. Note how even this user defined initializer is still accessible through the layer’s variable attributes.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on variable creation and initialization.  The Keras documentation offers valuable insights into layer construction and customization.  Furthermore, reviewing relevant sections of a textbook on deep learning principles and TensorFlow/Keras will solidify the understanding of variable initialization and its impact on model training.  Finally, studying the source code of various Keras layers (available on GitHub) can provide a deeper understanding of how initializers are utilized in practical implementations.
