The efficacy of a multi-output Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) often hinges on a correctly structured data pipeline, especially when working with manually curated datasets represented as dictionaries. I’ve navigated the challenges of this type of setup across several projects, ranging from medical image segmentation with varied label types to multimodal sensor data analysis where each modality has a different output interpretation. The core task here is to ensure that the data loading process within PyTorch aligns perfectly with the desired multi-output architecture. It's not merely about creating the model; it's about efficiently feeding it the appropriately formatted data.

The primary issue stems from PyTorch's reliance on datasets that yield tensors directly. When you're dealing with dictionaries, you're typically storing not just the input data (e.g., an image) but also multiple outputs, potentially with varying dimensions, data types, or semantic meanings. This necessitates a custom data loader implementation that can: (1) extract the input and corresponding outputs from the dictionary; (2) convert these elements into tensors suitable for neural network processing; and (3) collate the data into batches while handling the various output formats.

Here’s how you would construct such a system. Firstly, you'll define a custom `torch.utils.data.Dataset` subclass. This class will handle the retrieval of items from the training and testing dictionaries. Consider a structure where each key in your dictionary corresponds to a unique sample, and the associated value is a dictionary containing the input data and all output targets.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import numpy as np

class MultiOutputDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data_dict, transform=None):
        self.data_dict = list(data_dict.items())  # Convert dictionary to list of (key, value) tuples
        self.transform = transform

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data_dict)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        key, sample = self.data_dict[idx]
        image = sample['image']  # Assume 'image' contains the input data (numpy array or similar)
        output1 = sample['output1'] # output data 1
        output2 = sample['output2']  # output data 2
        
        if self.transform:
             image = self.transform(image)

        # Convert numpy arrays or similar to torch tensors
        image = torch.tensor(image, dtype=torch.float32)
        output1 = torch.tensor(output1, dtype=torch.long) # Example of integer output, adjust dtype as necessary
        output2 = torch.tensor(output2, dtype=torch.float32) # Example of float output, adjust dtype as necessary

        return image, output1, output2
```

In this initial stage, we are focusing on providing a structure for data access. The `__init__` method accepts the data dictionary, turning it into a list of tuples for easier indexing. The `__len__` method reports the number of samples in the dataset. Crucially, the `__getitem__` method is where the data is actually loaded and converted into PyTorch tensors. This snippet assumes that the 'image' is some kind of array and the output1 and output2 are already in a suitable state to be represented by the indicated dtypes. We can see the need for multiple outputs which will be targeted by the CNN model.

Next, we'll define a simple CNN model with multiple output heads to match our dataset structure. I am choosing a convolutional model for demonstrating a typical use case, however these concepts translate to other deep learning models.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class MultiOutputCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes_output1, num_classes_output2): # output dimensionalities
        super(MultiOutputCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)  # Assume input has 3 channels
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 8 * 8, 128) # hardcoded for example only - this would require calculating dimensions manually
        self.fc_output1 = nn.Linear(128, num_classes_output1)
        self.fc_output2 = nn.Linear(128, num_classes_output2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 32 * 8 * 8)  # Flatten the tensor
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        output1 = self.fc_output1(x)
        output2 = self.fc_output2(x)
        return output1, output2
```

This model consists of convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers, ultimately producing two separate outputs. The crucial element is the final two `nn.Linear` layers, which generate outputs matching the size of our output1 and output2 labels. The `forward` method then returns a tuple containing both outputs for use during training and testing. The architecture here is illustrative and serves as a functional example; the actual architecture should reflect the problem requirements.

The final piece of this system is the training procedure. This will require the creation of a data loader that utilises the custom dataset class. We also need an optimizer and criterion for the training loop.

```python
import torch.optim as optim

# Example dictionary data, can be replaced with real data
train_data_dict = {
    'sample1': {'image': np.random.rand(3, 32, 32), 'output1': 1, 'output2': np.array([0.5, 0.8])},
    'sample2': {'image': np.random.rand(3, 32, 32), 'output1': 0, 'output2': np.array([0.2, 0.1])},
    'sample3': {'image': np.random.rand(3, 32, 32), 'output1': 2, 'output2': np.array([0.9, 0.3])}
}
test_data_dict = {
    'sample4': {'image': np.random.rand(3, 32, 32), 'output1': 0, 'output2': np.array([0.4, 0.6])},
    'sample5': {'image': np.random.rand(3, 32, 32), 'output1': 1, 'output2': np.array([0.7, 0.2])}
}


# Parameters
num_classes_output1 = 3 # Number of classes for output1
num_classes_output2 = 2 # output dimensionality for output2
batch_size = 2
learning_rate = 0.001
epochs = 10

# Create datasets and dataloaders
train_dataset = MultiOutputDataset(train_data_dict)
test_dataset = MultiOutputDataset(test_data_dict)
train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
test_dataloader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)


# Initialize model, loss functions, and optimizer
model = MultiOutputCNN(num_classes_output1, num_classes_output2)
criterion_output1 = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() # or whatever is appropriate for output1
criterion_output2 = nn.MSELoss() # or whatever is appropriate for output2
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)


# Training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for images, output1_labels, output2_labels in train_dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        output1_predictions, output2_predictions = model(images)
        loss_output1 = criterion_output1(output1_predictions, output1_labels)
        loss_output2 = criterion_output2(output2_predictions, output2_labels)
        loss = loss_output1 + loss_output2  # Combine the losses

        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    print(f"Epoch: {epoch + 1}, Training Loss: {loss.item()}")


# Testing loop (illustrative only)
with torch.no_grad():
    for images, output1_labels, output2_labels in test_dataloader:
      output1_predictions, output2_predictions = model(images)
      loss_output1 = criterion_output1(output1_predictions, output1_labels)
      loss_output2 = criterion_output2(output2_predictions, output2_labels)
      loss = loss_output1 + loss_output2  # Combine the losses

      print(f"Testing Loss: {loss.item()}")
```
The training loop calculates the loss from both output branches, combines these losses, and then backpropagates to update the model's parameters. The choice of loss functions here is specific to the types of outputs we have defined. For instance, if output1 represents classification, `CrossEntropyLoss` is suitable. If output2 is for regression, then `MSELoss` might be appropriate. The data loader is instantiated with the custom `MultiOutputDataset`. During training we iterate through the data loader which, due to our `__getitem__`, unpacks the batched samples into image data, output1 labels and output2 labels.

This structure emphasizes the modularity and clarity required when handling datasets that are not immediately compatible with PyTorch’s pre-defined data loading infrastructure. The `MultiOutputDataset` acts as a bridge, transforming the dictionary structure into tensors compatible with the CNN and subsequently, the training and testing routines.

For further study, consult resources detailing PyTorch's `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes. Examine advanced data augmentation strategies, and be sure to delve into the nuances of loss functions suitable for diverse types of regression and classification tasks. Understanding how to tune hyperparameters and implement early stopping is important for stable and reliable training. Finally, experiment with techniques that incorporate more sophisticated model architectures as your needs evolve.
