The most frequent cause of a non-executing CUDA kernel, in my experience spanning over a decade of high-performance computing development, is a mismatch between the host-side and device-side code, manifesting primarily in incorrect memory allocation, data transfer, or kernel launch parameters.  This often leads to seemingly innocuous runtime errors that are difficult to debug without a methodical approach.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Successful CUDA kernel execution requires a precisely orchestrated sequence of operations.  First, the necessary data must be allocated on the GPU's memory space.  This allocation uses CUDA's `cudaMalloc` function and must be matched in size and type to the variables used within the kernel. Following allocation, host-side data needs to be transferred to the GPU's memory using `cudaMemcpy`.  This transfer specifies the source, destination, size, and a direction (host-to-device or device-to-host).  Crucially, the memory transfer must complete successfully before the kernel is launched.

Kernel launch itself utilizes the `<<<...>>>` syntax, specifying the grid and block dimensions. Incorrect specification of these dimensions can lead to underutilization or, in some cases, complete failure of execution. The kernel function must adhere to specific CUDA programming conventions, including proper usage of shared memory and synchronization primitives if necessary.  Finally, the results, if any, need to be copied back from the device to the host using `cudaMemcpy` with the appropriate direction.  Each step is critical, and failure in any of these steps leads to the kernel not executing correctly or at all.  Common errors include forgetting to check for errors after every CUDA API call, neglecting to synchronize streams, using incorrect memory access patterns, and overlooking the limitations of the GPU's hardware.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Memory Allocation and Transfer**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void addKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    int *h_a, *h_b, *h_c;
    int *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

    // INCORRECT ALLOCATION:  Forgot to check return values
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, n * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, n * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, n*sizeof(int)); //This line needs to check for cudaError_t


    h_a = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    h_b = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    h_c = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        h_a[i] = i;
        h_b[i] = i * 2;
    }

    // INCORRECT COPY:  Missing error check
    cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    addKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);


    //CORRECT COPY WITH ERROR CHECKING:
    cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    }

    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);
    free(h_a);
    free(h_b);
    free(h_c);

    return 0;
}
```
This example showcases the critical importance of checking the return values of every CUDA API call.  The corrected version demonstrates how to properly handle potential errors.  The original code lacks error checking, thus hiding potential problems during memory allocation and transfer.


**Example 2: Incorrect Kernel Launch Parameters**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void vecAdd(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1024 * 1024;
    float *h_a, *h_b, *h_c;
    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

    // Correct allocations and copies (error checking omitted for brevity)
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, n * sizeof(float));

    h_a = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    h_b = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    h_c = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // ... initialization of h_a and h_b ...

    cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    //INCORRECT LAUNCH PARAMETERS:  Too few blocks
    vecAdd<<<1, 256>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n); // Only one block launched. Need more.

    cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // ...  free memory ...

    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a common error: incorrect kernel launch parameters. Launching with only one block when a much larger grid is required results in only a fraction of the data being processed.  The corrected launch parameters would require calculating the appropriate number of blocks to cover the entire input array.


**Example 3:  Improper Memory Access**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void badAccess(int *arr, int n) {
    int i = threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        arr[i + n] = i; // Accessing beyond allocated memory
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    int *h_arr, *d_arr;

    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_arr, n * sizeof(int));
    h_arr = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

    badAccess<<<1, n>>>(d_arr, n); //Attempt to access outside allocated range

    cudaFree(d_arr);
    free(h_arr);
    return 0;
}
```

This example showcases out-of-bounds memory access.  Attempting to write beyond the allocated memory region of `d_arr` leads to undefined behavior, likely a crash or silently incorrect results.  Proper indexing within the kernel is vital to prevent such errors.  In this specific instance, the kernel attempts to write to memory locations it does not have access to.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA Programming Guide, the CUDA Best Practices Guide, and a comprehensive textbook on parallel computing with a focus on CUDA are recommended resources for advanced problem-solving.  Understanding asynchronous operations, memory management strategies, and error handling is crucial for effective CUDA programming.  Furthermore, using a CUDA debugger is invaluable for identifying the exact location of runtime errors.  Finally, proficient use of performance analysis tools can aid in optimizing kernel performance and identifying memory bottlenecks.
