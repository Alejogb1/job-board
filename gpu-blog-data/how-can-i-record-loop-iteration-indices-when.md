The inherent challenge in tracking iteration indices within `arrayfun` when operating on GPU arrays in MATLAB stems from the parallel nature of the execution.  `arrayfun` inherently distributes the function application across multiple threads, eliminating the straightforward sequential index tracking available with standard for loops.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects involving large-scale simulations highlighted this limitation early on.  Efficiently capturing this information requires a different approach leveraging MATLAB's parallel processing capabilities and understanding how data is handled on the GPU.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The lack of a direct, built-in mechanism to retrieve iteration indices inside `arrayfun` applied to GPU arrays necessitates a workaround involving pre-generation of index information and its subsequent incorporation within the function handle.  This involves creating an array of indices that mirrors the dimensions of the input GPU array.  This index array is then passed alongside the input array to the function handle within `arrayfun`.  The function handle then uses this index array to determine the current iterationâ€™s index.

The fundamental principle rests on the understanding that `arrayfun` applies the function element-wise. By providing the index as an additional argument to the function, we effectively give each element a unique identifier reflecting its position within the original array.  The parallel execution model remains intact; each thread independently accesses the corresponding index and input element without requiring inter-thread communication or synchronization for index management.

Critical to success is ensuring data transfer between the CPU and GPU is optimized.  Inefficient data transfers can negate the performance gains associated with GPU processing.  Therefore, transferring only the necessary index data (a relatively small array compared to the potentially large input array) minimizes the overhead.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Index Recording**

```matlab
% Create a sample GPU array
gpuArray_A = gpuArray(rand(1000,1));

% Generate index array on the CPU
indexArray = (1:length(gpuArray_A))';

%Transfer the index array to the GPU
gpuIndexArray = gpuArray(indexArray);

% Function handle incorporating index
myFunc = @(x,idx) [x, idx];  % Concatenates the element and its index

% Apply arrayfun
results = arrayfun(myFunc, gpuArray_A, gpuIndexArray, 'UniformOutput',false);

% Gather results back to CPU
results_cpu = gather(results);

% Accessing the indices:
indices = cellfun(@(x) x(2), results_cpu);

% Accessing the original data:
data = cellfun(@(x) x(1), results_cpu);
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental principle. The `myFunc` handles both the data element (`x`) and its corresponding index (`idx`). The `'UniformOutput',false` option is crucial because the output will be an array of cells, each containing the original data and its index.  The `gather` function retrieves the results from the GPU back to the CPU.  Finally, `cellfun` extracts the indices and original data into separate arrays.

**Example 2:  Index Handling with Multiple Dimensions**

```matlab
% 2D GPU array
gpuArray_B = gpuArray(rand(100,50));

% Generate 2D index array
[rows, cols] = size(gpuArray_B);
[rowIdx, colIdx] = ndgrid(1:rows, 1:cols);
gpuRowIdx = gpuArray(rowIdx);
gpuColIdx = gpuArray(colIdx);

% Function handle for 2D indices
my2Dfunc = @(x,r,c) [x, r, c];

% Applying arrayfun
results2D = arrayfun(my2Dfunc, gpuArray_B, gpuRowIdx, gpuColIdx, 'UniformOutput', false);

% Gathering and extracting information on CPU:
results2D_cpu = gather(results2D);
data2D = cellfun(@(x) x(1), results2D_cpu);
rowIndices2D = cellfun(@(x) x(2), results2D_cpu);
colIndices2D = cellfun(@(x) x(3), results2D_cpu);
```

This example extends the concept to a two-dimensional array. `ndgrid` efficiently generates the row and column indices.  The function handle `my2Dfunc` now accepts three inputs: the data element and its row and column indices. The subsequent extraction from the cell array follows the same logic as in Example 1.

**Example 3:  Conditional Logic with Indices**

```matlab
% GPU array
gpuArray_C = gpuArray(rand(500,1));

% Index array
gpuIndexArray_C = gpuArray(1:length(gpuArray_C))';

% Function with conditional logic based on index
myConditionalFunc = @(x,idx) (idx > 250) * x;  %Applies operation only when index is >250

% Applying arrayfun
resultsConditional = arrayfun(myConditionalFunc, gpuArray_C, gpuIndexArray_C);

% Gathering the results
resultsConditional_cpu = gather(resultsConditional);
```

This example demonstrates incorporating conditional logic using the index.  Only elements with indices greater than 250 undergo the operation. This illustrates the flexibility of using indices within the `arrayfun` function handle for controlled processing. The 'UniformOutput' option is omitted here as the output is a numeric array, hence uniform.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of MATLAB's parallel computing toolbox and GPU programming, I recommend consulting the official MATLAB documentation.  Explore the sections covering parallel computing, GPU arrays, and the `arrayfun` function's detailed specifications, particularly concerning performance optimization strategies.  Furthermore, texts on high-performance computing and parallel algorithms are invaluable resources, providing broader context and advanced techniques for managing parallel computations effectively.   Reviewing examples and tutorials focused on GPU computing in MATLAB will provide practical insights and solidify understanding.  Finally, carefully examine examples within the MATLAB help files that illustrate the use of `arrayfun` and related functions in the context of GPU arrays.
