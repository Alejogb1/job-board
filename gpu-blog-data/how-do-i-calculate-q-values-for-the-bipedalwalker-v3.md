Q-values, central to reinforcement learning, represent the expected cumulative reward of taking a specific action in a given state, following a particular policy. In the context of the BipedalWalker-v3 environment, calculating these values is not a straightforward, deterministic process. Instead, we must train a model to approximate them, typically using algorithms like Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), rather than directly computing them via an exact analytical formula.

Let me elaborate. The BipedalWalker-v3 environment, as part of the OpenAI Gym suite, is a complex continuous control problem. It features a four-legged bipedal walker that must navigate across a terrain. The state space is continuous and composed of 24 dimensions representing joint angles, velocities, and other sensor information. Similarly, the action space is continuous, involving four dimensions that control the torques of the walker’s joints. Given this dimensionality, it's not practical to store a Q-value for every conceivable state-action pair. Tabular Q-learning, which would require such storage, is infeasible. Instead, we use function approximation.

I've worked on similar environments, and in my experience, the most successful approach involves using a neural network to approximate the Q-function. Specifically, a DQN typically takes a state representation as input and outputs a vector of Q-values, each corresponding to a possible action. In the continuous action space of BipedalWalker-v3, this vector does not map to the specific actions directly. Rather, we can choose actions using some policy derived from the Q-values, such as ε-greedy action selection, and then determine the actual action parameters using an approach like discretized actions. Alternatively, we might modify the architecture to output action parameters or introduce an actor-critic scheme for a direct action parameterization. The Q-values here become a basis for selecting which action parameters to explore.

Here’s an illustrative example using a simplified, DQN-style approximation. I will use the PyTorch library, which I find quite convenient for this type of task:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

# Define a simple Q-network
class QNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, hidden_size=64):
        super(QNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, action_size)

    def forward(self, state):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(state))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)

# Dummy data for demonstration
state_size = 24 # BipedalWalker-v3 state space size
action_size = 4 # Simplified to 4 discretized actions (not the actual continuous action space)
learning_rate = 0.001
discount_factor = 0.99

# Instantiate the network, optimizer, and loss function
q_net = QNetwork(state_size, action_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(q_net.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# Training loop (simplified)
num_episodes = 10
batch_size = 32

for episode in range(num_episodes):
    # Sample a batch of transitions
    states = torch.randn(batch_size, state_size)
    actions = torch.randint(0, action_size, (batch_size,))
    rewards = torch.randn(batch_size)
    next_states = torch.randn(batch_size, state_size)
    dones = torch.randint(0, 2, (batch_size,)).float()

    # Compute target Q-values (using the Bellman equation)
    with torch.no_grad():
      next_q_values = q_net(next_states)
      max_next_q_values, _ = torch.max(next_q_values, dim=1)
      target_q_values = rewards + discount_factor * max_next_q_values * (1 - dones)

    # Compute predicted Q-values
    predicted_q_values = q_net(states)
    predicted_q_values_at_actions = predicted_q_values.gather(1, actions.unsqueeze(1)).squeeze(1)

    # Compute loss
    loss = loss_fn(predicted_q_values_at_actions, target_q_values)

    # Backpropagate
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Episode: {episode}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

    # At this point q_net contains learned approximations of q values for the states
```

In this example, `QNetwork` represents the neural network approximating the Q-function. I've simplified the action space into a set of discrete actions to keep the code demonstrably clear. In the actual BipedalWalker-v3 environment, this simplification would not be sufficient for optimal control. The training loop iterates over simulated experiences and computes a loss based on the temporal difference error, derived from the Bellman equation. The `target_q_values` represent the bootstrapped estimates of Q-values for the current state, and are used to update network weights during backpropagation to refine approximation.

Let's explore how to adapt this for continuous action spaces using a variant of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, which is often used in complex control problems. Here, I'll focus on just the Q-network aspect:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np


class QNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, hidden_size=64):
        super(QNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size + action_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, state, action):
        x = torch.cat([state, action], dim=1)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)

state_size = 24  # State space size for BipedalWalker-v3
action_size = 4  # Action space size for BipedalWalker-v3
learning_rate = 0.001
discount_factor = 0.99

q_net = QNetwork(state_size, action_size)
optimizer = optim.Adam(q_net.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()


# Simplified training loop
num_episodes = 10
batch_size = 32


for episode in range(num_episodes):
    states = torch.randn(batch_size, state_size)
    actions = torch.randn(batch_size, action_size)
    rewards = torch.randn(batch_size)
    next_states = torch.randn(batch_size, state_size)
    next_actions = torch.randn(batch_size, action_size)
    dones = torch.randint(0, 2, (batch_size,)).float()

    with torch.no_grad():
        next_q_values = q_net(next_states, next_actions)
        target_q_values = rewards + discount_factor * next_q_values.squeeze(1) * (1 - dones)

    predicted_q_values = q_net(states, actions).squeeze(1)
    loss = loss_fn(predicted_q_values, target_q_values)

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Episode: {episode}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

```

This DDPG-style Q-network takes both the state and action as input and produces a single Q-value estimate. This allows us to directly handle continuous actions by using an actor network to determine the action parameters, which are then used as input to the Q-network. The target Q-values are updated using the output of the target Q-network in conjunction with target policy to estimate the next_action, using the target actor network.

As a final example, consider using a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) approach. This introduces an entropy term to encourage exploration and typically offers more stable learning. While the full implementation of SAC is complex, we can isolate the key changes in the Q-network.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, hidden_size=64):

        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, state, action):
        x = torch.cat([state, action], dim=1)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)


class PolicyNetwork(nn.Module): # Simplified policy network
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, hidden_size=64):
        super(PolicyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.mean_fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, action_size)
        self.log_std_fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, action_size)

    def forward(self, state):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(state))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        mean = self.mean_fc(x)
        log_std = self.log_std_fc(x)
        return mean, log_std

```
SAC typically employs two Q-networks and a policy network. The Q-values are updated based on the minimal q value outputted from these networks in a manner similar to DDPG. Additionally, a policy update is calculated based on the log probability of selected actions. The goal is to maximize both the policy rewards and the entropy of the policy.

To better understand these methods, I recommend studying resources that discuss reinforcement learning and, in particular, the following topics. For the theoretical foundation, search for materials on dynamic programming, the Bellman equation, and Markov Decision Processes. For practical implementation, resources covering DQN, DDPG, and SAC algorithms are quite useful. Textbooks and lecture series on deep learning frequently delve into these algorithms. Also, exploring articles that discuss the subtleties of handling continuous action spaces in reinforcement learning will provide valuable context. The OpenAI Spinning Up website offers a strong starting point, though its documentation and code snippets might be more suitable after gaining some foundational knowledge on the related topics.
