Selecting elements in NumPy and PyTorch arrays based on indices along a specific dimension involves leveraging advanced indexing capabilities.  My experience working on large-scale scientific simulations, particularly those involving tensor manipulations for geophysical modeling, has highlighted the critical role of this technique in performance optimization and data extraction.  Misunderstanding this aspect frequently leads to inefficient code and incorrect results.  Crucially, the approach differs slightly depending on whether you're working with NumPy's ndarrays or PyTorch's tensors, though the underlying concepts remain consistent.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Advanced indexing in NumPy and PyTorch allows selecting subsets of array elements using integer arrays or boolean arrays as indices.  The key to selecting along a specific dimension is to ensure your index arrays have the correct shape and are applied to the appropriate axis.  For instance, if you want to select rows 0, 2, and 5 from a 2D array, your index array should be of shape (3,) and it will be applied along axis 0 (rows).  If you were selecting specific columns instead, the index array would still be (3,), but it would be applied along axis 1.  This distinction is vital and a frequent source of errors.


The crucial concept is that an index array of shape `(n,)` selects `n` elements along the dimension you specify using the `axis` parameter (implicitly axis 0 if not specified). If you use multiple index arrays, one for each dimension, the resulting selection will be a Cartesian product of the indices.  This functionality is available in both NumPy and PyTorch, with subtle syntactical variations.  Furthermore, understanding broadcasting rules is essential when dealing with advanced indexing and multi-dimensional arrays.  Inconsistent dimensions can lead to unexpected behavior, so careful attention to shape compatibility is paramount.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: NumPy - Selecting rows based on indices**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D NumPy array
array_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                    [4, 5, 6],
                    [7, 8, 9],
                    [10, 11, 12]])

# Indices of rows to select
row_indices = np.array([0, 2, 3])

# Select rows using advanced indexing
selected_rows = array_2d[row_indices]

print(selected_rows)  # Output: [[ 1  2  3] [ 7  8  9] [10 11 12]]

# Verification: Shape of selected_rows is (3, 3)
print(selected_rows.shape)
```

This example demonstrates selecting specific rows from a 2D array.  The `row_indices` array dictates which rows are selected.  The output clearly shows the selected rows are stacked together.  Note the resulting array shape reflects the number of selected rows and the number of columns in the original array.  This is a common pattern: the selected dimension's size changes according to the index array, while other dimensions remain unchanged.

**Example 2: PyTorch - Selecting columns based on indices**

```python
import torch

# Create a 2D PyTorch tensor
tensor_2d = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3],
                         [4, 5, 6],
                         [7, 8, 9]])

# Indices of columns to select
col_indices = torch.tensor([0, 2])

# Select columns using advanced indexing. Note that the indexing differs slightly from NumPy
selected_cols = tensor_2d[:, col_indices] #Colon denotes selection across all rows

print(selected_cols) #Output: tensor([[1, 3], [4, 6], [7, 9]])
print(selected_cols.shape) #Output: torch.Size([3, 2])
```

This example uses PyTorch's tensor indexing. The colon (`:`) is used to select all rows while `col_indices` specifies the columns.  The syntax differs slightly from NumPy, which may initially cause confusion.  The output and shape verification follow the same logic as the NumPy example. The key difference lies in the explicit specification of selection along the row dimension using the colon.

**Example 3: NumPy - Multi-dimensional indexing with broadcasting**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 3D NumPy array
array_3d = np.arange(24).reshape((2, 3, 4))

# Select specific elements along each dimension
x_indices = np.array([0, 1])
y_indices = np.array([1, 2])
z_indices = np.array([2, 3])

# Advanced indexing with broadcasting. The result is not a straightforward slicing but a selection based on combinations.
selected_elements = array_3d[x_indices[:, np.newaxis, np.newaxis], y_indices[:, np.newaxis], z_indices]

print(selected_elements)  # Output: [[ 6 10] [18 22]]
print(selected_elements.shape) #Output: (2,2)

```

This example illustrates multi-dimensional indexing. The `x_indices`, `y_indices`, and `z_indices` arrays select elements across the three dimensions. NumPyâ€™s broadcasting implicitly expands the arrays to be compatible with the 3D array. The output shows the selected elements based on all possible combinations from index arrays. Carefully note how the use of `np.newaxis` is crucial for correct broadcasting and shape alignment.  This highlights the importance of understanding broadcasting rules for more complex scenarios.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official NumPy documentation; The official PyTorch documentation;  A comprehensive linear algebra textbook; A practical guide to Python for scientific computing.  These resources offer detailed explanations, examples, and best practices for array manipulation.  Thorough study of these is essential for gaining proficiency.  These resources will provide in-depth knowledge on array manipulation techniques.  Pay particular attention to sections addressing broadcasting and advanced indexing.  Mastering these concepts is crucial for efficient and accurate data manipulation in NumPy and PyTorch.
