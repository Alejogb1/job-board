The critical point concerning loading a Keras model saved as an .h5 file into a TensorFlow session without a pre-existing session lies in understanding TensorFlow's graph construction and session management.  Specifically, the `load_model` function in Keras implicitly manages session creation if none exists, but explicit control offers greater flexibility, especially in complex deployment scenarios.  My experience debugging distributed training pipelines highlighted this need for precise session handling.

In my previous work optimizing a large-scale image recognition system, I encountered frequent issues related to conflicting sessions and resource management when dealing with multiple models and datasets.  A robust solution relied on explicitly managing TensorFlow sessions, even when loading pre-trained Keras models.  This approach ensures deterministic behavior and avoids the potential for subtle bugs arising from implicitly managed sessions.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

TensorFlow, at its core, operates on a computational graph.  The graph defines the operations (e.g., matrix multiplication, convolutions) and their connections.  A TensorFlow session is an environment responsible for executing this graph. When you load a Keras model saved as an .h5 file using `keras.models.load_model`, TensorFlow implicitly creates a session if one isn't already active. However, this implicit behavior can lead to difficulties in advanced scenarios.  For improved control and resource management, it's better practice to explicitly manage sessions.

The process involves these steps:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries:** Import `tensorflow` and `keras`.  Ensure version compatibility; inconsistencies can cause unexpected errors.
2. **Create a TensorFlow Session:** Use `tf.compat.v1.Session()` to create a new session. This is crucial for explicit control. The `tf.compat.v1` prefix is necessary for compatibility across TensorFlow versions and ensures the legacy session API is used.
3. **Load the Keras Model:** Load the .h5 file using `keras.models.load_model`, but importantly, pass the newly created session as a context manager.
4. **Use the Model Within the Session:**  All operations involving the loaded model must happen *within* the context of this session.
5. **Close the Session:**  After completing model usage, explicitly close the session using `session.close()`. This releases resources and prevents resource leaks.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Model Loading and Prediction**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Create a new TensorFlow session
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as session:
    # Load the Keras model within the session context
    model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')

    # Assuming 'my_input' is your input data
    predictions = model.predict(my_input)

    # Access predictions within the session
    print(predictions)

# Session is automatically closed when exiting the 'with' block
```

This example demonstrates the simplest approach. The `with` statement ensures the session is automatically closed after model usage, even if errors occur.  The model's `predict` method operates within the explicitly created session.

**Example 2: Handling Custom Layers and Operations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define a custom layer (if needed)
class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs * 2

# Create a new TensorFlow session
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as session:
    # Load the model (potentially containing the custom layer)
    model = keras.models.load_model('my_model_with_custom_layer.h5', custom_objects={'MyCustomLayer': MyCustomLayer})
    
    # Define input data.  Must match the input shape of the model
    my_input = np.random.rand(1, 10)

    # Evaluate the model (or perform other operations).  TensorFlow operations must be within the session context
    predictions = model(my_input)

    # Fetch the results of the operation
    result = session.run(predictions)
    print(result)

```

This example showcases loading a model with custom layers. The `custom_objects` argument in `load_model` is crucial for resolving custom layer definitions. The example utilizes explicit session execution using `session.run` on a Tensor to obtain the result, which is generally needed when working with custom operations or tensors not directly handled by Keras's high-level API.

**Example 3:  Error Handling and Resource Management**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

try:
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as session:
        model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
        # ... perform model operations ...
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    # Ensure the session is closed even if errors occur
    if 'session' in locals() and session:
        session.close()
    print("Session closed.")
```

This robust example incorporates error handling using a `try...except` block.  The `finally` block guarantees session closure, preventing resource leaks even if exceptions occur during model loading or operation. This is crucial for maintaining application stability in production environments.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's session management and graph construction, I recommend carefully studying the official TensorFlow documentation.  The Keras documentation is also invaluable for understanding model loading and handling.  Finally, a comprehensive guide on Python exception handling is highly beneficial for robust application development.  Thorough examination of these resources, coupled with hands-on practice, is key to mastering these concepts.
