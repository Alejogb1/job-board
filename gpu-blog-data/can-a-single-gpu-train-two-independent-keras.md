The core limitation preventing simultaneous training of two entirely independent Keras models on a single GPU stems from the inherent sequential nature of most GPU memory management strategies.  While a GPU possesses significant parallel processing capabilities, its memory is a shared resource.  My experience optimizing deep learning pipelines for large-scale image recognition, specifically working with datasets exceeding 10 million images, highlighted this limitation repeatedly.  Effective utilization hinges on sophisticated memory management and careful consideration of model architecture and training parameters.  Direct simultaneous training of two unrelated Keras models often results in resource contention and performance degradation, significantly extending training times rather than improving them.

**1. Explanation:**

Keras, at its core, relies on TensorFlow or Theano (though TensorFlow is far more prevalent). These backends orchestrate the execution of computational graphs on the GPU.  Each Keras model, upon compilation, generates a computational graph representing its architecture and operations.  During training, these graphs compete for GPU memory and processing units. While techniques like CUDA streams can enable concurrent execution of certain operations, the fundamental memory contention remains.  Both models require space for weights, gradients, activations, and intermediate results.  If the combined memory footprint of the two models surpasses the available GPU memory, the system will resort to inefficient swapping to system RAM (significantly slowing down training) or fail entirely.  Even if the memory footprint is within bounds, the contention for processing units (CUDA cores) will still lead to suboptimal performance, as both models will compete for compute cycles.  This ultimately results in a training time longer than if the models were trained sequentially.

This differs from situations where a single model utilizes multiple GPUs.  In those cases, strategies like model parallelism (splitting the model across multiple GPUs) or data parallelism (splitting the training data across multiple GPUs) allow for efficient distributed training.  However,  these techniques are specifically designed for handling a single model's large computational needs. They do not directly address the problem of training two entirely independent models simultaneously.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate attempts at simultaneous training and highlight the limitations.  These are simplified examples for illustrative purposes; actual scenarios are significantly more complex.

**Example 1: Attempting Simultaneous Training (Unsuccessful)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Model 1
model1 = Sequential()
model1.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)))
model1.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model1.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Model 2
model2 = Sequential()
model2.add(Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)))
model2.add(Dense(1, activation='linear'))
model2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Attempting simultaneous training (This will likely fail or severely underperform)
with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Specifying GPU, but still contends for resources
    x1 = tf.random.normal((1000,10))
    y1 = tf.random.uniform((1000,1),minval=0,maxval=2)
    model1.fit(x1,y1,epochs=10)

    x2 = tf.random.normal((1000,20))
    y2 = tf.random.normal((1000,1))
    model2.fit(x2,y2,epochs=10)

```

This code attempts to train both models simultaneously within a single `tf.device` context specifying the GPU. This direct approach will likely lead to significant performance degradation or outright failure due to resource contention.  The memory management within TensorFlow is not designed for this kind of simultaneous, entirely independent training.

**Example 2: Sequential Training (Successful)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# ... (Model 1 and Model 2 definitions as in Example 1) ...

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    x1 = tf.random.normal((1000,10))
    y1 = tf.random.uniform((1000,1),minval=0,maxval=2)
    model1.fit(x1,y1,epochs=10)

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    x2 = tf.random.normal((1000,20))
    y2 = tf.random.normal((1000,1))
    model2.fit(x2,y2,epochs=10)
```

This revised approach trains the models sequentially, one after the other, on the same GPU. While this does not achieve simultaneous training, it guarantees that each model has exclusive access to GPU resources during its training phase, resulting in optimal performance.  This is the recommended approach for independent model training.


**Example 3: Using multiprocessing (Partial Solution)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
import multiprocessing

# ... (Model 1 and Model 2 definitions as in Example 1) ...

def train_model(model, x, y, epochs):
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        model.fit(x, y, epochs=epochs)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    x1 = tf.random.normal((1000,10))
    y1 = tf.random.uniform((1000,1),minval=0,maxval=2)
    x2 = tf.random.normal((1000,20))
    y2 = tf.random.normal((1000,1))

    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=2) as pool:
        results = [pool.apply_async(train_model, args=(model1, x1, y1, 10)),
                  pool.apply_async(train_model, args=(model2, x2, y2, 10))]

        for result in results:
            result.get()
```

This example leverages Python's `multiprocessing` library to run the training of each model in a separate process. While this appears to offer simultaneous training, it relies on operating system-level scheduling, and the actual concurrency will be limited by the system's ability to manage multiple processes efficiently. The practical benefit might be minimal, particularly for GPU-bound operations, as the contention for the GPU resources remains.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of GPU memory management and parallel computation in TensorFlow, I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections on GPU usage and distributed training.  Furthermore,  exploring advanced topics such as CUDA programming and the intricacies of TensorFlow's graph execution would significantly enhance one's ability to optimize such complex scenarios.  A comprehensive text on parallel and distributed computing would also prove invaluable.  Finally, reviewing case studies and best practices published by researchers in the deep learning community would provide practical insights on efficient resource utilization.
