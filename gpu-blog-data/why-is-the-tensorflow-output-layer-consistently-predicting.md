The consistent prediction of [1.] in a TensorFlow output layer almost always stems from a mismatch between the model's output activation function and the expected output format.  Over the years, I've debugged countless neural networks exhibiting this behavior, and this underlying issue is overwhelmingly the culprit.  Failing to properly configure the final layer for the specific prediction task leads to this ubiquitous problem. The model isn't necessarily "wrong," but rather, improperly calibrated to produce the desired output range or format.

**1. Explanation:**

TensorFlow's flexibility allows for diverse model architectures. However, this flexibility necessitates precise specification of each layer's functionality. The output layer, in particular, requires careful consideration of the activation function and the loss function.  The activation function transforms the raw output of the preceding layer into a usable prediction.  Common activation functions for regression problems include linear activation (no activation), sigmoid (for probabilities between 0 and 1), and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).  For classification, softmax is often used to generate probability distributions over multiple classes.  Incorrect choices here drastically influence the predicted output.

If your model consistently outputs [1.], several scenarios are plausible. First, a linear activation function combined with a dataset where the target values are predominantly 1 (or close to 1) can lead to this outcome.  The model might simply learn to always output a value near the most frequent target.  Second, if you are using a sigmoid activation function, the model's internal weights might have become excessively large, resulting in saturated outputs that consistently approach 1.  This can occur due to improper initialization, learning rate issues, or an insufficiently regularized model prone to overfitting.  Third, if your target variable's values aren't normalized or scaled appropriately, the model might struggle to learn the correct mapping, leading to biased predictions towards the higher end of the unnormalized range.

The choice of loss function further compounds the problem.  Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common regression loss function, suitable for continuous outputs.  However, using it with a sigmoid activation and a dataset containing only values close to 1 might force the network to constantly output 1 to minimize the error.  Binary cross-entropy is appropriate for binary classification problems (0 or 1), but its use with a linear activation or improperly scaled target values can also result in the observed behavior.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Activation Function for Regression**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Incorrect: Should be linear for regression
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
#...training and prediction...
```

This example shows a regression model (predicting a continuous value) incorrectly using a sigmoid activation in the output layer.  The sigmoid function squashes the output to a range between 0 and 1, likely leading to consistent predictions near 1 if the model learns to strongly activate the output neuron.  Replacing `activation='sigmoid'` with `activation='linear'` (or omitting the activation parameter entirely) would correct this.


**Example 2:  Overfitting and Weight Initialization Issues**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01), loss='binary_crossentropy') #High learning rate might lead to overfitting
#...training and prediction...
```

This example demonstrates a binary classification scenario. However, a high learning rate (0.01) in the Adam optimizer, coupled with a lack of regularization (e.g., dropout or L1/L2 regularization), increases the risk of overfitting. The network might learn to strongly activate the output neuron, consistently predicting 1.  Reducing the learning rate, adding regularization, or using a more appropriate optimizer can help alleviate this.  The use of `glorot_uniform` kernel initializer helps with weight initialization, mitigating the potential for exploding gradients which can also lead to this outcome.


**Example 3:  Data Scaling and Loss Function Mismatch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Sample data with target values skewed towards 1
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 0.2 + 0.8 # Values mostly above 0.8

#Scale data
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
y_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(y)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') # MSE is okay here, but data scaling is critical
#...training and prediction...

```

In this example, the data's target variable (y) is skewed towards 1.  Without proper scaling using `MinMaxScaler`, the model's optimization might prioritize minimizing the MSE by always predicting a value near the mean of the target variable, which is close to 1. Scaling the data using `MinMaxScaler` before training ensures the data is within a normalized range, improving the model's ability to learn the correct mapping.  Even with this scaling, careful selection of the activation function and loss function remains crucial.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's functionalities and troubleshooting techniques, I strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  Furthermore, "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet offers a comprehensive introduction to the subject, including best practices for model building and debugging.  Finally, exploring various online forums and communities dedicated to deep learning and TensorFlow can prove invaluable for resolving specific issues and learning from the experiences of other practitioners.  Focusing on documentation related to activation functions, loss functions, and model regularization will be particularly useful in this situation.  Careful study of these resources will significantly improve your ability to diagnose and correct similar problems in the future.
