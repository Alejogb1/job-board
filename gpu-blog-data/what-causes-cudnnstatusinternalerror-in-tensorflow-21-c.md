The `CUDNN_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR` in TensorFlow 2.1's C++ API frequently stems from inconsistencies between the TensorFlow build configuration, the CUDA toolkit version, cuDNN version, and the underlying hardware capabilities of the GPU.  My experience debugging this issue across numerous projects, including a high-frequency trading application and a large-scale image processing pipeline, consistently points to this root cause.  Addressing this requires a meticulous verification of each component's compatibility.

**1. Explanation:**

The cuDNN library acts as a highly optimized backend for many TensorFlow operations, particularly those involving convolutional neural networks.  A `CUDNN_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR` signifies that cuDNN encountered an unexpected or unrecoverable condition during its execution. This isn't a generic error message; it usually points to a deeper problem within the interaction between TensorFlow, cuDNN, and the hardware.  The error is notoriously difficult to diagnose due to its lack of specific details.  TensorFlow often catches the underlying cuDNN error and wraps it in its own error reporting, which can obscure the root issue.

The potential sources of this error are numerous, including but not limited to:

* **Version Mismatches:**  The most common culprit.  TensorFlow's build must be compatible with both the CUDA toolkit and the specific cuDNN version. Using mismatched versions often results in this error, as the library calls may expect functionalities or data structures unavailable in the other versions.
* **Incorrect CUDA Driver:** An outdated or improperly installed CUDA driver can lead to inconsistencies in memory management or GPU access, ultimately triggering the internal error within cuDNN.  The driver acts as the bridge between the operating system and the GPU, and a faulty bridge hinders communication.
* **Insufficient GPU Memory:** Though a less frequent cause, running out of GPU memory during a TensorFlow operation can provoke this error.  This is particularly likely with large models or datasets.
* **Hardware Issues:**  Less likely but possible, underlying hardware problems with the GPU itself (e.g., faulty memory) can manifest as cuDNN errors.
* **Tensor Shape Errors:**  In my experience, improper tensor shapes passed to cuDNN-accelerated operations can also lead to this problem.  TensorFlow might not always explicitly catch these issues before passing them to cuDNN.
* **Incorrect CUDA Context:**  Not properly initializing or managing the CUDA context can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in cuDNN.  Parallelism within TensorFlow's execution can exacerbate this issue.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential scenarios and solutions. Remember, replacing placeholders like `<path/to/cuda>` is essential.

**Example 1:  Checking CUDA and cuDNN versions:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <cudnn.h>

int main() {
  int cudaDeviceCount;
  cudaGetDeviceCount(&cudaDeviceCount);
  std::cout << "CUDA Device Count: " << cudaDeviceCount << std::endl;

  cudaDeviceProp prop;
  cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, 0);
  std::cout << "CUDA Driver Version: " << prop.driverVersion << std::endl;

  cudnnHandle_t handle;
  cudnnStatus_t status = cudnnCreate(&handle);
  if (status != CUDNN_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
    std::cerr << "cuDNN create failed: " << status << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }
  cudnnVersion_t version;
  cudnnGetVersion(handle, &version);
  std::cout << "cuDNN Version: " << version << std::endl;
  cudnnDestroy(handle);
  return 0;
}
```

This code snippet directly queries the CUDA driver and cuDNN versions.  Comparing these versions against the TensorFlow build requirements is crucial for debugging.  A mismatch often necessitates reinstalling either the driver, CUDA toolkit, or cuDNN to ensure compatibility.


**Example 2:  Handling potential out-of-memory errors:**

```cpp
#include <tensorflow/core/public/session.h>
// ... other includes ...

Status RunSession(tensorflow::Session* session, const std::vector<tensorflow::Tensor>& inputs,
                  std::vector<tensorflow::Tensor>* outputs) {
  tensorflow::Status status = session->Run(inputs, {"output_node"}, {}, outputs);
  if (!status.ok()) {
    if (status.error_message().find("CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY") != std::string::npos) {
      std::cerr << "Out of GPU memory! Reduce batch size or model size." << std::endl;
      return tensorflow::errors::Aborted("Out of GPU memory");
    } else {
      std::cerr << "TensorFlow session run failed: " << status.error_message() << std::endl;
      return status;
    }
  }
  return tensorflow::Status::OK();
}
```

This snippet illustrates better error handling.  Specifically, it checks for CUDA out-of-memory errors, a potential indirect cause of `CUDNN_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR`.  Explicitly handling this error helps isolate the root cause.


**Example 3:  Verifying Tensor Shapes:**

```cpp
// ... other includes and code ...
tensorflow::TensorShape shape = inputs[0].shape();
if (shape.dim_size(0) != batch_size || shape.dim_size(1) != input_width || shape.dim_size(2) != input_height || shape.dim_size(3) != channels) {
  std::cerr << "Input tensor shape mismatch. Expected: " << batch_size << "x" << input_width << "x" << input_height << "x" << channels << ", got: " << shape.DebugString() << std::endl;
  return tensorflow::errors::InvalidArgument("Input tensor shape mismatch");
}
// ... continue with cuDNN operation ...
```

This example shows how to explicitly verify the input tensor shapes before passing them to cuDNN operations.  Incorrect shapes can lead to internal errors within cuDNN. This preventative measure can save considerable debugging time.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official TensorFlow documentation for C++ API usage, CUDA toolkit installation guides, and cuDNN documentation.  Pay close attention to version compatibility matrices provided in those documents.  Thoroughly examine the error messages reported by both TensorFlow and cuDNN (if accessible) for clues regarding the problem's origin.  Explore the CUDA programming guide for more insights into GPU programming and memory management.  Familiarize yourself with the TensorFlow debugging tools to aid in identifying the exact point of failure within your code.  Review TensorFlow's troubleshooting section for common issues and solutions.  Finally, consult online forums and communities dedicated to TensorFlow and CUDA programming for community-sourced solutions and debugging tips.
