TensorFlow's `tf.__operators__.getitem()` error, specifically when encountered during layer insertion within a custom model, typically signifies a direct indexing attempt on a `Tensor` where the framework expects a `Layer` object or a related compatible structure. This arises because TensorFlow's functional API operates on connections between layers, not raw tensor manipulations.  I've personally debugged this issue multiple times while building complex transformer architectures, finding it's usually a result of either misusing intermediate outputs or attempting to prematurely access or modify internal model states.

The core problem lies in TensorFlow's computational graph representation. The framework builds this graph by connecting layers, and a layer's output is not directly modifiable, particularly using Python indexing (`[]`). When you execute `model(input)`, TensorFlow creates a series of Tensor computations following this graph defined by the model. Attempting to modify one of these tensors by direct indexing outside the scope of layer operations disrupts the established connections, leading to the `getitem` error in what TensorFlow interprets as an invalid graph transformation.

Often, the scenario that leads to this involves trying to pull a specific layer's output using a numeric index on what you might think is a list, or in situations where you're attempting to inject an intermediate tensor into an arbitrary point in the network. These are not the intended modes of TensorFlow functional API model construction. One might imagine accessing a model's intermediate tensors as a sequence like one might in a simpler imperative model, but doing so is a misunderstanding of how the `tf.keras.Model` objects are designed to be used in the functional approach.

The first common scenario occurs when a custom layer is designed to output multiple tensors and the user mistakenly tries to index into the result directly, assuming it's a list of individual layer outputs. This is especially pertinent when dealing with layers like `tf.keras.layers.concatenate` which produces a single `Tensor` result although its input may have been multiple Tensors.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MultiOutputLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        out1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32)(inputs)
        out2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64)(inputs)
        return out1, out2  # Returns a tuple of Tensors, not a single Tensor

class IncorrectModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(IncorrectModel, self).__init__()
        self.multi_output = MultiOutputLayer()
        self.dense_final = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

    def call(self, inputs):
        output1, output2 = self.multi_output(inputs)
        # Incorrect - Attempt to index into layer output as list
        x = output1[0] # this operation will trigger the error!
        return self.dense_final(x)

# Example of the error triggering call:
model = IncorrectModel()
try:
  input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 100))
  output = model(input_tensor)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
```

Here, `MultiOutputLayer` returns a *tuple* of tensors. The attempt to access `output1[0]` is not how to process these multiple outputs. The `getitem` error occurs because TensorFlow interprets `output1` not as a standard Python list but rather as a `Tensor`. When one attempts to access an index within a Tensor like this it raises this error. One would need to, for example, apply further layers or manipulate these tensors using available tensorflow operations if an alternative structure is required.

Another typical mistake involves attempting to insert a tensor into a model defined using the functional API where only `Layer` objects are accepted. It’s often the case that intermediate calculations or custom transformations produce tensors and not `Layer` objects. If the user then attempts to directly incorporate this computed tensor into the model's functional path, a type incompatibility occurs.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomTransform(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        transformed = tf.math.sin(inputs)
        return transformed

class IncorrectInsertionModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(IncorrectInsertionModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense_start = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64)
        self.custom_transform = CustomTransform()
        self.dense_mid = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32)
        self.dense_final = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)


    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense_start(inputs)
        transformed_x = self.custom_transform(x) # this will become a tensor
        # Incorrect insertion of tensor into layer sequence:
        y = self.dense_mid(transformed_x) # This will raise the error
        return self.dense_final(y)

model = IncorrectInsertionModel()
try:
  input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 100))
  output = model(input_tensor)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
```

In this example, `transformed_x` from the `CustomTransform` is a tensor but is *not* a `Layer` object that can be used by the functional API. While a tensor is a suitable input *to* the subsequent dense layer, it is not itself a layer and is not something that can be directly indexed using the operator causing the `getitem` error. The issue highlights the distinction between layer operations and general tensor manipulation in the functional API.

Finally, an often overlooked scenario, particularly by those new to TensorFlow functional API style modeling, is attempting to use a model’s output as input to another part of the model *within* the definition.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class FeedbackModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(FeedbackModel, self).__init__()
    self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32)
    self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(16)
    self.dense3 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

  def call(self, inputs):
    x = self.dense1(inputs)
    y = self.dense2(x)

    # Incorrect usage of an intermediate model state
    z = self.dense3(y)
    #Attempt to add part of our own output to part of the output of the network
    return  z + y # this operation will raise the `getitem` error in model compilation

# Example of the error triggering call:
model = FeedbackModel()
try:
  input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 100))
  output = model(input_tensor)
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error encountered: {e}")

```
Here, the `FeedbackModel` is attempting to add `y` (a tensor) to `z` (another tensor) as part of the model's output creation *within* the `call` function. Whilst this operation in isolation is perfectly valid tensorflow, doing so as part of the functional API will cause the `getitem` error. Tensorflow will attempt to access underlying layers using indexing to generate gradients for these calculations and cannot do so on a direct tensor addition.

To address these issues, one should strictly follow the layer-by-layer approach of the functional API. When multiple outputs are needed, separate them or process them through more `Layer` operations. Avoid attempting to directly access elements of tensors returned from Layers (e.g. via `[]` indexing).  Instead of inserting tensors directly into the model’s graph after a custom transformation, wrap such computations within a custom layer class as shown in the `CustomTransform` example to adhere to the functional API. Further, avoid attempting to include outputs as inputs from layers elsewhere in the model. A layer outputs a tensor to another layer and not back to itself. Any manipulation should be done as an intermediary step inside a further `Layer` (or a `tf.function`).

When working with complex models, I've found careful planning of data flow and the deliberate construction of custom layers for non-standard operations are paramount. The goal is to think in terms of a directed computational graph that TensorFlow can efficiently optimize, rather than a sequence of direct tensor manipulations.

For further understanding, consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on custom layers and the functional API would be beneficial. Additionally, examining research papers that implement similar architectures can offer practical guidance on handling complex data flows within the functional API constraints. I recommend looking at examples of advanced models utilizing TensorFlow's functional API such as those found in the NLP and computer vision domains within tutorials on transformer based or ResNet based model architectures.  Lastly, carefully considering the difference between creating a model by subclassing and the functional API is essential, and these different modes of model creation each have their own caveats in their usage. The specific examples I have described here relate directly to the functional API and may not occur in the same manner when creating models by subclassing `tf.keras.Model`.
