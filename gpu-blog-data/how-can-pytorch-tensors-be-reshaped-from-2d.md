The fundamental principle when reshaping a PyTorch tensor lies in maintaining the total number of elements. Data loss occurs only if the number of elements in the original tensor does not equal the number of elements implied by the new shape. Understanding the underlying data storage and manipulating its view are the keys to successful reshaping. I've encountered many instances in my work on convolutional neural networks where reshaping was crucial to align feature maps or batch data for specific layers.

Essentially, a PyTorch tensor is a multi-dimensional array; the tensor's data is stored in a contiguous block of memory, even if it is interpreted as a matrix or higher dimensional object. Reshaping involves providing a new interpretation, a different way of indexing into that same contiguous block. The `torch.reshape()` function, or the equivalent `tensor.view()` method, are the primary tools for this purpose. Critically, both require that the new shape’s product matches the original’s. When converting from a 2D to a 3D tensor, the key constraint is that the `rows * columns` product from the initial 2D matrix must be identical to the `depth * rows * columns` product in the resulting 3D tensor.

Let’s illustrate with examples. I'll use `torch.arange()` for easy data generation, and use integers for clarity in tracking element positions.

**Example 1: Reshaping a Simple Matrix into a 3D Volume**

Imagine you have a 2D tensor representing a grayscale image patch and you want to interpret it as a single-channel 3D volume, which can be useful when preparing data for 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

```python
import torch

# Create a 2D tensor (10 rows, 6 columns)
original_2d_tensor = torch.arange(60).reshape(10, 6)
print("Original 2D Tensor:\n", original_2d_tensor)
print("Shape:", original_2d_tensor.shape)

# Reshape to a 3D tensor (1 depth, 10 rows, 6 columns)
reshaped_3d_tensor = original_2d_tensor.reshape(1, 10, 6)
print("\nReshaped 3D Tensor:\n", reshaped_3d_tensor)
print("Shape:", reshaped_3d_tensor.shape)

# Ensure no data loss:
assert torch.equal(original_2d_tensor.flatten(), reshaped_3d_tensor.flatten())
```
In this instance, we started with a 2D tensor shaped `(10, 6)`, representing 60 elements. Reshaping it into `(1, 10, 6)` results in a 3D tensor with the same number of elements, but organized as a single “depth slice” of a volume. The `assert` statement confirms that the data is consistent. The `flatten()` function transforms a tensor into a 1-dimensional array, and the `torch.equal()` function checks element-wise equality. This verifies that the data hasn’t been rearranged or modified in any way during the reshaping operation.

**Example 2: Reshaping with Variable Dimensions**

In another use case, let’s assume I needed to process sequences of pixel data from multiple image patches in a batch. Here the number of rows and columns isn't necessarily fixed. The initial dimensions of each patch may vary. We can reshape accordingly.

```python
import torch

# Create a 2D tensor (4 rows, 15 columns)
original_2d_tensor = torch.arange(60).reshape(4, 15)
print("Original 2D Tensor:\n", original_2d_tensor)
print("Shape:", original_2d_tensor.shape)

# Reshape to a 3D tensor (2 depth, 2 rows, 15 columns)
reshaped_3d_tensor = original_2d_tensor.reshape(2, 2, 15)
print("\nReshaped 3D Tensor:\n", reshaped_3d_tensor)
print("Shape:", reshaped_3d_tensor.shape)


# Ensure no data loss:
assert torch.equal(original_2d_tensor.flatten(), reshaped_3d_tensor.flatten())
```

This example demonstrates how a 2D tensor `(4, 15)` can be reshaped to a 3D tensor `(2, 2, 15)`. The important point here is that the total number of elements – which is always 60 in our example – remains consistent across the original and reshaped tensor. If you were to have a batch of image patches, each of different dimensions and concatenated, you would require a more complex methodology to maintain structure, but the premise of maintaining the same number of elements during a reshape operation always applies.

**Example 3: Using `view()` Method and `-1` for automatic inference**

The `view()` method is functionally similar to `reshape()`, but has a slightly different behavior when working with tensors where their sizes aren't all explicit, due to, for example, having variable batch sizes. It shares the same core requirement of preserving the overall number of elements. In practice, using `view` will often involve fewer re-allocations under the hood than calling `reshape` directly. PyTorch can infer the appropriate dimension when using `-1` within `view()`.

```python
import torch

# Create a 2D tensor (5 rows, 20 columns)
original_2d_tensor = torch.arange(100).reshape(5, 20)
print("Original 2D Tensor:\n", original_2d_tensor)
print("Shape:", original_2d_tensor.shape)

# Reshape to a 3D tensor (5 depth, 4 rows, 5 columns)
reshaped_3d_tensor = original_2d_tensor.view(5, 4, -1)
print("\nReshaped 3D Tensor:\n", reshaped_3d_tensor)
print("Shape:", reshaped_3d_tensor.shape)

# Ensure no data loss:
assert torch.equal(original_2d_tensor.flatten(), reshaped_3d_tensor.flatten())
```
Here, `view(5, 4, -1)` instructs PyTorch to use a shape of `(5, 4, x)` where `x` is determined automatically, based on the initial size. Given we know the total number of elements is 100 and we specify `5` and `4` for the first two dimensions, the final dimension will be inferred as 5. Using `-1` can streamline your code when dimensions are not immediately obvious, which helps you avoid manual calculation of dimensions.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper dive, several resources are invaluable. Consult the official PyTorch documentation, specifically the section related to tensor operations. Look for information on the functionalities of `torch.reshape()`, `tensor.view()`, and other related functions like `torch.transpose()`, which changes axis ordering and can be used before a reshape for specific operations. Textbooks or online tutorials covering PyTorch are also extremely helpful. Seek out resources that highlight tensor manipulation with examples across various domains, as different areas often require slightly different tensor operations for data pre-processing.

To solidify understanding, practical experimentation is crucial. Try reshaping different tensors with varying shapes. Experiment with combinations of `reshape()` and `view()` and try different values, including `-1` to observe its behavior. Also, testing after each reshape using flatten and equality checks, like I did in the examples, is a crucial aspect to ensuring correct data transformation. The crucial concept is the maintenance of the total number of elements, and the view provides an interpretative lens rather than a re-ordering. With consistent practice, and referring to solid literature, tensor reshaping quickly becomes intuitive and easy to apply when creating complex data pipelines for machine learning applications.
