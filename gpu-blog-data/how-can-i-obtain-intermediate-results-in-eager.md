Eager execution, while offering immediate feedback and simplified debugging, presents challenges when dealing with computationally expensive operations where intermediate results are desired without completing the entire computation.  My experience working on large-scale physics simulations highlighted this limitation.  The inherent nature of eager execution – computing results immediately as operations are encountered – means that suppressing computation until a final stage isn't straightforward. However, strategic use of control flow, custom functions, and potentially TensorFlow's tf.function (if applicable to the underlying framework) allows the retrieval of intermediate results.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core issue lies in the fundamental design of eager execution.  Unlike graph-based execution where an entire computation graph is built and then executed, eager execution processes each operation sequentially.  To obtain intermediate results, we need to explicitly break down the computation into smaller, manageable steps and capture the output of these individual steps.  This involves manipulating the control flow of the execution, potentially introducing conditional statements or loops to selectively execute portions of the computation and retrieve intermediate results at predefined points.  Furthermore, leveraging custom functions to encapsulate sections of the computation improves code readability and modularity, making the process of extracting intermediate results much cleaner.

Consider a scenario involving a series of matrix multiplications.  In eager execution, each multiplication is performed immediately. To obtain the result after the second multiplication, we cannot simply "pause" the execution; we must design the code to explicitly return the intermediate result *before* proceeding to the final calculation.  This requires a careful restructuring of the computational steps.  If the system being used employs automatic differentiation (like TensorFlow or PyTorch), capturing intermediate results may be even more critical for gradients calculations in optimization tasks.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using conditional statements for intermediate result extraction.**

This example demonstrates retrieving intermediate results using Python's built-in conditional statements within a loop, simulating a sequential computation where we want results at specific steps.

```python
import numpy as np

def iterative_computation(data, steps):
  """
  Performs an iterative computation and returns intermediate results at specified steps.
  """
  intermediate_results = []
  result = data.copy() #Avoid modifying the original data

  for i in range(steps):
    result = result * 2 + 1 #Example computation. Replace with your actual operation.
    if (i+1) in [2, 5, 8]:  #Capture results at specific steps
      intermediate_results.append(result.copy())

  return intermediate_results, result


data = np.array([1,2,3])
steps = 10
intermediate_results, final_result = iterative_computation(data, steps)

print("Intermediate results:", intermediate_results)
print("Final result:", final_result)

```

This code iterates through a process.  The `if` condition strategically extracts results at steps 2, 5, and 8.  The `.copy()` method ensures we are storing copies and not just references.  This is crucial to prevent unexpected side effects during later stages of the calculation.


**Example 2:  Encapsulating computations within custom functions.**

This example uses custom functions to modularize the computation and provides a clearer mechanism for obtaining intermediate outputs.

```python
import numpy as np

def stage_one(x):
  return x**2

def stage_two(x):
  return x + 5

def stage_three(x):
  return np.sin(x)

def multi_stage_computation(input_data):
  """
  Performs a multi-stage computation, returning intermediate results.
  """
  intermediate_results = []

  stage1_result = stage_one(input_data)
  intermediate_results.append(stage1_result)

  stage2_result = stage_two(stage1_result)
  intermediate_results.append(stage2_result)

  final_result = stage_three(stage2_result)
  intermediate_results.append(final_result)

  return intermediate_results

input_data = np.array([1, 2, 3])
results = multi_stage_computation(input_data)

print("Intermediate and final results:", results)
```

Here, the computation is broken into discrete stages, each handled by a dedicated function.  This approach enhances readability and makes it trivial to retrieve results at each stage by simply accessing the `intermediate_results` list.


**Example 3:  Simulating intermediate results in a gradient-based optimization (Conceptual).**

In optimization tasks using automatic differentiation, intermediate gradients often need to be examined.  Illustrating this directly requires a specific framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. This example focuses on the conceptual approach.


```python
#Conceptual example – requires TensorFlow/PyTorch for actual implementation

# Assume a loss function and optimizer are defined (e.g., using TensorFlow/PyTorch)

def optimization_with_intermediate_gradients(model, data, optimizer, steps):
  """
  Performs optimization and returns intermediate gradients. (Conceptual)
  """
  intermediate_gradients = []
  for i in range(steps):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape: #Illustrative - adapt to your framework
      loss = loss_function(model, data)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    intermediate_gradients.append(gradients)  #Store gradients
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  return intermediate_gradients

#... (Rest of the code would involve defining model, loss function, etc.)
```

This example is illustrative; a real-world implementation would depend on a specific deep learning framework. The key is the use of automatic differentiation features to obtain gradients at each optimization step.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of eager execution and its implications:

* Consult the official documentation of your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).  The documentation provides comprehensive details on eager execution and how to manage computations efficiently.
* Explore advanced topics within the framework's documentation, such as control flow operations and custom operators. This enables you to design solutions tailored to your specific problem.
* Study textbooks and online courses focusing on numerical computation and parallel processing.  A strong grasp of these principles is vital for handling large-scale computations and optimizing performance.


By carefully structuring your code and making use of control flow statements and custom functions, you can effectively extract intermediate results in eager execution mode, despite its inherent immediate evaluation behavior.  This process requires careful planning and a thorough understanding of your computational pipeline. Remember to account for memory usage, as storing intermediate results might significantly increase memory consumption, especially for large datasets.
