The crucial aspect to understand regarding Keras Embedding layers is that the weights aren't stored as a separate, readily accessible entity like a typical weight matrix in a Dense layer.  Instead, they are intrinsically tied to the layer's internal state, specifically within the `embeddings` attribute. This is a consequence of the Embedding layer's functionality: it's designed to map discrete indices (representing words, items, etc.) to dense vector representations.  My experience working on large-scale recommendation systems and natural language processing models has consistently highlighted this point, leading to numerous debugging sessions stemming from misconceptions about direct weight access.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Keras Embedding layer takes an integer input (an index) and returns a corresponding embedding vector.  This mapping is defined by a weight matrix, but Keras doesn't expose this matrix directly as a `weights` attribute like some other layers (e.g., Dense).  The reason for this design choice is efficiency and conceptual clarity.  Explicitly storing and managing a large weight matrix for embedding layers, especially in scenarios with vast vocabularies, would add unnecessary overhead.  The underlying implementation optimizes memory usage by integrating the weight matrix directly within the layer's forward pass computation.  Thus, you access the embedding vectors *indirectly* through the layer's `embeddings` attribute. This attribute is a `tf.Variable` (in TensorFlow backend) or a `K.variable` (in Theano backend), representing the embedding matrix itself.  Modifying this attribute directly affects the subsequent embedding operations.

It's vital to distinguish between the embedding matrix itself and the output of the Embedding layer. The embedding matrix is the internal weight matrix that maps indices to vectors. The layer's output is the actual vector retrieved based on the input indices, after the embedding lookup operation.  Direct manipulation of the embedding matrix (through `layer.embeddings`) will alter the embedding vectors used in subsequent forward passes.  However, modifying the output of the layer *after* the embedding lookup does not affect the underlying weights.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Accessing and Printing the Embedding Matrix:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define an embedding layer
embedding_layer = keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=64) # 1000 words, 64-dim embeddings

# Access the embedding matrix
embedding_weights = embedding_layer.embeddings

# Print the shape of the embedding matrix
print(embedding_weights.shape) # Output: (1000, 64)

# Print a slice of the embedding matrix (e.g., first 5 vectors)
print(embedding_weights[:5, :])
```

This example demonstrates the direct access to the embedding matrix through `embedding_layer.embeddings`.  The shape reflects the vocabulary size (input_dim) and the embedding dimension (output_dim).  The printed slice showcases the actual numerical values of the learned embeddings.  Note that the values will be random initially until the model is trained.

**Example 2:  Modifying the Embedding Matrix:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define an embedding layer
embedding_layer = keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=64)

# Access the embedding matrix
embedding_weights = embedding_layer.embeddings

# Modify a specific embedding vector (e.g., the embedding for index 0)
new_embedding = np.random.rand(64)
embedding_weights[0].assign(new_embedding)

# Verify the change
print(embedding_weights[0])
```

This illustrates how you can directly change the embedding weights.  Here, we're replacing the embedding for index 0 with a randomly generated vector. This type of direct manipulation is often used for tasks like initializing embeddings with pre-trained word vectors or fine-tuning specific embeddings during transfer learning.  The `assign` method is crucial for updating the variable within the TensorFlow computational graph.

**Example 3: Using the Embedding Layer in a Model and Accessing Weights Post-Training:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define a simple model with an embedding layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=64, input_length=10),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate some dummy data for training
x_train = np.random.randint(0, 1000, size=(100, 10))
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100, 1))

# Train the model (brief training for demonstration)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)

# Access the embedding layer from the model
embedding_layer = model.layers[0]

# Access and print the trained embedding weights
trained_embeddings = embedding_layer.embeddings
print(trained_embeddings.shape)
print(trained_embeddings[:5,:])
```

This example demonstrates how to access the embedding weights *after* training a model.  The embedding layer is extracted from the model's layers list and its `embeddings` attribute is then used to retrieve the trained weights.  Observe the shape and the values which will now reflect the learned embeddings after the training process.  Note that the training is extremely abbreviated for brevity â€“ a real-world model would necessitate significantly more training data and epochs.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation.  TensorFlow documentation on variables and operations. A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, focusing on the mathematical foundations of embedding layers and neural networks in general. A practical guide to natural language processing with TensorFlow or Keras, as embedding layers are central to many NLP tasks.  Deep learning research papers focusing on word embedding techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe, for a deeper understanding of embedding methods.


In conclusion, while Keras Embedding layers don't offer a direct `weights` attribute, the `embeddings` attribute provides the equivalent functionality.  Understanding this distinction, along with the appropriate methods to access and manipulate these weights, is crucial for effective utilization of embedding layers in deep learning models.  My experience working with these layers has shown that a clear understanding of this internal mechanism significantly reduces debugging time and improves model development efficiency.
