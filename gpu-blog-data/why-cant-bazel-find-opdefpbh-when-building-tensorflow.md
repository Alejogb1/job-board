The root cause of Bazel's inability to locate `op_def.pb.h` during a TensorFlow source build almost invariably stems from inconsistencies within the build configuration, specifically concerning the generation and linking of Protocol Buffer (protobuf) files.  My experience troubleshooting this across numerous large-scale TensorFlow deployments points to three primary areas: incorrect protobuf compilation, misconfigured `BUILD` files, and problems within the TensorFlow workspace itself.

**1.  Protobuf Compilation and Linking:**

TensorFlow heavily relies on protobuf for defining its operation definitions.  The `op_def.pb.h` file, a crucial header, is generated from a `.proto` file during the build process.  If the protobuf compiler (`protoc`) is not correctly configured or if the generated files aren't properly incorporated into the Bazel build system, the compiler will fail to find the necessary header. This often manifests as an error message indicating a missing or inaccessible header file.  I've personally debugged several instances where a seemingly innocuous system-wide protobuf installation clashed with the one TensorFlow expected, leading to this exact problem.  Ensuring that the version of `protoc` used is consistent with the TensorFlow version is paramount.  Furthermore, the `protoc` binary must be correctly identified within the Bazel environment, often achieved through specifying its location in the `PATH` or using Bazel's `--host_jvm_args` or similar arguments for fine-grained control.  The build process needs to explicitly generate the necessary files from the `.proto` definitions and ensure they are available during the compilation of TensorFlow's C++ code.

**2.  Inconsistent BUILD File Configurations:**

The `BUILD` files within the TensorFlow source tree meticulously define the build rules for each component.  Errors in these files, particularly those related to protobuf dependencies, can directly prevent Bazel from locating `op_def.pb.h`.  I recall a project where a developer inadvertently omitted a dependency on the `tf_proto` target in a `BUILD` file, resulting in the protobuf-generated header being excluded from the compilation process.  The `BUILD` files must accurately reflect the dependencies between different parts of the TensorFlow codebase.  Overlooking even a single dependency can create cascading errors, manifesting as missing header files.  Careful review of the relevant `BUILD` files is crucial, with attention paid to both `cc_library` and `cc_binary` rules, ensuring all dependencies are correctly specified.  Furthermore, ensuring that the `srcs` attribute correctly lists all relevant source files (.cc and .h) will prevent compilation issues.

**3.  Workspace Configuration and External Dependencies:**

TensorFlow's build process involves managing a complex network of dependencies, both internal and external. Problems with the workspace setup, such as missing or incorrectly configured external dependencies, can lead to the header file being inaccessible. For instance, I encountered a scenario where an incorrect setting in the `.bazelrc` file prevented the proper resolution of a required external repository containing a dependency crucial for protobuf generation.  A thoroughly examined and well-maintained workspace configuration is therefore crucial.   This includes verifying the integrity of all downloaded dependencies and resolving any conflicts between different versions of libraries.  Examining the Bazel cache and ensuring that the necessary protobuf libraries are successfully fetched and integrated into the build process is equally important.  A faulty workspace often presents itself as a wider range of build errors, but the missing header file can be one of the symptoms.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct `BUILD` file snippet (Illustrative):**

```bazel
cc_library(
    name = "my_tensorflow_module",
    srcs = ["my_module.cc"],
    hdrs = ["my_module.h"],
    deps = [
        ":my_proto_library",  # Dependency on the generated protobuf library
        "@tensorflow//tensorflow:tensorflow", # TensorFlow core library
    ],
)

cc_proto_library(
    name = "my_proto_library",
    srcs = ["my_ops.proto"],
    deps = ["@protobuf//:protobuf"], #Dependency on protobuf library
)
```

This snippet demonstrates the correct inclusion of protobuf library dependency in the `BUILD` file.  The `cc_proto_library` rule generates the necessary header files from `my_ops.proto`. The `cc_library` then depends on this generated library, making sure the generated headers are available.  Notice the explicit dependency on the external protobuf library (`@protobuf//:protobuf`).

**Example 2:  Incorrect `BUILD` file snippet (Illustrative):**

```bazel
cc_library(
    name = "my_tensorflow_module",
    srcs = ["my_module.cc"],
    hdrs = ["my_module.h"],
    deps = [
        "@tensorflow//tensorflow:tensorflow",
    ],
)
```

This is an erroneous example; it omits the dependency on the generated protobuf library.  Without this dependency, Bazel will not include the necessary headers, leading to the `op_def.pb.h` not being found error.


**Example 3:  Fragment of a `.bazelrc` file highlighting protobuf location (Illustrative):**

```bazel
build --host_jvm_args="-Dprotobuf.home=/path/to/protobuf"
```

This demonstrates how to specify the location of the protobuf installation if Bazel is unable to automatically find it. Replace `/path/to/protobuf` with the actual path.  Incorrectly specifying this path can also lead to the error.  Alternatively, ensuring `protoc` is in your system's `PATH` might resolve the issue without requiring this command-line option.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on building from source and dependency management.  The Bazel documentation, focusing on `BUILD` file syntax, dependency resolution, and workspace configuration.   The Protocol Buffer Language Guide provides valuable context on protobuf compilation and usage.  A comprehensive understanding of these resources is indispensable for efficient TensorFlow development and debugging.


In conclusion, resolving the "Bazel cannot find `op_def.pb.h`" error involves systematic investigation across protobuf configuration, `BUILD` file integrity, and workspace setup.  By carefully examining these three aspects, one can identify and correct the underlying cause, ensuring a successful TensorFlow build process.  Through rigorous testing and careful attention to detail across these steps, I've consistently resolved such issues in my past projects.
