Obtaining individual token embeddings from RoBERTa requires understanding its architecture and leveraging the appropriate layer outputs.  Directly accessing the final hidden state provides a rich representation but might lack the contextual discrimination achievable through techniques like pooling.  My experience working on sentiment analysis projects, specifically those involving fine-grained emotion detection, has highlighted the importance of choosing the right embedding extraction method based on downstream task requirements.  Let's examine the process systematically.

**1. Understanding RoBERTa's Architecture and Embedding Generation:**

RoBERTa, like BERT, is a transformer-based model.  Its architecture comprises multiple encoder layers, each processing the input sequence iteratively. Each layer produces a hidden state representation for every token in the input sequence.  The final layer's output is often considered the most comprehensive representation, capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information. However, this high-dimensionality can be computationally expensive for downstream tasks.  Furthermore, the information pertinent to the token's intrinsic meaning might be distributed across different layers.

The process of obtaining token embeddings involves:

a) **Tokenization:** The input text is first tokenized using RoBERTa's tokenizer, converting it into a sequence of tokens, including special tokens like [CLS] and [SEP].

b) **Forward Pass:** The tokenized sequence is fed into the RoBERTa model, undergoing a forward pass through all encoder layers.

c) **Layer Selection and Embedding Extraction:**  The hidden state representation of each token from a chosen layer is extracted. The final layer is a common choice, but earlier layers might contain more localized contextual information.

d) **Potential Pooling:**  For applications requiring a single vector per token, the raw hidden state might be too high-dimensional.  Methods like max pooling or average pooling can reduce dimensionality while preserving essential information.  This step is crucial for computationally efficient downstream tasks and can improve performance in some scenarios.

**2. Code Examples (Python with PyTorch):**

The following examples assume familiarity with PyTorch and Hugging Face's `transformers` library.

**Example 1: Extracting Final Layer Embeddings without Pooling:**

```python
from transformers import RobertaTokenizer, RobertaModel
import torch

tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('roberta-base')
model = RobertaModel.from_pretrained('roberta-base')

text = "This is a sample sentence."
encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')
output = model(**encoded_input)
embeddings = output.last_hidden_state

# Access embeddings for each token
for i, token_embedding in enumerate(embeddings[0]):
    print(f"Token: {tokenizer.decode(encoded_input['input_ids'][0][i])}, Embedding Shape: {token_embedding.shape}")
```

This example shows straightforward extraction of the final layer's embeddings. The loop iterates through each token's embedding, demonstrating its shape and allowing for further processing or storage.  Note the direct access to the `last_hidden_state` attribute.  This approach is suitable when downstream tasks can handle high-dimensional vectors.

**Example 2:  Average Pooling of Final Layer Embeddings:**

```python
from transformers import RobertaTokenizer, RobertaModel
import torch

# ... (Tokenizer and model loading as in Example 1) ...

# ... (Forward pass as in Example 1) ...

embeddings = output.last_hidden_state
pooled_embeddings = torch.mean(embeddings, dim=1)

# Access the single pooled embedding for the entire sequence
print(f"Pooled Embedding Shape: {pooled_embeddings.shape}")
```

This example employs average pooling across the entire sequence to obtain a single vector representation.  This is useful when a single vector for the entire input is needed, such as for sentence classification tasks. Note that this isn't a per-token embedding but a holistic representation.


**Example 3:  Max Pooling of Final Layer Embeddings for each token:**

```python
from transformers import RobertaTokenizer, RobertaModel
import torch

# ... (Tokenizer and model loading as in Example 1) ...

# ... (Forward pass as in Example 1) ...

embeddings = output.last_hidden_state
pooled_embeddings = torch.max(embeddings, dim=1).values

# Access the max-pooled embedding for each token
for i, token_embedding in enumerate(pooled_embeddings[0]):
  print(f"Token: {tokenizer.decode(encoded_input['input_ids'][0][i])}, Pooled Embedding: {token_embedding.shape}")

```

This example demonstrates the application of max pooling at the token level.  For each token, we take the maximum value across all dimensions of its hidden state representation. This method helps to retain the most salient features of each token, potentially beneficial for certain tasks.  This produces a single vector per token, as requested.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of transformer architectures, I recommend consulting research papers on BERT and RoBERTa, paying close attention to their encoder mechanisms and output representations.  The official documentation for the Hugging Face `transformers` library is invaluable for practical implementation details.  Furthermore, exploring tutorials and example notebooks focusing on embedding extraction from transformer models will greatly assist practical application.  Advanced users will benefit from studying papers on advanced embedding techniques, especially those addressing dimensionality reduction and information preservation.
