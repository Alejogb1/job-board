Directly releasing GPU memory allocated to tensors and models, rather than relying solely on Python’s garbage collection, is crucial for efficient resource management, especially in deep learning workflows. Unmanaged memory can lead to ‘out of memory’ errors, hinder performance, and prevent other applications from utilizing the GPU. Through numerous projects, I’ve learned that proper memory cleanup requires a clear understanding of the specific framework being used and its memory management mechanisms.

Within deep learning frameworks, memory allocated to tensors and model parameters resides on the GPU’s dedicated memory space. These objects often persist even after their immediate scope has expired in Python because the framework internally manages the lifecycle of these GPU-resident objects. Simply reassigning a variable referencing a large tensor to 'None' does not automatically free up the corresponding GPU memory. The framework’s memory manager, not Python’s garbage collector, is responsible for this task. To proactively release this memory, specific framework functionalities must be invoked. Incorrectly handling GPU memory is a common pitfall, particularly when iteratively creating and destroying models within loops or in complex pipelines.

For PyTorch, the primary mechanism for releasing GPU tensor memory is through the `del` keyword coupled with proper detach operations. When tensors are used in computational graphs, they are associated with gradient computations. Unless the computational graph is detached, the tensors might remain alive even after they are no longer directly referenced in Python. This graph preservation allows for backpropagation, but requires explicit detachment and deletion when that functionality is no longer needed. Moreover, when dealing with models, setting variables referring to both the model object and the optimizer to `None` might not immediately trigger garbage collection unless there are no other references to their constituent parts. Therefore, explicitly calling `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` after releasing references is an effective way to reclaim the freed memory that has been marked as available. This ensures that PyTorch’s CUDA memory allocator returns the memory to the system.

The following code demonstrates this process.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple neural network
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Example usage
def training_example():
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    model = SimpleNet().to(device)
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

    # Simulate some training
    input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10, device=device)
    output = model(input_tensor)
    loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(output, torch.randn(1, 2, device=device))
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    # Clean up the graph and free up memory
    del output, loss, input_tensor, model, optimizer
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    training_example()
    print("Memory cleared after training example")
```

In this first example, after the training loop, all tensors and models associated with that particular training procedure are explicitly deleted using the `del` keyword. Then, `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` is called to clear any cached memory that would not have been released automatically after deleting references. This pattern is essential when repeatedly running the same model structure in a loop or processing several models successively. Failure to do so can lead to the dreaded “out of memory” errors, particularly when dealing with larger datasets or models.

In TensorFlow, the approach is somewhat different. While similar deletion techniques apply to Tensor objects, TensorFlow utilizes a different memory allocation scheme. The primary method for releasing memory involves using TensorFlow’s eager execution mode, combined with Python's garbage collection and calls to clear the session or device. Additionally, TensorFlow 2.x defaults to eager execution, which simplifies memory management compared to the graph execution mode of older versions. In eager mode, tensors are garbage-collected automatically as they go out of scope, which is not the case when running graph execution where references might persist. Explicit calls to clean up the session might be needed for managing certain allocated resources if running within a graph execution environment. When employing GPUs within a TensorFlow environment, understanding how TensorFlow interacts with CUDA or similar device specific libraries is important for effective memory management.

This next code shows a simple example using Tensorflow.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a simple neural network
class SimpleNet(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='relu')
        self.fc2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x


def training_example():
    device = "/GPU:0" if tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU') else "/CPU:0"
    with tf.device(device):
        model = SimpleNet()
        optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

        input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            output = model(input_tensor)
            loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(output - tf.random.normal((1, 2))))
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

        # Clean up
        del model, optimizer, input_tensor, output, loss, gradients
        if device == "/GPU:0":
            tf.keras.backend.clear_session() # clears the backend of tensorflow
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    training_example()
    print("Memory cleared after training example")
```
This second example focuses on TensorFlow and shows the use of `tf.keras.backend.clear_session()`. This function, when called on a GPU enabled session, ensures the GPU backend associated with the TensorFlow session has been cleared. This, along with the `del` keywords, assists in releasing GPU resources allocated for the model and tensors. Note the check on whether the device is the GPU: when running only on the CPU the `clear_session()` command is not needed. Proper selection of device is crucial for the efficiency of any neural network algorithm.

Another aspect to consider is the handling of dataset loading. Memory consumption can spike drastically when large datasets are loaded directly into GPU memory, particularly when the entire dataset is loaded instead of using batching techniques. Frameworks often provide efficient mechanisms for moving batches of data to the GPU asynchronously, thereby minimizing the GPU memory footprint.  Furthermore, persistent data structures, if stored as GPU tensors directly, should also be explicitly deleted to prevent GPU memory leakage. Using iterators or data loaders provided by frameworks also helps manage the data movement dynamically, avoiding large, single loads which cause memory problems.

Here's an example demonstrating a batching procedure:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Define a simple neural network (same as first example)
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

def batched_training_example():
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    model = SimpleNet().to(device)
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

    # Generate dummy dataset
    input_data = torch.randn(100, 10)
    target_data = torch.randn(100, 2)

    dataset = TensorDataset(input_data, target_data)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)


    for inputs, targets in dataloader:
      inputs = inputs.to(device)
      targets = targets.to(device)
      output = model(inputs)
      loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(output, targets)
      loss.backward()
      optimizer.step()
      optimizer.zero_grad()
      del inputs, targets, output, loss

    # Clean up the model and optimizer
    del model, optimizer
    torch.cuda.empty_cache()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    batched_training_example()
    print("Memory cleared after batched training example")
```

In this final example, I’ve incorporated PyTorch's DataLoader for training the model in batches, which prevents GPU overutilization during the loading stage. As each batch is processed, its corresponding tensors are explicitly deleted, ensuring the release of occupied GPU memory. Batching allows for more efficient memory utilization during the training process.

In summary, releasing GPU memory effectively involves more than just letting Python's garbage collector do its work. It requires actively releasing tensor and model references, detaching computational graphs, and clearing framework specific memory caches through functions like `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` in PyTorch and `tf.keras.backend.clear_session()` in TensorFlow. Employing batching also reduces the instantaneous memory demand, allowing for large datasets to be processed efficiently. For further exploration, I'd recommend focusing on the official documentation of both PyTorch and TensorFlow with a special consideration of their respective memory management sections, especially when using them with GPU acceleration. Also, online resources and textbooks describing advanced memory management in Python and the chosen framework’s intricacies can be very beneficial.
