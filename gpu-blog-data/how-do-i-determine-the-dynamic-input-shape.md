TensorFlow's graph execution model frequently necessitates knowing the shape of tensors, especially when dealing with dynamically sized inputs during model construction or inference. Unlike static shapes declared at graph build time, dynamic shapes, often stemming from batching or variable-length sequences, require a different approach to ascertain their current dimensions within the execution context. I've encountered this challenge countless times, particularly when building complex data processing pipelines or implementing custom layers that must operate on variable-sized inputs. The core issue is that `.shape` property of a Tensor object during graph construction provides a *symbolic* shape – a description of the shape, not its actual numerical dimensions at runtime. To obtain those runtime values, one must utilize TensorFlow's execution mechanisms.

A key distinction here lies between eager execution and graph mode. In eager execution, which runs operations immediately, determining the tensor's shape is straightforward as you can evaluate the `.shape` attribute directly after the operation that produces the tensor has been executed. The runtime values of dimensions will be readily available. However, in graph mode, which is more common in production environments for performance reasons, one cannot rely on the `.shape` attribute to provide concrete dimension values.

To obtain the dynamic shape of a Tensor in graph mode, I primarily use `tf.shape()`. This TensorFlow operation returns another tensor representing the shape of the input tensor. This resulting tensor will contain the actual numerical dimensions, and it is not merely a symbolic representation. The values within this shape tensor will only be known during graph execution when a specific input is actually passed.

The usage of `tf.shape()` requires understanding that it returns a Tensor itself. Therefore, to access the actual dimension values, you have to evaluate that tensor, typically within a TensorFlow session, or within a graph execution context when using the new `tf.function` decorator. This aspect is critical because simply calling `tf.shape()` won't reveal the dynamic values immediately, it only generates an operation that *will* calculate those values during execution. We will see this in the examples.

Now, let's look at specific code examples. The first demonstrates how one can use `tf.shape()` inside an eager context. We'll simulate a tensor with a dynamic first dimension using a random integer as the batch size.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Eager execution is enabled by default in TF 2.x.
# Let's create a tensor with a dynamically set batch size in eager execution
batch_size = np.random.randint(1, 10) # Simulate a variable batch size.
dynamic_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, 100)) # Shape : (batch_size, 100)
print(f"Tensor shape at eager creation: {dynamic_input.shape}") # Prints symbolic shape, first dimension is "?".
shape_tensor = tf.shape(dynamic_input) # We get a tensor representing its shape
print(f"Tensor shape using tf.shape(): {shape_tensor}") # Prints a tf.Tensor
actual_shape_values = shape_tensor.numpy()  # Evaluates the shape tensor to get runtime shape
print(f"Shape values evaluated to: {actual_shape_values}") # Prints [batch_size, 100]
```

The above code illustrates that even with eager execution, while `dynamic_input.shape` gives us some information about the shape symbolically, to obtain the actual runtime dimension values, we have to leverage `tf.shape` and then evaluate that resulting tensor via `.numpy()` in this eager context. Note the symbolic shape in the printout of `dynamic_input.shape`.

The next example shifts to graph mode, demonstrating the usage of `tf.shape()` within a `tf.function`, a mechanism for defining graph operations explicitly.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

@tf.function
def process_tensor(input_tensor):
  shape_tensor = tf.shape(input_tensor)
  return shape_tensor

# Create a placeholder tensor.
batch_size = np.random.randint(1, 10)
placeholder_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, 100))
print(f"Tensor shape at eager creation: {placeholder_input.shape}")

# Call the tf.function.
dynamic_shape_tensor = process_tensor(placeholder_input)
print(f"Shape from function {dynamic_shape_tensor}") # Prints a tf.Tensor, not an array
actual_shape = dynamic_shape_tensor.numpy()  # Evaluates the shape tensor.
print(f"Evaluated Shape values: {actual_shape}") # Prints array with runtime shape
```

In this second example, the `process_tensor` function has been decorated with `@tf.function`, meaning that TensorFlow will build a graph that will calculate and output the shape. We provide a tensor `placeholder_input` with a dynamic batch size and pass it to `process_tensor`. Within this graph, `tf.shape()` creates an operation node to determine the shape. Because we've invoked it through the `@tf.function`, we obtain the computed tensor using `dynamic_shape_tensor`, which then requires a `.numpy()` call to get the runtime values. This highlights the nature of working with symbolic shapes in graph mode – one must explicitly extract the runtime dimensions.

The final example demonstrates that `tf.shape()` can be used on tensors resulting from operations with variable dimensions, not just input placeholders. I'll implement a simple dense layer with a variable input size.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

@tf.function
def process_variable_output(input_tensor):
    dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=50, activation='relu') # A dense layer with 50 units.
    output_tensor = dense_layer(input_tensor) # Operation with an potentially variable shape
    shape_tensor = tf.shape(output_tensor)
    return shape_tensor

# Create input tensor, this time we also vary the width.
batch_size = np.random.randint(1, 10)
input_width = np.random.randint(10, 200)
dynamic_input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, input_width))
shape_result = process_variable_output(dynamic_input_tensor)
shape_values = shape_result.numpy()
print(f"Dynamic Shape: {shape_values}")
```

In this final example, I'm showing that you can use `tf.shape()` on the output of any operation to dynamically determine the output shape, even when the shape depends on the input (like in this example). The `Dense` layer changes the second dimension dynamically. This is essential for building adaptive models that can operate on differently structured inputs during training or deployment.

In summary, to retrieve the dynamic shape of a TensorFlow tensor, especially within graph execution: 1) use `tf.shape()` to generate a shape tensor; and 2) evaluate this tensor within the appropriate context to obtain the numerical values. Understanding the implications of eager vs. graph modes, and the need to access shape values correctly, is essential for writing robust and flexible TensorFlow code. When one encounters shape-related errors, ensuring they are accessing the shape at runtime can be the first step towards troubleshooting and resolution.

For further exploration, I recommend delving into the following resources: the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.shape()`, specifically looking at its usage within the context of graphs and `tf.function`. Additionally, examining tutorials on graph execution, specifically regarding building complex graph-based data pipelines using placeholders. Lastly, gaining familiarity with `tf.keras.layers` will show how dynamic shapes arise in the context of building more involved machine learning models and the necessity of retrieving shapes dynamically as described above.
