Verilog's `if` block execution model is fundamentally determined by its context within a procedural block (always or initial) and the nature of the signals involved.  Contrary to a naive expectation of inherent parallelism, the behavior is inherently sequential within a given procedural block, although concurrent execution of different procedural blocks is the norm in Verilog's event-driven simulation.  This subtlety is a common source of confusion for those transitioning from other programming paradigms.  My experience debugging complex ASIC designs has repeatedly highlighted the importance of understanding this nuanced execution model.

**1. Explanation of Sequential Execution within a Procedural Block:**

Verilog's `always` and `initial` blocks represent processes.  Within a single `always` or `initial` block, statements execute sequentially.  The `if` statement, like any other statement within this context, follows this sequential execution model.  The condition of the `if` statement is evaluated first.  If the condition evaluates to true, the statements within the `if` block are executed; otherwise, the `else` block (if present) is executed.  Crucially, this execution happens *one statement at a time* within the procedural block.  There is no inherent parallelism between statements inside a single `always` or `initial` block.  Parallelism in Verilog emerges from the concurrent execution of multiple procedural blocks, not from parallel execution of statements *within* a block.

Consider the case of multiple assignments within an `if` block.  These assignments are executed sequentially, one after the other.  The result of an earlier assignment might influence the outcome of a later assignment in the same block.  This sequential behavior is critical for correctly modeling the intended behavior of a circuit.  Misunderstanding this sequential nature can lead to incorrect simulation results and, more seriously, faulty hardware implementations.

Furthermore, the execution order within a procedural block is influenced by the sensitivity list (for `always` blocks) or implicit sensitivity to all variables in the block (for `initial` blocks).  The block executes only when a change occurs on a variable in its sensitivity list.  Consequently, even if multiple `if` conditions are present, they are evaluated sequentially, according to the order they appear in the code, whenever a change occurs on a sensitive variable impacting any condition.  The `if` statements don't execute concurrently; they execute sequentially based on the triggering event.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Sequential Assignment within an `if` block:**

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (enable) begin
    a <= b + 1; // Assignment 1
    c <= a * 2; // Assignment 2 - depends on the result of Assignment 1
  end
end
```

In this example, the assignments to `a` and `c` are sequential.  The value of `a` is updated first, and that updated value is then used in the assignment to `c`.  The block does not execute `a <= b + 1` and `c <= a * 2` simultaneously.  This is fundamental to sequential behavior within the `always` block.

**Example 2: Multiple `if` statements within a single `always` block:**

```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (condition1) begin
    x <= y + 1;
  end
  if (condition2) begin
    z <= x * 2; // z depends on x which might be modified by the previous if statement
  end
end
```

Here, the two `if` blocks execute sequentially.  First, `condition1` is evaluated. If true, `x` is updated.  Then, regardless of the outcome of the first `if` statement, `condition2` is evaluated.  If true, `z` is updated using the possibly modified value of `x`.  It's crucial to note that, despite the different conditions, the execution within the `always` block remains sequential.

**Example 3: Illustrating the impact of sensitivity list:**

```verilog
reg a, b, c;
always @(a or b) begin
  if (a == 1'b1) begin
    c <= b;
  end else begin
    c <= 1'b0;
  end
end
```
This example demonstrates that the `if` statement only evaluates and executes when `a` or `b` changes.  The execution is sequential: either `c <= b` or `c <= 1'b0` will execute based on the value of `a`, but not concurrently.  The sensitivity list explicitly defines when the entire `always` block will re-evaluate, triggering sequential execution of the code within.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Verilog's concurrency and procedural blocks, I strongly recommend consulting the official Verilog language reference manual.  Additionally, a thorough understanding of digital logic design principles is crucial for grasping the implications of Verilog's execution model.   Supplement this with a good textbook on Verilog HDL and digital system design.  Working through numerous examples and simulations is also essential to internalize the concepts discussed here.  The detailed exploration of the simulation behavior of your code, analyzing the waveforms produced by simulators, is an indispensable part of the learning process.  Finally, consider seeking out more advanced Verilog texts covering topics such as timing analysis and synthesis, as a solid grasp of these areas further illuminates the practical ramifications of Verilog's execution model.
