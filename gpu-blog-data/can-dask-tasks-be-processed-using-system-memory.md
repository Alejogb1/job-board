Dask, while often associated with out-of-core computation and parallel processing, does not inherently dictate that tasks must be executed on a GPU. The critical determinant lies in the nature of the underlying operations being performed and the libraries those operations leverage. If your Dask tasks involve computations that primarily use CPU resources, Dask will naturally utilize system memory. The utilization of GPU memory through Dask is a conscious choice made by the programmer by using libraries that support GPU acceleration like cuDF, cuPy, or Numba with CUDA.

I've spent the last several years architecting large-scale data processing pipelines, and often I find new users assuming Dask always offloads to the GPU when in reality the decision is often an active choice on our part. Dask is primarily a task scheduler and parallelization engine. It creates a computational graph from the instructions you provide and distributes those tasks to available workers, which could be physical CPU cores on the local machine, multiple machines on a cluster, or even specialized hardware like a GPU if properly configured with a specific backend. The default is to run on the local CPU and its RAM.

To clarify how tasks are processed with Dask in system memory, it is essential to understand the core elements. Dask utilizes a graph-based approach, representing computations as a network of tasks. These tasks consist of Python functions or operations that can be executed in parallel, with intermediate results being stored in memory. By default, when using libraries like NumPy, pandas, or custom Python functions that do not explicitly invoke GPU computations, Dask tasks will run on the CPU and use system RAM to hold intermediate results. This default behavior allows the user to scale out CPU-bound operations across multiple cores or even nodes in a cluster without necessarily having to rewrite code to leverage GPUs.

Let's examine three code examples to illustrate this. The first example uses NumPy, a library that will always execute operations on CPU memory by default:

```python
import dask.array as da
import numpy as np

# Create a Dask array backed by a NumPy array
data = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)
dask_array = da.from_array(data, chunks=(100, 100))

# Perform a simple element-wise operation using Dask
result_array = dask_array * 2

# Compute the result, triggering the execution
final_result = result_array.compute()

print(f"Shape of result: {final_result.shape}")

# Check if the operation was performed on system RAM
print(f"Type of result: {type(final_result)}")
```
In this example, a NumPy array is wrapped into a Dask array. The multiplication operation performed within the Dask environment leverages NumPy's capabilities, executing on CPU and system RAM. The `compute()` method triggers the evaluation of the Dask graph, and the final result will be a NumPy array which resides in system memory. The core operations were CPU bound and there was no need for any special configuration.

The next example shifts focus to using pandas with Dask. Dask DataFrames, while designed to handle large datasets that may exceed system RAM, by default use system memory for computation when standard Pandas operations are employed:

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd
import pandas as pd

# Create a pandas DataFrame
data_pd = pd.DataFrame({'A': range(1000), 'B': range(1000, 2000)})

# Create a Dask DataFrame from the pandas DataFrame
dask_df = dd.from_pandas(data_pd, npartitions=10)

# Perform an operation that involves several steps
result_df = dask_df.groupby('A').B.sum().compute()

print(f"Shape of result: {result_df.shape}")

# Verify that the resulting object is a pandas Series residing in system RAM
print(f"Type of result: {type(result_df)}")

```

In this instance, a pandas DataFrame is wrapped by Dask. The groupby and sum operation uses the usual pandas code but Dask does it in parallel across partitions, but still executes on the CPU and system RAM. The computed result is a Pandas series, a familiar data structure residing entirely in the local system's RAM. Notice that just like in the previous case, there are no specific instructions for moving computations or data to the GPU. If GPUs are available in a Dask cluster, they would remain idle for this calculation.

Finally, let's explore a simple user-defined Python function demonstrating the system-memory execution behavior of Dask:

```python
import dask

@dask.delayed
def my_function(x):
    return x * 2

# Create a list of integers
data_list = list(range(10))

# Apply the function to each element of the list
lazy_results = [my_function(item) for item in data_list]

# Perform the computation
results = dask.compute(*lazy_results)

print(f"Results: {results}")

# Check that the results are just lists of integers residing in system RAM
print(f"Type of results: {type(results)}")

```
Here we have a simple Python function, decorated to be a delayed function, which signifies a Dask task. The calculation, the multiplication by two, is performed in a standard way by the Python interpreter, using CPU and system RAM. The final result, as before, shows that Dask, without specific instruction, defaults to processing with system RAM rather than GPU memory. The resultant data types here are plain python integers.

To specifically leverage GPU resources with Dask, one must utilize libraries designed for GPU computation. For example, `dask-cudf`, built on top of cuDF, allows users to perform computations on data residing within GPU memory. Similarly, libraries like cuPy, or specialized functions using `numba.cuda` can perform numerical computations directly on GPUs. These are conscious choices made when you want to run on GPU. Dask does not provide implicit GPU offloading from any operation. Dask just provides the framework for scheduling and running the task regardless of where it is performed. The computation itself is defined by the underlying Python code.

Therefore, Dask's versatility comes from its capacity to schedule and execute tasks using the appropriate underlying computation frameworks. When working with libraries like NumPy, pandas, or custom Python functions that don't explicitly target GPU execution, computations naturally take place in system memory. Understanding this is critical for optimizing your Dask workflows. GPU acceleration should be a deliberate choice, involving the utilization of GPU-enabled libraries.

For further investigation, I'd recommend exploring the official Dask documentation, which provides comprehensive guides on the use of Dask Arrays and DataFrames. Additionally, studying the documentation for libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and CuPy will give better understanding of how the data structures and computations behave with both CPU memory and GPU memory. Reviewing example projects that explicitly demonstrate Daskâ€™s interaction with the GPU through libraries like `dask-cudf` is a good practical approach as well. This should offer a solid understanding of Dask and its interaction with different memory spaces.
