The perceived performance advantage of an increment-and-assign loop over a purely assignment-based loop in certain contexts stems primarily from compiler optimizations and the underlying hardware architecture, not from a fundamental difference in the number of operations.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects for embedded systems taught me that this seemingly counterintuitive observation hinges on how effectively the compiler can exploit instruction-level parallelism and memory access patterns.

Let's clarify.  A naive comparison might suggest that both approaches—increment-and-assign (e.g., `i++`) and assign (e.g., `i = i + 1`)—perform a similar number of operations:  a fetch, an increment or addition, and a store.  However, this ignores the potential for compiler optimizations and the capabilities of modern processors.

**1. Compiler Optimizations:**

Compilers are sophisticated tools capable of transforming code into more efficient machine instructions.  In the case of increment-and-assign,  compilers frequently recognize the `++` operator as a specific instruction—often a single machine instruction like `INC` in x86 assembly—which can execute faster than the equivalent sequence of instructions generated from `i = i + 1`. This single instruction approach eliminates the need for separate fetch and add instructions, directly manipulating the register containing `i`. The compiler's ability to perform this optimization is highly dependent on the target architecture and the level of optimization enabled.  In less optimized builds or on architectures with less sophisticated compilers, this advantage might not be present, and the performance difference would be negligible or even reversed.

**2. Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP):**

Modern processors employ techniques like pipelining and out-of-order execution to achieve high throughput.  The simpler instruction generated from `i++` may be more readily scheduled and executed in parallel with other instructions within the loop, compared to the potentially longer sequence stemming from `i = i + 1`.  This advantage becomes more pronounced in loops with complex calculations where the processor can overlap the execution of the increment operation with other computations.

**3. Memory Access Patterns:**

The way a loop accesses memory can significantly impact performance.  If the loop's operations heavily involve memory access (e.g., array manipulation), the potential for cache misses can dominate the runtime.  However, in a simple increment loop, the primary variable `i` is likely to remain in a register throughout the loop's execution, avoiding memory access altogether. The compiler's ability to optimize register allocation plays a crucial role here.  Both `i++` and `i = i + 1` benefit from this register allocation, but a subtle difference in the compiler's intermediate representation might still influence cache behavior in more complex scenarios, leading to performance variability.

**Code Examples:**

Let's examine three scenarios to illustrate these points. I've chosen C++ for its widespread use and compiler optimization capabilities, but the principles apply to other languages.  Each example demonstrates timing a simple loop iterating a billion times.


**Example 1: Basic Increment-and-Assign**

```c++
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int i = 0;
  auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  for (int j = 0; j < 1000000000; ++j) {
    i++;
  }
  auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end - start);
  std::cout << "Time taken by increment-and-assign: " << duration.count() << " ms" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This example utilizes the post-increment operator (`++`). The compiler can often translate this directly into a single `INC` instruction, maximizing efficiency.


**Example 2:  Assignment-Based Increment**

```c++
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int i = 0;
  auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  for (int j = 0; j < 1000000000; ++j) {
    i = i + 1;
  }
  auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end - start);
  std::cout << "Time taken by assignment: " << duration.count() << " ms" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This code performs the same operation using assignment.  The compiler might generate more instructions, potentially reducing efficiency, depending on optimization settings.

**Example 3:  Loop Unrolling and Increment-and-Assign**

```c++
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int i = 0;
  auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  for (int j = 0; j < 1000000000; j += 4) {
    i++; i++; i++; i++;
  }
  auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
  auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(end - start);
  std::cout << "Time taken by unrolled increment-and-assign: " << duration.count() << " ms" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}

```

This example introduces loop unrolling, a common optimization technique. By performing four increments per iteration, we increase ILP, potentially leading to further performance gains. This highlights how careful consideration of both the increment method and other optimization techniques can impact overall performance.  This will only show a performance improvement if the compiler doesn't already perform this unrolling implicitly.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend studying compiler optimization techniques,  instruction set architectures of your target platform (e.g., x86-64, ARM), and performance analysis tools like profilers.  Consult advanced compiler design texts and processor architecture documentation for a thorough grasp of the underlying mechanisms.  Explore how different compiler optimization levels affect the generated assembly code.  Furthermore, learning about low-level programming (assembly language) can provide invaluable insights into how your high-level code translates to machine instructions and thereby influences performance.  These resources will equip you to make informed decisions regarding code optimization based on your specific hardware and compiler.
