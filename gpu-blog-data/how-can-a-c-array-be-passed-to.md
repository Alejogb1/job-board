Passing C++ arrays to CUDA kernels necessitates a deep understanding of memory management and pointer arithmetic within the CUDA programming model.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects, particularly those involving large-scale simulations, has shown that neglecting these aspects often leads to segmentation faults, incorrect results, or significant performance bottlenecks. The key lies in understanding that CUDA kernels operate on device memory, separate from the host's (CPU's) memory. Direct access is impossible; data transfer is crucial.  We must explicitly allocate memory on the GPU, copy data from the host to the device, perform the computation on the device, and finally copy the results back to the host.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves several distinct steps. First, we allocate memory on the GPU using `cudaMalloc`. This function takes a pointer to a void pointer (where the allocated memory address will be stored) and the size of the memory block to allocate in bytes.  It's crucial to check for errors after each CUDA API call using `cudaGetLastError()`.  Next, we copy the host array data to the newly allocated device memory using `cudaMemcpy`.  This function requires the destination device pointer, the source host pointer, the size of the data to copy, and a copy kind specifying the direction of transfer (host-to-device, device-to-host, or device-to-device). The kernel is then launched, receiving the device pointer as an argument.  Following kernel execution,  `cudaMemcpy` is used again to transfer the processed data from the device back to the host.  Finally, both host and device memory are freed using `free` and `cudaFree`, respectively, to prevent memory leaks.  Incorrectly managing memory leads to instability and unpredictable behavior.

Crucially, the array's size must be known and passed to the kernel to prevent out-of-bounds accesses, a common cause of errors.  Furthermore, the data type must be consistent between host and device to avoid type mismatches leading to data corruption.  While using pointers is essential, proper error checking is equally vital for robust CUDA applications.  Ignoring error handling can lead to undetected issues that only manifest later during runtime, significantly hindering debugging.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Vector Addition**

This example demonstrates adding two vectors element-wise.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  float *h_a, *h_b, *h_c;
  float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

  h_a = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
  h_b = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
  h_c = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

  // Initialize host arrays (omitted for brevity)

  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, n * sizeof(float));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, n * sizeof(float));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, n * sizeof(float));

  cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

  cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // Verify results (omitted for brevity)

  free(h_a); free(h_b); free(h_c);
  cudaFree(d_a); cudaFree(d_b); cudaFree(d_c);
  return 0;
}
```
This code demonstrates the fundamental steps: allocation, copy to device, kernel launch, copy back to host, and deallocation. The `vectorAdd` kernel showcases simple parallel processing.  Note the crucial error checking omitted for brevity, but essential in production code.


**Example 2:  Matrix Multiplication (Simplified)**

This example focuses on passing a matrix, represented as a 1D array.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void matrixMultiply(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int width) {
  int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

  if (row < width && col < width) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int k = 0; k < width; ++k) {
      sum += a[row * width + k] * b[k * width + col];
    }
    c[row * width + col] = sum;
  }
}

int main() {
  int width = 1024;
  // ... (Memory allocation and initialization similar to Example 1) ...

  matrixMultiply<<<dim3(blocksPerGrid, blocksPerGrid), dim3(threadsPerBlock, threadsPerBlock)>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, width);

  // ... (Memory copy and deallocation similar to Example 1) ...

  return 0;
}
```

This example handles matrices stored in row-major order.  The kernel iterates through the matrix elements, performing the multiplication efficiently using threads.  Note how `width` is passed to the kernel to handle proper indexing. The grid and block dimensions are adjusted for matrix sizes, again showcasing the importance of managing these parameters accurately.

**Example 3: Using `cudaMallocPitch` for 2D Arrays**

For true 2D arrays, `cudaMallocPitch` offers better memory alignment and performance.


```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void process2DArray(const float* devPtr, size_t pitch, int width, int height) {
    int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

    if (x < width && y < height) {
        float* element = (float*)((char*)devPtr + y * pitch + x * sizeof(float));
        //Process element
        *element *= 2.0f; //Example operation
    }
}


int main() {
    int width = 1024;
    int height = 768;
    float *h_data, *d_data;
    size_t pitch;

    h_data = (float*)malloc(width * height * sizeof(float));
    //Initialize h_data

    cudaMallocPitch((void**)&d_data, &pitch, width * sizeof(float), height);
    cudaMemcpy2D(d_data, pitch, h_data, width * sizeof(float), width * sizeof(float), height, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    dim3 blockDim(16,16);
    dim3 gridDim((width + blockDim.x -1)/blockDim.x, (height + blockDim.y -1)/blockDim.y);
    process2DArray<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(d_data, pitch, width, height);


    cudaMemcpy2D(h_data, width * sizeof(float), d_data, pitch, width * sizeof(float), height, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    //Further processing of h_data

    free(h_data);
    cudaFree(d_data);
    return 0;
}
```

This example utilizes `cudaMallocPitch` to allocate memory, accounting for potential padding.  The pitch value is crucial for correct addressing within the kernel.  `cudaMemcpy2D` facilitates efficient 2D data transfers, making it superior to `cudaMemcpy` for this scenario.  The kernel accesses elements using pointer arithmetic, carefully accounting for the pitch.
