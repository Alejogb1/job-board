The phenomenon of increasing training loss at the start of each epoch, frequently observed during deep learning model training, is primarily attributable to the batch-based nature of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants.  My experience debugging countless training runs across diverse architectures – from convolutional neural networks for image classification to recurrent networks for time-series forecasting – has solidified this understanding.  The apparent increase isn't a genuine divergence from the overall downward trend of loss, but rather a consequence of the shuffling of training data and the resultant shift in the initial gradient calculations within each epoch.

Let's clarify this with a precise explanation.  Each epoch involves iterating through the entire training dataset.  To manage computational resources and improve efficiency,  this dataset is typically divided into smaller batches.  Before each epoch, the training data is randomly shuffled.  This randomization is crucial for preventing bias and ensuring the model generalizes effectively.  However, this shuffling leads to a different sequence of batches presented to the model at the beginning of each epoch.  Consequently, the initial batches in a new epoch might contain samples that are more challenging for the model to classify accurately compared to those presented towards the end of the previous epoch.  This results in a temporary spike in the training loss, as the model begins adapting to a new, potentially more difficult, subset of the data.  This initial increase is not indicative of model divergence or hyperparameter issues, unless it's consistently and drastically large.  In my own work with medical image analysis, I've observed this behavior numerous times, particularly with imbalanced datasets.  The key takeaway is that the long-term trend of decreasing loss is more indicative of the model's overall learning progress than these momentary spikes at the start of each epoch.

Consider the following code examples that illustrate this concept.  These examples are simplified for clarity but represent common practices in training deep learning models using popular frameworks.

**Example 1:  Training a simple neural network with PyTorch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple neural network
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 5),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(5, 1)
)

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
epochs = 10
for epoch in range(epochs):
    running_loss = 0.0
    for i, data in enumerate(train_loader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        running_loss += loss.item()
        print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, Batch {i + 1}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}') # Observe loss per batch
    print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, Average Loss: {running_loss / len(train_loader):.4f}') # Epoch average loss
```

This PyTorch example demonstrates a basic training loop.  The `print` statements allow for monitoring the loss at both the batch and epoch levels. Notice the loss fluctuation within an epoch.  Observe the average epoch loss; this gives a better indication of true progress than individual batch losses.

**Example 2:  TensorFlow/Keras example emphasizing the impact of batch size**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple sequential model
model = keras.Sequential([
  keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
batch_size = 32  # Experiment with different batch sizes
epochs = 10
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=epochs)

# Observe the loss history
print(history.history['loss'])
```

This Keras example highlights the role of batch size. Experimenting with different `batch_size` values (e.g., 32, 64, 128) can reveal how the initial loss fluctuation changes.  Larger batch sizes often lead to smoother loss curves, but might require more memory.  Smaller batch sizes introduce more noise but can potentially lead to faster convergence in some cases. My experience has shown that finding the optimal batch size is a critical step in optimizing training performance.

**Example 3:  Illustrating the use of learning rate schedulers to mitigate the effect**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import ReduceLROnPlateau

# ... (Model definition, loss, and optimizer as in Example 1) ...

scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, 'min', patience=2, factor=0.1)  # Reduce learning rate if loss plateaus

# Training loop with scheduler
epochs = 10
for epoch in range(epochs):
    running_loss = 0.0
    for i, data in enumerate(train_loader, 0):
        # ... (training steps as in Example 1) ...
        running_loss += loss.item()
    print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}, Average Loss: {running_loss / len(train_loader):.4f}')
    scheduler.step(running_loss / len(train_loader)) # Adjust learning rate based on epoch loss
```

This example integrates a learning rate scheduler.  Techniques like `ReduceLROnPlateau` dynamically adjust the learning rate based on the observed loss.  By reducing the learning rate when the loss plateaus, the training might become less sensitive to the initial batch variations, thus potentially smoothing the loss curve.  However, improper use of such schedulers can hinder convergence.


In summary, the initial increase in training loss at the beginning of each epoch is a common and generally benign observation stemming from the stochastic nature of SGD and data shuffling.  Focusing on the overall trend of the loss curve, rather than individual epoch starts, provides a more accurate assessment of the model's learning progress.  Careful consideration of batch size and advanced techniques like learning rate schedulers can help to mitigate the effect of this initial fluctuation and improve training stability.   My extensive experience in training deep learning models has consistently confirmed these observations.
