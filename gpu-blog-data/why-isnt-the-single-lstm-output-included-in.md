The discrepancy between a single LSTM output and the `return_sequences=True` output stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the LSTM's temporal processing nature.  My experience debugging recurrent neural networks, specifically LSTMs, for financial time-series forecasting, has frequently highlighted this point.  The crucial fact to grasp is that an LSTM, unlike a standard feedforward network, inherently processes sequential data.  A single output reflects the network's final state after processing the *entire* input sequence, while `return_sequences=True` provides the hidden state at *each* timestep.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

An LSTM network is characterized by its hidden state, which is updated at each timestep as it processes the input sequence.  This hidden state encapsulates information gathered from preceding timesteps.  When you set `return_sequences=False` (the default), the LSTM returns only the final hidden state, representing the network's summarized understanding of the entire input.  This is useful when the task requires a single prediction based on the whole sequence, such as classifying a sentence's sentiment or predicting the next value in a time series after observing a window of past values.

Conversely, `return_sequences=True` instructs the LSTM to return the hidden state at *every* timestep during the sequence processing.  This output is therefore a sequence of hidden states, with each state representing the network's understanding at a specific point in the input sequence.  This is essential for tasks requiring prediction at multiple points in time or processing each element of the sequence individually, such as generating sequences (e.g., text generation) or performing multi-step time series forecasting.  The single output from `return_sequences=False` is simply the final element of this sequence.  It is *not* omitted; rather, it's a specific choice of what to return from a longer sequence.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with Keras examples, using a fictional dataset for stock price prediction.  Assume `X_train` and `y_train` represent training data where `X_train` is a three-dimensional array (samples, timesteps, features) of historical stock prices and `y_train` contains the target values (future price).

**Example 1: Single Output Prediction (return_sequences=False)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    Dense(units=1) # Single output for future price prediction
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Prediction for a single sequence
prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(X_test[0], axis=0))
print(f"Single prediction: {prediction}")
```

Here, the model predicts a single future price for each input sequence. The LSTM's internal hidden states at each timestep are not explicitly returned.  The `Dense` layer outputs a single value.

**Example 2: Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction (return_sequences=True)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, TimeDistributed

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(timesteps, features), return_sequences=True),
    TimeDistributed(Dense(units=1)) # Output at each timestep
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Prediction for a single sequence, returns a sequence
predictions = model.predict(np.expand_dims(X_test[0], axis=0))
print(f"Sequence predictions: {predictions}")
```

This model, using `return_sequences=True` and `TimeDistributed`, outputs a prediction at each timestep. The `TimeDistributed` wrapper applies the `Dense` layer independently to each timestep's LSTM output. This is suitable for predicting multiple future prices based on each point in the input sequence.  The final element of `predictions` would be equivalent to the single output from Example 1, given identical weights and input.

**Example 3:  Accessing the Internal State (Advanced)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Lambda
from keras import backend as K

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(timesteps, features), return_state=True),
    Lambda(lambda x: x[0]) # Selects only the output
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

_, h, c = model.predict(np.expand_dims(X_test[0], axis=0)) #h and c are the hidden and cell states
print(f"Final Hidden State: {h}")
```

In this example, `return_state=True` returns the final hidden (h) and cell (c) states of the LSTM. The Lambda layer specifically selects the last output of the LSTM, demonstrating that the single output is readily available if you need to access it directly through the internal state mechanisms.  Note that this isnâ€™t returning the output layer's output, but the raw hidden state, and additional processing might be necessary.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of LSTMs, I recommend consulting the original LSTM paper by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber.  Further,  a thorough grasp of recurrent neural networks in general is fundamental.  Several excellent textbooks cover these topics in detail, focusing on both theoretical and practical aspects.  Moreover, carefully reviewing the documentation of your chosen deep learning framework (e.g., Keras, PyTorch) concerning LSTM layers is vital.  Finally,  working through practical examples and experimenting with different hyperparameters and configurations will solidify your understanding.  Remember to carefully analyze your chosen loss function and optimization algorithm to appropriately guide training.
