The core limitation of `itertools.product` lies in its inability to efficiently handle updates to the input iterables after the product generation has commenced.  This is because `itertools.product` generates the Cartesian product on demand, but it doesn't maintain a reference to the original iterables.  Therefore, any modification to those iterables post-initialization will not be reflected in the already initiated product iteration. This necessitates alternative approaches for dynamic updates.

My experience working on a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem highlighted this constraint acutely. We were using `itertools.product` to explore a solution space defined by several variable sets. However, as the optimization algorithm progressed, the feasible set of values for these variables changed dynamically based on constraints discovered during the search.  Simply re-initializing `itertools.product` with the updated iterables at every step proved computationally prohibitive. This led me to develop strategies leveraging generators and custom iteration logic to address this limitation.

**1.  Explanation of Alternative Strategies**

Instead of directly modifying `itertools.product`, we need to embrace a more flexible, iterative approach. This involves designing a custom generator that:

a) **Maintains references:** Stores references to the input iterables, allowing for monitoring of changes.

b) **Dynamically recomputes:** Recomputes the Cartesian product whenever changes are detected in the referenced iterables.

c) **Handles partial generation:**  Efficiently manages the state of the generated product, allowing continuation after updates.

This requires a departure from the concise syntax of `itertools.product`. The trade-off is greater control and adaptability at the cost of increased code complexity.  The central idea is to manage the iterables and their products explicitly within a custom generator function.  This allows us to refresh the product set whenever the input iterables are updated.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Dynamic Cartesian Product Generator**

This example showcases a simple generator that recomputes the entire product upon detection of changes in input iterables.  It's suitable for scenarios with infrequent updates.

```python
def dynamic_product(*iterables):
    original_iterables = [list(it) for it in iterables] #Store original copies for comparison
    while True:
        for combo in itertools.product(*iterables):
            yield combo
        #Check for changes in iterables
        for i, iterable in enumerate(iterables):
            if list(iterable) != original_iterables[i]:
                original_iterables = [list(it) for it in iterables]
                break #Exit inner loop to start the next iteration with updated iterables.
```

This approach utilizes `itertools.product` internally, but the outer loop and the change detection mechanism are crucial for the dynamic update capability.  Note the use of `list()` to create copies of iterables for comparison â€“ this avoids unintended modifications of the original data structures.

**Example 2: Generator with Partial Product Continuation**

This generator improves upon Example 1 by tracking the current position within the Cartesian product. This allows the generator to resume from where it left off after an update, improving efficiency when updates are frequent.

```python
import itertools

def dynamic_product_optimized(*iterables):
    original_iterables = [list(it) for it in iterables]
    current_index = [0] * len(iterables)
    while True:
        try:
            yield tuple(it[i] for it, i in zip(iterables, current_index))
            current_index[-1] += 1
            for i in reversed(range(len(current_index) - 1)):
                if current_index[i] == len(iterables[i]):
                    current_index[i] = 0
                    current_index[i + 1] += 1
        except IndexError:
            #Detect end of product. Check for iterable updates
            for i, iterable in enumerate(iterables):
                if list(iterable) != original_iterables[i]:
                    original_iterables = [list(it) for it in iterables]
                    current_index = [0] * len(iterables)
                    break
```

This version uses manual index tracking to iterate through the Cartesian product. The `try-except` block gracefully handles the end of the current product iteration and triggers an update check.  This minimizes redundant computations.

**Example 3:  Handling Variable-Sized Iterables**

This example demonstrates a more robust solution that explicitly manages variable-sized input iterables, a scenario commonly encountered in dynamic combinatorial problems.

```python
import itertools

def dynamic_product_variable(*iterables):
    original_sizes = [len(it) for it in iterables]
    current_index = [0] * len(iterables)
    while True:
        try:
            yield tuple(it[i] for it, i in zip(iterables, current_index))
            current_index[-1] += 1
            for i in reversed(range(len(current_index) - 1)):
                if current_index[i] == len(iterables[i]):
                    current_index[i] = 0
                    current_index[i + 1] += 1
        except IndexError:
            #Update check incorporating size changes
            updated = False
            for i, iterable in enumerate(iterables):
                if len(iterable) != original_sizes[i]:
                    original_sizes = [len(it) for it in iterables]
                    current_index = [0] * len(iterables)
                    updated = True
                    break
            if updated:
                continue #restart loop from beginning
```

This version explicitly checks for changes in the *sizes* of the iterables in addition to their contents, addressing situations where elements might be added or removed during the update.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of generator functions and iterator protocols in Python, I recommend consulting the official Python documentation.  A comprehensive text on algorithms and data structures will provide valuable context on efficient iteration and combinatorial techniques. Finally, exploring advanced Python libraries focused on numerical computation and scientific computing can offer further insights into optimized methods for handling large-scale combinatorial problems.
