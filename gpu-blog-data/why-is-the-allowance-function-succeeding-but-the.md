The discrepancy between a successful allowance function and a failing transfer function typically stems from a misunderstanding of how token allowances operate within the context of ERC-20 compliant smart contracts.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous decentralized applications (dApps) points to three primary causes: insufficient allowance, incorrect token address, and reentrancy vulnerabilities.

**1. Insufficient Allowance:**

The allowance function, typically `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`, modifies the allowance granted by a token owner (`msg.sender`) to a spender.  This function doesn't directly transfer tokens; it merely updates a mapping that records the spender's authorization to access the owner's tokens.  The transfer function, frequently `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount)`, consumes this allowance.  A common failure mode arises when the allowance granted is less than the amount the `transferFrom` function attempts to transfer.  The `transferFrom` function will revert if this condition is met, even if the sender possesses sufficient token balance.  Crucially, the allowance is a separate state variable from the token balance; both must be correctly managed.

**2. Incorrect Token Address:**

Many instances of failure originate from using the wrong token address in either the allowance or the transfer function call. This often happens when interacting with multiple tokens or when utilizing third-party libraries that may not clearly identify the intended token.  A simple typo in the address, especially when dealing with long hexadecimal values, can lead to a seemingly successful allowance but a failed transfer because the `transferFrom` operates on a different, perhaps non-existent, contract.  This highlights the importance of rigorous address verification and the avoidance of hardcoded addresses whenever possible.  Using a registry or a verifiable source for token addresses significantly mitigates this risk.

**3. Reentrancy Vulnerabilities:**

Reentrancy vulnerabilities represent a more nuanced and potentially catastrophic failure mode. A reentrancy attack exploits the ability of a malicious contract to recursively call the `transferFrom` function before the state changes resulting from the initial call are finalized.  Consider a scenario where a malicious contract calls `approve` followed by `transferFrom`.  If the `transferFrom` function isn't properly protected against reentrancy, the malicious contract might manipulate its own allowance during the execution of `transferFrom`, potentially resulting in the transfer of more tokens than initially intended or even a complete depletion of the owner's balance.

Let's illustrate these scenarios with code examples using Solidity.  These examples are simplified for clarity and may lack comprehensive error handling present in production-ready contracts.

**Code Example 1: Insufficient Allowance**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {}
}

contract MyContract {
    MyToken public myToken;

    constructor(address tokenAddress) {
        myToken = MyToken(tokenAddress);
    }

    function transferTokens(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        require(myToken.allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= amount, "Insufficient allowance");
        myToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
    }
}
```

This example explicitly checks the allowance before attempting the transfer.  Failure occurs if the allowance is insufficient, returning a clear error message.  This demonstrates correct practice.

**Code Example 2: Incorrect Token Address**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyContract {
    address public tokenAddress;

    constructor(address _tokenAddress) {
        tokenAddress = _tokenAddress;
    }

    function transferTokens(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        ERC20 token = ERC20(tokenAddress); // Potential point of failure
        token.approve(address(this), amount); // Allowance might succeed even with a wrong address.
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, recipient, amount); //This will likely revert if tokenAddress is wrong.
    }
}
```

Here, the `tokenAddress` is used directly. If it's incorrect, the `transferFrom` will likely revert, even if the `approve` seemingly succeeds, potentially interacting with a different, unintended contract.  Always verify the address independently before use.

**Code Example 3: Reentrancy Vulnerability (Illustrative)**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract VulnerableContract {
    ERC20 public token;

    constructor(address tokenAddress) {
        token = ERC20(tokenAddress);
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount); // Vulnerable to reentrancy
    }
}

contract MaliciousContract {
    VulnerableContract public vulnerableContract;
    ERC20 public token;

    constructor(address vulnerableAddress, address tokenAddress) {
        vulnerableContract = VulnerableContract(vulnerableAddress);
        token = ERC20(tokenAddress);
    }

    function attack() public {
        vulnerableContract.withdraw(100);
    }
}
```

This illustrates a simplified reentrancy vulnerability.  A malicious contract could override the `withdraw` function within the `attack` function, potentially causing unintended transfers. In a real-world scenario, much more sophisticated techniques would be employed. This is merely a conceptual demonstration highlighting the risk.  Employing the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern is crucial to preventing this type of attack.
