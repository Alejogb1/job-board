The appearance of NaN (Not a Number) values in Keras output and loss, even after normalization, frequently stems from numerical instability during training, often exacerbated by inappropriate activation functions or loss functions combined with poorly scaled or ill-conditioned data.  My experience debugging numerous deep learning models across various projects, including a large-scale recommendation system and several image classification tasks, points to several common culprits.  The problem isn't simply about the initial normalization step; rather, it's a cascading effect originating from the interplay of data, model architecture, and training parameters.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

NaN values propagate rapidly through computations. Once a NaN appears in a tensor, any subsequent operation involving that tensor will likely result in more NaNs.  Normalization, while crucial for improving training stability, doesn't inherently prevent the emergence of NaNs during the learning process.  The root causes generally lie in one or more of the following areas:

* **Exploding Gradients:**  In deep networks, especially those with many layers, gradients can become excessively large during backpropagation.  This can lead to numerical overflow, resulting in `inf` (infinity) values, which in turn cause NaNs when operations like division by infinity occur.  This is more prevalent with activation functions like the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) or sigmoid, which saturate, meaning their derivatives approach zero, causing vanishing gradients at one extreme and exploding gradients at the other. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) mitigates exploding gradients, but can still suffer from vanishing gradients in the negative regions.

* **Inappropriate Loss Function:**  The choice of loss function is critical.  Some loss functions, when combined with specific data distributions or network architectures, can be more prone to producing NaNs. For instance, using the mean squared error (MSE) loss with highly skewed data or using binary cross-entropy with probabilities that reach 0 or 1 can lead to numerical instability.  Logarithms of zero or negative numbers will produce NaNs, and this can quickly propagate through the training process.

* **Data Issues:**  Even after normalization, outliers or extreme values in the dataset can still cause problems. While normalization scales the data, it doesn't eliminate the inherent variability.  Certain operations, particularly those involving exponentiation or logarithms, are highly sensitive to extreme values.  Further data cleaning or robust statistical transformations might be necessary.

* **Learning Rate:**  An excessively large learning rate can cause the optimizer to overshoot optimal parameters, resulting in unstable weight updates and leading to NaN values.  Conversely, an extremely small learning rate can lead to slow convergence, allowing for the gradual accumulation of errors until NaNs appear.

Addressing these issues requires a systematic approach involving careful data analysis, model selection, and parameter tuning.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Exploding Gradients with tanh Activation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='tanh', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='tanh'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Generate some data (replace with your actual data)
X = np.random.rand(100, 10) * 100  #Intentionally generating large values
y = np.random.rand(100, 1)

try:
    model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Training failed with error: {e}") #Expect a NaN error or similar
```
*Commentary:* This example deliberately uses large input values and the `tanh` activation function, making it highly susceptible to exploding gradients.  The `try-except` block is included to handle the expected `RuntimeError` related to NaN values.  Replacing `tanh` with ReLU or using gradient clipping (discussed below) can help mitigate this.

**Example 2:  Loss Function Instability with Binary Cross-Entropy**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

#Data with probabilities close to 0 or 1
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.clip(np.random.rand(100, 1), 0.01, 0.99) #Avoid exact 0s and 1s, but close


model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)
```

*Commentary:*  This example demonstrates the risk of using binary cross-entropy with probabilities that are very close to 0 or 1. Clipping the target variable `y` prevents exact 0s and 1s, but values very close to these boundaries can still cause numerical issues. Using a different loss function or data transformation may be required.


**Example 3:  Addressing Exploding Gradients with Gradient Clipping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='tanh', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='tanh'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(clipnorm=1.0) #Gradient clipping implemented here

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

X = np.random.rand(100, 10) * 100
y = np.random.rand(100, 1)

try:
    model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Training failed with error: {e}")
```

*Commentary:* This example incorporates gradient clipping into the Adam optimizer. `clipnorm=1.0` limits the norm of the gradient to a maximum of 1.0, preventing exploding gradients. This is a common technique to stabilize training when dealing with potentially large gradients.  Experiment with different `clipnorm` values to find the most effective setting for a particular model and dataset.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of numerical stability in deep learning, I recommend consulting relevant chapters in advanced machine learning textbooks focusing on optimization algorithms and neural network architectures.  Furthermore, the documentation for TensorFlow and Keras provides comprehensive explanations of various optimizers, activation functions, and loss functions, and how they can affect model training.  Finally, exploring papers on robust optimization techniques within the machine learning literature offers valuable insights into handling noisy or ill-conditioned data.  Reviewing the source code of popular deep learning frameworks can also offer valuable educational opportunities.
