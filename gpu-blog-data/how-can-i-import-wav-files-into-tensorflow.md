Directly addressing the question of WAV file import into TensorFlow 2 requires understanding that TensorFlow's core functionality operates primarily on tensors—multi-dimensional arrays of numerical data.  WAV files, being audio files, contain raw audio samples encoded in a specific format. Therefore, the import process necessitates a preprocessing step to convert the WAV data into a tensor representation suitable for TensorFlow's operations.  My experience working on audio classification projects for several years has shown me that inefficient handling of this preprocessing often leads to performance bottlenecks.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental approach involves using libraries like librosa or scipy to read the WAV file, extract the raw audio data, and then convert this data into a NumPy array.  This array can then be easily converted into a TensorFlow tensor using `tf.convert_to_tensor`.  Crucially, consistent data handling is key.  Inconsistencies in sample rates, bit depths, or channel numbers across different WAV files will require normalization and preprocessing to avoid model training issues.  Furthermore, the choice between using `tf.data.Dataset` for efficient batching and feeding to the model versus manual tensor creation depends heavily on the dataset size and the complexity of the desired preprocessing pipeline. For smaller datasets, direct tensor manipulation might suffice. For larger datasets, leveraging `tf.data.Dataset` is essential for optimal performance and scalability.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic WAV Import and Conversion using Librosa**

```python
import librosa
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def load_wav_as_tensor(file_path):
    """Loads a WAV file and converts it to a TensorFlow tensor.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the WAV file.

    Returns:
        A TensorFlow tensor representing the audio data.  Returns None if an error occurs.
    """
    try:
        y, sr = librosa.load(file_path, sr=None) # sr=None preserves original sample rate
        #Reshape to (1, len(y)) for single channel. Adjust if multichannel
        tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(np.expand_dims(y, axis=0), dtype=tf.float32)
        return tensor
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading WAV file: {e}")
        return None

# Example Usage
wav_tensor = load_wav_as_tensor("path/to/your/audio.wav")
if wav_tensor is not None:
    print(wav_tensor.shape)
    print(wav_tensor.dtype)
```

This example leverages `librosa.load()` for efficient WAV file reading and sample rate preservation. Error handling is included to gracefully manage potential file loading issues. The use of `np.expand_dims` ensures the audio data is reshaped into a suitable format for TensorFlow, accommodating single-channel audio.  For multi-channel audio, the reshaping would need to be adjusted accordingly.


**Example 2:  Using tf.data.Dataset for Batch Processing**

```python
import librosa
import tensorflow as tf
import os

def load_wav_from_path(file_path):
  """Loads a single WAV file using librosa."""
  y, sr = librosa.load(file_path, sr=None)
  return y, sr

def create_dataset(directory, batch_size=32):
    """Creates a tf.data.Dataset from WAV files in a directory."""
    wav_files = [os.path.join(directory, f) for f in os.listdir(directory) if f.endswith('.wav')]
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(wav_files)
    dataset = dataset.map(lambda file_path: tf.py_function(load_wav_from_path, [file_path], [tf.float32, tf.int64]))
    dataset = dataset.map(lambda y, sr: (tf.expand_dims(y, axis=0), sr))  # Add channel dimension
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    dataset = dataset.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)  # Optimizes data loading
    return dataset


# Example Usage
dataset = create_dataset("path/to/your/wav/directory")
for audio_batch, sr_batch in dataset:
  print(audio_batch.shape) #Shape will be (batch_size, 1, audio_length)
  print(sr_batch)
```

This example demonstrates creating a `tf.data.Dataset` for efficient batch processing. This is crucial for larger datasets where loading and processing individual files would be slow.  The `tf.py_function` allows us to integrate the librosa loading function within the TensorFlow pipeline, and `prefetch` helps improve performance by overlapping data loading with model computation.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Channels and Sample Rate Discrepancies using Scipy**

```python
import scipy.io.wavfile as wav
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def load_wav_scipy(file_path, target_sr=16000):
  """Loads a WAV file using scipy, handling multiple channels and resampling."""
  sr, data = wav.read(file_path)
  if len(data.shape) == 1: #Mono
      data = np.expand_dims(data, axis=1)
  elif len(data.shape) > 2:
      print(f"Warning: More than two channels detected in {file_path}. Only the first channel is being used.")
      data = np.expand_dims(data[:,0], axis=1)


  if sr != target_sr:
      #Resampling to target sample rate
      data = librosa.resample(data, orig_sr=sr, target_sr=target_sr)
  tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(data, dtype=tf.float32)
  return tensor

#Example Usage
tensor = load_wav_scipy("path/to/your/audio.wav", target_sr=22050)
print(tensor.shape)
print(tensor.dtype)

```
This example uses `scipy.io.wavfile` to load WAV files, explicitly handling potential multi-channel audio and allowing for sample rate conversion using `librosa.resample`. The target sample rate is defined for consistency across the dataset. Error handling for unsupported formats or file issues could be incorporated further.  Note that I've included a warning rather than raising an error for multi-channel files – the best course of action here often depends on the specific application.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of digital signal processing concepts relevant to audio manipulation, I would recommend textbooks on digital signal processing and audio processing.  Additionally, the official TensorFlow documentation and the librosa documentation are invaluable resources for detailed information on the functionalities used in the code examples.  Finally, studying examples of well-structured audio processing pipelines in larger open-source projects can provide practical insights into best practices for handling large datasets and complex audio features.
