The core challenge in unpacking a NumPy `float64` object within a Keras dataset in TensorFlow 2.0 lies not in the `float64` type itself, but rather in how it's structured within the broader dataset.  A single `float64` is easily handled; the complication arises when it's embedded within a more complex data structure, such as a nested array or a dictionary, which is common when dealing with real-world datasets.  My experience with high-dimensional image classification datasets, particularly those involving spectrographic analysis, frequently necessitates this type of unpacking.

The solution hinges on understanding how Keras expects data to be fed.  It needs numerical data structured as tensors or arrays, typically in the shape (samples, features) for a simple input. Therefore, the unpacking process aims to extract the `float64` values and arrange them into this compliant format.  If the `float64` represents a single feature, the process is straightforward. However, if it represents multiple features or is part of a multi-dimensional representation, more complex restructuring is required.  Incorrect handling leads to shape mismatches and value errors during model training.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The unpacking strategy depends entirely on the structure of your input dataset.  We'll examine three common scenarios:

* **Scenario 1: Single `float64` as a single feature:**  If your dataset consists of multiple samples, each represented by a single `float64` value, you can simply reshape it into a 1D array. This is the simplest case.

* **Scenario 2:  Multiple `float64` objects as features:**  If each sample contains multiple `float64` values representing distinct features, these need to be concatenated or stacked into a row vector (representing a single sample) before building the dataset.

* **Scenario 3:  `float64` nested within a more complex structure (e.g., dictionary or list):**  This requires accessing the `float64` values using appropriate indexing and potentially further manipulation to create the (samples, features) structure.  Error handling must be integrated to deal with inconsistencies in the dataset structure.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Single `float64` as a single feature:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'data' is a NumPy array where each element is a single float64 value
data = np.array([1.23, 4.56, 7.89, 10.11], dtype=np.float64)

# Reshape to a column vector (samples, features) = (4, 1)
data_reshaped = data.reshape(-1, 1)

# Convert to TensorFlow tensor
data_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(data_reshaped, dtype=tf.float64)

# Verify the shape
print(data_tensor.shape)  # Output: (4, 1)

# Now 'data_tensor' can be used in a Keras dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data_tensor)
```

This example directly addresses the simplest scenario. The `reshape(-1, 1)` cleverly handles any length input by inferring the number of samples automatically.


**Example 2: Multiple `float64` objects as features:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'data' is a NumPy array where each row represents a sample with multiple float64 features.
data = np.array([[1.2, 2.3, 3.4], [4.5, 5.6, 6.7], [7.8, 8.9, 9.0]], dtype=np.float64)

# Data is already in the correct shape (samples, features)
data_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(data, dtype=tf.float64)

# Verify shape.
print(data_tensor.shape)  # Output: (3, 3)

# Create Keras dataset.
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data_tensor)
```

Here, the input data is already structured correctly, eliminating the need for reshaping. This scenario highlights the importance of pre-processing your dataset to ensure compatibility with Keras.


**Example 3: `float64` nested within a dictionary:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'data' is a list of dictionaries, each containing a 'feature' key with a float64 array.
data = [
    {'feature': np.array([1.1, 2.2, 3.3], dtype=np.float64)},
    {'feature': np.array([4.4, 5.5, 6.6], dtype=np.float64)},
    {'feature': np.array([7.7, 8.8, 9.9], dtype=np.float64)},
]

# Extract features and reshape
features = np.array([item['feature'] for item in data])
features_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(features, dtype=tf.float64)

#Verify Shape
print(features_tensor.shape) #Output: (3,3)

#Create Keras Dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(features_tensor)
```

This example demonstrates handling nested data.  Error handling (e.g., checking for the existence of the 'feature' key) would be crucial in a production environment to gracefully handle inconsistent data.  The list comprehension efficiently extracts the relevant `float64` arrays.  The subsequent conversion to a NumPy array and then a TensorFlow tensor ensures compatibility with Keras.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections covering datasets and Keras models, are invaluable resources.  Furthermore,  a strong understanding of NumPy's array manipulation capabilities is essential.  Exploring tutorials and examples focusing on data preprocessing for machine learning will further enhance your understanding.  Finally, consulting advanced texts on deep learning, particularly those covering practical aspects of model building, will provide a broader context for efficient dataset handling.
