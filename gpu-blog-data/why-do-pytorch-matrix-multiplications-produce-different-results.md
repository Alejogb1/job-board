The discrepancy in PyTorch matrix multiplication results between CPU and GPU stems primarily from the differing precisions employed in their respective computations, compounded by variations in hardware-specific optimizations and memory management.  Over my years working on large-scale deep learning projects, I've encountered this issue numerous times, often tracing it back to subtle differences in floating-point arithmetic.  While both utilize floating-point numbers, the internal representations and the handling of rounding errors differ subtly, leading to minute but potentially significant deviations in final results.

**1.  A Clear Explanation:**

The core of the problem resides in the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic.  IEEE 754, the standard governing floating-point computation, specifies different levels of precision, most notably single-precision (float32) and double-precision (float64). CPUs often default to double-precision calculations for higher accuracy, while GPUs, optimized for speed, frequently default to single-precision. This difference in precision is the most likely culprit for divergent results.  A single-precision float uses 32 bits, offering approximately 7 decimal digits of precision, whereas a double-precision float uses 64 bits, providing approximately 15-16 decimal digits. The accumulation of rounding errors during numerous multiplications and additions in matrix operations, especially in larger matrices, can magnify these subtle precision differences, resulting in noticeable discrepancies in the final output.

Further compounding this is the fact that different hardware architectures and their respective optimized libraries (e.g., cuBLAS on NVIDIA GPUs, OpenBLAS on CPUs) employ varying algorithms for matrix multiplication.  These algorithms, while aiming for the same mathematical outcome, may differ in their order of operations, leading to slightly different accumulations of rounding errors.  Furthermore, memory access patterns and caching mechanisms significantly impact performance.  GPUs, with their parallel architecture, excel at handling large matrices but may exhibit different memory access behaviours compared to CPUs.  These variations can introduce further, albeit minor, inconsistencies in the final result.

Finally, subtle differences in the implementation of PyTorch itself on CPU and GPU backends can contribute. Although PyTorch strives for consistency, low-level optimisations and the interaction with underlying libraries might introduce small variations not directly related to precision.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate the described phenomena.  They involve creating random matrices and performing matrix multiplication using both CPU and GPU devices. Note that the magnitude of differences will vary based on matrix size, values and the specific hardware used.

**Example 1: Illustrating Precision Differences:**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

# Define matrix dimensions
m, n, p = 1000, 500, 750

# Generate random matrices
A_cpu = torch.rand(m, n, dtype=torch.float64)  # Double precision on CPU
B_cpu = torch.rand(n, p, dtype=torch.float64)
A_gpu = torch.rand(m, n, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()  # Single precision on GPU
B_gpu = torch.rand(n, p, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()

# Perform matrix multiplications
C_cpu = torch.matmul(A_cpu, B_cpu)
C_gpu = torch.matmul(A_gpu, B_gpu).cpu()

# Compute the difference
diff = torch.abs(C_cpu - C_gpu)
print(f"Maximum absolute difference: {diff.max().item()}")
print(f"Average absolute difference: {diff.mean().item()}")

#Optional: for a more in-depth analysis, compare with NumPy which uses double precision by default:
A_np = np.random.rand(m,n)
B_np = np.random.rand(n,p)
C_np = np.matmul(A_np, B_np)
C_np_torch = torch.from_numpy(C_np)
diff_np = torch.abs(C_cpu - C_np_torch)
print(f"Maximum absolute difference (CPU vs NumPy): {diff_np.max().item()}")
```

This code explicitly sets the data type to highlight the effect of precision. The output shows the maximum and average absolute difference between the CPU and GPU results.  The larger the matrices, the more pronounced the differences are likely to be.



**Example 2: Demonstrating Algorithm Variation Influence:**

This example is difficult to reproduce reliably without accessing the inner workings of cuBLAS and OpenBLAS. However, the concept can be illustrated by simulating slightly different order of operations.  Note that this is a simplification and doesn't perfectly represent the complexities of the underlying libraries.

```python
import torch

#Simplified Example demonstrating the possibility of order of operations impacting results

A = torch.rand(3,3)
B = torch.rand(3,3)

#Simulate slightly different computation order (this is a simplification)
C_cpu = torch.matmul(A,B)  #Standard matmul
C_gpu_sim = torch.matmul(A.T, B.T).T #Simulate a different computation pathway


diff = torch.abs(C_cpu - C_gpu_sim)
print(f"Difference due to simulated algorithmic variation: {diff}")
```

This example, while not perfectly replicating the actual differences due to algorithmic choices, highlights how the sequence of operations in matrix multiplication can potentially lead to different results due to the accumulation of rounding errors.



**Example 3: Highlighting the Impact of Data Transfer:**

```python
import torch

# Create a matrix on the CPU
A_cpu = torch.rand(1000, 1000)
B_cpu = torch.rand(1000, 1000)

# Move the matrices to the GPU
A_gpu = A_cpu.cuda()
B_gpu = B_cpu.cuda()

# Perform matrix multiplication on the GPU
C_gpu = torch.matmul(A_gpu, B_gpu)

# Move the result back to the CPU
C_cpu_from_gpu = C_gpu.cpu()

# Perform matrix multiplication on the CPU
C_cpu = torch.matmul(A_cpu, B_cpu)

# Compare the results
diff = torch.abs(C_cpu - C_cpu_from_gpu)
print(f"Maximum absolute difference after GPU computation and data transfer: {diff.max().item()}")
```

This example shows how the process of transferring data between CPU and GPU memory can introduce minor discrepancies.  While not directly due to the computation itself, data transfer can slightly alter the representation of floating-point values, adding to the overall deviation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The IEEE 754 standard documentation.
*  A comprehensive linear algebra textbook covering numerical stability and floating-point arithmetic.
* Advanced PyTorch documentation focusing on low-level details of tensor operations and hardware interactions.  The documentation on CUDA interaction would also be beneficial.


In conclusion, the differences in PyTorch matrix multiplication results between CPU and GPU are a multifaceted issue primarily driven by differences in floating-point precision, variations in optimized algorithms employed by different hardware architectures and libraries, and the intricacies of data transfer between CPU and GPU memory.  Understanding these factors is crucial for interpreting results and ensuring numerical stability in large-scale computations.
