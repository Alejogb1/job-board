TensorFlow import errors on Windows 7 frequently stem from underlying system incompatibilities, rather than solely TensorFlow-specific issues.  My experience troubleshooting this across numerous legacy projects revealed that the most common culprits are outdated Visual C++ Redistributables and conflicting Python installations.  Addressing these foundational elements is paramount before delving into more complex TensorFlow configurations.

**1.  Comprehensive Explanation:**

The core of the problem lies in TensorFlow's reliance on a robust and specific underlying software environment.  Windows 7, while possessing a substantial legacy, lacks native support for many of the newer features and optimizations employed by TensorFlow's underlying libraries.  Consequently, installation failures often manifest as import errors, masking the true root cause.

Firstly, TensorFlow is built upon numerous libraries, primarily relying on a compatible version of the Visual C++ Redistributable packages. These packages provide essential runtime components for various C++ libraries used within TensorFlow's architecture.  Mismatched or missing versions are a frequent source of import failures.  A simple check for existing installations is often overlooked.  It's crucial to ensure that the appropriate versions, as specified in the TensorFlow documentation for your specific TensorFlow version, are installed and up-to-date.  In my experience, a clean uninstall and reinstall of these packages, often performed using the official Microsoft installer, is frequently the most effective solution.

Secondly, inconsistent Python environments can severely complicate TensorFlow installation. Multiple Python installations, especially with variations in architecture (32-bit versus 64-bit) or conflicting package managers (pip, conda), can result in import errors. This is further compounded by the potential for incompatible versions of crucial dependencies like NumPy and SciPy.  The solution here often requires a strategic approach: identifying the primary Python installation designated for TensorFlow, removing any conflicting installations, and ensuring all required packages are installed within that specific environment using a consistent package manager (I generally prefer conda for its superior environment management capabilities).

Finally, environment variables can play a significant role, particularly the `PATH` variable.  Incorrectly configured environment variables can prevent the system from locating essential TensorFlow DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries).  This usually results in obscure `ImportError` messages related to the inability to load a specific module.  Verifying that the directory containing the TensorFlow DLLs is included in the system's `PATH` variable is crucial.  Similarly, the correct Python installation directory needs to be reflected in the `PATH` variable to ensure the Python interpreter is accessible system-wide.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate practical solutions within a Python environment. These examples assume you have already installed TensorFlow (if the installation itself is the issue, refer to the preceding explanation on prerequisites).  These solutions are illustrated using `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.

**Example 1: Checking for TensorFlow Installation and Version:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
try:
    print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
    print(f"TensorFlow installation path: {tf.__file__}")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"TensorFlow import error: {e}")
    print("Ensure TensorFlow is correctly installed and added to your Python path.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

This example attempts to import TensorFlow and displays its version and installation path if successful. Otherwise, it provides informative error messages.  The `try-except` block ensures the script doesn't crash upon failure, instead providing helpful debugging information.

**Example 2:  Verifying NumPy Installation:**

```python
import numpy as np
try:
    print(f"NumPy version: {np.__version__}")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"NumPy import error: {e}")
    print("Install NumPy using pip install numpy or conda install numpy.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

NumPy is a fundamental dependency for TensorFlow. This code snippet verifies its presence and version.  If NumPy is missing, the error message provides instructions for its installation using either `pip` or `conda`.  Again, the error handling prevents script termination upon failure.

**Example 3:  Checking for conflicting Python environments (using `where` command):**

This example is not executable Python code but rather a command-line instruction to identify potential issues with multiple Python installations.

```bash
where python
```

(Replace `python` with `python3` if necessary). On Windows, executing this command in the command prompt or PowerShell will list all paths where a Python executable is found. Multiple entries often indicate conflicting installations, potentially leading to TensorFlow import errors.  Resolving this typically involves removing redundant or older installations, leaving only one primary Python installation designated for TensorFlow.  It is crucial to select the appropriate architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) to match your TensorFlow installation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable website, and the documentation for your chosen Python package manager (pip or conda) provide invaluable resources for troubleshooting and resolving these kinds of issues.  Consulting these resources directly will provide the most accurate and up-to-date guidance for your specific TensorFlow version and Windows 7 configuration.  Furthermore, community forums dedicated to TensorFlow and Python can provide assistance from experienced users facing similar problems.  Reviewing relevant error messages carefully and searching online using specific error codes can often lead to readily available solutions.
