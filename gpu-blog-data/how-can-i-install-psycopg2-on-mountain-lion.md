The successful installation of psycopg2 on older macOS systems like Mountain Lion (10.8) often hinges on the precise versioning of PostgreSQL and its associated development libraries. My experience working on legacy systems highlights the critical need for meticulous attention to dependency management, particularly when dealing with older Python versions which might be prevalent in such environments.  Ignoring these dependencies leads to frequent compilation errors.  Therefore, a straightforward `brew install psycopg2` might not suffice.

**1.  Explanation:**

The process involves three main steps: installing PostgreSQL, ensuring the development libraries are available, and then using pip to install psycopg2.  The key to success is recognizing that psycopg2 requires the PostgreSQL client library headers during compilation.  A simple `brew install postgresql` might install a server but not necessarily the necessary development files.  Furthermore, the specific versions of PostgreSQL and Python must be carefully considered for compatibility.  Mountain Lionâ€™s limited support for newer software packages demands that we utilize package managers like Homebrew adeptly.

Homebrew serves as our primary tool for managing system-level dependencies. Its package manager capabilities are essential for installing PostgreSQL and its related development files, which are commonly omitted in basic server installations.  Pip, the Python package installer, then leverages these system-level components to compile and install psycopg2.  Without the correct development packages, pip's compilation step will fail.  The error messages will typically indicate missing headers or libraries, directing us towards the crucial dependency issue.

Furthermore, we must carefully consider Python version compatibility.  While modern Python versions are preferable for various reasons (security updates, features), using the version available and suitable for the Mountain Lion environment is crucial to avoid conflicts.  Attempting to force a modern Python interpreter might conflict with existing system dependencies.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Installation using PostgreSQL 9.3 (Illustrative)**

This example assumes you're working with Python 2.7 (a common version for Mountain Lion), and it targets PostgreSQL 9.3, acknowledging that later versions might be incompatible.

```bash
# Install PostgreSQL 9.3 and its development packages.  The `--devel` flag is crucial.
brew install postgresql93 --devel

# Ensure PostgreSQL is running, this is crucial to prevent errors
brew services run postgresql93

# Install the Python development headers (important for compilation)
xcode-select --install  # May prompt for Xcode installation or update

# Install psycopg2 using pip.  Specifying Python 2.7 using the `-p` flag.  (Adapt as necessary if you're not using Python 2.7).
pip2 install psycopg2-binary

# Verify installation (replace with your database credentials)
python2 -c "import psycopg2; conn = psycopg2.connect('dbname=your_database user=your_user password=your_password'); cur = conn.cursor(); cur.close(); conn.close()"
```

**Commentary:** The `--devel` flag in the `brew install postgresql93` command ensures the installation of the development libraries needed for compilation.  The explicit use of `pip2` guarantees that psycopg2 is installed for the Python 2.7 interpreter. The `xcode-select --install` command is critical because it ensures that the Xcode command-line tools, including essential compiler components, are installed. This step is frequently overlooked and may cause compilation to fail.


**Example 2:  Handling potential errors and version mismatches:**

Even with the correct dependencies, version mismatches can cause problems. This example demonstrates a more robust approach:

```bash
# Check the currently installed PostgreSQL version
brew list postgresql

# Check Python version
python --version

# If PostgreSQL version is not 9.3, install it with --devel
# Example, if the installed version is 9.6
brew uninstall postgresql
brew install postgresql93 --devel
brew services run postgresql93


# Install psycopg2, handling potential errors
pip2 install psycopg2-binary
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "psycopg2 installation failed.  Check for conflicting packages or missing dependencies."
    exit 1
fi

# Verify installation (check for appropriate version)
python2 -c "import psycopg2; print(psycopg2.__version__);"
```

**Commentary:** This example includes error handling, checking the return code of `pip2 install` to detect any problems. The example also suggests uninstalling conflicting versions of PostgreSQL before installing the correct one.  It emphasizes the necessity to verify the installation by printing the psycopg2 version.

**Example 3:  Using a specific psycopg2 version (if needed):**

If you encounter issues with the latest psycopg2 version, you can specify a particular version:

```bash
# Find compatible psycopg2 version (check psycopg2's release notes and PostgreSQL version compatibility)
# Example: Let's assume psycopg2==2.8.5 is suitable for PostgreSQL 9.3 and Python 2.7

pip2 install psycopg2==2.8.5

#Verify the installed version
python2 -c "import psycopg2; print(psycopg2.__version__);"
```

**Commentary:**  This approach is essential if you encounter compatibility problems with the latest psycopg2 version.  Referencing the psycopg2 release notes is critical to identify a version compatible with your specific PostgreSQL and Python setup.  Always verify the installation after each step to ensure the package has been installed correctly and the version matches the intended one.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official PostgreSQL documentation.
*   The official psycopg2 documentation.
*   The Homebrew documentation.
*   The Python documentation.
*   Xcode documentation (specifically, the command-line tools section).


By following these steps and carefully managing dependencies, installing psycopg2 on Mountain Lion using brew and pip becomes achievable. Remember, meticulous attention to versioning and a systematic approach are key to overcoming the challenges presented by older operating systems and their associated software ecosystems.  Always check for error messages and consult the respective documentation for any unresolved issues.
