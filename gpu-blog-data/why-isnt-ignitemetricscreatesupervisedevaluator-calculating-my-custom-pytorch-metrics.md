The root cause of `ignite.metrics.create_supervised_evaluator` failing to calculate custom PyTorch metrics often stems from a mismatch between the metric's expected input format and the output of your model and the data loader.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects involving complex deep learning models and custom evaluation strategies,  this discrepancy is almost always the culprit.  The `create_supervised_evaluator` expects specific output structures from your model and assumes a standard data loader format; failing to adhere to this leads to incorrect metric calculations, often producing zeros or NaN values.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`ignite.metrics.create_supervised_evaluator` simplifies the process of evaluating models trained with PyTorch.  It assumes a supervised learning context where your model outputs predictions and your data loader provides inputs and ground truth labels. The function then automatically feeds these into your specified metrics, handling the iteration over batches. However, this automation hinges on a strict input format.  The `update` method of most Ignite metrics (including custom ones) expects two inputs:  `y_pred` (predictions from your model) and `y` (ground truth labels).  The critical aspects are the data types and shapes of these tensors.


* **`y_pred`:** This should typically be a tensor of predicted probabilities (for classification) or raw predictions (for regression).  The crucial aspect is its dimensionality. For multi-class classification, it should be a tensor of shape `(batch_size, num_classes)`, representing probabilities for each class for every sample in the batch. For binary classification, a tensor of shape `(batch_size,)` representing probabilities or logits is usually acceptable. Regression problems might require a tensor of shape `(batch_size, 1)` for single output predictions or `(batch_size, num_outputs)` for multiple outputs.

* **`y`:** This should be a tensor containing the ground truth labels. The shape should align with the shape of the predictions. For multi-class classification, this is usually a tensor of shape `(batch_size,)` representing the index of the correct class for each sample.  For binary classification, a shape of `(batch_size,)` with binary labels (0 or 1) is typically used. Regression demands a tensor with the same shape as the output of the model.

Any deviation from these expected formats—different data types (e.g., `torch.float32` vs. `torch.float64`), unexpected dimensions, or mismatched shapes between predictions and labels—will lead to incorrect metric calculations.  Furthermore, problems can arise from incorrect handling of model outputs (e.g., forgetting to apply a sigmoid or softmax activation function).

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Implementation for Binary Classification:**

```python
import torch
from ignite.metrics import Accuracy, Loss, create_supervised_evaluator
from torch import nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
# Define a simple binary classification model
class BinaryClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(BinaryClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

model = BinaryClassifier()
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
accuracy = Accuracy()
loss = Loss(criterion)
evaluator = create_supervised_evaluator(model, metrics={'accuracy': accuracy, 'loss': loss}, device="cpu")

# Sample data
X = torch.randn(32, 10)
y = torch.randint(0, 2, (32,)).float()

evaluator.run([[X, y]])
metrics = evaluator.state.metrics
print(f"Accuracy: {metrics['accuracy']}, Loss: {metrics['loss']}")
```
This example uses `BCEWithLogitsLoss`, which handles sigmoid activation internally. The output from the model is directly used; the shapes are compatible because we've designed the model and the data to match the expectations of the evaluator and the metrics.


**Example 2: Incorrect Implementation: Shape Mismatch:**

```python
import torch
from ignite.metrics import Accuracy, create_supervised_evaluator
# ... (Model definition from Example 1) ...

evaluator = create_supervised_evaluator(model, metrics={'accuracy': Accuracy()}, device="cpu")

# Incorrect data shape – predictions are two-dimensional
X = torch.randn(32, 10)
y = torch.randint(0, 2, (32, 1)).float() #  Shape mismatch will cause errors

evaluator.run([[X, y]]) # This will raise an error or produce meaningless results.
```

Here, a shape mismatch between `y_pred` (which would be (32,1) from the model) and `y` (which is (32,1)) will lead to an error or incorrect results.  Ignite's error handling might not always explicitly indicate the shape mismatch, so careful attention to the structure of both predictions and labels is essential.


**Example 3: Incorrect Implementation: Missing Activation Function:**

```python
import torch
from ignite.metrics import Accuracy, create_supervised_evaluator
from torch import nn
# ... (Model definition from Example 1) ...

evaluator = create_supervised_evaluator(model, metrics={'accuracy': Accuracy()}, device="cpu")

X = torch.randn(32, 10)
y = torch.randint(0, 2, (32,)).float()
# Apply sigmoid for proper probability output
evaluator.run([[X,y]])

metrics = evaluator.state.metrics

#  Missing sigmoid will likely lead to inaccurate accuracy,
# as the raw logits are not suitable for direct comparison with binary labels.
print(f"Accuracy: {metrics['accuracy']}")
```

This demonstrates a common error.  The binary classifier outputs logits; applying `torch.sigmoid` is crucial before feeding these logits to the `Accuracy` metric, which expects probabilities.  Omitting the sigmoid function leads to incorrect accuracy calculation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation, the Ignite documentation, and the relevant documentation for specific metrics (like `Accuracy` and `Loss`) are invaluable. Exploring the source code of Ignite metrics can also be highly informative for understanding input expectations. Consult books on deep learning and PyTorch for a comprehensive understanding of model building, data handling, and evaluation strategies.


In summary, meticulously inspecting the shapes and data types of your model's predictions and your ground truth labels is paramount.  Ensure your data loader and model output are compatible with the assumptions made by `ignite.metrics.create_supervised_evaluator` and the chosen metrics to avoid common pitfalls.  Debugging often involves adding print statements to inspect intermediate results (shapes, values, data types) to pinpoint the source of the problem. This systematic debugging approach, honed from years of wrestling with similar issues, provides the most effective strategy for troubleshooting these kinds of challenges.
