TensorFlow 1.x's reliance on `tf.Session` and static computational graphs fundamentally differs from TensorFlow 2.x's eager execution and imperative programming style.  This core architectural shift is the primary reason why the automatic conversion tools often fall short, necessitating manual intervention for complex projects.  In my experience migrating several large-scale production models from TensorFlow 1.0 to 2.0,  the most frequent hurdles stem from custom operations, intricate graph structures, and the management of variable scopes.

**1.  Understanding the Core Differences and Migration Strategies:**

The automatic conversion process, primarily using the `tf.compat.v1` module, aims to translate the 1.x syntax into equivalent 2.x operations. However, this automated approach struggles with cases involving highly customized layers, complex control flow within the graph, or the use of deprecated functions that lack direct 2.x counterparts.  Manual migration, therefore, becomes essential.  This involves a phased approach:

* **Phase 1: Dependency Resolution and Compatibility Checks:**  Begin by identifying all dependencies within your 1.x codebase.  Check for outdated libraries and replace them with their 2.x equivalents.  Tools like `pip-compile` and `pip-tools` can aid in dependency management during this phase.  Thorough testing after each dependency update is crucial.

* **Phase 2: Session Management and Eager Execution:** This is where the most significant changes occur.  The entire `tf.Session` management paradigm needs to be removed.  Instead, embrace eager execution, where operations are executed immediately.  This usually involves refactoring code to remove `with tf.Session()` blocks and running operations directly.

* **Phase 3:  Graph-Level Transformations:**  If your 1.x code relies heavily on graph manipulations using functions like `tf.get_default_graph()`, manual rewriting is unavoidable.  The concept of a default graph is absent in TensorFlow 2.x.  Functions must be explicitly defined and operations managed within their respective scopes.

* **Phase 4: Variable Handling and Scope Management:**  Variable scope management in TensorFlow 1.x was handled using `tf.variable_scope` and `tf.get_variable`.  These are replaced by `tf.Variable` and the more modern approach to creating and managing variables within the context of functions and classes.  Pay close attention to variable reuse and name collisions.

* **Phase 5:  Custom Operation Adaptation:**  This is often the most challenging part.  Custom operations written for TensorFlow 1.x often require significant rewriting to ensure compatibility.  This usually involves reimplementing the functionality using TensorFlow 2.xâ€™s APIs and data structures.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Converting a simple `tf.Session` based model:**

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x code
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    a = tf.constant(5)
    b = tf.constant(10)
    c = a + b
    print(sess.run(c))


# TensorFlow 2.x equivalent
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(10)
c = a + b
print(c)
```

*Commentary:*  This simple example highlights the elimination of `tf.Session`.  The operation is executed immediately in 2.x due to eager execution.


**Example 2:  Migrating a model with custom layers (TensorFlow 1.x):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.compat.v1.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__()

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.compat.v1.layers.dense(inputs, units=10)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    layer = MyLayer()
    input_tensor = tf.constant([[1,2,3]])
    output = layer(input_tensor)
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    print(sess.run(output))
```

**TensorFlow 2.x Equivalent:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyLayer, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)

layer = MyLayer()
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1,2,3]])
output = layer(input_tensor)
print(output)
```

*Commentary:*  Here, the custom layer is adapted to use the Keras `Layer` class, offering better integration with the TensorFlow 2.x ecosystem.  Note the use of `tf.keras.layers.Dense` instead of the deprecated `tf.compat.v1.layers.dense`.  Variable initialization is implicit in 2.x.


**Example 3:  Handling Control Flow (TensorFlow 1.x):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32)
y = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    with tf.compat.v1.control_dependencies([x,y]):
        z = tf.cond(tf.greater(x,y), lambda: x*2, lambda: y*3)
        print(sess.run(z, feed_dict={x:5, y:2}))
```

**TensorFlow 2.x Equivalent:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(5.0)
y = tf.Variable(2.0)

def f1():
  return x * 2

def f2():
  return y * 3

z = tf.cond(tf.greater(x,y), f1, f2)
print(z)
```

*Commentary:*  The control flow, previously managed within a session, is now implemented using `tf.cond`.  The use of placeholders is replaced with `tf.Variable` for better integration with eager execution.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow migration guide.  The TensorFlow API documentation for both 1.x and 2.x.  Books on TensorFlow 2.x focusing on practical aspects of model building and deployment.  Extensive testing frameworks such as pytest for rigorous code validation.

My experience has consistently shown that manual migration, while demanding more effort upfront, offers greater control and clearer understanding of the resulting code.  The key lies in a methodical approach that prioritizes careful dependency analysis, a thorough grasp of eager execution, and meticulous attention to detail during the rewriting of custom components and control flow sections.  This strategy ensures a robust and maintainable TensorFlow 2.x implementation.
