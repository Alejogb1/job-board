The core distinction between `sample_weights` and `sample_weight` in Keras' `model.fit` lies in their dimensionality and intended application.  `sample_weight` is a one-dimensional array, directly scaling the loss contribution of each individual training sample.  `sample_weights`, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional array, enabling sample-wise weighting across multiple loss components in a multi-output or multi-loss model.  This crucial difference often leads to confusion, especially when dealing with models featuring multiple outputs or custom loss functions.  My experience debugging complex neural networks for anomaly detection in high-frequency financial data highlighted this distinction repeatedly.

During my time developing trading algorithms, I encountered numerous instances where improperly applying these weighting mechanisms resulted in unexpected model behavior, leading to significant performance degradation. Specifically, using `sample_weight` in a multi-output model, expecting it to act as `sample_weights`, frequently led to incorrect loss calculations and suboptimal training. Understanding this dimensionality difference is paramount for correctly leveraging sample weighting in Keras.

**1. Clear Explanation**

`sample_weight` is designed for single-output models or scenarios where a single loss function is used. It's a NumPy array of the same length as your training data, where each element represents the weight assigned to the corresponding training sample.  A weight of 2.0 would mean that particular sample contributes twice as much to the overall loss calculation than a sample with a weight of 1.0.  This is helpful for handling class imbalance, giving more importance to under-represented classes, or prioritizing specific data points based on domain expertise.

`sample_weights`, however, is reserved for multi-output or multi-loss scenarios. Itâ€™s a 2D array with shape (samples, outputs). Each row corresponds to a training sample, and each column represents the weight for that sample's contribution to a particular output or loss function.  This allows for independent weighting of each sample's influence on different aspects of the model's prediction. For instance, in a model predicting both price and volume, one might assign higher weights to price accuracy, reflecting its greater importance in the trading strategy.

Failure to understand this dimensionality leads to errors. Providing a 2D `sample_weights` array to a single-output model will result in an error, while providing a 1D `sample_weight` to a multi-output model will lead to incorrect loss calculations, as the single weight will be applied uniformly across all outputs for each sample.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Single-output model with `sample_weight`**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Simple single-output model
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(1)
])
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')

# Sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Sample weights - emphasizing certain samples
sample_weight = np.random.uniform(0.5, 1.5, size=100)

# Training with sample weights
model.fit(X, y, sample_weight=sample_weight, epochs=10)
```
This example demonstrates the use of `sample_weight` in a straightforward single-output regression model.  The `sample_weight` array directly scales the contribution of each data point to the mean squared error loss.


**Example 2: Multi-output model with `sample_weights`**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Multi-output model
model = keras.Model(inputs=keras.Input(shape=(10,)), outputs=[
    Dense(5, activation='sigmoid')(Dense(64, activation='relu')(keras.Input(shape=(10,)))),
    Dense(2, activation='linear')(Dense(32, activation='relu')(keras.Input(shape=(10,))))
])
model.compile(loss=['binary_crossentropy', 'mse'], optimizer='adam')


# Sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y1 = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100, 5)) # Binary classification
y2 = np.random.rand(100, 2) # Regression

# Sample weights for each output
sample_weights = np.random.uniform(0.8, 1.2, size=(100, 2))

# Training with sample_weights
model.fit(X, [y1, y2], sample_weight=sample_weights, epochs=10)

```
This showcases `sample_weights` for a model with two outputs, one binary classification and one regression task.  The `sample_weights` array is two-dimensional, with each column representing weights for a specific output. This allows differential weighting of the loss contribution of each sample to the classification and regression components.  Note the list structure in `model.fit` reflecting the multiple outputs.


**Example 3:  Handling Missing Weights**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(1)
])
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')

X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Simulate missing weights for some samples
sample_weight = np.random.uniform(0.5, 1.5, size=100)
sample_weight[50:75] = np.nan


# Keras handles NaN values appropriately, ignoring them
model.fit(X, y, sample_weight=sample_weight, epochs=10)

```
This demonstrates how Keras handles missing weights (`NaN`) in the `sample_weight` array.  It gracefully ignores these samples during the loss calculation, effectively reducing the effective batch size.  This robustness is essential in real-world scenarios where data quality might be an issue.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official Keras documentation is the primary resource.  Consult the documentation on `model.fit` specifically, paying close attention to the parameters `sample_weight` and `sample_weights`.  Supplement this with reputable machine learning textbooks focusing on neural network training and loss functions.  Understanding the underlying mathematics of gradient descent and backpropagation will greatly aid in interpreting the effects of sample weighting.  Finally, examining example code repositories and tutorials from well-respected sources can provide valuable practical insights.  Remember to critically evaluate any code found online before integrating it into your own projects.
