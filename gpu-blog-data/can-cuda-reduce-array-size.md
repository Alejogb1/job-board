Directly addressing the question of CUDA's ability to reduce array size: CUDA itself doesn't offer a direct function to shrink an array's size in the same way a `resize()` method might in standard C++.  Memory allocation and management on the GPU are fundamentally different from CPU-based approaches.  However, CUDA facilitates efficient techniques to achieve the *effect* of array size reduction, primarily through selective data copying and reallocation.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects involving large-scale simulations has shown this to be a crucial optimization strategy.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The challenge arises from CUDA's reliance on allocating memory on the device (GPU) explicitly. Once memory is allocated, it cannot be directly resized.  Attempting to write beyond the allocated bounds results in undefined behavior, potentially leading to crashes or corrupted data. Therefore, reducing the effective size of a CUDA array involves these key steps:

* **Identifying the subset of data:** Determine which elements of the original array are necessary for subsequent computations. This requires analysis of the algorithm and data dependencies.
* **Allocating new memory:** Allocate a new CUDA array on the device with the reduced size.
* **Copying relevant data:** Transfer the selected elements from the original array to the newly allocated smaller array.
* **Deallocating old memory:** Release the memory occupied by the original, larger array to prevent memory leaks.

This approach, while seemingly more involved than a simple `resize()`, is often more efficient than unnecessarily processing a large array, especially when dealing with the massive datasets common in GPU-accelerated applications. The overhead of data transfer and memory management is significantly outweighed by the reduction in computational time.  Furthermore, it aligns with the principle of minimizing data movement between host (CPU) and device (GPU) memory, which is critical for performance optimization.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate the reduction of array size using different CUDA approaches.  I've focused on clarity and best practices gained from years of experience troubleshooting performance bottlenecks.

**Example 1:  Using `cudaMemcpy` for direct data transfer:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int *h_data, *d_data, *d_reduced_data;
    int size = 1024;
    int reduced_size = 512;

    // Allocate host memory
    h_data = (int*)malloc(size * sizeof(int));
    // ... Initialize h_data ...

    // Allocate device memory
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, size * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_reduced_data, reduced_size * sizeof(int));

    // Copy data to device
    cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Copy the first half to the reduced array (example reduction)
    cudaMemcpy(d_reduced_data, d_data, reduced_size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);

    // ... Perform computations on d_reduced_data ...

    // Free device memory
    cudaFree(d_data);
    cudaFree(d_reduced_data);
    free(h_data);

    return 0;
}
```

This example directly uses `cudaMemcpy` to copy a portion of the original array to a smaller one.  The `reduced_size` variable explicitly controls the amount of data transferred.  Error checking (omitted for brevity) is crucial in production code to handle potential CUDA errors.

**Example 2: Utilizing a kernel function for selective copying:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void reduceArray(int* input, int* output, int size, int reduced_size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < reduced_size) {
        output[i] = input[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    // ... Memory allocation as in Example 1 ...

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (reduced_size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    reduceArray<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, d_reduced_data, size, reduced_size);

    // ... Error checking and further operations ...

    // ... Memory deallocation as in Example 1 ...
    return 0;
}
```

This approach leverages the parallel processing capabilities of CUDA. The kernel function `reduceArray` copies elements selectively based on the thread's index, providing finer-grained control over the reduction process. This is particularly beneficial for more complex reduction strategies.

**Example 3: Dynamic allocation within a kernel for advanced scenarios:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void dynamicReduction(int* input, int size, int* output, int* outputSize) {
    // This is a simplified illustration, complex logic would be needed for dynamic size determination within the kernel
    if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
        // Determine reduced size based on data characteristics in the kernel
        *outputSize = size / 2; // Example: Halving the size.  Replace with actual logic.
        cudaMalloc((void**) output, (*outputSize) * sizeof(int));
        // Copy relevant data
        // ... sophisticated copying logic here ...
    }
}

int main() {
  // ... Memory Allocation ...

  int outputSize; // to hold the size of the new array
  int *h_outputSize = &outputSize;
  int *d_outputSize;

  cudaMalloc((void**) &d_outputSize, sizeof(int));

  dynamicReduction<<<1,1>>>(d_data, size, d_reduced_data, d_outputSize);

  cudaMemcpy(h_outputSize, d_outputSize, sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // ... further work with h_outputSize, d_reduced_data and deallocate memory ...

  return 0;
}
```


This example, while conceptually illustrating dynamic allocation within a kernel, requires careful consideration of synchronization and error handling.  The actual logic for determining `reduced_size` within the kernel would depend heavily on the specific application requirements.  I've encountered situations where analyzing data characteristics within the kernel allowed for significant size optimization, albeit with increased kernel complexity.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA C Programming Guide, the CUDA Best Practices Guide, and the relevant sections of a comprehensive text on parallel programming techniques.  Thorough understanding of memory management within CUDA is critical.  Focusing on optimizing memory transfers and minimizing data movement is paramount for achieving true performance gains.  Familiarizing yourself with different memory allocation strategies (e.g., pinned memory) can improve performance further.  Finally, using performance analysis tools (like NVIDIA Nsight) is invaluable for identifying and resolving bottlenecks in CUDA code.
