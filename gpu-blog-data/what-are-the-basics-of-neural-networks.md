Neural networks, at their core, are fundamentally about approximating complex functions through interconnected nodes arranged in layers.  This approximation leverages the power of distributed processing and adaptable weights to learn patterns from data, a capacity that distinguishes them from traditional algorithmic approaches. My experience implementing and optimizing these networks across various projects, particularly in time series prediction and image classification, has underscored this foundational principle.

The basic building block is the perceptron, a single node that performs a weighted sum of its inputs and applies an activation function to produce an output. This seemingly simple unit, when connected in layers, forms the architecture of a neural network.  The weights associated with each connection are the parameters the network learns during training.  The learning process involves iteratively adjusting these weights to minimize the difference between the network's predictions and the actual values in the training data, a process commonly achieved through backpropagation.

Let's clarify this through distinct network architectures.  A single perceptron is insufficient for complex tasks.  Therefore, we build multi-layered networks, known as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) or feedforward neural networks.  In these networks, the output of one layer serves as the input for the next, forming a directed acyclic graph. The initial layer is the input layer, receiving the raw data; the final layer is the output layer, producing the network's prediction; and the layers between are called hidden layers, responsible for extracting increasingly complex features from the input data.

**1.  Simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in Python using NumPy:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Define activation function (sigmoid)
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Define derivative of activation function
def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return x * (1 - x)

# Initialize weights randomly
input_size = 2
hidden_size = 3
output_size = 1
weights_input_hidden = np.random.rand(input_size, hidden_size)
weights_hidden_output = np.random.rand(hidden_size, output_size)

# Forward propagation
def forward_propagate(X):
    hidden_layer_input = np.dot(X, weights_input_hidden)
    hidden_layer_output = sigmoid(hidden_layer_input)
    output_layer_input = np.dot(hidden_layer_output, weights_hidden_output)
    output_layer_output = sigmoid(output_layer_input)
    return hidden_layer_output, output_layer_output

# Backpropagation (simplified example â€“ omits bias terms for clarity)
def backpropagate(X, y, hidden_layer_output, output_layer_output, learning_rate):
    error = y - output_layer_output
    d_output = error * sigmoid_derivative(output_layer_output)
    error_hidden_layer = d_output.dot(weights_hidden_output.T)
    d_hidden_layer = error_hidden_layer * sigmoid_derivative(hidden_layer_output)

    weights_hidden_output += hidden_layer_output.T.dot(d_output) * learning_rate
    weights_input_hidden += X.T.dot(d_hidden_layer) * learning_rate

# Training data
X = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]])
y = np.array([[0], [1], [1], [0]]) # XOR gate example

# Training loop (simplified)
learning_rate = 0.1
epochs = 10000
for _ in range(epochs):
    hidden_layer_output, output_layer_output = forward_propagate(X)
    backpropagate(X, y, hidden_layer_output, output_layer_output, learning_rate)

#Prediction
print(forward_propagate(np.array([[1,0]]))[1])

```

This example showcases a rudimentary MLP implementation using NumPy.  It lacks crucial elements like bias nodes and sophisticated optimization algorithms, but serves to illustrate the core principles of forward and backward propagation.  The limitations are deliberate to focus on core concepts.


**2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Conceptual Overview:**

CNNs excel in processing grid-like data, like images. Unlike MLPs, CNNs employ convolutional layers that utilize filters (kernels) to extract features from the input data. These filters slide across the input, applying a weighted sum to each local region.  This process effectively identifies patterns regardless of their position within the input.  Pooling layers then reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps, making the network more robust to variations in the input.  Finally, fully connected layers aggregate the extracted features to produce the final output.


**3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for Sequence Data:**

Recurrent neural networks are designed for sequential data, where the order of the data points is crucial.  RNNs utilize internal memory (hidden state) to maintain information from previous time steps, allowing them to process sequences effectively.  The hidden state is updated at each time step, influenced by both the current input and the previous hidden state.  This memory mechanism is crucial for tasks involving sequences, such as natural language processing and time series forecasting.  However, simple RNNs suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients, limitations often addressed by architectures like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units).

The implementation of a full RNN or CNN would be lengthy and beyond the scope of a concise explanation.  Existing libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch significantly simplify their implementation.  These frameworks provide optimized routines for both forward and backward propagation, eliminating the need for manual implementation of gradient calculations.
