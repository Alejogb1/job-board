The inherent limitation of standard Keras loss functions is their operation solely on predicted and target outputs.  They lack direct access to input features.  However, this limitation can be circumvented using custom loss functions and leveraging Keras's backend capabilities.  Over the years, I've encountered numerous scenarios requiring this functionality, primarily in problems involving weighted regression and context-aware loss calculations.  The key is to explicitly incorporate the input data into the loss calculation within a custom loss function.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Keras's `compile` method accepts a `loss` argument, typically a pre-defined function like `mse` or `categorical_crossentropy`.  These functions receive two arguments: `y_true` (the ground truth) and `y_pred` (the model's prediction).  To utilize input data, we must create a custom loss function that accepts a third argument, representing the input features. This necessitates accessing the input tensor within the custom function.  This is achieved using Keras's backend functionality, specifically `backend.concatenate` or similar functions depending on the desired operation.  The input tensor needs to be passed explicitly during the `compile` stage; it is not automatically available within the loss function.  The structure looks like this:  The model must be defined such that the input layer is accessible.  This is usually trivial with sequential models but requires careful consideration with functional or subclassing APIs. The input is then passed as the third argument to the custom loss function.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Weighted MSE based on Input Feature:**

This example demonstrates a weighted mean squared error where the weight is determined by an input feature.  Imagine a scenario where we predict house prices, and the weight should be higher for larger houses (indicated by square footage).

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_mse(y_true, y_pred, input_data):
    # Assuming input_data[:, 0] contains square footage
    weights = input_data[:, 0]  
    weights = K.clip(weights, K.epsilon(), 1000) # avoid numerical instability with very small weights

    squared_error = K.square(y_pred - y_true)
    weighted_error = squared_error * weights
    return K.mean(weighted_error)

# Model definition (simplified example)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), #10 features
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1) #single output
])

# Accessing input layer
input_layer_name = model.layers[0].name

# Compile with custom loss and explicit input
model.compile(loss=lambda y_true, y_pred: weighted_mse(y_true, y_pred, model.input), optimizer='adam')

# Training data
X = np.random.rand(100,10)
y = np.random.rand(100,1)

# Assuming the first column in X represents square footage
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)

```

**Commentary:**  This code highlights several important aspects. First, the `weighted_mse` function explicitly takes `input_data` as an argument. Second, `K.clip` is crucial for numerical stability; it prevents extremely small weights from causing issues.  Third,  the lambda function in `model.compile` passes the model's input to the custom loss function.  This requires the proper input shape to be provided during model definition. The `input_layer_name` could be improved by using a more robust method to identify the input tensor within the model for models more complex than sequential models.


**Example 2:  Contextual Loss based on Categorical Input:**

Here, we use a categorical input feature to modify the loss calculation. Suppose we're predicting customer churn, and the loss should be higher for high-value customers.

```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def contextual_binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, input_data):
    # Assuming input_data[:, 1] represents customer value (0=low, 1=high)
    customer_value = input_data[:, 1]
    weights = K.switch(K.equal(customer_value, 1), K.constant(2.0), K.constant(1.0)) #Higher weight for high-value customers

    loss = K.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
    weighted_loss = loss * weights
    return K.mean(weighted_loss)


# Simplified Model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(loss=lambda y_true, y_pred: contextual_binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred, model.input), optimizer='adam')

#Training Data
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100).reshape(-1,1) #Binary Classification Data
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates how to incorporate categorical information from the input to modulate the loss function.  The `K.switch` function allows conditional weighting based on customer value.  Note the use of `sigmoid` activation in the output layer for binary classification.


**Example 3:  Loss incorporating Input Feature Distance:**

This example calculates the loss based on the distance between a specific input feature and a threshold. For instance, predicting material strength where a loss penalty increases significantly if the strength falls below a safety threshold.


```python
import tensorflow.keras.backend as K
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def distance_based_mse(y_true, y_pred, input_data):
    strength = input_data[:, 2]  #Assuming strength is the third feature
    threshold = K.constant(50.0) # Safety threshold
    distance_to_threshold = K.abs(strength - threshold)
    penalty_factor = K.exp(distance_to_threshold / 10.0) # Exponential penalty increases rapidly for low strength
    mse = K.square(y_pred - y_true)
    weighted_mse = mse * penalty_factor
    return K.mean(weighted_mse)

#Model Definition
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(loss=lambda y_true, y_pred: distance_based_mse(y_true, y_pred, model.input), optimizer='adam')

#Training Data
X = np.random.rand(100, 10) * 100
y = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 100 #Simulate Strength and Prediction Values
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)
```

**Commentary:** This code showcases a more sophisticated example where the penalty increases exponentially as the predicted strength gets further from the threshold. This approach allows for implementing domain-specific constraints and preferences directly within the loss function.  The use of `K.exp` introduces a non-linear penalty.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation, particularly sections on custom loss functions and backend operations, is essential.  A thorough understanding of TensorFlow's computational graph and tensor manipulation is highly beneficial.  Finally, exploring advanced topics like custom training loops within Keras can provide greater control over the training process if needed for more complex loss function integrations.
