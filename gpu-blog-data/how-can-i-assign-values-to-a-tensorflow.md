Assigning values to specific elements within a TensorFlow 2D tensor using indices requires careful consideration of tensor immutability and the appropriate indexing techniques provided by the library. Unlike mutable structures like Python lists, TensorFlow tensors are inherently immutable after creation. To modify a tensor based on indices, one needs to create a new tensor reflecting the desired changes. I’ve encountered this challenge frequently while working on convolutional neural networks where I had to manipulate feature maps dynamically. The most efficient approaches leverage TensorFlow's tensor indexing and update functions.

Fundamentally, direct assignment like `my_tensor[row, col] = new_value` will not work in TensorFlow. It throws an error because, as I mentioned, tensors are immutable. Instead, I primarily use two strategies: boolean masking combined with `tf.where` or `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`. The choice between these depends on the specific modification required, with masking being suitable when setting values based on conditions and `scatter_nd_update` providing precise index-based updates.

**Method 1: Boolean Masking and `tf.where`**

Boolean masking allows us to create a tensor of the same shape as the original, containing `True` at indices where a change is desired and `False` elsewhere. We then use this mask with `tf.where` to conditionally select either the original value or the new value, creating a new modified tensor.

Here’s an example demonstrating this technique:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original 2D tensor
original_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3],
                             [4, 5, 6],
                             [7, 8, 9]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Desired indices to modify: (0, 1) and (2, 2)
row_indices = tf.constant([0, 2], dtype=tf.int32)
col_indices = tf.constant([1, 2], dtype=tf.int32)
new_values = tf.constant([10, 20], dtype=tf.int32)


# Create a mask tensor with same shape as original_tensor
mask = tf.zeros_like(original_tensor, dtype=tf.bool)
indices_to_update = tf.stack([row_indices, col_indices], axis=1)
updates_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(mask, indices_to_update, tf.ones_like(row_indices, dtype=tf.bool))

# Apply the modification using tf.where
updated_tensor = tf.where(updates_tensor, new_values, original_tensor)

print("Original Tensor:")
print(original_tensor.numpy())
print("\nUpdated Tensor:")
print(updated_tensor.numpy())

```

In this example, I start with an initial 2D tensor and identify specific row and column indices that need updating. A boolean mask is created that is initially `False` everywhere, and `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` sets it to `True` at the desired indices. The `tf.where` function then creates a new tensor where values at masked locations (where `True`) come from `new_values`. All other locations retain their original values. This is beneficial when modifications need to be done conditionally or based on some logic related to the original tensor values.

**Method 2: `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`**

For directly assigning new values at specific indices, `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` offers a more targeted approach. This function takes the original tensor, the desired indices (as an array), and the corresponding new values. It produces a new tensor with the provided modifications. This method is particularly useful when you have a list of specific indices to update with corresponding new values.

Here's an example using `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original 2D tensor
original_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3],
                             [4, 5, 6],
                             [7, 8, 9]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Desired indices to modify (row, col)
indices_to_update = tf.constant([[0, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1]], dtype=tf.int32)
new_values = tf.constant([100, 200, 300], dtype=tf.int32)

# Apply the modification using tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update
updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(original_tensor, indices_to_update, new_values)

print("Original Tensor:")
print(original_tensor.numpy())
print("\nUpdated Tensor:")
print(updated_tensor.numpy())
```

In this example, the `indices_to_update` defines the precise locations for modification using (row, col) format. `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` then creates a new tensor with the provided `new_values` at these specific indices. It's a more direct and intuitive method when your primary goal is to assign values based on precise index specification. In my experience, I've found this more suitable than masking when dealing with sparse update patterns.

**Method 3: Combining `tf.gather_nd` and `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` for Partial Updates**

Sometimes, the task requires partial updates, where one needs to read certain values based on given indices, perform some computation on those values, and then write them back at the same indices. Here’s how one would use `tf.gather_nd`, combined with `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`, for this type of task:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original 2D tensor
original_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3],
                             [4, 5, 6],
                             [7, 8, 9]], dtype=tf.int32)

# Indices to modify
indices_to_modify = tf.constant([[0, 1], [2, 0]], dtype=tf.int32)


# Gather the values from the specified indices
gathered_values = tf.gather_nd(original_tensor, indices_to_modify)

# Perform some operation on the gathered values (e.g. multiply by 2)
modified_values = gathered_values * 2

# Update the tensor with new values at the specified indices
updated_tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(original_tensor, indices_to_modify, modified_values)


print("Original Tensor:")
print(original_tensor.numpy())
print("\nUpdated Tensor:")
print(updated_tensor.numpy())
```

In this scenario, `tf.gather_nd` first extracts the existing values at indices indicated by `indices_to_modify`. Those extracted values are then processed (in this example, they're doubled), and the result is written back into the tensor at the same locations using `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`. This method is useful when performing operations based on original values and then updating at those indices as I've often done when implementing custom activation functions or backpropagation rules.

These methods have proven sufficient in my projects to handle the diverse ways in which tensors must be updated. While they address fundamental index-based tensor modifications, understanding the immutable nature of tensors in TensorFlow remains essential. Always consider that you're generating a new tensor with modifications, rather than altering the original.

For further exploration, I'd recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation for the following:
-   `tf.where`
-   `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`
-   `tf.gather_nd`

Additionally, resources focusing on advanced tensor manipulation will greatly help to enhance your familiarity with these techniques. There are textbooks covering deep learning with TensorFlow and various online courses available. These resources often dedicate significant sections to tensor operations which are essential for building sophisticated neural network models. Understanding tensor manipulation is critical for efficient TensorFlow programming.
