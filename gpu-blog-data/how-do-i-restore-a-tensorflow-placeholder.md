Restoring a TensorFlow placeholder directly, as if it were a variable with an assigned value, is not possible because placeholders serve a different purpose within the TensorFlow computational graph. Placeholders act as entry points for data; they are symbolic variables that need to be fed with actual values during runtime to execute operations. They don't hold persistent data. My experience working with large-scale image recognition models often involves saving and restoring entire computational graphs, and understanding this distinction is crucial for efficient model management.

The challenge users often face arises from the need to persist and reuse not just the learned model parameters (weights and biases stored in variables), but also the architectural components – including the shapes defined through placeholders. When you save a TensorFlow model, you're generally saving the graph's structure and the values of the trainable variables. However, the mechanism for how the model receives its input data via placeholders isn’t inherently part of this saved state. The data itself is external to the graph. Consequently, attempting to restore placeholders as if they were weights in a saved checkpoint will fail. What one needs to restore is not the placeholder’s data, because there is no data, but rather the graph’s structure and subsequently re-create the placeholder in the rebuilt graph.

Therefore, the ‘restoration’ of a placeholder involves ensuring its definition is replicated accurately in a new TensorFlow session or graph, such that the graph, when restored, expects input data through placeholders defined with the same name and characteristics.  The proper methodology for what the user likely means when asking about restoring a placeholder, is to reconstruct it using the same shape and data type that the original placeholder used. This involves either explicitly defining the placeholders again within a new graph or reconstructing the graph from metadata where the placeholders are implied by the graph's structure. Essentially, the process focuses on the graph structure and data input rather than the values held within the placeholders, as they do not have values until a feed dictionary is used.

Here are three illustrative scenarios and how one would reconstruct the necessary placeholders:

**Example 1: Explicit Placeholder Re-creation**

Let's say you initially defined a placeholder within a model for 28x28 pixel grayscale images as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial graph
graph1 = tf.Graph()
with graph1.as_default():
  x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 28, 28, 1], name="input_placeholder")
  # some model layers...
  # ...

  # During training, variables are saved
  saver = tf.train.Saver()

  with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Initialize variables...
    # Train the model...
    saver.save(sess, "my_model/model.ckpt") # Saving checkpoint
```

To use this trained model later, you must recreate the placeholder definition in the new graph during the inference stage. The key is to specify the same name and data type, and typically, the same shape. The shape parameter can be 'None' in one dimension, indicating varying batch sizes:

```python
# Restore the model in a new graph
graph2 = tf.Graph()
with graph2.as_default():
    x_restored = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 28, 28, 1], name="input_placeholder")
    # Rebuild model from checkpoint with the placeholder
    # ... other graph ops needed here as you need the layers also
    saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph("my_model/model.ckpt.meta") # Recreate the graph using the meta-graph file
    with tf.Session() as sess:
      saver.restore(sess, "my_model/model.ckpt")
      # feed data using feed_dict on restored placeholder
      some_data = ... # Prepare data
      feed_dict = {x_restored: some_data}
      output = sess.run(some_op, feed_dict=feed_dict) # Run some operation

```

This code does not directly “restore” the placeholder. Rather, it creates a placeholder with identical attributes. The crucial factor here is using the same name, “input_placeholder”, and shape definition and data type such that the feed dictionary can be used with it and so that the model structure can utilize it. The `import_meta_graph` operation restores the saved graph structure with the weights from the model checkpoint.

**Example 2: Recreating Placeholders From Meta-Graph Data**

When dealing with more complex models, manually recreating placeholders by remembering the details can be cumbersome. TensorFlow provides meta files (.meta), which contain the graph's structure, including information about all placeholders used. In this scenario, one would first save the graph using this methodology:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial graph
graph3 = tf.Graph()
with graph3.as_default():
  x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 100], name="feature_placeholder")
  y = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None, ], name="label_placeholder")
  # some model layers...
  # ...

  # During training, variables are saved
  saver = tf.train.Saver()

  with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Initialize variables...
    # Train the model...
    saver.save(sess, "my_model_complex/model_complex.ckpt") # Saving checkpoint
```

During restoring we will use the graph metadata to locate the placeholder:

```python
# Restore graph from meta data
graph4 = tf.Graph()
with graph4.as_default():
  saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph("my_model_complex/model_complex.ckpt.meta")
  with tf.Session() as sess:
    saver.restore(sess, "my_model_complex/model_complex.ckpt")
    
    x_restored = graph4.get_tensor_by_name("feature_placeholder:0")
    y_restored = graph4.get_tensor_by_name("label_placeholder:0")
    # Get relevant operations from graph
    some_op = graph4.get_operation_by_name("some_op") # Replace with your op name

    # Now one can feed the reconstructed placeholders using feed dictionary
    some_features = ... # Prepare data
    some_labels = ... # Prepare labels

    feed_dict = {x_restored: some_features, y_restored: some_labels}
    output = sess.run(some_op, feed_dict=feed_dict)
```

In this example, the `tf.train.import_meta_graph` function loads the complete graph structure, including the placeholder definitions and the necessary operations.  The important step now is to extract the placeholder definitions using their names which is done through the `get_tensor_by_name` operation which locates the `feature_placeholder` and `label_placeholder` by their names, allowing us to use them in the feed_dict in subsequent steps.  This process avoids manual recreation.

**Example 3: Dealing with Dynamic Input Shapes**

TensorFlow's ability to accommodate dynamic input shapes during inference adds another layer of complexity. Consider a graph where the image input size is not fixed during the training period.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial graph
graph5 = tf.Graph()
with graph5.as_default():
  x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, None, None, 3], name="dynamic_input")
  # Model layers...
  # ...

  saver = tf.train.Saver()

  with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Initialize Variables...
    # Train model with varying image sizes...
    saver.save(sess, "dynamic_model/dynamic_model.ckpt") # Save model
```

In this scenario, the shape of the placeholder has `None` as shape entries other than the last channel entry.  When restoring, you would need to do the following:

```python
# Restore dynamic model
graph6 = tf.Graph()
with graph6.as_default():
    saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph("dynamic_model/dynamic_model.ckpt.meta")
    with tf.Session() as sess:
      saver.restore(sess, "dynamic_model/dynamic_model.ckpt")

      x_restored = graph6.get_tensor_by_name("dynamic_input:0")
      some_op = graph6.get_operation_by_name("some_op") # Replace with your op name

      # Now one can feed in different image sizes during inference
      image_data = ... # Prepare your data
      feed_dict = {x_restored: image_data} # Use image data here

      output = sess.run(some_op, feed_dict=feed_dict) # Run some operation
```

The shape `[None, None, None, 3]` allows feeding the graph with varying image dimensions, as the `None` dimensions can take any size, providing adaptability without having to recompile the graph with different input dimensions. The key is that the placeholder itself is reconstructed using the correct name and data type.

In summary, "restoring" a TensorFlow placeholder primarily refers to ensuring its definition matches the saved graph's expectations, allowing data to be fed correctly. Direct value restoration is not the goal, and it's not possible because the placeholder serves only as the input gate to the computational graph. Employing the `tf.train.import_meta_graph` method along with careful extraction of tensors by their names is the most practical and reliable approach. It’s necessary to make sure that you rebuild the graph using the correct names, types and dimensions and then pass in the necessary data with the feed_dict to actually utilize the rebuilt placeholders.

For further study, I would recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation on "Saving and Restoring" and "TensorBoard: Visualizing Learning."  Additionally, reviewing practical examples involving model saving in repositories that are available online will help deepen understanding. Learning to use the meta-graphs is crucial for efficiently rebuilding the graph for inference as it stores all the necessary information about the graph’s structure including the names and types of the placeholders. Finally, an in depth understanding of the difference between variables and placeholders, both in terms of definition and usage is crucial.
