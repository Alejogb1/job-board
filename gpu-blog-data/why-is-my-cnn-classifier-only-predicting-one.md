The persistent issue of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consistently predicting only a single class, despite having a multi-class dataset, typically arises from several interconnected problems related to data, loss function application, or network configuration during the training phase. It’s a situation I’ve encountered numerous times during my tenure training various deep learning models.

At its core, a CNN learns to distinguish between classes by adjusting its internal weights to minimize the chosen loss function. When a classifier collapses to predict a single class, this indicates the network hasn't learned to properly differentiate; instead, it's found a local minimum in the loss landscape that results in consistently outputting the same, likely the dominant, class. The network, in essence, has become a sophisticated constant function. Several contributing factors can lead to this outcome, and a careful examination of each area is necessary.

One of the most common culprits is imbalanced training data. If one class significantly outnumbers the others, the network will naturally gravitate towards predicting the majority class since minimizing loss will be easier this way. I have personally observed this in a medical imaging project where the presence of a disease was far rarer than the absence. This issue manifests even with carefully chosen hyper-parameters and can be misleading, as model loss might appear to be decreasing, but not translating into genuine learning. The model essentially minimizes global loss by ignoring less frequent, albeit crucial, classes.

Another pivotal aspect is the choice of activation function in the final layer combined with the proper application of a loss function. In multi-class classification, the last activation layer generally is `softmax`, converting the logits (output of the last linear layer) into probability distributions across all classes. The most used loss function, `CrossEntropyLoss`, integrates a LogSoftmax function to calculate loss, specifically designed for this probability-based output. If, for instance, you mistakenly use `sigmoid` activation and apply `CrossEntropyLoss`, the loss calculation can be ineffective, and your classifier is highly likely to fail. Furthermore, I have seen developers occasionally overlook the `torch.argmax` function for obtaining class predictions from the model's output, leading to skewed interpretations of model performance.

Moreover, insufficient training or unsuitable learning rates can contribute to the problem. If the model isn't trained for a long enough time or the learning rate is set too high or low, the model might converge prematurely or fail to find an optimal solution, resulting in a classifier stuck in a suboptimal space. Overly aggressive learning rates can lead to unstable training and ultimately the model never truly learning. Additionally, a learning rate that's too low will make convergence slow and might even halt any meaningful change to the model's parameters. It is critical to employ learning rate schedulers and monitor validation loss to ensure parameters are properly updated.

Furthermore, issues in the network architecture, particularly overly complex models, can sometimes lead to such convergence problems. A very deep network with insufficient regularization might overfit the training data to the point that it generalizes poorly and can get trapped predicting the same class. This is where various techniques such as dropout and batch normalization become important to help regularize the network.

Lastly, incorrect implementations of the dataset loading, potentially with labels assigned incorrectly or data not properly preprocessed, can also cause a failure in class discrimination. This is one of the easiest to overlook issues, which I experienced in an early computer vision project, where labels were mixed due to a faulty data-loading script. Thorough data exploration is imperative before training.

Here are three code snippets, demonstrating common scenarios and solutions:

**Example 1: Addressing Data Imbalance using Weighted Loss**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
import numpy as np

# Simulated imbalanced dataset
X_train = torch.randn(1000, 3, 28, 28)
y_train = torch.cat([torch.zeros(800, dtype=torch.long), torch.ones(200, dtype=torch.long)])

dataset = TensorDataset(X_train, y_train)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Model architecture (Simplified)
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 14 * 14, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 14 * 14)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

model = SimpleCNN()

# Calculate class weights
class_counts = np.bincount(y_train.numpy())
weights = 1.0 / torch.tensor(class_counts, dtype=torch.float)
weights = weights / weights.sum()  # Normalize weights to prevent scale issues.
# Loss function with weights
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=weights)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)


# Training loop
for epoch in range(10):
    for batch_x, batch_y in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(batch_x)
        loss = criterion(output, batch_y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss {loss}")

# Note: This example demonstrates a simplistic imbalance scenario.
# For more complex scenarios, oversampling or data augmentation could further assist training.

```
This snippet focuses on employing class weights in the loss function. By assigning greater weights to under-represented classes, the optimizer is incentivized to learn features of the minority class, mitigating the tendency of the model to gravitate towards the majority class. The dataset is intentionally skewed, and the weights are calculated to give the model the signal to care about the data that is less prevalent.

**Example 2: Correct Final Layer Activation and Prediction Interpretation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Simulated data
X_train = torch.randn(100, 3, 28, 28)
y_train = torch.randint(0, 4, (100,), dtype=torch.long)  # 4 classes
dataset = TensorDataset(X_train, y_train)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Correct Model architecture for multi-class classification
class MultiClassCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(MultiClassCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 14 * 14, num_classes) # Output matches # of classes


    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 14 * 14)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

model = MultiClassCNN(num_classes=4)


criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(10):
    for batch_x, batch_y in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(batch_x)
        loss = criterion(output, batch_y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    # Correct Prediction - Using ArgMax to get class label
    with torch.no_grad():
      test_output = model(batch_x)
      _, predicted_classes = torch.max(test_output, dim=1) # Correct extraction
      accuracy = (predicted_classes == batch_y).float().mean()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}")

```

This example illustrates the use of `CrossEntropyLoss` along with `softmax` activation (implicitly in the `CrossEntropyLoss`) and demonstrates correct class label extraction via `torch.argmax`. `CrossEntropyLoss` expects the raw logits (pre-softmax). This emphasizes the crucial point of correctly interpreting model outputs by selecting the class with the highest probability.

**Example 3: Addressing Insufficient Training**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
import numpy as np


# Simulated data
X_train = torch.randn(100, 3, 28, 28)
y_train = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,), dtype=torch.long)  # 2 classes
dataset = TensorDataset(X_train, y_train)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Simplified CNN
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 14 * 14, num_classes)


    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 14 * 14)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

model = SimpleCNN(num_classes=2)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Using a dynamic learning rate scheduler
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=2, gamma=0.5) # Decay by 0.5 every two epochs

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(20): # Train longer
    for batch_x, batch_y in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(batch_x)
        loss = criterion(output, batch_y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    scheduler.step() # Update Learning Rate
    with torch.no_grad():
      test_output = model(batch_x)
      _, predicted_classes = torch.max(test_output, dim=1) # Correct extraction
      accuracy = (predicted_classes == batch_y).float().mean()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}, LR: {scheduler.get_last_lr()[0]}")

```
This snippet demonstrates the use of a learning rate scheduler to address the problem of the model getting stuck due to learning rates that are too high and/or insufficient training. A dynamic learning rate schedule allows for more fine tuning of the network by decreasing the step size as training progresses. Furthermore, the model is trained for more epochs.

To further explore these concepts, several resources provide detailed explanations. For data imbalance techniques, review material focusing on class weights, oversampling, and data augmentation. Regarding loss functions, carefully analyze the documentation on activation functions like `softmax` and the behavior of the `CrossEntropyLoss` criterion. Understanding learning rate schedulers, such as step decay or cosine annealing, provides insight into improving the convergence of your model. Books focused on deep learning principles can offer a deeper understanding of the interplay between model architectures, regularization techniques, and loss function optimization. I also found that the official PyTorch documentation for specific modules and loss functions offers a wealth of practical advice and can be invaluable for debugging. Finally, revisiting established CNN architectures in computer vision literature helps to solidify the knowledge of proper layer implementation and design principles.
