The discrepancy between MariaDB container memory usage and available system memory stems primarily from the interplay between the container's resource limits, the operating system's memory management, and MariaDB's internal memory allocation strategies.  My experience troubleshooting database performance across various Linux distributions and container orchestration systems has repeatedly highlighted this nuanced interaction.  It's rarely a simple case of a direct, one-to-one mapping.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

The available system memory represents the total physical RAM plus swap space on the host machine.  However, this total isn't directly accessible to a single container. The host operating system (e.g., Linux) manages this memory, allocating resources to various processes, including the container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O) and the container itself.  The container runtime further mediates resource allocation for the processes *within* the container.  Therefore, the MariaDB process inside the container operates within constraints set by both the container's resource limits and the host OS's memory management mechanisms.

Several factors contribute to the observed difference:

* **Container Resource Limits:**  Docker, for instance, allows setting memory limits (`--memory`) and memory reservations (`--memory-reservation`) for containers.  The `--memory` limit imposes a hard ceiling on the container's memory usage; exceeding this limit will lead to the container being terminated (or OOM-killed). The `--memory-reservation` parameter guarantees a minimum amount of memory for the container.  However, even with these limits, the actual memory used by MariaDB might be less than the container's limit due to internal MariaDB memory management.

* **MariaDB Configuration:** MariaDB's memory usage is largely influenced by its configuration parameters (e.g., `innodb_buffer_pool_size`, `query_cache_size`, `tmp_table_size`).  These parameters control how much memory MariaDB allocates for various internal operations, such as caching data and storing temporary results. Overly aggressive configuration can lead to memory exhaustion, even if the container has ample allocated resources. Conversely, under-provisioning these parameters can lead to performance degradation.

* **Operating System Overhead:** The host OS consumes a portion of the system memory for its own processes and kernel operations.  The container runtime itself also requires memory resources.  This overhead reduces the actual memory available to containers, even if the host reports a large amount of free memory.

* **Memory Accounting Differences:** The reported memory usage of the container might differ from the actual memory used by MariaDB due to the way different tools report memory statistics.  Tools like `top`, `ps`, and `docker stats` might provide slightly different values, reflecting different aspects of memory allocation and usage (e.g., resident set size (RSS), virtual memory size (VSZ)).

* **Swap Space Usage:**  If MariaDB's memory usage exceeds its allocated limit, the operating system might utilize swap space to handle the overflow. However, this is generally slower than using RAM and can lead to performance issues.  Monitoring swap usage is crucial in diagnosing memory pressure.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Setting Container Memory Limits (Docker)**

```bash
docker run --name mariadb-container -d \
  -m 4g --memory-reservation 2g \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  mariadb:10.11
```

This command starts a MariaDB container with a 4GB memory limit and a 2GB memory reservation. This ensures the container has at least 2GB of guaranteed memory, but can use up to 4GB if needed.  Exceeding 4GB will trigger an out-of-memory event.


**Example 2: Monitoring MariaDB Memory Usage (within the container)**

```sql
SELECT @@innodb_buffer_pool_size, @@query_cache_size, @@tmp_table_size;
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Innodb_buffer_pool_reads';
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests';
SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE 'Innodb_buffer_pool_pages_data';

```

These SQL queries retrieve crucial MariaDB configuration parameters and performance metrics.  `innodb_buffer_pool_size` shows the InnoDB buffer pool size (a significant portion of MariaDB's memory usage). The status variables provide insight into the buffer pool's efficiency. High read requests relative to data pages suggest insufficient buffer pool size.


**Example 3: Monitoring Container Memory Usage (from the host)**

```bash
docker stats mariadb-container
```

This command displays real-time statistics for the `mariadb-container`, including memory usage (in various formats).  Regular monitoring of this output helps identify trends and potential memory issues.  Combining this with the internal MariaDB metrics provides a comprehensive view of memory consumption.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The MariaDB documentation is the primary source for understanding its configuration parameters and memory management.  Consult the system administrator guides for your chosen operating system and container runtime for detailed information on resource allocation and management.  Performance monitoring tools, including those integrated into your monitoring stack, are essential for identifying and resolving memory-related issues.  Finally, studying advanced topics in Linux process management and virtual memory can significantly enhance your understanding of the complexities involved.
