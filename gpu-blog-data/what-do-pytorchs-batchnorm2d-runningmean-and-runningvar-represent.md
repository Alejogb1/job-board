PyTorch's `BatchNorm2d` layer's `running_mean` and `running_var` attributes represent the exponentially weighted moving averages of the batch means and variances, respectively, accumulated across the training process.  This is crucial because these values are used for inference, allowing for efficient normalization without recomputing statistics for each mini-batch.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects solidified this understanding, as optimizing inference speed was often a paramount concern.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) is a technique used to stabilize training and improve the performance of deep neural networks.  It operates by normalizing the activations of each layer, mitigating the internal covariate shift problem—the change in the distribution of layer inputs during training.  The core idea is to normalize each feature channel independently across a mini-batch. This involves subtracting the mini-batch mean and dividing by the mini-batch standard deviation.

However, calculating the mean and standard deviation for each mini-batch during inference would be computationally expensive and inefficient.  Therefore, `BatchNorm2d` maintains running estimates of the mean and variance—`running_mean` and `running_var`—which are updated during training using an exponentially decaying average.

The update rule for these running statistics is typically:

`running_mean = momentum * running_mean + (1 - momentum) * batch_mean`
`running_var = momentum * running_var + (1 - momentum) * batch_var`

where `momentum` is a hyperparameter, usually set between 0.1 and 0.9, controlling the weight given to the previous running statistics. A higher momentum implies a slower update, placing more emphasis on past statistics. During training, these values are updated after each mini-batch. During inference, `running_mean` and `running_var` are directly used for normalization, bypassing the computation of mini-batch statistics.  This significantly accelerates the inference process.  Furthermore, the use of an exponentially weighted moving average, rather than a simple average, provides a more robust estimate of the data distribution, particularly in cases where the training data distribution may not be perfectly stationary.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Usage and Observation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a BatchNorm2d layer
bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(num_features=3) # For 3-channel input images

# Create a dummy input tensor
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224) # Batch size 1, 3 channels, 224x224 image

# Perform a forward pass
output = bn(input_tensor)

# Access and print the running mean and variance.  These will be initialized to zero.
print("Initial running_mean:", bn.running_mean)
print("Initial running_var:", bn.running_var)

# Simulate training with a few batches. Notice the running_mean and running_var change.
for i in range(10):
  output = bn(torch.randn(1,3,224,224))
print("\nRunning mean after 10 batches:", bn.running_mean)
print("Running variance after 10 batches:", bn.running_var)
```
This example demonstrates the initialization and gradual update of `running_mean` and `running_var` during simulated training iterations.  Observe how these values shift away from their initial zeros.  The key is to understand the dynamic nature of these attributes; they are not static values determined solely by the input data's initial distribution.

**Example 2:  Momentum Control**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define BatchNorm2d layers with different momentums
bn_high_momentum = nn.BatchNorm2d(num_features=3, momentum=0.9)
bn_low_momentum = nn.BatchNorm2d(num_features=3, momentum=0.1)

# Simulate training for a few batches
input_tensor = torch.randn(10, 3, 224, 224) # Increased batch size for more representative stats

for i in range(100):
    output_high = bn_high_momentum(input_tensor)
    output_low = bn_low_momentum(input_tensor)

print("\nHigh Momentum running mean:", bn_high_momentum.running_mean)
print("High Momentum running var:", bn_high_momentum.running_var)
print("\nLow Momentum running mean:", bn_low_momentum.running_mean)
print("Low Momentum running var:", bn_low_momentum.running_var)
```
This showcases the influence of the `momentum` hyperparameter on the running statistics. The higher momentum leads to slower updates, resulting in running statistics that are less responsive to recent mini-batches. This can be beneficial for stability but may lead to slower adaptation to changing data distributions.

**Example 3: Inference Mode and Frozen Statistics**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a BatchNorm2d layer
bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(num_features=3)

# Simulate training to populate running statistics
input_tensor = torch.randn(100, 3, 224, 224)
for i in range(100):
    bn(input_tensor)

# Switch to evaluation mode
bn.eval()

# Inference with frozen running statistics.  No further updates occur.
with torch.no_grad():
    inference_output = bn(torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224))

print("\nRunning mean after inference:", bn.running_mean)
print("Running variance after inference:", bn.running_var)
```
This illustrates the crucial aspect of inference.  In `eval()` mode, the `running_mean` and `running_var` are used directly for normalization, and their values are not updated.  This is a critical efficiency optimization in production deployments.  The `torch.no_grad()` context manager further enhances efficiency by preventing the unnecessary computation of gradients during inference.
