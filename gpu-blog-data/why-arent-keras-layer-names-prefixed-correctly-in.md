In my experience debugging TensorFlow models integrated with Keras, the issue of improperly prefixed layer names often stems from a misunderstanding of how Keras handles naming conventions within the TensorFlow graph.  The problem isn't necessarily a bug within Keras or TensorFlow itself, but rather a consequence of how layers are added dynamically and how name scopes are managed.  Correctly prefixed names are crucial for debugging, model visualization, and weight sharing across multiple models.  The core issue arises from implicit naming and the interaction between Keras' sequential and functional APIs, coupled with potentially nested models.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras layers don't inherently possess a built-in mechanism to guarantee consistently prefixed names across all scenarios. The layer naming process relies on several interconnected factors: the layer's type, its position within the model, and the presence of parent models or name scopes.  If these factors are not carefully managed, the resulting names may appear inconsistent or lack the desired prefix.  The Sequential API, while convenient, often leads to less control over naming than the Functional API, which provides more explicit control through name specification.

When you create a Keras model using the Sequential API, layer names are assigned automatically, typically using a sequential numerical identifier (e.g., "dense_1," "dense_2"). This implicit naming is straightforward for simple models but can become problematic with nested models or when adding layers programmatically in loops. The Functional API, on the other hand, allows you to specify custom names for each layer, but mistakes in this process, like forgetting to specify a name or using inconsistent prefixes, can easily result in the inconsistent naming you're observing.

Furthermore, TensorFlow's name scoping mechanism, essential for organizing the underlying computational graph, can interact with Keras' layer naming in unforeseen ways.  Improper nesting of models or inconsistent use of `tf.name_scope` can lead to layer names that include unexpected prefixes or are not consistently prefixed as intended.  Therefore, a solution necessitates a thorough understanding of these underlying mechanisms to enforce desired naming conventions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inconsistent Naming with Sequential API:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.summary()  #Observe automatically generated names 'dense', 'dense_1' etc.
```

This demonstrates the default behavior of the Sequential API.  The names are generated automatically, which might not always align with a project-specific naming convention.  This approach is convenient for simple models but becomes brittle when scaling or modifying the architecture.


**Example 2:  Consistent Naming with Functional API:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

inputs = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
x = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', name='my_prefix_dense_1')(inputs)
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='my_prefix_dense_2')(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

model.summary() #Observe the consistent 'my_prefix' prefix.
```

This showcases the advantage of the Functional API. Explicitly naming each layer guarantees consistent prefixes, making the model's structure clear and easy to understand.  This approach is significantly more robust when handling larger or more complex model architectures.

**Example 3: Addressing Nested Models and Name Scopes:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def create_submodel():
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=(64,))
    x = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', name='sub_dense_1')(inputs)
    return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x, name='submodel')

inputs = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
x = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', name='main_dense_1')(inputs)
submodel = create_submodel()
x = submodel(x)
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='main_dense_2')(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

model.summary() # Observe how the submodel's names are correctly nested.
```

This example tackles a common scenario involving nested models.  By using explicit naming within the `create_submodel` function and correctly integrating the submodel into the main model, we maintain consistent and organized naming. The `name` argument in `keras.Model` is crucial for managing nested model names correctly.   Failure to use it can lead to less predictable layer names.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To deepen your understanding of TensorFlow and Keras model construction, I recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation and exploring the Keras API guide.  Focus specifically on sections detailing the functional API and the use of name scopes.  Additionally, textbooks on deep learning generally dedicate chapters to building and managing neural network architectures, which will provide a broader theoretical context.  Finally,  working through numerous examples and practicing different model architectures will solidify your grasp on how layer names are constructed and maintained.  Careful analysis of the summary output of models is crucial for detecting naming inconsistencies.
