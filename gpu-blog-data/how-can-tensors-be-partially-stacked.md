Partial stacking of tensors, specifically when the dimensions intended for stacking do not align across all input tensors, requires careful management of dimensions and often involves padding or masking to ensure consistent shapes for concatenation or other stack-like operations. Having grappled with mismatched sensor data in a multi-modal robotic perception project, I’ve encountered this issue frequently.

The core challenge arises because standard tensor stacking functions like `torch.stack` or `tf.stack` insist on equal sizes along the non-stacking dimensions. This means if you have three tensors—one of shape `(10, 5)`, one of shape `(7, 5)`, and another of shape `(12, 5)`—you can't directly stack them along the first axis without adjustments. Partial stacking, in this context, addresses how to combine these disparate tensors into a meaningful aggregate. There are several approaches; the most common involve padding or truncation. Which method is most appropriate depends heavily on the application’s data semantics.

**Padding for Alignment**

The most straightforward way to achieve partial stacking is by padding the smaller tensors to match the size of the largest one along the dimension intended for stacking. This ensures all tensors have compatible dimensions for concatenation. Common padding strategies include zero-padding, reflection padding, and replication padding. Zero padding is often the easiest to implement, and often suitable when the values themselves don't have an inherent spatial relationship.

Let’s examine a scenario involving PyTorch. Assume we have three input tensors:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

tensor1 = torch.randn(10, 5)
tensor2 = torch.randn(7, 5)
tensor3 = torch.randn(12, 5)

# Find the maximum dimension along the stacking axis
max_dim = max(tensor1.shape[0], tensor2.shape[0], tensor3.shape[0])

# Pad the smaller tensors
padded_tensor1 = F.pad(tensor1, (0, 0, 0, max_dim - tensor1.shape[0]), 'constant', 0)
padded_tensor2 = F.pad(tensor2, (0, 0, 0, max_dim - tensor2.shape[0]), 'constant', 0)
padded_tensor3 = F.pad(tensor3, (0, 0, 0, max_dim - tensor3.shape[0]), 'constant', 0)


# Stack the padded tensors
stacked_tensor = torch.stack([padded_tensor1, padded_tensor2, padded_tensor3], dim=0)

print(f"Shape of stacked tensor: {stacked_tensor.shape}")
```

Here, I've identified the largest dimension along the stack axis using `max()`. The `torch.nn.functional.pad` function is employed to add zero padding to the smaller tensors, making them `(12, 5)` as well. The `(0, 0, 0, max_dim - tensor.shape[0])` tuple specifies the amount of padding on each side for the last 2 dimensions. Because we’re padding only along the first dimension (rows), we have 0 for the second dimension. This produces a tensor of shape `(3, 12, 5)`. While simple, zero padding can introduce bias if downstream computations aren't cognizant of the padded regions.

**Masking for Selective Use**

Instead of simply padding and then using the whole stacked tensor indiscriminately, a mask can accompany the padded tensor, marking the true data regions from the added padding. This enables subsequent operations to treat the padded areas as null or invalid, allowing partial stacking without introducing spurious information.

Let’s explore a TensorFlow implementation involving masking:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor1 = tf.random.normal((10, 5))
tensor2 = tf.random.normal((7, 5))
tensor3 = tf.random.normal((12, 5))

# Find the maximum dimension along the stacking axis
max_dim = max(tensor1.shape[0], tensor2.shape[0], tensor3.shape[0])

# Pad the smaller tensors
padded_tensor1 = tf.pad(tensor1, [[0, max_dim - tensor1.shape[0]], [0, 0]], 'CONSTANT', constant_values=0)
padded_tensor2 = tf.pad(tensor2, [[0, max_dim - tensor2.shape[0]], [0, 0]], 'CONSTANT', constant_values=0)
padded_tensor3 = tf.pad(tensor3, [[0, max_dim - tensor3.shape[0]], [0, 0]], 'CONSTANT', constant_values=0)

# Create masks for true data portions
mask1 = tf.sequence_mask([tensor1.shape[0]], maxlen=max_dim, dtype=tf.float32)
mask2 = tf.sequence_mask([tensor2.shape[0]], maxlen=max_dim, dtype=tf.float32)
mask3 = tf.sequence_mask([tensor3.shape[0]], maxlen=max_dim, dtype=tf.float32)


# Stack padded tensors and masks
stacked_tensors = tf.stack([padded_tensor1, padded_tensor2, padded_tensor3], axis=0)
stacked_masks = tf.stack([mask1, mask2, mask3], axis=0)

print(f"Shape of stacked tensors: {stacked_tensors.shape}")
print(f"Shape of stacked masks: {stacked_masks.shape}")

```

Here, I use `tf.pad` to pad the tensors in a similar fashion to the PyTorch implementation, and I employ `tf.sequence_mask` to create boolean masks indicating valid data regions. `tf.sequence_mask` is an efficient way to generate masks given lengths of sequences.  The resulting shapes are `(3, 12, 5)` for stacked tensors and `(3, 1, 12)` for the masks. It’s important to note the difference in the mask’s shape. For each batch, there is one sequence mask (length 12). These need to be broadcast correctly for each stacked tensor (shape of (12, 5)) along the final dimension, which is typically achieved through element-wise multiplication.

In subsequent computations, multiplying `stacked_tensors` element-wise by the corresponding `stacked_masks` will essentially nullify the padding contribution, using the mask as a gate for each element in the padded tensor. In my experience, this offers greater control and accuracy when processing sensor data of varying lengths.

**Truncation with Length Tracking**

Another approach when faced with disparate lengths, primarily when dealing with time series, involves truncation. Instead of padding smaller tensors, you reduce the larger tensors to the size of the smallest one. While lossy, it avoids the bias introduced by padding.  Crucially, it is essential to store the original lengths to keep track of how much the sequence was trimmed when subsequent processing needs it. For many timeseries analysis methods, equal lengths are a hard constraint.

Let's look at an example using NumPy, as its indexing is convenient for truncation:

```python
import numpy as np

tensor1 = np.random.randn(10, 5)
tensor2 = np.random.randn(7, 5)
tensor3 = np.random.randn(12, 5)

# Find the minimum dimension along the stacking axis
min_dim = min(tensor1.shape[0], tensor2.shape[0], tensor3.shape[0])

# Truncate the larger tensors
truncated_tensor1 = tensor1[:min_dim]
truncated_tensor2 = tensor2[:min_dim]
truncated_tensor3 = tensor3[:min_dim]

# Store original lengths
original_lengths = [tensor1.shape[0], tensor2.shape[0], tensor3.shape[0]]

# Stack the truncated tensors
stacked_tensor = np.stack([truncated_tensor1, truncated_tensor2, truncated_tensor3], axis=0)


print(f"Shape of stacked tensor: {stacked_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Original lengths: {original_lengths}")

```

In this example, we identify the minimum length, 7 in this case, and truncate the larger tensors to this size. The resulting shape of the stacked tensor is `(3, 7, 5)`. I’ve also kept the list of the original lengths. For signal processing pipelines, these original lengths might be used later for un-truncating signals or for other analysis. While this approach sacrifices data, it may be acceptable in specific situations where the loss of information is not detrimental or is preferred over the introduction of padding.

In summary, partial tensor stacking addresses the very common need to combine tensors of non-uniform shape. Padding with masking and truncation (with length tracking) each represent solutions with different tradeoffs. There's no universal answer; the best choice depends on the nature of the data, the processing pipeline and how each of these affects downstream computation.

For further theoretical understanding of these concepts, I'd recommend studying advanced deep learning textbooks, particularly those covering sequence modeling, and reading material from the official documentation of your preferred tensor library (such as PyTorch or TensorFlow). Look for material that elaborates on masking techniques, padding strategies, and their effects on downstream analyses. Additionally, resources focusing on data preprocessing best practices can shed light on when and why to employ one technique over the others. A solid understanding of underlying principles combined with hands-on experimentation is usually the best approach.
