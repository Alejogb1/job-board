The core challenge in loading GPU-trained models into CPU memory lies in the inherent architecture differences between CPUs and GPUs.  GPUs excel at parallel processing, utilizing thousands of cores optimized for matrix operations, while CPUs generally possess fewer cores with broader functionality.  Models trained on GPUs are often structured to leverage this parallel architecture, resulting in data structures and optimized operations not directly compatible with CPU memory management.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications for diverse hardware has highlighted this incompatibility repeatedly.  Overcoming this requires careful consideration of data representation, memory constraints, and the selection of appropriate libraries.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves several key steps.  First, the model's weights and biases, typically stored in a GPU's memory in a highly optimized format, need to be transferred to the CPU's RAM.  This transfer itself can be a bottleneck, particularly for large models, and necessitates efficient data transfer mechanisms.  Second, the model's architecture needs to be compatible with CPU execution.  GPU-optimized libraries and frameworks, often employing CUDA or ROCm, are designed for parallel execution and data structures unsuitable for CPU architectures.  We must thus either use a CPU-compatible framework from the start or translate the model's representation into a CPU-friendly format. Third, and frequently overlooked, the application must be adapted to utilize the model loaded into CPU memory. The code originally designed to interact with the model on the GPU must be modified to interact with it in CPU memory space, often requiring careful management of memory access patterns to avoid performance degradation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate with examples using PyTorch, a common deep learning framework.  Assume the model, trained on a GPU, is saved as `model.pth`.

**Example 1:  Direct Loading (If Possible):**

```python
import torch

# Attempt to load the model directly onto the CPU.  This assumes the model was saved in a CPU-compatible format.
device = torch.device('cpu')
model = torch.load('model.pth', map_location=device)

# Verify the model is on the CPU.
print(next(model.parameters()).device)  # Should print 'cpu'

# Perform inference.
# ... Your inference code here ...
```

This approach is only viable if the model was initially saved in a manner that doesn't rely on GPU-specific data structures.  This is often not the case, especially with models trained using CUDA extensions or heavily optimized kernels.  Failure to specify `map_location` will result in an error.

**Example 2:  Using ONNX for Intermediate Representation:**

```python
import torch
import onnx

# Assuming 'model' is the loaded model on the GPU.
# Export the model to ONNX format.
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224).cuda() # Example input tensor
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model.onnx", verbose=True)

# Load the ONNX model on the CPU using onnxruntime.
import onnxruntime as ort
ort_session = ort.InferenceSession("model.onnx")

# Get input and output names.
input_name = ort_session.get_inputs()[0].name
output_name = ort_session.get_outputs()[0].name

# Perform inference.
ort_inputs = {input_name: torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224).cpu().numpy()}
ort_outs = ort_session.run([output_name], ort_inputs)

# Process the output.
# ... Your output processing code here ...
```

This method converts the model into the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format, an intermediary representation that's designed to be platform-agnostic.  This allows loading and inference using ONNX Runtime, which supports both CPU and GPU execution. This is a robust solution and often avoids compatibility issues. However, it adds an extra step and may result in some performance overhead compared to a natively CPU-optimized model.


**Example 3:  Manual Weight Transfer and Architecture Adaptation (Advanced):**

```python
import torch

# Load the model's state dictionary (weights and biases) onto the CPU.
device = torch.device('cpu')
state_dict = torch.load('model.pth', map_location=torch.device('cpu'))['state_dict'] # Adjust key if different

# Create a new model instance with the same architecture but for CPU execution.
# ... define the model architecture ...
model_cpu = YourModelClass()

# Load the state dictionary onto the CPU model.
model_cpu.load_state_dict(state_dict)
model_cpu.to(device) # move model to CPU


# Verify the model is on the CPU.
print(next(model_cpu.parameters()).device) # Should print 'cpu'

# Perform inference.
# ... Your inference code here ...
```

This highly customized method requires in-depth knowledge of the model's architecture. You would need to recreate the model on the CPU, ensuring all operations are compatible with CPU instructions.  While offering potential performance benefits through careful optimization, this approach is significantly more complex and error-prone.  Incorrect mapping of layers or parameters will lead to inaccurate results or application crashes.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I suggest consulting the official documentation of PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ONNX Runtime.  Furthermore, exploring resources on numerical computation and linear algebra will prove valuable for understanding the underlying operations and potential optimizations.   Studying efficient data transfer techniques, such as memory mapping, would also greatly enhance your ability to manage this task.  Lastly, reviewing papers on model compression and quantization techniques can provide strategies to mitigate memory constraints.
