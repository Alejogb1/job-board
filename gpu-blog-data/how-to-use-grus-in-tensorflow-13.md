TensorFlow 1.3's lack of a dedicated GRU layer necessitates constructing one using the lower-level `tf.nn` primitives.  My experience working on a time-series anomaly detection system in 2017 heavily involved this, as the higher-level APIs for recurrent layers weren't as mature as they are today.  This involved a careful understanding of the GRU's internal gating mechanisms and their implementation using TensorFlow's core operations.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a recurrent neural network (RNN) variant designed to address the vanishing gradient problem inherent in traditional RNNs.  Unlike LSTMs with their intricate cell state and three gates, GRUs employ only two: a reset gate and an update gate.  These gates regulate the flow of information through the network, allowing for better long-term dependency learning.

The reset gate (`r_t`) determines the extent to which past information is ignored when calculating the current hidden state.  A value close to 0 effectively resets the hidden state, focusing the network on the current input.  Conversely, a value near 1 retains the previous hidden state's information.

The update gate (`z_t`) controls the extent to which the current hidden state is updated.  A value near 1 indicates that the previous hidden state should be largely preserved, while a value close to 0 signifies a significant update based on the current input.

The core equations for a GRU are as follows:

* **Reset Gate:**  `r_t = σ(W_r * x_t + U_r * h_(t-1) + b_r)`
* **Update Gate:** `z_t = σ(W_z * x_t + U_z * h_(t-1) + b_z)`
* **Candidate Hidden State:** `h̃_t = tanh(W_h * x_t + r_t ⊙ (U_h * h_(t-1)) + b_h)`
* **Hidden State:** `h_t = (1 - z_t) ⊙ h_(t-1) + z_t ⊙ h̃_t`

Where:

* `x_t`: Input at time step *t*.
* `h_(t-1)`: Hidden state at time step *t-1*.
* `h_t`: Hidden state at time step *t*.
* `W_r`, `W_z`, `W_h`: Weight matrices for the reset, update, and candidate hidden state calculations, respectively.
* `U_r`, `U_z`, `U_h`: Weight matrices connecting the previous hidden state to the gates and candidate hidden state.
* `b_r`, `b_z`, `b_h`: Bias vectors.
* `σ`: Sigmoid activation function.
* `⊙`: Element-wise multiplication.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic GRU Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def gru_cell(x, h_prev, num_units):
    # Define weights and biases
    Wr = tf.Variable(tf.random.truncated_normal([x.shape[-1], num_units]))
    Ur = tf.Variable(tf.random.truncated_normal([num_units, num_units]))
    br = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([num_units]))

    Wz = tf.Variable(tf.random.truncated_normal([x.shape[-1], num_units]))
    Uz = tf.Variable(tf.random.truncated_normal([num_units, num_units]))
    bz = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([num_units]))

    Wh = tf.Variable(tf.random.truncated_normal([x.shape[-1], num_units]))
    Uh = tf.Variable(tf.random.truncated_normal([num_units, num_units]))
    bh = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([num_units]))

    # Calculate gates
    r = tf.sigmoid(tf.matmul(x, Wr) + tf.matmul(h_prev, Ur) + br)
    z = tf.sigmoid(tf.matmul(x, Wz) + tf.matmul(h_prev, Uz) + bz)

    # Candidate hidden state
    h_tilde = tf.tanh(tf.matmul(x, Wh) + tf.multiply(r, tf.matmul(h_prev, Uh)) + bh)

    # Update hidden state
    h = tf.add(tf.multiply(1 - z, h_prev), tf.multiply(z, h_tilde))

    return h

# Example usage
x = tf.random.normal([1, 10]) # Batch size 1, input dimension 10
h_prev = tf.zeros([1, 20]) # Previous hidden state, num_units = 20
h = gru_cell(x, h_prev, 20)
print(h)

```

This example showcases a single GRU step. Note the explicit definition of weights and biases, reflecting the manual implementation necessary in TensorFlow 1.3.  The random initialization follows common practices for weight matrices.

**Example 2:  Unrolling GRU for a Sequence**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def gru_layer(inputs, num_units):
    num_timesteps = tf.shape(inputs)[1]
    h = tf.zeros_like(inputs[:, 0, :])  # Initialize hidden state

    outputs = []
    for t in range(num_timesteps):
      h = gru_cell(inputs[:, t, :], h, num_units)
      outputs.append(h)

    return tf.stack(outputs, axis=1)

# Example usage
inputs = tf.random.normal([1, 10, 5]) # Batch size 1, timesteps 10, input dimension 5
outputs = gru_layer(inputs, 20) # num_units = 20
print(outputs)
```

This extends the single-step GRU to process entire sequences. The `gru_layer` function iterates through each timestep, feeding the output of the previous timestep as input to the next.  This is the basic form of unrolling a recurrent network.

**Example 3: Using `tf.scan` for Efficiency**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def gru_layer_scan(inputs, num_units):
  def gru_step(h_prev, x):
    return gru_cell(x, h_prev, num_units)

  initial_state = tf.zeros_like(inputs[:, 0, :])
  outputs, _ = tf.scan(gru_step, inputs, initializer=initial_state)

  return outputs

#Example Usage (same as Example 2)
inputs = tf.random.normal([1, 10, 5]) # Batch size 1, timesteps 10, input dimension 5
outputs = gru_layer_scan(inputs, 20) # num_units = 20
print(outputs)
```

This demonstrates using `tf.scan`, a more efficient approach to unrolling recurrent networks compared to explicit loops. `tf.scan` automatically handles the stateful nature of the GRU, improving performance, particularly for longer sequences.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation (for the relevant version, 1.3),  a good textbook on neural networks covering RNN architectures, and research papers on GRUs (specifically those focusing on their mathematical derivation and implementation details) are invaluable resources.  Understanding linear algebra and calculus at a level sufficient to grasp the underlying mathematical operations of the GRU is crucial for a deep understanding.   Additionally, exploring the source code of various open-source RNN implementations can offer valuable insights into practical considerations.
