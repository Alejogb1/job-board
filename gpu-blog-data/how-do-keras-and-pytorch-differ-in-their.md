The fundamental difference between Keras and PyTorch's matrix multiplication implementations lies in their underlying computational graphs and autograd mechanisms.  Keras, being a higher-level API built atop TensorFlow (or other backends), utilizes a static computational graph, whereas PyTorch employs a dynamic computational graph. This distinction significantly impacts how matrix multiplications are handled, affecting performance characteristics, debugging capabilities, and overall workflow.  My experience working on large-scale deep learning projects involving image recognition and natural language processing has highlighted these differences repeatedly.

**1. Computational Graph and Autograd:**

Keras, in its TensorFlow backend (the most common), defines the entire computation graph before execution. This means you first define all operations, including matrix multiplications, and only then does TensorFlow optimize and execute the graph. This static nature allows for extensive optimization but limits flexibility during runtime.  Matrix multiplications are represented as nodes within this graph, and gradients are computed through backpropagation across the entire structure.  The optimization strategies employed by TensorFlow, like XLA compilation, are geared towards this static graph execution.

PyTorch, conversely, uses a dynamic computational graph.  Operations, including matrix multiplications, are executed immediately, and the computational graph is constructed on-the-fly.  This dynamic approach makes debugging easier because you can inspect intermediate results and modify the graph during execution.  PyTorch's autograd system automatically tracks operations and computes gradients as they occur, eliminating the need for a pre-defined graph. This dynamic nature comes at the cost of potentially less optimized execution compared to TensorFlow's compiled static graph, particularly for very large models.  However, the flexibility is often worth the trade-off.

**2.  Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate the differences with three code examples focusing on matrix multiplication and gradient computation.

**Example 1: Simple Matrix Multiplication:**

```python
# Keras with TensorFlow backend
import tensorflow as tf

A = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
B = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

C = tf.matmul(A, B)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    result = tf.reduce_sum(C)

gradients = tape.gradient(result, [A, B])

print(C)
print(gradients)


# PyTorch
import torch

A = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], requires_grad=True)
B = torch.tensor([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

C = torch.matmul(A, B)
result = C.sum()
result.backward()

print(C)
print(A.grad) # Gradients are directly available for A
```

This example demonstrates a basic matrix multiplication.  Note the difference in gradient calculation. Keras requires a `GradientTape` context manager, while PyTorch automatically tracks gradients via `requires_grad=True`.

**Example 2:  Incorporating Non-linearity:**

```python
# Keras
import tensorflow as tf

A = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
B = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

C = tf.matmul(A, B)
D = tf.nn.relu(C) #Adding a ReLU activation

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    result = tf.reduce_sum(D)

gradients = tape.gradient(result, [A,B])
print(D)
print(gradients)

# PyTorch
import torch

A = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], requires_grad=True)
B = torch.tensor([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

C = torch.matmul(A, B)
D = torch.relu(C) #Adding a ReLU activation

result = D.sum()
result.backward()

print(D)
print(A.grad)
```

This extends the example by adding a ReLU activation function.  Both frameworks handle this seamlessly, but the PyTorch approach remains more concise due to the dynamic nature of the graph.

**Example 3:  Conditional Execution and Dynamic Graph:**

```python
# PyTorch - Demonstrating Dynamic Graph Capabilities
import torch

A = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], requires_grad=True)
B = torch.tensor([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

if torch.sum(A) > 5:
    C = torch.matmul(A, B)
else:
    C = A + B

result = C.sum()
result.backward()

print(C)
print(A.grad)

# Keras equivalent would require significant restructuring to achieve the same dynamic behavior.
```

This example highlights PyTorch's ability to handle conditional execution within the graph.  Constructing a similar dynamic graph in Keras would necessitate significantly more complex techniques and potentially involve using `tf.cond` which can lead to decreased performance compared to PyTorch's native support.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's graph execution and optimization, consult the official TensorFlow documentation and explore resources focused on XLA compilation. For PyTorch, delve into the official documentation focusing on the autograd system and its dynamic graph implementation.  Exploring resources dedicated to comparing deep learning frameworks will provide a broader perspective on the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.  Furthermore, examining research papers discussing performance optimization techniques in both frameworks will prove invaluable.


In conclusion, while both Keras and PyTorch offer robust matrix multiplication implementations, their underlying approaches lead to significant differences in performance, flexibility, and debugging experience. Keras, leveraging TensorFlow's static computational graph, prioritizes optimization, whereas PyTorch's dynamic graph provides greater flexibility and ease of debugging, particularly beneficial for complex and evolving models. The choice between them ultimately depends on the project's specific needs and priorities. My own experience indicates that PyTorch's flexibility proves invaluable during the exploratory phases of model development, while Keras can be advantageous for deploying highly optimized models in production environments.
