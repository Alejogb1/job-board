The consistent prediction of class 0 despite a 1.0 validation accuracy in a Keras binary classification model points to a critical issue: the validation set is likely heavily skewed or improperly constructed, leading to a misleading accuracy metric.  This isn't a problem with the model's learning capacity itself, but rather a flaw in the data used for evaluation.  In my experience troubleshooting similar discrepancies across numerous projects – from medical image analysis to financial time series prediction –  this deceptive accuracy stems from a class imbalance in the validation set combined with a model that simply predicts the majority class.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Accuracy, defined as (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Samples, is a deceptively simple metric.  When one class dominates the validation set, a model that consistently predicts that majority class will achieve high accuracy even if it completely fails to correctly classify the minority class. In binary classification with class imbalance, this is a common pitfall.  Consider a scenario with 99% of samples belonging to class 0 and only 1% to class 1 in your validation set. A naive classifier that always predicts class 0 will achieve 99% accuracy, even though its performance on the actual task of correctly classifying class 1 is abysmal.  This is exactly what is occurring: your model has learned to exploit the bias in your validation data rather than learn the underlying classification task.

The problem is not necessarily an issue with the model architecture or training process itself (though these could certainly contribute to poor generalization), but rather a problem of evaluation methodology.  A model with perfect validation accuracy, but only predicting one class, demonstrates a severe flaw in the data validation strategy.  This highlights the importance of choosing appropriate evaluation metrics beyond simple accuracy, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.  Metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) provide a more nuanced understanding of model performance, accounting for class imbalance and false positives/negatives.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the issue and possible solutions.  These are simplified for clarity, but reflect the core principles encountered during my work.

**Example 1: The Problematic Scenario**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Create an imbalanced validation set
X_val = np.random.rand(100, 10) # 100 samples, 10 features
y_val = np.concatenate([np.zeros(99), np.ones(1)]) # 99 class 0, 1 class 1

# Define a simple model (replace with your actual model)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Simulate a model that always predicts class 0.
y_pred = np.zeros(100) # Always predicts class 0

# Evaluate – the accuracy will be high despite poor performance
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_val, y_val, verbose=0)
print(f"Validation Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(classification_report(y_val, y_pred))
```

This code generates a heavily imbalanced validation set. Even a model that always predicts class 0 achieves high accuracy. The `classification_report` highlights the true performance, revealing the poor recall and F1-score for class 1.

**Example 2: Addressing Class Imbalance with Resampling**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.utils import resample
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report


#Create a balanced dataset using resampling (this part is essential to fix imbalanced data)
X_train = np.random.rand(1000,10)
y_train = np.concatenate([np.zeros(500), np.ones(500)])

X_val = np.random.rand(100,10)
y_val = np.concatenate([np.zeros(99),np.ones(1)])


X_minority, y_minority = resample(X_val[y_val==1],y_val[y_val==1], replace=True, n_samples=99, random_state=42)


X_val_resampled = np.concatenate([X_val[y_val==0], X_minority])
y_val_resampled = np.concatenate([y_val[y_val==0], y_minority])

# Define a simple model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_val_resampled)
y_pred = (y_pred > 0.5).astype(int).flatten()
print(classification_report(y_val_resampled,y_pred))

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_val_resampled, y_val_resampled, verbose=0)
print(f"Validation Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This example demonstrates the use of `resample` from scikit-learn to oversample the minority class in the validation set, creating a more balanced dataset for evaluation.  The evaluation metrics will now reflect a more accurate representation of model performance.  Note:  Resampling should ideally be applied to the *training* set as well for optimal results, not just the validation set as shown here for brevity.

**Example 3: Utilizing a More Robust Metric**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

# ... (same imbalanced validation set as Example 1) ...

# Train a model (replace with your actual model)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_val, y_val, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Predict probabilities, not just class labels
y_pred_prob = model.predict(X_val)

# Evaluate using AUC-ROC, which is less sensitive to class imbalance
auc = roc_auc_score(y_val, y_pred_prob)
print(f"AUC-ROC: {auc}")
```

This example highlights the use of AUC-ROC, a metric that is less sensitive to class imbalance than accuracy.  By evaluating with AUC-ROC, a better understanding of the model's discriminatory power is obtained, even with an imbalanced dataset.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron;  "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet;  "Introduction to Statistical Learning" by Gareth James et al.  These texts offer comprehensive treatments of model evaluation, class imbalance, and best practices in machine learning.  Further, exploring the documentation for scikit-learn and Keras will prove invaluable in understanding the functionalities and limitations of various metrics and techniques.
