My experience with numerical modeling frequently involves ingesting data from diverse sources, including text files where numerical arrays are represented as strings. Transferring this data efficiently to TensorFlow for machine learning purposes requires careful handling to maintain type integrity and avoid common errors. Primarily, one faces challenges involving string parsing, type conversion, and the necessity to maintain the 2D structure of the array. Without proper attention to detail, the resulting tensor might be malformed, leading to incorrect training or evaluation of models.

The process can be broadly divided into three distinct phases: reading the file, parsing the strings into numerical data, and creating the TensorFlow tensor. For simplicity, I assume that the text files are structured consistently, with each row of the 2D array represented as a single line within the file and array elements separated by a delimiter such as a comma or space. Moreover, all rows are assumed to have the same length to conform to a rectangular array format.

First, reading the file should ideally be done using Python’s built-in file handling mechanisms. This provides flexibility and is independent of external libraries beyond the core language. Each line represents a row and can be extracted efficiently. Subsequently, each line needs to undergo string parsing. It's here that the delimiters play a crucial role; splitting the string by these delimiters generates a list of string representations of the individual numerical elements of the array.

The most challenging part is transforming these string representations into numerical data that TensorFlow can work with. One should employ Python’s `float()` or `int()` conversion functions while accounting for potential formatting inconsistencies like leading or trailing spaces. This conversion must be done in a nested manner, iterating through each element of each row. Finally, after converting each row into a list of numerical values, the entire collection of lists can be converted into a NumPy array, from which TensorFlow can then create a tensor. The advantage of this two-stage approach is that NumPy’s array structure provides the perfect bridge between the raw data extracted from files and the data that TensorFlow uses. This approach reduces the likelihood of unexpected type mismatches within the TensorFlow computational graph.

Let's explore this process through code examples.

**Example 1: Handling Space-Delimited Arrays**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def load_space_delimited_array(filepath):
    """Loads a 2D array from a text file where elements are space-delimited."""
    data = []
    with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            row = [float(x) for x in line.strip().split()]
            data.append(row)
    return tf.convert_to_tensor(np.array(data), dtype=tf.float32)

# Example usage
filepath = 'space_delimited.txt'
# The file 'space_delimited.txt' contains lines like:
# "1.0 2.0 3.0"
# "4.0 5.0 6.0"
# "7.0 8.0 9.0"
tensor = load_space_delimited_array(filepath)
print(tensor)
```
This function, `load_space_delimited_array`, reads the text file. It uses `line.strip().split()` to both remove leading/trailing whitespaces from a line and split it into individual elements based on space as the delimiter. The `float(x)` function converts these string elements into floating-point numbers. After assembling a list of numerical lists, it is converted into a NumPy array and further into a TensorFlow tensor with `tf.float32` dtype. The `strip` function is critically important when the file has extra white spaces before or after number strings.

**Example 2: Handling Comma-Delimited Arrays**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def load_comma_delimited_array(filepath):
    """Loads a 2D array from a text file where elements are comma-delimited."""
    data = []
    with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            row = [int(x) for x in line.strip().split(',')]
            data.append(row)
    return tf.convert_to_tensor(np.array(data), dtype=tf.int32)

# Example usage
filepath = 'comma_delimited.txt'
# The file 'comma_delimited.txt' contains lines like:
# "1,2,3"
# "4,5,6"
# "7,8,9"

tensor = load_comma_delimited_array(filepath)
print(tensor)

```
The `load_comma_delimited_array` function performs a similar operation, but this time, it splits each line using the comma delimiter (`split(',')`). Furthermore, it casts the numerical data to integers using `int(x)` instead of floating point. This caters to scenarios where only integer array representations are provided in the text file. Note the final tensor is of `tf.int32` type. This is essential to make sure data type does not result in an error down stream in the model building process.

**Example 3: Handling Missing Data (or placeholders)**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def load_array_with_missing(filepath, missing_value_placeholder='NA'):
   """Loads a 2D array from a text file, replacing placeholders for missing values."""
   data = []
   with open(filepath, 'r') as file:
      for line in file:
         row = []
         for x in line.strip().split(','):
            if x.strip() == missing_value_placeholder:
               row.append(np.nan) # Using numpy's NaN for missing values
            else:
               row.append(float(x))
         data.append(row)
   return tf.convert_to_tensor(np.array(data), dtype=tf.float32)

# Example usage
filepath = 'missing_values.txt'
# The file 'missing_values.txt' contains lines like:
# "1,2,NA"
# "4,NA,6"
# "7,8,9"
tensor = load_array_with_missing(filepath)
print(tensor)

```
This function, `load_array_with_missing`, addresses a common scenario where data may contain missing entries. Here, placeholders such as 'NA' are used to denote missing values. The function replaces these placeholders with NumPy’s `np.nan`, a standard representation for missing numerical data. When converting to a tensor it is important to note that tensorflow will still need to handle the presence of NaN during the training phase. This may require the use of specific loss functions and pre-processing steps on the input data.

These examples illustrate the core process of converting 2D string array representations into usable TensorFlow tensors. It is important to adapt the delimiter and data type conversions to match the specific structure of the input text files. Error handling (beyond simple `try`/`except` blocks) can be further added for robustness, particularly when the text files may have inconsistent formatting. In addition to the standard practices demonstrated, handling different data types within a single file could necessitate using a structured approach to read the data in multiple tensors according to their types.

Further resources on this topic are available in several places. The official Python documentation provides detailed explanations of file handling, string manipulation and list comprehensions. The NumPy documentation includes information about NumPy arrays and how they can interact with TensorFlow. Finally the TensorFlow documentation contains crucial details on how to convert data into tensors and manage data types. Carefully reading these resources can solidify the process and offer solutions to complex challenges that can occur in real-world data loading scenarios. Understanding these libraries is crucial for effectively preparing data for machine learning.
