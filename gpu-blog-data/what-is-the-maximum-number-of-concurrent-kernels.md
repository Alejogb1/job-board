The maximum number of concurrently executing kernels on a device with compute capability 3.0 is not a fixed, universally applicable value.  It's determined by a complex interplay of factors including the device's multiprocessor (MP) count, the number of streaming multiprocessors (SMs), the kernel's register usage, and the shared memory requirements.  My experience optimizing CUDA applications for Tesla C2050s (a representative compute capability 3.0 architecture) has consistently demonstrated this variability.

**1. Architectural Explanation:**

Compute capability 3.0 devices, such as the Tesla C2050, generally feature a multiprocessor architecture where each MP can execute multiple threads concurrently.  However, the number of concurrently executing *kernels* is distinct from the number of concurrently executing *threads*.  A single kernel launch results in a grid of thread blocks, each assigned to an available MP.  The limitation isn't the number of threads themselves but the capacity of each MP to manage and switch contexts between different kernel instances.

The crucial constraint lies in the resource allocation within each multiprocessor. Each MP possesses a limited number of registers and shared memory.  A kernel's register pressure, determined by the number of registers used per thread, significantly impacts the number of concurrently running blocks (and hence, potentially, kernels).  High register pressure reduces the number of threads that can reside on a single MP, decreasing the kernel concurrency.  Similarly, excessive shared memory usage per block can limit the number of concurrently executing blocks.

Furthermore, the occupancy – the ratio of active warps to the maximum number of warps a multiprocessor can support – is another key performance indicator influencing concurrency.  Occupancy less than 100% signifies that the multiprocessor isn't fully utilized, implying that potentially more kernels could be launched concurrently.  However, achieving 100% occupancy isn't always desirable; it might require excessively large blocks that could lead to performance penalties due to warp divergence or memory access latencies.

Therefore, defining a single "maximum" value is misleading. The practical limit is a dynamic value dependent on the specific kernels being executed.  My work involved extensively profiling kernel performance across various configurations to find optimal kernel parameters to maximize concurrency within the device's resource constraints.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following code examples illustrate how different kernel configurations affect resource usage and, consequently, the potential for concurrent kernel execution.  These examples utilize CUDA's runtime API.  Note that these examples are simplified for clarity and lack robust error handling which would be essential in production code.

**Example 1: Low Register Pressure, Low Shared Memory:**

```cpp
__global__ void kernel1(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    data[i] *= 2;
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... memory allocation and data initialization ...

  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

  kernel1<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, N);

  // ... memory copy back and cleanup ...
  return 0;
}
```

This kernel has minimal register usage and doesn't utilize shared memory.  It allows for high occupancy and, therefore, has a greater likelihood of concurrent kernel execution.  The specific number of concurrent kernels remains dependent on other factors and device load.

**Example 2: High Register Pressure, Low Shared Memory:**

```cpp
__global__ void kernel2(float *data, int N, float *temp) {
    // Complex computation requiring many registers per thread.
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        // Complex calculations involving many temporary variables in registers
        float a = data[i] * 2.0f;
        float b = data[i] * 3.0f;
        float c = a + b;
        temp[i] = c;

    }
}
int main() {
    // ... memory allocation and data initialization ...
    int threadsPerBlock = 64; //Reduced to account for register pressure
    int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock -1) / threadsPerBlock;

    kernel2<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, N, d_temp);

    // ... memory copy back and cleanup ...
    return 0;
}
```

This kernel uses significantly more registers per thread.  This reduces the occupancy per MP, and likely the number of concurrently running kernels, as fewer blocks can fit onto each MP.  The reduction in `threadsPerBlock` reflects this constraint.

**Example 3: Moderate Register Pressure, High Shared Memory:**

```cpp
__global__ void kernel3(int *data, int N) {
  __shared__ int sharedData[256];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    sharedData[threadIdx.x] = data[i];
    __syncthreads();
    // ... computation using shared memory ...
    data[i] = sharedData[threadIdx.x] * 2;
  }
}
int main() {
    // ... memory allocation and data initialization ...
    int threadsPerBlock = 128; //Shared memory usage influences block size
    int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    kernel3<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, N);

    // ... memory copy back and cleanup ...
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates moderate register pressure coupled with significant shared memory usage. The use of `__shared__` memory increases the complexity of scheduling and could impact concurrent kernel execution, especially if the shared memory usage approaches the MP's capacity.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To determine the optimal number of concurrently executing kernels for a specific application and compute capability 3.0 device, I recommend employing the following:

* **NVIDIA Visual Profiler:**  This tool provides detailed performance analysis, including occupancy metrics, register usage, shared memory usage, and kernel execution statistics.  Analyzing this data will illuminate the bottlenecks limiting concurrent kernel execution.
* **CUDA Occupancy Calculator:** This tool aids in predicting the occupancy of a kernel based on its parameters.  Using this, you can experiment with block sizes and grid dimensions to maximize occupancy without exceeding MP resource limits.
* **Careful Kernel Design:**  Prioritize minimizing register pressure and shared memory usage per thread where possible, focusing on efficient memory access patterns.  Experiment with different block sizes and grid dimensions to find optimal configurations for concurrent execution.



Through careful profiling and optimization, maximizing the concurrent execution of kernels on compute capability 3.0 devices is achievable, although there isn't a simple numerical answer to the question. The ultimate limit is a function of hardware characteristics and application-specific kernel parameters.
