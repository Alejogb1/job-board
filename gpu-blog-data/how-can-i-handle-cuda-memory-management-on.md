The core challenge in simulating CUDA memory management on a CPU-only environment stems from the fundamental difference in memory architectures. CUDA relies on a hierarchical memory model with distinct memory spaces (global, shared, constant, texture) and associated access patterns dictated by the GPU's parallel processing capabilities.  Replicating this behavior on a CPU, which operates on a fundamentally different, typically flat, memory model, requires careful emulation.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects involving both GPU and CPU-based simulations has highlighted the importance of a structured approach to address this.

The solution doesn't involve direct CUDA API calls, as these are inherently GPU-specific.  Instead, we must focus on emulating the key aspects of CUDA memory management:  allocation of different memory regions with varying access speeds and limitations, and mimicking the behavior of kernel launches and data transfers between these regions. This involves managing different memory pools and controlling access to them, reflecting the hierarchical nature of CUDA memory.

**1.  Explanation:**

The strategy centers around creating distinct memory regions within the CPU's address space to represent CUDA's memory types. We can utilize standard C++ features like `std::vector` or custom memory pool implementations to manage these regions.  Global memory can be directly mapped to a large contiguous memory block. Shared memory emulation requires more sophistication, potentially involving thread-local storage or carefully managed data structures to reflect the shared nature of this memory in CUDA. Constant memory can be represented by a simple array with read-only access.  The crucial aspect is to track memory allocation and deallocation meticulously to avoid memory leaks and ensure data consistency. The emulation will also include functions that mimic the behavior of CUDA kernel launches.  Instead of parallelizing execution on a GPU, these functions will utilize multi-threading capabilities within the CPU using libraries like OpenMP or pthreads.  Data transfer operations between these emulated memory regions will then be handled as standard memory copy operations.  This requires careful consideration of data dependencies to accurately reflect the behavior of CUDA's asynchronous memory transfers.  The complexity depends largely on the degree of CUDA features being emulated.  A simple application might only need global and constant memory emulation, while a complex simulation might require more intricate management of shared memory and synchronization mechanisms.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Basic Global and Constant Memory Emulation**

This example showcases a simplified emulation of global and constant memory using `std::vector`.  Error handling and advanced features are omitted for brevity.

```c++
#include <vector>

// Emulated global memory
std::vector<float> global_memory;

// Emulated constant memory
std::vector<float> constant_memory;

void initialize_memory(size_t global_size, size_t constant_size) {
    global_memory.resize(global_size);
    constant_memory.resize(constant_size);

    // Initialize constant memory (example)
    for (size_t i = 0; i < constant_size; ++i) {
        constant_memory[i] = i * 1.0f;
    }
}


int main() {
    size_t global_size = 1024;
    size_t constant_size = 64;

    initialize_memory(global_size, constant_size);

    // Access global memory
    global_memory[512] = 10.0f;


    //Access constant memory (read only)
    float val = constant_memory[10];

    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:**  This example illustrates the fundamental concept of using `std::vector` to represent CUDA memory spaces.  The `initialize_memory` function simulates memory allocation.  Access is straightforward, mirroring the behavior of accessing global and constant memory in CUDA.

**Example 2:  Simplified Shared Memory Emulation using Thread Local Storage**

This example simulates shared memory using thread-local storage within a multi-threaded context.

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <thread>

//Simulate a Kernel launch
void kernel(int tid, std::vector<int>& shared_memory, std::vector<int>& global_memory) {
    //Access "shared" memory - thread local
    int my_shared = shared_memory[tid];
    my_shared += 1;
    shared_memory[tid] = my_shared;

    //Access global memory
    global_memory[tid] = shared_memory[tid];

}

int main() {
    int numThreads = 4;
    std::vector<int> global_memory(numThreads,0);
    std::vector<int> shared_memory(numThreads,0); //simplified emulation
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;

    for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) {
        threads.emplace_back(kernel,i, std::ref(shared_memory), std::ref(global_memory));
    }

    for (auto& t : threads) {
        t.join();
    }
    return 0;
}

```

**Commentary:** This code utilizes `std::thread` to create multiple threads, each accessing its own element within the `shared_memory` vector, simulating the concept of per-thread private memory within a shared memory space. This approach avoids true shared memory access issues common to multi-threaded programming, simplifying the emulation but compromising the real shared memory behaviour. A more sophisticated implementation might utilize mutexes and other synchronization primitives for more accurate behaviour.

**Example 3:  Memory Pool Management**

This example illustrates a rudimentary memory pool to manage memory allocation and deallocation, mimicking some aspects of CUDA's memory handling.

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class MemoryPool {
public:
    MemoryPool(size_t size) : size_(size), data_(size), allocated_(size, false) {}

    void* allocate(size_t bytes) {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < size_; ++i) {
            if (!allocated_[i]) {
                allocated_[i] = true;
                return &data_[i];
            }
        }
        return nullptr; // Allocation failed
    }

    void deallocate(void* ptr) {
        size_t index = (size_t)((char*)ptr - (char*)&data_[0]);
        if (index < size_ && allocated_[index]) {
            allocated_[index] = false;
        }
    }

private:
    size_t size_;
    std::vector<char> data_;
    std::vector<bool> allocated_;
};


int main() {
    MemoryPool pool(1024);
    int* ptr1 = (int*)pool.allocate(sizeof(int));
    *ptr1 = 10;

    // Allocate and deallocate more memory as needed

    pool.deallocate(ptr1);
    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:**  This demonstrates a basic memory pool.  It manages a contiguous block of memory, tracking allocation and deallocation.  A real-world implementation would need to handle fragmentation and potentially different sized allocations more robustly.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of memory management concepts, consult texts on operating systems, particularly those covering virtual memory and memory allocation algorithms.  For parallel programming on CPUs, explore resources on multithreading and synchronization using OpenMP and pthreads.  Furthermore, studying the CUDA programming guide, even without direct GPU access, can provide valuable insights into the memory model being emulated.  Finally, exploring memory profiling tools for CPU applications would assist in optimizing the memory management strategies employed.
