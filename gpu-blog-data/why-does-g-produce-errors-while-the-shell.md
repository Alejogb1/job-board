The disparity between apparent correctness in a shell script and resulting g++ compilation errors often stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how shell environments interact with compiler toolchains. Specifically, environmental variables passed to a shell script aren't automatically available to programs executed within that script unless explicitly handled, often through export mechanisms or command-line arguments. I’ve encountered this numerous times in my career, particularly when automating build processes or setting up testing environments where scripts relied on dynamically determined paths or compiler flags.

Fundamentally, shell scripts operate within their own process space. When a shell executes a command (like calling g++), it creates a child process to run that command. Inheriting environment variables from the parent shell is not a guaranteed, automatic transfer; rather, the shell explicitly makes some environment variables available to child processes. Typically, these are the variables declared and exported. When g++ is invoked directly from the terminal, the shell exports relevant variables (such as PATH) for g++'s proper functioning. However, when g++ is called by the script, this inheritance isn't implicit for all variables used for g++ configuration.

The primary culprit, in my experience, is when a shell script defines paths or compiler flags through shell variables that aren’t exported or are misused. These values become lost to the g++ process as it runs in the script's child process without the context provided by those unexported variables. Furthermore, the shell script might unintentionally alter existing compiler configurations or rely on temporary shell states which the compiler subprocess doesn’t inherit, leading to compilation failures. This often manifest as errors like "file not found," linking errors due to missing library paths or incorrect compiler options.

Let’s illustrate these points through a series of common scenarios.

**Example 1: Missing Header File Paths**

A frequent cause is an incorrect search path for include files. Assume I've written a script to compile a C++ program that uses a custom header located outside of the standard include paths.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

CUSTOM_INCLUDE_DIR="/path/to/custom/headers"

g++ -I$CUSTOM_INCLUDE_DIR main.cpp -o program
```

In this script, while the shell expands `$CUSTOM_INCLUDE_DIR`, the g++ command may still fail. G++ might complain that custom headers are missing, even if these headers reside in the specified directory, because the `-I` flag is not robust enough. The directory might not be present or it might be misinterpreted by the compiler’s parsing rules, especially in complex directory structures.

To resolve this, I'd first verify the path `$CUSTOM_INCLUDE_DIR` is correct, and then consider making it fully qualified. Further, I need to ensure the header files are explicitly included using relative or absolute paths. It can also be helpful to check the exact compiler command being invoked by using `-v` in the g++ command for verbose output.

**Example 2: Library Linkage Issues**

Linking libraries is another domain where environmental discrepancies manifest in compilation errors. Consider this script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

CUSTOM_LIB_DIR="/path/to/custom/libraries"
CUSTOM_LIB_NAME="mylib"

g++ -L$CUSTOM_LIB_DIR -l$CUSTOM_LIB_NAME main.cpp -o program
```

This script establishes library paths and the library name, again in shell variables. If executed directly, the shell expands the variables and links the library. If the custom libraries are not found by g++, errors result. It isn't always enough to merely specify a library directory with `-L`; G++ relies on properly finding the library file within that directory. If the library names don’t match, for instance, due to different naming conventions used by the library builder or the linker being configured incorrectly, G++ will fail to link. Often, there is a need to include specific library files using relative or absolute pathing in cases where the linker can't resolve the `-l` argument with files present in the directories provided with `-L`.

**Example 3: Compiler Flag Configuration**

Compiler flags, often modified by a user environment, can behave inconsistently within a shell script. Let's examine a situation where specific compiler optimization flags are necessary for compilation.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

CFLAGS="-O2 -Wall"
g++ $CFLAGS main.cpp -o program
```

While this script seemingly passes optimization flags, a similar problem to include directories and library paths is occurring. G++, in its child process, might not interpret the flags as intended. For example, some system-level flags might be expected by G++ that are not included in the script, or worse, an environment variable might be setting flags that interfere. The CFLAGS environment variable is one of the locations G++ will look for compiler flags if they are not included in the command. If those flags are set in one environment and not the one the shell script runs in there is a problem. There could also be an issue where flags are set to a default in the script or system-wide configuration that interfere with the script's intent.

To resolve this kind of issue, I ensure the CFLAGS set in the script accurately reflect what the program needs to build correctly and I avoid relying on system-level flags set elsewhere. It is important to know that G++ can be very sensitive to flag ordering so unexpected errors may result due to improper flag configuration. Also, I avoid relying on system settings as much as possible to have repeatable builds across different environments.

In summary, the discrepancy between shell script functionality and g++ behavior often arises from the way child processes inherit, or fail to inherit, environmental context. Shell variables, especially paths and flags, need careful handling. The resolution often involves making paths fully qualified, carefully specifying library files using relative or absolute paths, and double-checking that shell variables are appropriately exported or directly passed as command-line arguments to ensure that g++ has the necessary information. The verbose output from G++ when run with `-v` is often the best way to diagnose environmental and flag configuration problems as it can be used to see exactly what flags and paths are being passed to the compiler backend.

For further learning, I recommend reading GNU’s C++ compiler documentation on environment variables that affect the compiler’s operation. Additionally, studying the `export` command behavior in bash and other shells is critical for understanding how variables propagate to subprocesses. Understanding the difference between shell expansion and compiler behavior is also essential when debugging compile-time errors. Lastly, a deep dive into the GNU Make utility, which can explicitly define compiler paths and flags in a controlled manner, has aided me numerous times in managing complex builds.
