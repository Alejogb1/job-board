In TensorFlow 2 Keras, a model training on only a single batch, despite an expectation for more data loading, frequently points to a problematic configuration within the data pipeline rather than the model architecture itself. I've encountered this numerous times across various projects, and it typically stems from how the `tf.data.Dataset` is constructed and utilized.

The core issue usually revolves around a misconfigured or inadvertently limited `tf.data.Dataset` object's iterator. When the training loop initiates, Keras relies on this dataset to produce batches of data. If the dataset is not set up to properly cycle through the data or if its `repeat()` operation is missing or incorrectly placed, the iterator exhausts quickly, causing the training to halt after just one batch, seemingly without loading further data.

The critical component is understanding how data is fed to the model. Keras's `fit` method takes a `tf.data.Dataset` object, which is an efficient mechanism for loading, transforming, and batching data. Internally, the training loop obtains a new batch by calling the `next()` method on the dataset's iterator. If this iterator has reached its end (i.e., it has only yielded the data from a single pass through the input), the training appears to stop prematurely.

To illustrate, consider the following common missteps, each showcasing a different manifestation of the single-batch issue:

**Example 1: Missing `repeat()` Operation**

This example demonstrates a dataset that iterates over the data only once, resulting in training on a single batch.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Dummy data
data = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(1000,))

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
dataset = dataset.batch(32)


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(dataset, epochs=5)
```

In this scenario, `dataset` is created without calling `repeat()`. The iterator generated by this dataset provides each batch sequentially and then terminates. Keras's training loop effectively consumes the entire dataset after the first batch, and the remaining epochs do not get any new data. The absence of `repeat()` is the root cause. The model trains only on the initial batch, and the training process appears to stall. To address this, adding `dataset = dataset.repeat()` prior to the training will allow the dataset to cycle infinitely.

**Example 2: Incorrect Placement of `repeat()`**

In the following snippet, I demonstrate an example where the dataset will only train for one batch because the repeat is applied to the batch instead of the entire dataset.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Dummy data
data = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(1000,))

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
dataset = dataset.batch(32).repeat()


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(dataset, epochs=5)
```

Here, the `repeat()` call is incorrectly placed *after* the `batch()` operation. As a result, the *batched* data is repeated rather than the individual data points being grouped into new batches. The consequence is that the iterator generates the first batch repeatedly, indefinitely. In practice, the model trains on this single, static batch. While the loop continues running, the model will only fit against the initial data. To rectify this, `repeat()` should precede `batch()`. This ensures that data points from the original dataset are reused to construct new batches.

**Example 3: Data Shuffling Issues Combined with Missing Repeat**

This final example combines issues with a missing `repeat()` and not shuffling the dataset:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Dummy data
data = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(1000,))

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
dataset = dataset.batch(32)


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(dataset, epochs=5)
```

Similar to the first example, this code also fails to call `repeat()`. Moreover, the dataset is not shuffled before being batched, resulting in no batch randomization. The dataset will only produce one batch before ending. This further amplifies the original issue of training on a single batch. In real-world scenarios, data is often loaded sequentially. Failing to shuffle can result in biased results, as well as the premature termination of the training loop. In conjunction with `repeat()`, it is recommended to use `shuffle()` when appropriate to ensure randomness in each epoch. The dataset should be shuffled using `dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size)` before the dataset is batched and repeated. This will result in random batch sampling.

To resolve these issues, the `tf.data.Dataset` should be structured correctly. The recommended pipeline is to first create the dataset from your data source (e.g., `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices()`), then shuffle the dataset ( `shuffle(buffer_size)` ), then repeat the dataset with the `.repeat()` method, and then finally batch the data using the `.batch(batch_size)` method. This pattern ensures that you produce unique, random batches of data for training the model. For instance, a correctly configured version would look like this:

```python
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1000)  # Shuffle before batching
dataset = dataset.repeat()
dataset = dataset.batch(32)
```

In summary, training halts after a single batch primarily due to issues with the data iterator being exhausted too quickly. Proper configuration of `tf.data.Dataset` elements like the `repeat()` and `shuffle()` operations, as well as considering their sequence relative to `batch()`, are critical for continuous data feeding during model training.

For further study, I would strongly recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data` and its various components. Specifically, exploring the use of `repeat()`, `shuffle()`, and the role of iterators within the dataset. Additionally, there are well-written tutorials and blog posts that illustrate common patterns for constructing `tf.data.Dataset` pipelines. These resources, while not providing specific code examples here, offer a good understanding of the fundamentals necessary for effective data handling in TensorFlow training. The TensorFlow tutorials and guides provide detailed information on how to build efficient and effective data pipelines. Lastly, the TensorFlow API reference documentation provides clear explanations of the different methods and their expected behaviors.
