Directly addressing the query, GPU memory updates, specifically as they pertain to operations within shaders executing on compute or graphics pipelines, are *not* inherently atomic in the sense that a single write operation from a single thread will universally and instantaneously be visible to all other threads. This non-atomicity is crucial to understand for correct concurrent programming on GPUs and introduces complexities absent from more traditionally single-core or multi-core CPU environments where atomic operations are readily available.

The fundamental architecture of a GPU necessitates this behavior. GPUs consist of numerous Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), each housing multiple cores that execute shader programs (kernels) in parallel. Within a single SM, threads execute in lockstep within warps (groups of threads), but different SMs operate largely independently. Global memory, the memory accessible by all threads across all SMs, is accessed through a memory controller. This controller, optimized for high throughput rather than strict single-instruction precision, introduces delays and potential for race conditions. Consequently, a write operation initiated by a thread on one SM is not guaranteed to immediately propagate to all other SMs and subsequently all threads' view of that memory location.

When we speak of "atomicity," we usually mean that an operation appears to occur as a single, indivisible unit with respect to other operations, regardless of which threads initiate them. In the case of GPU memory, a simple write instruction from thread A to global memory address X might not be immediately reflected when thread B, executing on a different SM, reads the value at address X. This inconsistency is because the write from A might be buffered within its SM's cache or still in transit through the interconnect before making its way to global memory and propagating back out to Bâ€™s SM. This is fundamentally different from CPU architecture where cache coherency protocols enforce a much tighter and more consistent memory model, often allowing access to atomic instructions and guarantees.

The implication of non-atomic memory updates is that programmers must explicitly enforce synchronization when multiple threads modify the same global memory location or when one thread modifies a memory location read by another thread in a subsequent operation. Failure to do so results in race conditions, leading to unpredictable and erroneous outcomes. This typically involves using explicit atomic operations and synchronization primitives provided by the API (CUDA, OpenCL, Vulkan, etc.).

Now, let's examine some code examples to illustrate the challenges.

**Example 1: The Inherent Race Condition**

Assume we have a kernel that increments a counter in global memory:

```cpp
// OpenCL Kernel
__kernel void increment_counter(__global int* counter) {
    int my_id = get_global_id(0);
    (*counter)++;
}
```

This seemingly straightforward kernel will produce incorrect results if executed by multiple threads simultaneously. Each thread attempts to increment the `counter`, which might be stored in global memory. Without any explicit synchronization, the following sequence could occur:

1.  Thread A reads the `counter` value (let's say 0).
2.  Thread B reads the `counter` value (also 0).
3.  Thread A increments its local copy of the value (to 1).
4.  Thread B increments its local copy of the value (to 1).
5.  Thread A writes 1 back to global memory.
6.  Thread B writes 1 back to global memory.

The final value in global memory is 1, when it should have been 2. This is a classic race condition resulting from non-atomic updates. The inherent problem is the lack of enforced mutual exclusion and the possibility of stale cached values.

**Example 2: Employing Atomic Operations**

We can rectify the issue in the first example by utilizing an atomic increment instruction:

```cpp
// OpenCL Kernel
__kernel void increment_counter_atomic(__global int* counter) {
    int my_id = get_global_id(0);
    atomic_inc(counter);
}
```

Here, the `atomic_inc` function ensures that the increment operation is performed as an indivisible unit. In most GPU APIs, `atomic_inc` and related atomic operations guarantee the following:
*  The read and write are performed as a single, uninterrupted operation.
*  Multiple threads attempting to execute an atomic operation on the same memory location will be serialized by the memory controller, preventing concurrent access.
*  The updated value will be made visible to all other threads accessing that memory location.

This addresses the race condition by ensuring the correct result is written to the counter. However, atomic operations also come at a cost. They typically introduce overhead because they require serialization and communication through the memory controller and incur additional clock cycles. Therefore, careful usage is advised.

**Example 3: Utilizing Memory Fences for Coherence**

While atomic operations are necessary for concurrent updates, sometimes you might want a broader synchronization mechanism involving a series of reads and writes. Memory fences are designed for this purpose:

```cpp
// CUDA Kernel
__global__ void complex_operation(int* data, int* result){
    int tid = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    // A threads reads the data
    int temp = data[tid];

    // perform some operation to update temp
    temp = temp + 1;

    // Write to a location in memory accessible by a subsequent kernel
    result[tid] = temp;

    // Memory fence ensures all writes are flushed from cache
    __threadfence();
}

__global__ void  subsequent_kernel(int* data, int* output){
    int tid = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    output[tid] = data[tid] * 2;
}
```

In this CUDA example, `__threadfence()` forces all memory writes to complete before the thread proceeds.  Without `__threadfence()`, it is possible that subsequent kernel execution using the data will read outdated data because the data is cached within the SM and not immediately updated in main memory. Memory fences do not ensure the atomicity of individual reads and writes; rather, they guarantee that the *visibility* of previous writes will be guaranteed to subsequent memory operations of all threads once the fence instruction is reached. This is needed when the application has the potential to perform operations out-of-order due to optimizations in the hardware architecture. This instruction, therefore, should be used sparingly to minimize synchronization overhead.

In conclusion, GPU memory updates are inherently non-atomic, and reliance on any assumed atomicity leads to race conditions and program malfunction. Proper concurrent programming on GPUs requires diligent use of atomic operations, memory fences, and synchronization primitives provided by the GPU API (CUDA, OpenCL, Vulkan, etc.) to maintain data integrity when shared data is accessed across multiple threads and multiple SMs. Understanding the specifics of the memory models of the particular GPU architecture is essential for creating high-performance, deterministic parallel computing solutions.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a more in-depth understanding of GPU programming and memory models, I recommend consulting the official documentation for your specific GPU API (CUDA or OpenCL) or graphics API (Vulkan or DirectX). You should also study the architectural manuals of the relevant GPU vendor. These documents provide detailed descriptions of memory access patterns, synchronization methods, and best practices for performance. Further technical publications such as those found on the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore can offer additional theoretical insight. Finally, online forums and communities such as the official vendor-specific forums often contain solutions to more specific problems.
