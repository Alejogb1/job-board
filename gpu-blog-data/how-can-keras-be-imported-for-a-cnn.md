The successful import of Keras for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) development hinges critically on the underlying TensorFlow or Theano backend configuration.  My experience building and deploying numerous CNN models, particularly within production environments characterized by stringent dependency management, has consistently highlighted the importance of verifying this foundational aspect before proceeding with model architecture definition.  Failure to do so frequently results in cryptic import errors, masking the true root cause of the issue.

**1.  Explanation:**

Keras, a high-level API for neural networks, operates as an abstraction layer above lower-level frameworks like TensorFlow or Theano.  While Keras simplifies model building, the underlying backend is responsible for the actual computation. The choice of backend profoundly influences how Keras is imported and consequently, how the CNN is executed.  Incorrect or conflicting backend configurations are a common source of import failures.  For instance, attempting to utilize TensorFlow functionalities within a Theano-backed Keras environment leads to incompatibility errors.  Furthermore, version mismatches between Keras, TensorFlow, and potentially CUDA (if using a GPU) can silently undermine the import process, producing seemingly unrelated runtime errors later.  Therefore, a careful assessment of the environment's dependencies is paramount.

The most prevalent approach, and the one I consistently recommend, is to use TensorFlow as the backend.  TensorFlow's robust ecosystem and widespread adoption make it the preferred choice for most CNN projects.  This approach simplifies dependency management and leverages TensorFlow's extensive optimization features for improved performance.  However, ensuring that TensorFlow is correctly installed and that Keras is configured to use it is critical.  Using pip, the Python package installer, is the most common and reliable method for managing dependencies.

The process is fundamentally three-fold: verifying the presence of a suitable backend (typically TensorFlow), ensuring Keras's awareness of the backend, and then finally proceeding with the import statement.  Errors typically arise at one of these stages.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Successful Import with TensorFlow Backend (Recommended):**

```python
# Verify TensorFlow installation (optional but recommended)
import tensorflow as tf
print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")

# Import Keras; TensorFlow is the default backend in most installations
import keras

# Verify Keras backend
print(f"Keras backend: {keras.backend.backend()}")

# Proceed with CNN model building
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

print("Keras CNN model successfully built.")

```

This example showcases a streamlined approach.  The initial verification of TensorFlow's installation provides crucial diagnostic information if issues arise. The explicit print statement confirming the Keras backend selection reinforces the successful configuration.  The subsequent CNN model construction demonstrates the standard workflow once Keras has been imported correctly.


**Example 2: Specifying the Backend (Less Common, but Useful for Troubleshooting):**

```python
import os
os.environ['KERAS_BACKEND'] = 'tensorflow' #Explicitly set the backend

import keras

print(f"Keras backend: {keras.backend.backend()}")

# ... (rest of the CNN model building as in Example 1) ...
```

This example explicitly sets the Keras backend using an environment variable.  This is helpful in situations where the default backend is not correctly detected or when troubleshooting conflicts between multiple backend installations.  This method ensures that Keras utilizes the specified backend, regardless of any system-wide default settings.


**Example 3:  Handling Potential Import Errors:**

```python
try:
    import keras
    print("Keras imported successfully.")

    # ... (rest of the CNN model building) ...

except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Error importing Keras: {e}")
    print("Ensure TensorFlow or Theano is installed and configured correctly.")
    print("Check your Python environment for conflicting packages.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```

This example demonstrates robust error handling.  The `try-except` block gracefully handles potential `ImportError` exceptions, providing informative messages about possible causes of the failure.  It also includes a generic `Exception` handler to catch unexpected errors, preventing the script from crashing silently. This is particularly valuable in production deployments where unexpected issues can cause significant disruptions.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation.  A comprehensive guide to TensorFlow.  A dedicated text on deep learning frameworks, encompassing Keras and its integration with TensorFlow.  These resources provide in-depth explanations of Keras's functionalities, TensorFlow's architecture, and the practical aspects of integrating them for CNN development.  Consult these resources for a thorough understanding of best practices and troubleshooting strategies.  They are invaluable for resolving complex dependency issues and navigating the nuances of deep learning framework integration.
