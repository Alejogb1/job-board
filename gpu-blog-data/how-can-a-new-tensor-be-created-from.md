Tensor manipulation frequently involves creating sub-tensors from existing ones based on specific index selections.  My experience optimizing large-scale machine learning models has highlighted the importance of efficient tensor slicing techniques, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data where performance is critical.  Directly accessing and manipulating specific column indices is crucial for tasks like feature selection, data augmentation, and model input preparation.  Inefficient methods can severely impact training time and memory usage.  Therefore, understanding the nuances of tensor indexing is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Creating a new tensor from an existing one using specific column indices requires careful consideration of the underlying tensor library and its indexing mechanisms.  Most tensor libraries, such as NumPy (Python) or TensorFlow/PyTorch (Python), utilize zero-based indexing and support both integer and boolean indexing.  Integer indexing allows selecting specific columns by their index numbers, while boolean indexing enables selection based on a condition applied to the tensor's columns.  The chosen method depends on the specific requirements of the task.  For instance, selecting a fixed set of columns benefits from integer indexing due to its speed and simplicity.  In contrast, selecting columns based on some criteria (e.g., columns with a mean value above a threshold) requires boolean indexing.

The core operation is usually implemented through slicing.  Slicing uses colon notation (`:`), allowing the selection of a range of elements. When creating a new tensor from selected columns, the complete range of rows (`:`), but only the selected column indices are specified.  This creates a view in some cases, and a copy in others – understanding the distinction is crucial for memory management and avoiding unintended side effects.  A view shares the underlying data with the original tensor, leading to efficient memory usage but potential unintended modifications if the new tensor is altered.  A copy, on the other hand, allocates new memory, ensuring independent manipulation but resulting in higher memory consumption.  The library's implementation often influences this behavior; certain functions explicitly create copies while others may return views.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Integer Indexing with NumPy**

```python
import numpy as np

# Original tensor
original_tensor = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                           [5, 6, 7, 8],
                           [9, 10, 11, 12]])

# Select columns at indices 1 and 3 (columns 2 and 4 in human-readable indexing)
selected_indices = [1, 3]
new_tensor = original_tensor[:, selected_indices]

print("Original Tensor:\n", original_tensor)
print("\nNew Tensor:\n", new_tensor)
```

This example uses integer indexing in NumPy.  `selected_indices` explicitly lists the column indices to be included in the new tensor.  The slicing `[:, selected_indices]` selects all rows (`:`), and the columns specified in `selected_indices`.  This is generally efficient and creates a view in this specific case, meaning that modifying `new_tensor` also modifies `original_tensor`.  To create a copy, use `.copy()` method: `new_tensor = original_tensor[:, selected_indices].copy()`.


**Example 2: Boolean Indexing with PyTorch**

```python
import torch

# Original tensor
original_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                              [5, 6, 7, 8],
                              [9, 10, 11, 12]])

# Select columns where values are greater than 5
condition = original_tensor > 5
new_tensor = original_tensor[:, condition.any(dim=0)] #Any column having atleast one value > 5

print("Original Tensor:\n", original_tensor)
print("\nNew Tensor:\n", new_tensor)
```

This PyTorch example demonstrates boolean indexing.  The `condition` tensor is a boolean mask indicating which elements satisfy the condition (greater than 5).  `condition.any(dim=0)` reduces this mask to determine columns with at least one value satisfying the condition.  The slicing then selects all rows and the columns indicated by the reduced mask.  This approach is flexible for complex selection criteria but can be slower than integer indexing for large tensors, as it involves evaluating the condition for every element.  Here, a copy is created by default; if a view is needed, specific methods must be used depending on your required outcome.


**Example 3: Advanced Indexing with TensorFlow**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original tensor
original_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                             [5, 6, 7, 8],
                             [9, 10, 11, 12]])

# Select columns at indices 0 and 2 using tf.gather
indices = tf.constant([0, 2])
new_tensor = tf.gather(original_tensor, indices, axis=1)

print("Original Tensor:\n", original_tensor)
print("\nNew Tensor:\n", new_tensor)
```

TensorFlow's `tf.gather` provides another way to select specific columns (or rows, depending on the axis specified).  This example uses `tf.gather` with `axis=1` to select columns specified in the `indices` tensor. This function returns a new tensor with allocated memory, hence it's always a copy. This method, while concise, might be less efficient than direct slicing for simple index selections, but shines when dealing with more complex scenarios or very large tensors where optimized underlying implementations of `gather` can greatly improve performance.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of tensor manipulation, I recommend consulting the official documentation of NumPy, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.  Explore tutorials and examples focusing on array slicing and indexing.  Furthermore, textbooks on linear algebra and numerical computation provide a strong theoretical foundation for tensor operations.  Focusing on efficiency improvements by comparing the performance of different methods – such as direct indexing, `gather` functions, or advanced masking – should be prioritized.  Finally, in-depth exploration of memory management within these libraries is crucial for handling large-scale datasets effectively.
