The `pg_stats` view in PostgreSQL doesn't directly support unnesting arrays.  It presents aggregated statistics, and the array representation reflects the inherent variability within a column's data.  Attempts to directly unnest within the view itself will fail. The solution lies in querying the underlying data and then applying array unnesting techniques.  My experience working with performance optimization for large-scale PostgreSQL deployments has shown this to be the most efficient approach, avoiding the overhead of unnecessary joins and subqueries against potentially massive tables.

The primary challenge stems from the fact that `pg_stats` provides a summarized view.  Unnesting requires accessing the granular row-level data, which necessitates a separate query against the relevant table.  This query must then be appropriately joined with the information provided in `pg_stats` if the goal is to correlate statistical summaries with individual array elements.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

The process involves three distinct steps:

* **Identifying the Target Table:**  First, determine the table whose statistics are represented in `pg_stats`.  This can be achieved by examining the `schemaname`, `tablename`, and `attname` columns within `pg_stats`.  These columns specify the schema, table, and attribute (column) associated with the statistics.  Note that only columns with array data types will yield arrays in the `most_common_vals` column.

* **Retrieving Row-Level Data:** Next, formulate a query to extract the data from the identified table, focusing on the column containing the arrays.  This step uses a `SELECT` statement targeting the specific table and column.

* **Unnesting the Arrays:** Finally, employ PostgreSQL's `unnest()` function to expand the arrays into individual rows.  This function transforms each array element into a separate row, making it accessible for further analysis or joining with other data sources, including the summary statistics in `pg_stats`.

Crucially, the efficiency of this process is significantly impacted by the size of the target table and the cardinality of the array elements within the target column.  For exceptionally large tables, optimization techniques such as indexing and potentially partitioning might be necessary.  In my work, I've found that careful index design is often the key to maintaining acceptable query performance, particularly in production environments.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's assume we have a table named `products` with a column `tags` of type `text[]`.  The following examples illustrate unnesting the arrays, combining it with data from `pg_stats`, focusing on different aspects of the problem.

**Example 1: Basic Unnesting**

This example demonstrates the fundamental unnest operation on the `products` table's `tags` column:

```sql
SELECT unnest(tags) AS individual_tag
FROM products;
```

This query simply extracts each element from the `tags` array in each row of the `products` table and presents them as individual rows in a column named `individual_tag`.  It's the foundational step for more complex scenarios.


**Example 2: Joining with `pg_stats` for Statistical Context**

This example adds context by joining the unnesting result with information from `pg_stats`.  This allows you to see how individual tags relate to the overall statistics calculated by PostgreSQL.

```sql
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    individual_tag,
    s.n_distinct
FROM
    products p,
    pg_stats s,
    unnest(p.tags) AS individual_tag
WHERE
    s.schemaname = 'public'  -- Replace 'public' with your schema
    AND s.tablename = 'products'
    AND s.attname = 'tags';
```

This query joins the `products` table with `pg_stats` using conditions on schema, table, and attribute name.  The `unnest` function is integrated to show each individual tag alongside the overall distinct count (`n_distinct`) from `pg_stats`.  Remember to replace `'public'` with the actual schema of your `products` table.


**Example 3:  Handling Null Values and Filtering**

This example addresses potential null values in the `tags` column and includes a filter to select only specific tags:


```sql
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    individual_tag,
    s.n_distinct
FROM
    products p
JOIN
    pg_stats s ON s.schemaname = 'public' AND s.tablename = 'products' AND s.attname = 'tags'
LEFT JOIN
    unnest(p.tags) AS individual_tag ON TRUE
WHERE
    individual_tag IS NOT NULL AND individual_tag = 'electronics' --Filter for specific tag
;
```

This query uses a `LEFT JOIN` with `unnest` to include rows even if `tags` is null, handling cases where some products may lack tags. It also demonstrates the use of `WHERE` clause to filter for specific tags, in this case, 'electronics'.  Null handling and filtering are essential for effective data analysis. Note the use of a `LEFT JOIN` with the `unnest` to ensure all `products` are present in the output, regardless of the value of the `tags` column.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

The PostgreSQL documentation is invaluable for understanding the specifics of `pg_stats` and array functions.  Consult the official documentation for details on data types, functions, and query optimization techniques.  Thorough familiarity with SQL query optimization strategies is essential.  Consider investing time in learning about indexing techniques specific to PostgreSQL, particularly for large datasets.  Books on database design and query performance tuning will also prove beneficial for understanding advanced techniques beyond the scope of this response.  Finally, understanding the limitations of the `pg_stats` view and its role in providing statistical summaries is critical for properly leveraging this information.
