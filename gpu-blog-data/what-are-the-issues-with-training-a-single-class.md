The core challenge in training a single-class U-Net++ model stems from the inherent imbalance between positive and negative pixel classes during the learning process.  My experience in biomedical image segmentation, specifically with microscopic cell identification, has highlighted this repeatedly.  While U-Net++ architectures, with their nested dense skip connections, excel at capturing contextual information beneficial for segmentation tasks, this advantage becomes a liability when the dataset predominantly contains one class.  The network, optimized using standard loss functions like binary cross-entropy, will readily converge to a solution that always predicts the majority class, achieving high accuracy but failing to segment the minority class effectively. This leads to poor recall and F1-score for the class of interest.

This problem manifests in several ways.  Firstly, the gradient descent process, the backbone of backpropagation, can become skewed towards minimizing losses associated with the dominant class, leading to minimal updates for the rare class.  Secondly, the network might learn a trivial solution, constantly predicting the majority class regardless of input image features.  Finally, subtle variations within the minority class become indistinguishable to the model due to a lack of sufficient examples and gradients to drive learning for those specific features.  These issues are not unique to U-Net++, affecting any single-class segmentation model, but the architectural complexity of U-Net++ can exacerbate them.  The dense skip connections, intended to promote feature propagation across scales, might inadvertently propagate the dominance of the majority class to deeper layers, further hindering minority class learning.

Addressing these issues requires careful consideration of several factors.  Pre-processing the dataset using data augmentation techniques to oversample the minority class is crucial. Techniques such as random cropping, rotations, and mirroring can artificially increase the sample size of the minority class, providing the model with more opportunities to learn its features. However, simple augmentation may not always suffice, especially with complex image features. Class weighting in the loss function is another critical strategy.  This allows for emphasizing the contribution of the minority class to the overall loss, thereby directing the training process towards learning its features more effectively.  Finally, employing more advanced loss functions that are less susceptible to class imbalance, such as focal loss, can significantly improve model performance.

Let's examine this through code examples in Python using TensorFlow/Keras.  I'll assume the reader possesses familiarity with these frameworks.

**Example 1:  Simple U-Net++ with Binary Cross-Entropy**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, UpSampling2D, concatenate, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def unetpp(input_shape):
    inputs = Input(input_shape)
    # ... (U-Net++ architecture definition - omitted for brevity, assume a standard implementation) ...
    outputs = Conv2D(1, 1, activation='sigmoid')(x)  # Single-class output
    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

model = unetpp((256, 256, 3)) # Example input shape
model.summary()

# Training loop (omitted for brevity)
```

This example demonstrates a basic U-Net++ setup using binary cross-entropy, which, as previously discussed, is prone to class imbalance issues.

**Example 2: U-Net++ with Class Weighting**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# ... (U-Net++ architecture definition from Example 1) ...

# Calculate class weights
pos_samples = np.sum(training_masks == 1)
neg_samples = np.sum(training_masks == 0)
class_weights = {0: pos_samples / (pos_samples + neg_samples), 1: neg_samples / (pos_samples + neg_samples)}

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'], loss_weights=class_weights)
# Training loop (omitted for brevity)
```

Here, we introduce class weighting to counteract the imbalance.  `class_weights` dictionary assigns higher weight to the minority class, proportionally to its under-representation in the dataset.

**Example 3: U-Net++ with Focal Loss**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.losses import binary_crossentropy

def focal_loss(gamma=2.0, alpha=0.25):
    def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
        return tf.keras.backend.mean(focal_loss_fixed(y_true, y_pred, gamma=gamma, alpha=alpha))
    return custom_loss

def focal_loss_fixed(y_true, y_pred, gamma=2., alpha=.25):
    pt_1 = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true, 1), y_pred, tf.ones_like(y_pred))
    pt_0 = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true, 0), y_pred, tf.zeros_like(y_pred))

    epsilon = tf.keras.backend.epsilon()
    pt_1 = tf.clip_by_value(pt_1, epsilon, 1. - epsilon)
    pt_0 = tf.clip_by_value(pt_0, epsilon, 1. - epsilon)

    return -K.sum(alpha * K.pow(1. - pt_1, gamma) * K.log(pt_1)) - K.sum((1 - alpha) * K.pow(pt_0, gamma) * K.log(1. - pt_0))


# ... (U-Net++ architecture definition from Example 1) ...

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=focal_loss(), metrics=['accuracy'])
# Training loop (omitted for brevity)
```

This example demonstrates the implementation of focal loss, a loss function designed to alleviate the impact of class imbalance by down-weighting the contribution of easy examples (well-classified majority class samples).  The `alpha` and `gamma` hyperparameters can be tuned for optimal performance.


In conclusion, effectively training a single-class U-Net++ necessitates a multi-pronged approach.  Addressing class imbalance through data augmentation, class weighting in the loss function, and potentially utilizing more sophisticated loss functions like focal loss are key strategies.  Remember that careful hyperparameter tuning and thorough model evaluation using metrics beyond accuracy, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, are vital for ensuring robust performance.  Further investigation into techniques like active learning and transfer learning could also prove beneficial depending on the specific dataset and application.
