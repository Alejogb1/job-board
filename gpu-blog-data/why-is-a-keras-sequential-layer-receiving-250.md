The root cause of a Keras sequential layer receiving 250 input tensors instead of the expected single tensor almost invariably stems from a mismatch between the output shape of the preceding layer or data preprocessing step and the input expectations of the sequential layer.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous deep learning projects, particularly those involving complex data pipelines and custom layers, highlights the critical role of shape consistency.  Neglecting to meticulously track tensor shapes throughout the model architecture frequently leads to this precise error.

**1. Explanation:**

Keras' sequential model inherently expects a strictly ordered, sequential flow of data. Each layer processes the output of its predecessor. A discrepancy arises when the output from a previous layer (or your input data itself) produces a tensor or list of tensors that doesn't conform to the input shape requirements of the subsequent layer. In this case, the unexpected 250 tensors suggest that the input to the problematic sequential layer is not a single tensor, but rather a collection, possibly a list or batch of tensors improperly handled.

This situation can occur in several ways:

* **Incorrect data preprocessing:** The data might not be properly reshaped or formatted before feeding it into the model. This is especially prevalent when dealing with image data, time-series data, or other multi-dimensional inputs requiring careful manipulation.  For example, if you're working with images and haven't flattened them correctly before passing them to a dense layer, you'll encounter this problem.  Each image might be treated as a separate tensor.

* **Output of a previous layer:**  A preceding layer, perhaps a convolutional layer with multiple output channels or a custom layer with an incorrectly defined output shape, could be generating 250 tensors. This indicates a design flaw in the architecture preceding the problematic layer.  Common causes include using a layer which outputs multiple independent feature maps without aggregation or reshaping.

* **Batching issues:**  The problem might not originate from the layer itself but from how you're feeding data into the model.  If you are feeding batches of data and haven't correctly configured your `model.fit()` function or `model.predict()` function, each element in the batch could be interpreted as a separate tensor, leading to this error. Incorrect handling of batch dimensions is a prevalent source of errors.

* **Inconsistent data types:** Occasionally, the data type mismatch between layers, or between input data and the first layer, can cause issues. Ensuring that everything is a NumPy array or TensorFlow tensor of the correct data type is crucial.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate potential scenarios and their solutions with Python code using TensorFlow/Keras.

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Preprocessing**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

# Incorrect data: List of 250 tensors instead of a single tensor
incorrect_data = [np.random.rand(10, 10) for _ in range(250)]

# Correct data: Single tensor representing the concatenated inputs
correct_data = np.array(incorrect_data).reshape(250, 100)  # Assuming 10x10 tensors

# Model definition
model = keras.Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(100,)), #input_shape expects a vector size of 100
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Attempting to fit the model with incorrect data will throw an error
# model.fit(incorrect_data, np.random.rand(250,10)) # This will fail

# Fitting the model with correctly reshaped data
model.fit(correct_data, np.random.rand(250,10), epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates the effect of incorrect data formatting.  The `incorrect_data` list, containing 250 separate 10x10 tensors, causes the error. Reshaping it into a single tensor of shape (250, 100) resolves the issue, as each row now represents a single data point. The `input_shape` parameter in the `Flatten` layer is crucial here; it must align with the reshaped data.


**Example 2:  Incorrect Output from a Previous Layer**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, Flatten, Dense, Reshape

# Model with a convolutional layer producing multiple tensors (incorrect)
model_incorrect = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(250, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), #250 filters results in 250 tensors
    Flatten(), #flattening the incorrect tensors still produces a mis-shape
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Model with a convolutional layer and reshaping (correct)
model_correct = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(10, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), #10 filters results in 10 tensors
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Attempting to compile/fit model_incorrect will likely raise an error related to shape incompatibility.
#model_incorrect.compile(...) # This line may throw an error.
#model_incorrect.fit(...) #this may throw an error.
model_correct.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
#model_correct.fit(...) # This will function without issue
```

Here, the incorrect model uses a convolutional layer that produces 250 feature maps (filters).  The `Flatten` layer then tries to flatten these 250 tensors into a single vector, causing a shape mismatch.  The corrected model uses fewer filters, resulting in a single tensor output from the convolutional layer that is compatible with the subsequent `Flatten` and `Dense` layers.



**Example 3: Batching Issues**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

#Incorrectly formatted training data
incorrect_training_data = np.random.rand(250,10,10) #250 batches of size 10x10

#Correctly formatted training data
correct_training_data = np.random.rand(2500,100) #2500 single samples each with 100 features

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#Fitting model with incorrect data will fail
#model.fit(incorrect_training_data, np.random.rand(250,10)) # This will fail, as it expects 2500 samples

#Fitting model with correct data works
model.fit(correct_training_data, np.random.rand(2500,10), epochs=10)
```

This example highlights the importance of proper batching.  The `incorrect_training_data` is shaped as if each element is an independent batch, leading to the error. The `correct_training_data` reshapes the data such that each row represents a single sample, eliminating the mismatch.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I strongly advise reviewing the official Keras documentation thoroughly, focusing on the sections detailing sequential model building, layer input/output shapes, and data preprocessing.  Examine tutorials on data formatting for various input types (images, text, time series).  Consult advanced tutorials on building custom Keras layers and understanding tensor operations within TensorFlow.  Furthermore, a solid grasp of NumPy array manipulation is crucial for effective data handling.  Mastering these fundamentals will greatly reduce the likelihood of encountering such shape-related errors in the future.
