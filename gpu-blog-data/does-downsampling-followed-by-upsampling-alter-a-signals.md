A signal, upon undergoing downsampling followed by upsampling to its original sampling rate, will often *not* return to its original sample length; it's more about the *rate* than the *sample count*. The misunderstanding arises from the terminology – downsampling and upsampling impact the effective sample rate, while the actual number of samples can be different. This is crucial to understand, especially in digital signal processing where these techniques are routinely applied. I've frequently encountered this during my work on audio codecs and image resizing where managing the number of samples is just as important as the rate.

Downsampling, at its core, reduces the sampling rate of a signal by discarding samples. It’s not just a matter of arbitrarily throwing away data; ideally, a process like anti-aliasing filtering should precede the decimation. This filtering reduces high-frequency components that would cause aliasing when the signal is resampled at a lower rate. The output of downsampling is a signal with a lower *effective* sample rate and fewer total samples, assuming integer decimation factors. If the downsampling factor isn’t an integer, things become a bit more complex; however for simplicity I will assume it is for this answer. Mathematically if `x[n]` is a signal sampled at rate `fs`, a downsampled version `y[n]` by a factor of `M` is defined such that `y[n] = x[Mn]`. This operation clearly reduces the total number of samples.

Upsampling, conversely, increases the effective sample rate of a signal by inserting additional samples. A common technique is to insert zeros between the existing samples – a process sometimes called zero-padding or zero-stuffing. This increases the total sample count, but not necessarily the information content, or the *effective* sample rate, without proper interpolation. To restore the effective sample rate after zero-padding, the signal must be passed through an interpolation filter. This low pass filter smooths the data, filling in the artificial gaps with new data points. The result is a signal with a higher sample rate and a greater total number of samples than the initial signal prior to downsampling. If we upsample a signal `y[n]` by a factor `L` which means `y[n]` is defined with sample rate `fs_y` to the resulting upsampled signal `z[n]`, `z[n]` has a sample rate `fs_z = L * fs_y`.

When a signal is downsampled by a factor `M` and then upsampled by a factor of `L`, the number of samples is altered as follows. If the initial signal has `N` samples, downsampling by `M` *could* result in approximately `N/M` samples (the precise number will depend on whether the division results in an integer).  Upsampling this resultant signal by `L` will result in `(N/M)*L` samples, again, if we disregard truncation errors. Therefore the final sample count is different from the original when `L` is not equal to `M` and can even differ with truncation errors. If `L` equals `M`, the sample rate effectively returns to normal, but the sample count *may not* be exactly `N` due to integer truncation. This means that although the effective sample rate can be brought back to its original value, the sample length will only match under specific conditions – usually when `L = M`.

Here are some examples to clarify:

**Example 1: Basic Downsampling and Upsampling**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import resample, firwin, lfilter

def downsample_upsample(signal, down_factor, up_factor):
    """
    Downsamples and then upsamples a signal, returning the processed signal.
    Applies a lowpass filter before downsampling.
    """
    cutoff = 0.8 / down_factor
    taps = firwin(51, cutoff, window=('kaiser', 5))

    downsampled = lfilter(taps, 1.0, signal[::down_factor])
    upsampled = resample(downsampled, len(signal), t=None)  # Using scipy resample with automatic anti-aliasing

    return upsampled


# Test signal
signal_length = 100
signal = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 0.1 * np.arange(signal_length))

# Process with downsampling and upsampling
down_factor = 2
up_factor = 2
processed_signal = downsample_upsample(signal, down_factor, up_factor)

print(f"Original signal length: {len(signal)}")
print(f"Processed signal length: {len(processed_signal)}")
print(f"Does the processed signal have original sample length: {len(signal) == len(processed_signal)}")

```
This example creates a sine wave and then performs downsampling and then upsampling with the same factor (2). It shows the use of a basic low-pass filter before downsampling and `scipy.signal.resample` for efficient upsampling. The `resample` function provides anti-aliasing filtering during upsampling, automatically performing low-pass operations before resampling.  Here, we can see that even with the same down and up factors, the processed signal may not always have the same length as the original. However, it will be close.

**Example 2: Different Downsampling and Upsampling Factors**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import resample, firwin, lfilter

def downsample_upsample(signal, down_factor, up_factor):
    """
    Downsamples and then upsamples a signal, returning the processed signal.
    Applies a lowpass filter before downsampling.
    """
    cutoff = 0.8 / down_factor
    taps = firwin(51, cutoff, window=('kaiser', 5))
    downsampled = lfilter(taps, 1.0, signal[::down_factor])
    upsampled = resample(downsampled, len(signal), t=None)  # Using scipy resample

    return upsampled

# Test signal
signal_length = 100
signal = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 0.1 * np.arange(signal_length))


# Process with different downsampling and upsampling factors
down_factor = 2
up_factor = 3
processed_signal = downsample_upsample(signal, down_factor, up_factor)


print(f"Original signal length: {len(signal)}")
print(f"Processed signal length: {len(processed_signal)}")
print(f"Does the processed signal have original sample length: {len(signal) == len(processed_signal)}")

```
In this case, the downsampling factor is 2, while the upsampling factor is 3. This will invariably lead to a processed signal length that differs from the original signal length.

**Example 3: Integer Truncation Effects**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import resample, firwin, lfilter

def downsample_upsample(signal, down_factor, up_factor):
    """
    Downsamples and then upsamples a signal, returning the processed signal.
    Applies a lowpass filter before downsampling.
    """

    cutoff = 0.8 / down_factor
    taps = firwin(51, cutoff, window=('kaiser', 5))
    downsampled = lfilter(taps, 1.0, signal[::down_factor])
    upsampled = resample(downsampled, len(signal), t=None)  # Using scipy resample
    return upsampled


# Test signal
signal_length = 101 # Make it an odd number
signal = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 0.1 * np.arange(signal_length))


# Process with equal down and up sample factors
down_factor = 2
up_factor = 2
processed_signal = downsample_upsample(signal, down_factor, up_factor)

print(f"Original signal length: {len(signal)}")
print(f"Processed signal length: {len(processed_signal)}")
print(f"Does the processed signal have original sample length: {len(signal) == len(processed_signal)}")

```

Here, I've made the length of the signal an odd number so that the initial downsampling step will result in a fractional result. During the final upsampling step, the length of the signal is changed to match the original signal length, so they no longer match. This highlights that the total number of samples is changed by the resampling process.

For further understanding, consider looking into resources covering: digital signal processing fundamentals, focusing on the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, aliasing, and anti-aliasing techniques. Specific texts on multirate signal processing, often found in advanced DSP textbooks, will offer a more mathematical perspective. Signal processing libraries in Python, such as `scipy.signal`, are very useful for learning practically. In addition, many online courses covering digital signal processing offer in-depth discussions of upsampling and downsampling.
