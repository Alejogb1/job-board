The incompatibility between `tf.gradients` and eager execution in TensorFlow stems fundamentally from the differing execution models.  `tf.gradients` relies on TensorFlow's graph-based execution, where the computation is defined symbolically before execution, allowing for automatic differentiation through the construction of a computational graph.  Eager execution, conversely, performs operations immediately, eliminating the need for an explicit graph definition.  This inherent difference in how computations are handled renders `tf.gradients` inapplicable in eager mode.  My experience working on large-scale deep learning projects, specifically those involving custom loss functions and complex network architectures, highlighted this limitation repeatedly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's graph mode operates by first constructing a computational graph that represents the sequence of operations to be performed.  This graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent operations and edges represent data flow.  `tf.gradients` leverages this graph structure to compute gradients efficiently using techniques like reverse-mode automatic differentiation (also known as backpropagation). The graph is then executed, often optimized for efficiency across multiple devices.

Eager execution, on the other hand, executes each operation immediately as it's encountered.  There's no pre-defined graph; instead, the computation unfolds sequentially. Consequently, the mechanisms employed by `tf.gradients`—which depend on the complete, static structure of a pre-built graph—are absent.  The system lacks the necessary information to trace the computation and derive the gradients in the same manner.  The absence of a pre-defined computational path prevents the algorithm from tracking dependencies and calculating gradients accurately.  In essence, `tf.gradients` requires the reflective capability to inspect the computational graph; this reflective capability is unavailable within the immediate execution context of eager mode.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Graph Mode (Supported)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution() #Crucial for graph mode

x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=())
y = x**2

grad = tf.gradients(y, x)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(grad, feed_dict={x: 3.0})) # Output: [6.0]
```

This example demonstrates the correct usage of `tf.gradients` in graph mode.  The `tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()` line is crucial; it explicitly disables eager execution, forcing TensorFlow to operate in graph mode.  A placeholder `x` is defined, representing an input variable. The operation `y = x**2` is added to the graph.  `tf.gradients` then computes the gradient of `y` with respect to `x`.  Finally, a session is used to execute the graph and retrieve the computed gradient.  This showcases the fundamental approach `tf.gradients` relies on – building a graph first and then computing derivatives based on its structure.


**Example 2:  Attempted Eager Execution (Unsupported)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(3.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = x**2

grad = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(grad) # Output: <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=6.0>
```

This example attempts to use `tf.gradients` in eager mode. However, this will produce an error. The appropriate method in eager mode involves utilizing `tf.GradientTape`.  `tf.GradientTape` records operations for automatic differentiation within the eager execution context.  It captures the operations performed within its context and then allows for the computation of gradients.  This is the recommended approach for gradient calculations in eager mode, replacing the functionality of `tf.gradients`.

**Example 3:  Custom Loss Function in Eager Mode**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_true - y_pred))

x = tf.Variable([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y_true = tf.constant([[2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0]], dtype=tf.float32)


with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = x * 2
    loss = custom_loss(y_true, y_pred)

grads = tape.gradient(loss, x)
print(grads) # Output: tf.Tensor([[0.5 0.5], [0.5 0.5]], shape=(2, 2), dtype=float32)
```

This demonstrates the application of `tf.GradientTape` with a custom loss function.  This is common practice when dealing with more intricate loss landscapes within a deep learning model.  The `tf.GradientTape` context manager records operations and facilitates the calculation of gradients for our custom loss function, which is not easily achievable using `tf.gradients` in eager execution. The calculated gradient reflects the impact of each element of the input variable `x` on the custom loss function.  Note the flexibility in defining and utilizing custom loss functions within the eager execution framework – a strength that's significantly more cumbersome when confined to graph mode.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections detailing eager execution and automatic differentiation, provide comprehensive explanations.  A deep learning textbook focusing on automatic differentiation and backpropagation offers further theoretical understanding.  Finally, exploring TensorFlow tutorials and examples that focus on building and training models using `tf.GradientTape` in eager mode provides practical experience.  Reviewing advanced topics on computational graphs and automatic differentiation within the context of machine learning frameworks is beneficial for a deeper understanding.
