PyTorch's extensibility is a key strength, allowing seamless integration of custom operations into the computation graph.  This capability is crucial for researchers and developers working on specialized algorithms or hardware acceleration.  My experience optimizing a deep reinforcement learning agent for a custom neuromorphic chip highlighted the intricacies of this process. Effectively mapping PyTorch operators to custom functions requires a deep understanding of PyTorch's autograd system and its interaction with custom CUDA kernels or other backend implementations.

The core principle involves creating a custom autograd function, which defines both the forward and backward passes for your operation.  The forward pass computes the output, while the backward pass calculates the gradients necessary for backpropagation.  Crucially, the custom function needs to be compatible with PyTorch's tensor operations and adheres to the rules of automatic differentiation to ensure the computation graph remains consistent and gradients are correctly computed.  Neglecting this consistency can lead to inaccurate gradients and ultimately, a non-functional training process.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process broadly involves three steps:  (a) defining the custom function using `torch.autograd.Function`, (b) implementing the forward and backward passes within this class, and (c) integrating this custom function into your existing PyTorch model.

The `torch.autograd.Function` class is the fundamental building block.  It expects two methods: `forward` and `backward`.  The `forward` method takes input tensors as arguments and returns the output tensor(s).  Importantly, this method needs to handle the actual computation.  This could involve calling a custom CUDA kernel, a highly optimized library function, or even a purely Python-based implementation.  The choice depends on the complexity and performance requirements of the operation.

The `backward` method is equally crucial.  It takes the gradient(s) with respect to the output(s) (as computed by subsequent layers) as input and calculates the gradient(s) with respect to the input(s).  This calculation follows the chain rule of calculus and must accurately reflect the mathematical relationship defined by the `forward` pass.  Incorrectly implemented backward passes can lead to gradient explosion or vanishing, significantly hindering the training process.

This custom function can then be used within a PyTorch model like any other operator.  It's seamlessly integrated into the computation graph, enabling automatic gradient calculation and optimization using standard PyTorch optimizers.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  A Simple Custom Element-wise Operation**

This example demonstrates a custom element-wise function that squares each element of an input tensor.

```python
import torch
import torch.autograd as autograd

class SquareFunction(autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input):
        ctx.save_for_backward(input)
        return input.mul(input) # Efficient in-place squaring

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        input, = ctx.saved_tensors
        return grad_output.mul(input.mul(2.)) # 2*x*dx/dx

input = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
output = SquareFunction.apply(input)
output.backward(torch.ones_like(output)) # Gradient calculation with a ones tensor
print(input.grad)
```

This example showcases a straightforward custom operation. The `forward` pass performs element-wise squaring. The `backward` pass correctly calculates the gradient as 2*x, a direct application of the chain rule.


**Example 2: Custom CUDA Kernel Integration**

This example (conceptually) shows integration with a custom CUDA kernel.  Note:  Actual CUDA kernel implementation would require significantly more code outside this example's scope.

```python
import torch
import torch.autograd as autograd

class CustomCUDAFunction(autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input):
        ctx.save_for_backward(input)
        output = torch.empty_like(input)
        # Call custom CUDA kernel here.  Replace with actual kernel call
        #  e.g., custom_cuda_kernel(input, output)
        return output

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        input, = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_input = torch.empty_like(input)
        # Call custom CUDA kernel for backward pass.
        #  e.g., custom_cuda_kernel_backward(input, grad_output, grad_input)
        return grad_input

# Example usage (assuming custom CUDA kernel is defined)
input = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True, device="cuda")
output = CustomCUDAFunction.apply(input)
# ... rest of the training loop ...
```

This illustrates the fundamental structure.  The crucial part omitted here is the actual CUDA kernel implementation, which requires proficiency in CUDA programming.  The `forward` and `backward` calls would invoke this kernel.


**Example 3:  Incorporating a Pre-trained Model**

This shows a scenario where a pre-trained model (for instance, a custom layer implemented in a different framework) can be wrapped as a PyTorch custom function.  This assumes serialization/deserialization for the external model.

```python
import torch
import torch.autograd as autograd
# Assume a function 'load_external_model' and 'run_external_model' exist

class ExternalModelFunction(autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input):
        model = load_external_model() # Load the external model
        ctx.save_for_backward(input, model)
        output = run_external_model(input, model) # Run the model on the input
        return output

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        input, model = ctx.saved_tensors
        # Implement backward pass using external model's capabilities (if available).
        # This might involve approximating gradients or using external gradient calculation tools
        grad_input = torch.zeros_like(input)  #Placeholder until proper backward available
        return grad_input


# Example Usage:
input = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
output = ExternalModelFunction.apply(input)
# ... training loop ...
```

This example showcases the versatility: incorporating pre-existing, potentially non-PyTorch, components.  The challenge lies in implementing a correct backward pass, possibly through approximation or leveraging the external model's own gradient calculation mechanisms.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation provides extensive details on autograd and custom CUDA kernel implementation.  Thorough understanding of automatic differentiation and the underlying principles of backpropagation is essential.  A strong grasp of linear algebra and calculus is also crucial for designing accurate gradient calculations.  Exploring advanced topics like Jacobian-vector products for efficient backward passes in complex scenarios is highly beneficial.
