The impact of hidden layer size on DeepExplainer SHAP values is non-trivial and often counterintuitive.  My experience working on several large-scale fraud detection models has shown that while a larger hidden layer might improve model accuracy, it doesn't necessarily lead to more interpretable or stable SHAP values.  In fact, I've observed increased variance and, in certain cases, a complete obfuscation of feature importance as the number of neurons in hidden layers increases, particularly in deep networks. This stems from the complex, high-dimensional feature representations learned by these larger networks.


**1. Explanation:**

DeepExplainer, based on the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, attempts to quantify the contribution of each feature to a model's prediction.  It does this by comparing the model's output for a given input with the model's output for a set of perturbed inputs where individual features have been altered. The SHAP values are then assigned based on a game-theoretic approach, considering all possible coalitions of features.  However, the complexity of the internal representations within a deep neural network significantly affects this process.

With smaller hidden layers, the model learns simpler feature representations.  This leads to a more straightforward relationship between input features and the model's output. Consequently, DeepExplainer can more easily attribute the prediction to specific input features, resulting in more stable and interpretable SHAP values. The model's decision boundary is, in essence, less convoluted.  Perturbing a feature will predictably alter the output, facilitating accurate SHAP value calculation.

Conversely, larger hidden layers allow the network to learn more intricate and abstract feature combinations.  The model can capture highly non-linear relationships, leading to improved performance.  However, this enhanced representational power comes at the cost of interpretability. The contribution of a single input feature becomes entangled with numerous complex internal representations, making it difficult for DeepExplainer to isolate the feature's independent effect on the prediction.  Small perturbations might have unpredictable, cascading effects within the network, causing instability in the SHAP values.  The increased dimensionality of the feature space within the larger hidden layers also introduces computational challenges, potentially impacting the accuracy of the approximation methods used within DeepExplainer. This can manifest as high variance in the SHAP values, making the feature attributions unreliable.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples use Python with the `shap` and `keras` libraries.  Assume a binary classification task where `X` represents the features and `y` the target variable.

**Example 1: Small Hidden Layer**

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
import shap

# Generate synthetic data
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

# Define model with small hidden layer
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(5, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Compute SHAP values
explainer = shap.DeepExplainer(model, X[:100])
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)

# Analyze SHAP values (e.g., visualize)
# shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X)
```

This example utilizes a small hidden layer with only 5 neurons.  The SHAP values obtained should generally be more stable and easier to interpret because the feature mappings are simpler.


**Example 2: Medium Hidden Layer**

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
import shap

# ... (same data generation as Example 1) ...

# Define model with medium hidden layer
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(20, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# ... (same SHAP value computation and analysis as Example 1) ...
```

Increasing the hidden layer size to 20 neurons introduces more complexity.  While predictive power might improve, the SHAP values might exhibit greater variance and less clear feature importance.


**Example 3: Large Hidden Layer & Deep Network**

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
import shap

# ... (same data generation as Example 1) ...

# Define deep model with large hidden layer
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)))
model.add(Dense(50, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# ... (same SHAP value computation and analysis as Example 1) ...
```

This example showcases a deeper network with a large first hidden layer (100 neurons).  The resulting SHAP values are likely to be highly variable and difficult to interpret due to the significant complexity of the feature representations.  In practice, DeepExplainer might even struggle to provide meaningful results in such scenarios.  Consider alternative explanation methods designed for deeper networks.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   "Interpretable Machine Learning" by Christoph Molnar (book)
*   Research papers on SHAP and its variations
*   Documentation for the `shap` library
*   Publications on model explainability for deep learning architectures


In conclusion, the relationship between hidden layer size and SHAP value interpretability is not linear. While larger hidden layers can boost model accuracy, they frequently compromise the reliability and clarity of DeepExplainer's feature importance estimations.  Careful consideration should be given to this trade-off, and alternative explanation methods might be necessary for complex deep learning models.  Careful model design and potentially using simpler models with equivalent accuracy are strong alternatives to increase interpretability.
