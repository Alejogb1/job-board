Out-of-memory (OOM) errors in PyTorch with CUDA, especially when processing large images, stem fundamentally from exceeding the available GPU memory.  My experience working on high-resolution satellite imagery analysis has consistently highlighted this as a major bottleneck.  The problem isn't simply insufficient GPU RAM; it's a complex interplay of data loading, model architecture, and batch size management. Effective mitigation requires a multi-pronged approach addressing each of these aspects.

**1. Data Loading Strategies:**

The most impactful change is often optimizing how your data is loaded and processed.  Simply loading all images into memory before training is almost certainly going to cause OOM errors with large datasets. Instead, employ techniques that load and process data in smaller, manageable chunks.  The key is to leverage PyTorch's DataLoader capabilities coupled with appropriate image transformations.  Instead of loading an entire dataset at once, use the `DataLoader` to fetch batches of images on-demand during training. This allows you to control the memory footprint per iteration.

Furthermore, consider using multiprocessing to speed up data loading.  The `num_workers` argument in `DataLoader` allows the creation of multiple worker processes, running image transformations concurrently and feeding data to the GPU more efficiently. However, keep in mind that overly aggressive multiprocessing can sometimes lead to communication overhead, which might negate the performance gains. This often requires experimentation to find the optimal value.

**2. Model Architecture and Optimization:**

The model architecture itself significantly influences memory consumption. Deep, wide networks inherently require more memory. Techniques such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation can reduce model size and computational cost, mitigating memory pressure.  In my work with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on very large images, I found that carefully selecting the architecture was crucial. Using smaller kernel sizes, fewer layers, and efficient architectures like MobileNet or ShuffleNet could significantly reduce memory requirements without sacrificing too much accuracy.

Furthermore, consider using techniques such as mixed precision training. This involves using both FP16 (half-precision) and FP32 (single-precision) floating-point numbers during training. This reduces memory usage and can speed up training, though it might necessitate careful consideration of numerical stability.

**3. Batch Size Management:**

The batch size is a crucial parameter directly affecting memory consumption.  Larger batch sizes lead to faster training but dramatically increase the GPU memory footprint.  Start with smaller batch sizes and gradually increase them, monitoring GPU memory usage carefully.  If you hit an OOM error, decrease the batch size immediately.  It's often more efficient to train with smaller batches for longer, especially when dealing with large images, than to crash repeatedly with larger batches.

Furthermore, consider using gradient accumulation.  This technique simulates a larger batch size by accumulating gradients over multiple smaller batches before performing an update.  While this doesn't reduce peak memory usage, it offers an effective way to mimic the benefits of larger batch sizes without hitting OOM errors.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Efficient Data Loading with DataLoader and Transformations:**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset
from torchvision import transforms

class LargeImageDataset(Dataset):
    # ... (Dataset implementation for loading large images) ...

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        image = self.load_image(index) #Efficient image loading from disk
        transform = transforms.Compose([
            transforms.Resize((256, 256)), #Resize before loading into memory
            transforms.ToTensor(),
            transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
        ])
        return transform(image), self.labels[index]

dataset = LargeImageDataset(...)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=8, num_workers=4, pin_memory=True)

for images, labels in dataloader:
    # ... training loop ...
```

This example showcases efficient data loading using `DataLoader` with image transformations applied *before* loading into GPU memory. `pin_memory=True` helps optimize data transfer to the GPU.

**Example 2: Mixed Precision Training:**

```python
import torch
model.half() #Casts model parameters to FP16

optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()

for images, labels in dataloader:
    images = images.half() #Cast input to FP16
    with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.step(optimizer)
    scaler.update()
```

This demonstrates mixed precision training using `torch.cuda.amp.autocast` for reduced memory footprint.  Note that casting the model and inputs to `half()` is critical.


**Example 3: Gradient Accumulation:**

```python
import torch

accumulation_steps = 4
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for images, labels in dataloader:
    images, labels = images.cuda(), labels.cuda()
    outputs = model(images)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels) / accumulation_steps # Normalize loss
    loss.backward()

    if (i + 1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

This example simulates a larger batch size through gradient accumulation. The loss is divided by `accumulation_steps` to normalize the gradient updates.


**Resource Recommendations:**

PyTorch documentation;  High-performance computing textbooks focusing on parallel programming and GPU optimization;  Research papers on model compression and quantization techniques;  Advanced deep learning textbooks covering architectural optimization.  Thorough understanding of linear algebra and numerical methods will also prove invaluable.  Familiarity with profiling tools for GPU memory usage is crucial for debugging and optimization.
