The core challenge in converting a 2D tensor to a 4D tensor lies in understanding the inherent dimensionality and the intended semantic mapping between the dimensions.  A 2D tensor represents data structured along two axes;  converting this to a 4D tensor necessitates introducing two additional dimensions, which requires a clear definition of their meaning within the context of the data.  My experience working on high-dimensional data representations for image processing and natural language processing has highlighted the importance of this conceptual clarity.  Without a well-defined purpose for the added dimensions, the resulting 4D tensor will likely be nonsensical.

The method of conversion hinges entirely on the application.  Arbitrary expansion, for example, might simply add singleton dimensions, while a more sophisticated approach may involve reshaping the data according to a specific pattern, perhaps derived from spatial relationships or temporal sequences.  Misunderstanding this leads to incorrect interpretations and inefficient computations downstream.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The primary approaches for 2D to 4D tensor conversion involve leveraging the `reshape` functionality offered by most tensor libraries, coupled with potential transpositions or the addition of singleton dimensions using functions like `unsqueeze`.  The key is to determine how the original 2D data should be distributed across the four dimensions.   

Consider a 2D tensor representing a grayscale image (height x width). We could convert this into a 4D tensor representing a batch of grayscale images (batch size x height x width x channels).  In this scenario, the 'batch size' and 'channels' dimensions are effectively added.  If the image was initially represented as a 2D tensor where each entry is a pixel value, then the channel dimension would simply have a value of 1 for each pixel.

Alternatively, the conversion could be used to represent a set of features across multiple spatial locations, where each location holds a set of two features.  In this case, the added dimensions may reflect the different feature types and another dimension that groups the features within each location.  The mapping between the original 2D structure and the new 4D structure is critical.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples use a hypothetical tensor library with a syntax similar to PyTorch and TensorFlow.  Assume `tensor_2d` represents our initial 2D tensor.

**Example 1: Adding singleton dimensions**

This approach simply adds two singleton dimensions, resulting in a 4D tensor with the same data but a different shape.  Useful for compatibility with models expecting 4D input when batch processing is not yet involved.

```python
import tensor_library as tl

tensor_2d = tl.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])  # Example 2x3 tensor

tensor_4d = tl.unsqueeze(tl.unsqueeze(tensor_2d, dim=0), dim=0) # Add singleton dimensions at positions 0 and 1

print(tensor_2d.shape)  # Output: (2, 3)
print(tensor_4d.shape)  # Output: (1, 1, 2, 3)

```

**Example 2: Reshaping for batch processing of images**

This example demonstrates converting a 2D grayscale image representation into a 4D representation suitable for processing multiple images.

```python
import tensor_library as tl

tensor_2d = tl.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])  # Representing a single grayscale image (2x3)
batch_size = 2

# Duplicate the tensor to create the 'batch' dimension
tensor_2d_batch = tl.stack([tensor_2d, tensor_2d], dim=0)

# Add a channel dimension (grayscale, so it's 1)
tensor_4d = tl.unsqueeze(tensor_2d_batch, dim=-1)

print(tensor_2d.shape)  # Output: (2, 3)
print(tensor_4d.shape)  # Output: (2, 2, 3, 1)

```


**Example 3:  Reshaping for multiple feature sets within spatial locations**

This scenario presumes each entry in the 2D tensor holds two features. We need to reshape to separate these features into separate dimensions.

```python
import tensor_library as tl

tensor_2d = tl.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]) # Represents two spatial locations, each with two features (2 locations, 2 features/location)


# Reshape to (number of locations, height, width, number of features)
# Assuming height and width of individual locations are 1x2, we'll reshape to 2 x 1 x 2 x 2
tensor_4d = tl.reshape(tensor_2d, (2, 1, 2, 2))

print(tensor_2d.shape) # Output: (2, 4)
print(tensor_4d.shape) # Output: (2, 1, 2, 2)

```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official documentation for your chosen tensor library (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy).  Explore introductory materials on linear algebra and tensor operations.  Studying examples of image processing or time series analysis can provide further practical insights into the utility of multi-dimensional tensors and the various conversion techniques.  A strong understanding of tensor manipulation techniques is invaluable.  Reviewing papers on convolutional neural networks will help you appreciate different ways 4D tensors are used in practice.  Finally, books dedicated to deep learning and machine learning offer a broad context for working with higher-dimensional data.  These combined resources provide a solid foundation for mastering this complex topic.
