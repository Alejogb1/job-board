NVIDIA GPU memory allocation, independent of a directly associated process, stems from the architecture of the CUDA runtime and its interaction with the operating system's memory management.  This decoupling allows for efficient utilization of GPU resources, particularly in scenarios involving asynchronous operations, shared memory, and library-level computations.  I've encountered this behavior extensively during my work on high-performance computing projects involving large-scale simulations and real-time rendering engines.  The key understanding lies in the distinction between the host (CPU) process and the GPU's execution environment.

**1.  Explanation:**

The CUDA runtime, the software layer facilitating interaction between the CPU and the GPU, manages memory allocation on the GPU differently than the CPU.  While a CPU process directly requests and manages its memory through the operating system's virtual memory system,  GPU memory allocation often occurs indirectly.  This is primarily due to the concurrent nature of GPU processing.  Many threads execute concurrently on the GPU, and managing memory allocation on a per-thread basis would introduce significant overhead. Instead, the CUDA runtime employs a more abstracted approach.  Allocations are managed via CUDA APIs like `cudaMalloc`, `cudaMallocManaged`, and `cudaMallocPitch`.  These functions allocate memory in the GPU's global memory space, which is accessible by all CUDA kernels running on that GPU.

Crucially, the allocation isn't tied to a single host process's address space.  A process can allocate memory on the GPU, and even after that process terminates, the memory might remain allocated.  This is because the GPU memory management is handled by the CUDA driver, a kernel-level component that continues to operate independently of individual applications.  This is particularly true for memory allocated using `cudaMalloc`. Memory allocated with `cudaMallocManaged` presents a nuanced case, offering CPU-GPU unified memory, where memory allocated appears to both the CPU and GPU, but management complexities are still handled at a driver level beyond the direct purview of a single process.  The driver is responsible for tracking allocations, preventing conflicts, and reclaiming memory when possible, often through mechanisms such as memory paging and garbage collection.  The actual deallocation, however, is implicitly handled by the CUDA driver or explicitly by the developer using functions such as `cudaFree`.

This design choice allows for several benefits.  First, it enables efficient memory sharing among different CUDA kernels launched from various processes.  Second, it simplifies the management of large datasets, allowing data to persist across kernel executions, even if the initiating process has finished. Finally,  it allows for the management of GPU memory beyond the life cycle of any single user process,  a crucial capability for specialized applications such as real-time systems or frameworks requiring persistent GPU resources.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Standard CUDA Memory Allocation:**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int *devPtr;
    size_t size = 1024 * sizeof(int);

    cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc((void **)&devPtr, size);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaMalloc failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // ... perform computation on devPtr ...

    err = cudaFree(devPtr);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaFree failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a basic allocation using `cudaMalloc`.  The memory allocated (`devPtr`) resides in the GPU's global memory.  Even after `main` exits, this memory remains allocated until explicitly freed by the driver (or the system later reclaims it). The `cudaFree` call is crucial; failure to free allocated memory leads to memory leaks.


**Example 2: Using cudaMallocManaged:**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int *devPtr;
    size_t size = 1024 * sizeof(int);

    cudaError_t err = cudaMallocManaged((void **)&devPtr, size);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaMallocManaged failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // ... access devPtr from both CPU and GPU ...

    err = cudaFree(devPtr);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaFree failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:*  `cudaMallocManaged` allocates memory accessible from both the CPU and GPU.  This simplifies data transfer, but the underlying memory management still operates at the driver level, decoupled from a single process's lifecycle. The apparent access from CPU and GPU is an abstraction; the runtime manages the synchronization and potential page faults internally.


**Example 3:  Error Handling and Context:**

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    cudaFree(0); // Example of an error handling scenario

    int *devPtr;
    size_t size = 1024 * sizeof(int);
    cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc((void **)&devPtr, size);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaMalloc failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // ...  Code to handle CUDA context creation and destruction properly ...

    err = cudaFree(devPtr);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaFree failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}

```

*Commentary:* This example highlights the importance of robust error handling.  The first `cudaFree(0)` demonstrates that error checking is paramount; even seemingly innocuous operations can return errors.  Note that proper management of CUDA contexts is also crucial to prevent memory leaks and maintain stability.   While not explicitly showcasing the decoupling, the example subtly reinforces that the memory allocation's success or failure is determined by the CUDA driver and not solely dependent on the calling process.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official NVIDIA CUDA programming guide, the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide, and textbooks on parallel computing and GPU programming.  A thorough understanding of operating system memory management principles will also prove beneficial.  Studying the CUDA runtime architecture and its interactions with the kernel will illuminate the underlying mechanisms driving this behavior.  Furthermore, explore resources detailing the internal workings of the NVIDIA driver to gain a more complete picture of how GPU memory is handled at a system level.
