TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset` objects, by default, operate on a finite data source.  This inherent characteristic dictates that once the dataset's elements have been iterated through completely—marking the end of an epoch—re-iteration requires restarting the dataset's traversal from the beginning.  Appending batches *after* the initial epoch isn't directly supported because the underlying data pipeline isn't designed for dynamic append operations during runtime.  My experience debugging large-scale image classification models underscored this limitation.  The expectation of seamlessly adding data midway through training conflicted with TensorFlow's optimized data handling strategies.

This behavior stems from performance considerations. TensorFlow employs efficient data prefetching and buffering mechanisms.  These optimizations hinge on knowing the dataset's size upfront, allowing for optimal pipeline construction and resource allocation.  Allowing arbitrary batch appends would necessitate constant pipeline restructuring, severely impacting performance, especially for large datasets.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core issue lies in the distinction between a dataset and a data iterator.  A `tf.data.Dataset` object represents a read-only description of the data source.  It doesn't hold the actual data in memory; instead, it defines a recipe for producing data batches.  The `make_one_shot_iterator()` function (deprecated in newer versions, replaced by `iter()`) or other iterator creation methods generate an iterator that traverses this dataset.  Once the iterator exhausts the dataset, it's at its end.  There's no mechanism to append new data to the *dataset* itself without creating a new dataset instance.  You can't append to the "recipe"; you must create a new, extended recipe.

Furthermore,  TensorFlow's optimizers rely on a predictable data flow.  Appending batches mid-training would disrupt the gradient calculations, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect model updates.  The model's internal state—including optimizer variables—is inherently tied to the number of training steps and the consistency of data input.  Injecting new data mid-stream would break this crucial consistency.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Demonstrating the Standard Behavior**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
dataset = dataset.batch(2)

for epoch in range(2):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}:")
    for batch in dataset:
        print(batch.numpy())

#Output shows the same data in each epoch
```

This exemplifies the default behavior: the dataset is iterated completely within each epoch, and the next epoch simply restarts from the beginning.  Appending data to this `dataset` object post-creation is impossible.


**Example 2: Creating a New Dataset to Simulate Appending**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial dataset
dataset1 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
dataset1 = dataset1.batch(2)

# New data to "append"
dataset2 = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
dataset2 = dataset2.batch(2)

# Concatenate datasets to create a new, larger dataset
combined_dataset = dataset1.concatenate(dataset2)

for epoch in range(2):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}:")
    for batch in combined_dataset:
        print(batch.numpy())

```

This code demonstrates the correct approach.  Instead of appending to the existing `dataset1`, a new dataset (`dataset2`) is created containing the new data.  Then, `tf.data.Dataset.concatenate` merges these two into a single, larger dataset, which is then used for training. This approach maintains the integrity of the data pipeline and avoids unexpected behavior.  Note:  This requires creating the entire new dataset before the next training epoch.


**Example 3:  Handling Large Datasets Efficiently**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Function to generate batches from a large file - simulates a large dataset
def generate_batches(filepath, batch_size):
  dataset = tf.data.TextLineDataset(filepath)
  dataset = dataset.map(lambda line: tf.py_function(process_line, [line], [tf.float32])) #example pre-processing
  dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
  return dataset

def process_line(line):
  #Simulate pre-processing a single line from a file
  return tf.constant([float(x) for x in line.decode('utf-8').split(',')],dtype=tf.float32) #example

filepath = "my_large_data.csv" #replace with your file. Assumes CSV format, adapt as necessary

#Initial dataset
dataset = generate_batches(filepath, 32) #batch size

for epoch in range(3):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}:")
    for batch in dataset:
        print(batch.shape) #Illustrates that the data stream is processed and batched correctly

```

This example showcases how to handle large datasets that cannot fit completely into memory.  Instead of loading everything upfront, it uses a generator function to process data in chunks.  Each epoch iterates over the data, but appending would still necessitate recreating the `dataset` using the updated file. The key here is to maintain a consistent and well-defined data pipeline that is not dynamically modified mid-training.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on `tf.data.Dataset` and data input pipelines, are invaluable.  Consult comprehensive machine learning textbooks that cover the nuances of data pipelines and efficient data handling in deep learning frameworks.  Additionally, I found studying examples of data preprocessing and pipeline building in established TensorFlow model repositories immensely helpful in understanding the underlying mechanisms.  Focusing on understanding the iterator and dataset concepts within the TensorFlow framework is critical.


In conclusion, while you cannot directly append batches to a TensorFlow dataset after the first epoch, correctly constructing and managing datasets, utilizing the `concatenate` method for combining datasets, and employing efficient data generation techniques are crucial for managing large-scale training effectively. The key is to avoid modifying the data pipeline dynamically during training.
