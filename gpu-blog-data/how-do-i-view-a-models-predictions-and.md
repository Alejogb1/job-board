The `.h5` file format, while versatile, lacks inherent structure to directly expose model predictions and associated ground truth outputs.  My experience working with Keras models, extensively saved in `.h5` format for various deep learning projects involving time-series forecasting and image classification, has underscored the need for a tailored approach.  Accessing this information necessitates reconstructing the model architecture and loading the relevant data used during training or prediction.  The key is not directly "viewing" the predictions from the `.h5` but rather strategically reconstructing the prediction pipeline.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `.h5` file stores model weights, architecture, and potentially some training configuration, but not the input data or the generated predictions.  To view the predictions, we need to:

a) **Load the Model:**  Utilize a deep learning framework like Keras (TensorFlow/Keras backend preferred for seamless integration with `.h5`) to load the model architecture and weights from the `.h5` file.  This step reconstructs the model's computational graph.

b) **Load the Input Data:**  Obtain the dataset used for either training or prediction.  This dataset must be preprocessed identically to the data used when the `.h5` model was trained or used for inference.  Data inconsistencies will directly impact the accuracy and reproducibility of the prediction process.

c) **Perform Inference:**  Run the loaded model on the input data to generate predictions.  This will produce output in the expected format (e.g., classification probabilities, regression values).

d) **Compare Predictions and Actuals:**  Finally, compare the model's generated predictions with the ground truth values present within the dataset. This comparison allows for performance evaluation using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE).


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples assume a Keras model trained for a regression task (predicting a continuous value) and a classification task (predicting a class label).  Error handling and data validation are omitted for brevity, but are crucial in production environments.


**Example 1: Regression Task**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Load the model
model = keras.models.load_model('my_regression_model.h5')

# Load the input data (assuming it's a NumPy array)
X_test = np.load('X_test.npy')

# Generate predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Load the actual outputs (assuming it's a NumPy array)
y_test = np.load('y_test.npy')

# Compare predictions and actuals
print("Predictions:\n", predictions)
print("\nActual Outputs:\n", y_test)

# Calculate RMSE (example metric)
rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean((predictions - y_test)**2))
print("\nRMSE:", rmse)
```

This example demonstrates loading a regression model, predicting on test data, and comparing the predictions with ground truth values.  The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is calculated as a performance metric.  The crucial aspect is the loading of both `X_test` and `y_test`, mirroring the test data used during the original model training.  Note:  replace `'my_regression_model.h5'`, `'X_test.npy'`, and `'y_test.npy'` with your actual file paths.


**Example 2: Classification Task (Multi-class)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.models.load_model('my_classification_model.h5')
X_test = np.load('X_test.npy')
y_test = np.load('y_test.npy')

predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Convert probabilities to class labels (assuming argmax for single label prediction)
predicted_labels = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)
actual_labels = np.argmax(y_test, axis=1)

print("Predicted Labels:\n", predicted_labels)
print("\nActual Labels:\n", actual_labels)

# Calculate accuracy (example metric)
accuracy = np.mean(predicted_labels == actual_labels)
print("\nAccuracy:", accuracy)
```

This example showcases a classification task.  The `predict` function outputs probabilities for each class.  `np.argmax` converts these probabilities to class labels for easier comparison with the actual labels. Accuracy is then computed as a simple performance metric.  The one-hot encoding of the `y_test` is crucial here; ensure consistency with the training data.


**Example 3: Handling Custom Metrics and Data Structures:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
import pandas as pd

model = keras.models.load_model('my_custom_model.h5')
X_test = pd.read_csv('X_test.csv', index_col=0) # Example: CSV input
y_test = pd.read_csv('y_test.csv', index_col=0) # Example: CSV input

# Preprocessing might be required here, depending on the custom model and data
X_test_processed = ... # Add necessary preprocessing steps
predictions = model.predict(X_test_processed)

# Assuming a custom metric function 'my_custom_metric'
custom_metric_result = my_custom_metric(predictions, y_test)
print("Custom Metric Result:", custom_metric_result)
```

This example highlights flexibility. The model might have a custom architecture or require specific data preprocessing steps.  The crucial points are adapting the data loading to the input type (here, a Pandas DataFrame) and applying a custom metric tailored to the problem's specifics.  Remember to define `my_custom_metric` appropriately to reflect your evaluation needs.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation, particularly the sections on model saving and loading, is invaluable.  Consult the documentation for your specific deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) for details on handling model I/O and performance evaluation.  A solid understanding of NumPy for array manipulation and Pandas for data manipulation will be essential.  Finally, a good textbook on machine learning fundamentals would provide a broader context for understanding model evaluation and prediction analysis.
