The discrepancy between predicted and calculated Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values often stems from inconsistencies in data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation methodologies.  In my experience debugging machine learning pipelines, overlooking these subtle differences is a common source of frustration.  This response will elucidate the underlying reasons for this discrepancy, providing concrete examples and outlining strategies for ensuring consistent results.

**1.  Clear Explanation of Potential Discrepancies:**

The MAE, a metric assessing the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values, necessitates precise alignment between the prediction stage and the evaluation stage.  Discrepancies typically arise from:

* **Data Preprocessing Mismatches:**  The data used for model training, validation, and final prediction may undergo different preprocessing steps.  For instance, if features are scaled using standardization (mean=0, std=1) during training but not during prediction, the model's outputs will be on a different scale, leading to an inflated MAE when calculated on the unscaled test data.  Similarly, inconsistent handling of missing values or categorical encoding can significantly affect the MAE.

* **Model Implementation Variations:**  The prediction phase might use a different model version or parameters than the one used for training.  This could happen inadvertently if a model is accidentally overwritten or if hyperparameter tuning isn't properly managed, leading to a mismatch between the model used for generating predictions and the model whose performance is assessed through MAE calculation.

* **Evaluation Methodology Inaccuracies:**  The calculation of the MAE itself can be erroneous.  Issues may arise from incorrect indexing, data type mismatches, or the presence of unexpected values (NaNs, Infs) in either the predicted or actual values. Incorrect handling of weighted averages or class imbalances can also bias the MAE calculation.

* **External Factors:** The predicted values might be derived from a different source entirely – say, an external API or a separate pre-trained model – introducing discrepancies unrelated to the original model’s training and internal workings.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Data Scaling Discrepancy:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Generate sample data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Scale the data for training
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_scaled, y)

# Predict on unscaled data (incorrect)
X_test = np.array([[6], [7]])
y_pred = model.predict(scaler.transform(X_test)) #Correct prediction scaling
y_pred_unscaled = model.predict(X_test) #Incorrect prediction scaling

y_true = np.array([6,7])


mae_correct = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)
mae_incorrect = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred_unscaled)

print(f"Correct MAE: {mae_correct}")
print(f"Incorrect MAE (unscaled prediction): {mae_incorrect}")

```

This example demonstrates how inconsistent scaling can inflate the MAE.  Note that `y_pred` uses proper scaling during prediction, while `y_pred_unscaled` does not. The MAE calculated using `y_pred_unscaled` will differ significantly from the correctly calculated MAE using `y_pred`.


**Example 2: Model Version Mismatch:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
import pickle

# Train a model
X_train = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])
y_train = np.array([2, 4, 5])
model1 = LinearRegression()
model1.fit(X_train, y_train)

#Save model
with open('model1.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model1, f)


#Load and use a different model (simulates accidental overwrite or versioning issue)
model2 = LinearRegression()
model2.fit(X_train, y_train + 1) #Simulates training a different model

#Load original model
with open('model1.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    loaded_model = pickle.load(f)

X_test = np.array([[4]])
y_true = np.array([4])

y_pred_correct = loaded_model.predict(X_test)
y_pred_incorrect = model2.predict(X_test)

mae_correct = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred_correct)
mae_incorrect = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred_incorrect)

print(f"Correct MAE: {mae_correct}")
print(f"Incorrect MAE (model version mismatch): {mae_incorrect}")
```

This example showcases how using a different model (model2 here, unintentionally) during the prediction phase, compared to the model used for MAE calculation (model1), will lead to inconsistent MAE values.  Proper version control and careful model handling are critical.


**Example 3:  Incorrect MAE Calculation:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

y_true = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y_pred = np.array([1.1, 1.9, 3.2, 4.1, np.nan]) #Contains NaN

# Incorrect calculation (ignores NaN)
mae_incorrect = np.mean(np.abs(y_true - y_pred)) #Will raise an error due to np.nan

# Correct calculation (handles NaN)
mae_correct = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred, ignore_nan=True)


print(f"Correct MAE (handles NaN): {mae_correct}")
#print(f"Incorrect MAE (ignores NaN): {mae_incorrect}") #Uncomment to see the error

```

This highlights the importance of correctly handling potential errors during the MAE computation.  The `ignore_nan` parameter in `sklearn`'s `mean_absolute_error` is crucial to avoid erroneous results if your data contains missing values.  Failing to handle these correctly can easily lead to inaccurate MAE values.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of MAE and regression model evaluation, consult standard machine learning textbooks.  Specific attention should be given to chapters focusing on model evaluation metrics and best practices for data preprocessing and pipeline construction.  Reviewing the documentation for your chosen machine learning libraries (like scikit-learn) will be crucial for ensuring proper usage of evaluation functions and understanding the implications of various parameters.  Finally, studying case studies and examples of robust machine learning pipelines will help solidify your understanding of the potential pitfalls and best practices.
