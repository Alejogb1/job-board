A fundamental challenge when working with real-world data often arises from its inherent irregularity. CSV datasets, while seemingly straightforward, frequently deviate from the ideal rectangular form where each row contains the same number of columns. Using TensorFlow's `tf.data.experimental.CsvDataset` with these non-uniform CSVs presents a specific difficulty, as the API expects a consistent column structure. My experience building a customer churn prediction system exposed me to this exact issue, where varying customer profiles resulted in inconsistent comma-delimited records.

The core problem is that `tf.data.experimental.CsvDataset` is designed to parse fixed-length rows. It defines the data types and number of columns through the `record_defaults` parameter, creating a schema that expects a specific number of fields per line. If a line has fewer or more fields than specified, the dataset will either raise an error or truncate/pad, leading to data corruption. Thus, directly feeding a non-rectangular CSV into this API without preprocessing is generally not feasible.

The solution involves a preprocessing step performed *before* the data is ingested into the `CsvDataset`. Iâ€™ve found that explicitly handling each row based on its individual structure allows for the flexible mapping to TensorFlow tensors. This process typically involves reading the file line by line, parsing each line into a list of strings based on the delimiter, and handling each list according to a user-defined logic, which then can then be turned into the necessary TensorFlow Tensor structures. This often involves padding or truncating lists to a canonical length.

Here are three code examples illustrating different methods I've employed to address this non-rectangular data issue:

**Example 1: Padding with Default Values**

This approach is suitable when missing values are meaningfully replaced by a default. For instance, in a user profile data with varying numbers of skills, a 'None' placeholder could be used when a skill is not specified. In this scenario, we read the file line by line, split on the delimiter, and pad the resulting list to a predefined length using a default string value, before turning it into a tensor and saving to a file format that can be read directly into TensorFlow datasets.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import csv

def pad_and_save_csv(input_file, output_file, delimiter=',', default_value='None', max_columns=10):
  """Pads CSV rows to a fixed number of columns and saves to tfrecord"""
  writer = tf.io.TFRecordWriter(output_file)

  with open(input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter=delimiter)
    for row in reader:
      padded_row = row + [default_value] * (max_columns - len(row))
      padded_row = padded_row[:max_columns]
      example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={
      'data': tf.train.Feature(bytes_list=tf.train.BytesList(value=[x.encode('utf-8') for x in padded_row]))
      }))
      writer.write(example.SerializeToString())
  writer.close()


def decode_tfrecord(record, max_columns=10):
    features = {
        'data': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([max_columns], tf.string)
    }
    parsed_features = tf.io.parse_single_example(record, features)
    return parsed_features['data']


# Example Usage:
input_csv = "uneven.csv"
output_tfrecords = "uneven.tfrecord"

pad_and_save_csv(input_csv, output_tfrecords)

dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(output_tfrecords)
dataset = dataset.map(decode_tfrecord)
for record in dataset.take(2):
  print(record.numpy())
```

This code snippet first defines a function `pad_and_save_csv` which opens the irregular CSV file, reads line by line, pads to a `max_columns` length with the `default_value`, and serializes each row to tfrecord. Then, a function `decode_tfrecord` defines the schema to unpack each record. Finally, the TFRecord is loaded to a dataset. The output shows tensors of the same shape with missing values filled using the `default_value`.

**Example 2: Handling Variable-Length Sequences**

In cases where variable-length data represents sequences (e.g., a sequence of events logged for each customer), padding to a maximum length may not be the ideal solution. A better approach would be to store the variable lengths and the values in separate fields of the TFRecord, thus preserving the underlying data without loss of information.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import csv


def sequences_and_save(input_file, output_file, delimiter=','):
  """Stores variable length rows and their lengths into tfrecord."""
  writer = tf.io.TFRecordWriter(output_file)
  with open(input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter=delimiter)
    for row in reader:
      row_len = len(row)
      example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={
          'data': tf.train.Feature(bytes_list=tf.train.BytesList(value=[x.encode('utf-8') for x in row])),
          'len': tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[row_len]))
      }))
      writer.write(example.SerializeToString())

  writer.close()


def decode_sequence(record):
    features = {
        'data': tf.io.VarLenFeature(tf.string),
        'len': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([1], tf.int64)
    }
    parsed_features = tf.io.parse_single_example(record, features)
    return parsed_features['data'].values, parsed_features['len'][0]

# Example Usage
input_csv = "uneven.csv"
output_tfrecords = "uneven_seq.tfrecord"

sequences_and_save(input_csv, output_tfrecords)

dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(output_tfrecords)
dataset = dataset.map(decode_sequence)

for record, length in dataset.take(2):
  print("Sequence:", record.numpy())
  print("Length:", length.numpy())
```

In this case, the `sequences_and_save` function stores the row and its corresponding length, serialized as separate elements in the `tf.train.Example`, before writing it to the TFRecord file. The `decode_sequence` function then unpacks both elements, returning the sequence as a variable length tensor and the length. This allows for later use of dynamic operations, such as masking, within the TensorFlow model.

**Example 3: Selective Column Handling**

In certain instances, only specific columns from the CSV are relevant. A selective column handling mechanism allows for mapping only those columns into the TensorFlow tensors, allowing for greater control and efficiency.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import csv

def selective_columns(input_file, output_file, delimiter=',', columns_to_extract=[0,2]):
  """Extracts specific columns from each row and saves to tfrecord"""
  writer = tf.io.TFRecordWriter(output_file)
  with open(input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter=delimiter)
    for row in reader:
      filtered_row = [row[i] for i in columns_to_extract if i < len(row)]
      example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={
      'data': tf.train.Feature(bytes_list=tf.train.BytesList(value=[x.encode('utf-8') for x in filtered_row]))
      }))
      writer.write(example.SerializeToString())
  writer.close()

def decode_selective_columns(record):
    features = {
        'data': tf.io.VarLenFeature(tf.string)
    }
    parsed_features = tf.io.parse_single_example(record, features)
    return parsed_features['data'].values

# Example Usage
input_csv = "uneven.csv"
output_tfrecords = "selective.tfrecord"

selective_columns(input_csv, output_tfrecords)

dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(output_tfrecords)
dataset = dataset.map(decode_selective_columns)
for record in dataset.take(2):
  print(record.numpy())

```

Here, the `selective_columns` function filters each row based on the index given in the `columns_to_extract` argument, handling the potential scenario where a specified index does not exist. The function then serializes the filtered data to TFRecord. The `decode_selective_columns` function is updated to unpack the data. The result shows how only selected data is passed into the data processing pipeline.

In summary, when dealing with non-rectangular CSV datasets, relying solely on `tf.data.experimental.CsvDataset` without prior processing will not result in correct data loading. Instead, preprocess the dataset using custom functions, then save the processed data into a standard format such as TFRecords. This approach provides control over the data handling process, thereby ensuring accurate and effective ingestion into the TensorFlow training pipeline.

For further reading, I recommend exploring books on practical machine learning, where data engineering is extensively discussed, particularly within sections detailing data preparation and processing pipelines. Additionally, publications from O'Reilly that specifically cover TensorFlow in a practical context often dive into these nuanced challenges. Examining code examples on data pre-processing using Python scripting (like shown above) can help understanding the specific data transformations used before data ingestion into TensorFlow.
