Layer normalization's behavior subtly differs between training and evaluation phases in TensorFlow/Keras due to the handling of batch statistics.  My experience optimizing deep generative models highlighted this discrepancy repeatedly.  Crucially, during training, layer normalization computes its mean and variance statistics from the current batch, introducing stochasticity.  During evaluation, however, a fixed, often population-based, statistic is utilized, ensuring consistent normalization across all inputs. This shift influences the model's output variance and, consequently, its generalization performance.


**1.  A Clear Explanation of the Discrepancy**

The core difference lies in the computation of the normalization parameters – mean (µ) and variance (σ²) – used to standardize the layer's activations.  Consider a layer with activation tensor *x* of shape (batch_size, features).  During training, Layer Normalization (LN) calculates µ and σ² for each feature across the batch dimension.  This is done using a running average (often implemented with a moving average, exponential moving average, or similar technique). This introduces variability dependent on the batch's characteristics. A small batch size increases the noise in those statistics.  This stochasticity acts as a form of regularization, preventing the model from overfitting to specific batch patterns.  It's this inherent randomness which often contributes to the performance boost observed during training.


In the evaluation phase, the goal is to obtain a stable and consistent output.  The stochastic nature of training-time normalization is undesirable. Therefore, the previously accumulated statistics (mean and variance) are used. This could be a simple average of statistics accumulated during the training phase or a more sophisticated strategy to consider potential biases from limited data.  This ensures that the normalization remains consistent and predictable, essential for accurate predictions and consistent results across multiple runs.


The specific implementation details might vary based on the framework and chosen hyperparameters, however the fundamental principle remains constant: training introduces stochastic normalization based on per-batch statistics, while evaluation employs pre-calculated, fixed statistics for stable, deterministic operation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate this difference using TensorFlow/Keras, focusing on how the internal statistics are handled.  I've used simplified scenarios for clarity.


**Example 1:  Illustrating Batch Statistics during Training**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple layer normalization layer
layer = tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization()

# Sample input tensor (batch of 4 samples, 3 features)
x_train = tf.random.normal((4, 3))

# Forward pass during training
y_train = layer(x_train, training=True)

# Access the moving average parameters (Note: Access method might vary depending on the specific LayerNormalization implementation.)
#  This example illustrates the concept; actual access might involve a more convoluted retrieval.
# mean, variance = layer.moving_mean.numpy(), layer.moving_variance.numpy() # Placeholder for illustrative purposes.  Access methods might vary.
print("Training output:", y_train)
#print("Training mean:", mean)  #Uncomment when working with custom LN class that exposes these attributes.
#print("Training variance:", variance)  #Uncomment when working with custom LN class that exposes these attributes.
```

This code snippet demonstrates the training phase where batch statistics are used to normalize the input tensor `x_train`. The `training=True` argument is crucial; it instructs the layer to compute the mean and variance from the current batch.  The commented-out lines illustrate how one might access these computed statistics. The actual methods of accessing these can change based on the layer implementation, so this is a generic example for illustrative purposes only.  My experience building custom layers with more complex normalization schemes involved more intricate methods for maintaining and accessing these parameters.


**Example 2: Evaluation with Pre-calculated Statistics**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Reuse the same layer normalization layer from Example 1
# Assume 'layer' is already defined and trained.

# Sample input tensor for evaluation
x_eval = tf.random.normal((2, 3))

# Forward pass during evaluation
y_eval = layer(x_eval, training=False)

print("Evaluation output:", y_eval)
```

Here, `training=False` ensures the layer uses the pre-calculated statistics gathered during training. This guarantees consistent normalization across all evaluation samples, leading to stable, reproducible outputs.  The absence of recalculating statistics during evaluation leads to faster inference.


**Example 3: Custom Layer Normalization for Enhanced Control (Advanced)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomLayerNormalization(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayerNormalization, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.gamma = self.add_weight(name="gamma", initializer="ones")
        self.beta = self.add_weight(name="beta", initializer="zeros")
        self.moving_mean = self.add_weight(name="moving_mean", initializer="zeros", trainable=False)
        self.moving_variance = self.add_weight(name="moving_variance", initializer="ones", trainable=False)

    def call(self, inputs, training=None):
        mean = tf.reduce_mean(inputs, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        variance = tf.math.reduce_variance(inputs, axis=-1, keepdims=True) + 1e-8 #Add small epsilon for numerical stability

        if training:
            self.moving_mean.assign_add(0.01 * (mean - self.moving_mean)) #Example update - adjust learning rate as needed
            self.moving_variance.assign_add(0.01 * (variance - self.moving_variance)) #Example update
        else:
            mean, variance = self.moving_mean, self.moving_variance

        normalized = (inputs - mean) / tf.sqrt(variance)
        return self.gamma * normalized + self.beta

# Usage:
custom_layer = CustomLayerNormalization()
#Training and Evaluation as before
```

This example shows a custom Layer Normalization implementation, providing greater control over the update rule for the moving average. Here, a simple exponential moving average is applied; more sophisticated strategies could improve stability, especially in scenarios with high-variance data or imbalanced batches.  The ability to specify the update rate (0.01 in this instance) allows for fine-tuning the influence of the current batch on the moving averages. This offers significant advantages for situations requiring tailored behavior or when dealing with non-standard data distributions.   My experience indicates that this level of control is sometimes crucial for achieving optimal performance in unusual applications.
