The core issue underlying a disconnected Keras graph, hindering tensor value retrieval, typically stems from a mismatch between the model's execution flow and the intended data dependencies during the forward pass.  This manifests as a lack of clear pathways for gradient calculations or value propagation from input to output, resulting in inaccessible intermediate tensor values.  I've encountered this frequently during the development of large-scale sequence-to-sequence models and custom loss functions involving multiple branches.

The problem manifests in several ways:  a `ValueError` during `model.predict()`, a failure to retrieve layer outputs using `layer.output`, or difficulties in visualizing the model graph using tools like TensorBoard.  The root cause, however, usually lies in one of three areas:  incorrect layer connections, misuse of custom layers or functions, or issues with the model's compilation process.

**1. Incorrect Layer Connections:**

A seemingly minor error in specifying input and output tensors between layers can lead to a disconnected graph.  This is particularly prevalent when working with functional APIs, where layers are explicitly connected.  A forgotten connection, an incorrect tensor passed as input, or a mismatch in tensor shapes can all cause the graph to fragment.  Layers may appear in the model summary, but their interdependencies remain undefined, leading to disconnected components within the computational graph.  The `model.summary()` method often helps identify structural issues, though it may not always reveal subtle connectivity problems.

**Example 1:  Incorrect Functional API Connection**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Incorrect connection:  Dense layer missing input
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='relu')
dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')

# Missing connection between dense1 and dense2
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense2(input_layer))  # Incorrect!

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Attempting to predict will likely fail due to the disconnected graph
# model.predict(np.random.rand(1, 10))

# Corrected version
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='relu')(input_layer) #Correct connection
dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(dense1)     #Correct connection
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense2)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
# model.predict(np.random.rand(1, 10)) #Now functions correctly
```


**2. Misuse of Custom Layers or Functions:**

Implementing custom layers or loss functions often introduces complexities that can lead to graph disconnections.  Failing to correctly define input/output tensors within a custom layer or improperly handling tensor manipulations within a custom function can disrupt the flow of the computational graph.  In particular,  operations that modify tensor shapes unexpectedly or detach tensors from the computational graph (e.g., through unintended copies)  are common culprits.

**Example 2: Problematic Custom Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        # Incorrect:  This creates a tensor outside the graph
        x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0]]) + inputs #Problem Line:  tf.constant creates a disconnected tensor
        return x

input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(2,))
custom_layer = MyCustomLayer()(input_layer)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=custom_layer)

#model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')  #Will probably fail compilation

#Corrected Version:
class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
      return inputs + tf.keras.backend.constant([[1.0, 2.0]]) #Using backend to maintain graph connection

input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(2,))
custom_layer = MyCustomLayer()(input_layer)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=custom_layer)

#model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') #Now correctly compiles
```


**3. Issues with Model Compilation:**

Even with correctly defined layers and connections, compilation issues can lead to a dysfunctional graph.  Inconsistencies between the specified optimizer, loss function, and metrics with the model's structure, or the use of incompatible tensor types, can prevent the proper building of the computational graph and result in a disconnected state.

**Example 3: Incompatible Loss and Output Shapes**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='relu')(input_layer)
dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')(dense1) # Output shape is (None, 2)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense2)

# Incorrect: Using a loss function incompatible with the output shape
#model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy') #Problem: Binary crossentropy expects a single output.

# Corrected version: Using categorical_crossentropy for multi-class classification
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) #Correct loss function


# Sample data for demonstration
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
Y = keras.utils.to_categorical(np.random.randint(0, 2, 100), num_classes=2) #One-hot encoded labels

model.fit(X, Y, epochs=10)
```

In summary, resolving disconnected Keras graphs necessitates a methodical approach involving: 1) careful review of layer connections in the functional API or model definition, 2) thorough examination of custom layers and functions for proper tensor handling and graph integration, and 3) verification of compatibility between the model's structure, optimizer, loss function, and metrics during the compilation phase.  Utilizing debugging tools like `tf.print()` within the model to inspect tensor shapes and values at various points can prove invaluable in pinpointing the source of disconnections.
