Discovering REST API parameters for a website without readily available HTML data requires a multi-pronged approach leveraging browser developer tools, network analysis, and potentially, some educated guesswork based on common API design patterns.  My experience working on reverse-engineering various e-commerce platforms for competitive analysis has highlighted the importance of systematic exploration in such scenarios.

**1. Leveraging Browser Developer Tools:** The most effective initial step involves utilizing your browser's developer tools, specifically the Network tab.  This allows for direct observation of HTTP requests made by the website, revealing the underlying API calls.  Before commencing, ensure the website is fully loaded and any dynamic content has rendered.  Then, initiate actions that would reasonably trigger data retrieval – such as a search, filtering operation, or navigation to a data-rich section of the website.  Observe the requests generated;  look for those with URLs containing query parameters or a JSON payload in the request body. These are strong indicators of API endpoints being used.  Pay close attention to the request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the headers, and the response status codes.  A successful API call will generally return a 200 OK status code with the requested data in JSON or XML format.  Failure to identify calls immediately suggests employing further investigative techniques discussed subsequently.


**2. Examining the Website's JavaScript Code:**  If direct network observation proves fruitless,  the website's JavaScript code may offer clues.  Many websites embed API calls directly within their client-side JavaScript.  Access the website's source code through the browser's developer tools (Sources tab) and search for keywords like "fetch," "XMLHttpRequest," "axios," or similar terms indicating AJAX calls.  These calls often contain the API endpoint URLs and parameters, possibly obfuscated or dynamically constructed.  Carefully examining the code, including any JavaScript libraries used, is crucial.  I've personally encountered instances where minified JavaScript required deobfuscation using tools like  JSNice or even manual inspection to reveal embedded API calls.  This process can be time-consuming, but often yields valuable insights.


**3.  Inference through Common API Design Patterns:** When all else fails, understanding prevalent API design patterns can help formulate educated guesses about the API's structure.   For instance, many APIs follow predictable naming conventions, such as `/users`, `/products`, or `/items`, and use query parameters like `limit`, `offset`, `sort`, and `filter` to control data retrieval.  Combining this understanding with knowledge gleaned from the website's functionality – what data the website displays – can facilitate the construction of hypothetical API calls.  This step relies heavily on experience and understanding of common data structures and API standards (RESTful design principles).  However, it should only be employed after exhaustive attempts at direct discovery.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Using Browser Developer Tools to Intercept a GET Request**

```javascript
// This is a conceptual example, the actual implementation depends on the browser developer tools
// The 'fetch' function will show the URL in the Network tab in the browser's developer tools.

fetch('/api/products?category=electronics&limit=10')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Process the data received from the API
    console.log(data);
  });
```

This code snippet demonstrates a hypothetical GET request to retrieve a limited set of products from an electronics category.  Observing this request in the Network tab reveals the API endpoint and its parameters.  In practice, you will find this request already present in the Network tab without needing to write this code, you are simply observing existing traffic.

**Example 2:  Analyzing a POST Request from JavaScript Code**

```javascript
// Hypothetical example of a POST request found within the website's JavaScript code.

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('name', 'New Product');
formData.append('description', 'A fantastic new item');

fetch('/api/products', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Handle the response
    console.log(data);
  });
```

This example illustrates a POST request used to add a new product. Examining the code reveals the API endpoint (`/api/products`) and the parameters sent in the request body.  Again, this is not code you would write; it is example code that you would find embedded within the target website's JavaScript. The parameters are provided within the request body, unlike Example 1.

**Example 3:  Constructing a Hypothetical API Call Based on Inference**

```javascript
// Hypothetical API call based on assuming a common API design pattern for user data.

fetch('/api/users?id=123&email=test@example.com')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data); //Expect user data
  });
```

This example demonstrates a hypothetical API call constructed based on the assumption of a common API design for retrieving user information.  The `/api/users` endpoint and query parameters (`id`, `email`) are educated guesses based on typical API patterns.  This method requires careful consideration of the website's functionality and an understanding of common API conventions.  The success of this approach relies heavily on prior experience.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* Comprehensive documentation on HTTP methods and status codes.
* A detailed guide to web browser developer tools.
* A reference manual on common JavaScript frameworks and libraries used in web development.
* Textbooks on RESTful API design principles and best practices.
* Guides on web scraping and data extraction techniques (used cautiously and ethically).


Remember to always respect the website's terms of service and robots.txt file.  Unauthorized access or excessive requests can lead to account suspension or legal repercussions. The techniques described are for legitimate purposes such as understanding website functionality, competitive analysis, and software development.  Improper use can have serious consequences.
