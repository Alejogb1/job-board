The most common reason PyTorch parameters fail to update during training stems from a mismatch between the optimizer's `zero_grad()` call and the backward pass execution.  Specifically, forgetting to zero the gradients accumulated from previous iterations leads to gradient accumulation, effectively averaging gradients across multiple steps instead of updating based on a single step's calculation. This averaged gradient can be significantly smaller than expected, resulting in negligible or imperceptible parameter updates, giving the impression of stalled training.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on large-scale image classification models and recurrent neural networks, and it's often obscured by more complex debugging challenges.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's automatic differentiation mechanism utilizes computational graphs to track gradients.  During the forward pass, the model computes predictions.  The backward pass then computes gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters.  These gradients are accumulated in the `.grad` attribute of each parameter tensor. The optimizer then uses these accumulated gradients to update the parameters, typically using an algorithm like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Crucially, the `.grad` attribute is *not* reset automatically after each backward pass.  If the gradients from a previous iteration remain, they add to the gradients of the current iteration, leading to the aforementioned gradient accumulation problem. The `optimizer.zero_grad()` function explicitly sets the `.grad` attribute of all parameters managed by the optimizer to zero, ensuring that only the gradients from the current iteration are used for the update.  Omitting this step renders the update ineffective, often leading to very slow or no learning.

Furthermore, issues can arise from incorrect model construction, particularly in scenarios involving custom layers or complex architectures.  A common oversight is not registering parameters correctly within a custom module, preventing them from being included in the optimizer's parameter list. This results in the optimizer never seeing these parameters, meaning they are never updated.  Another potential source of error lies in incorrect data handling, where issues such as incorrectly normalized inputs or vanishing gradients can effectively prevent parameter updates, although the outward symptoms might mimic the gradient accumulation problem.  Finally, the learning rate itself can be too small, obscuring the problem by making parameter changes practically undetectable.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Implementation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple model
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    # Generate some dummy data
    inputs = torch.randn(64, 10)
    targets = torch.randn(64, 1)

    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)

    # Backward pass and optimization
    optimizer.zero_grad()  # Crucial step: Zero gradients before backward pass
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/100], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

```

This example demonstrates the correct usage of `optimizer.zero_grad()`.  The gradients are explicitly zeroed before each backward pass, ensuring that only the gradients calculated in the current iteration contribute to the parameter update.  This is fundamental for proper training.


**Example 2: Incorrect Implementation (Missing `zero_grad()`)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple model
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    # Generate some dummy data
    inputs = torch.randn(64, 10)
    targets = torch.randn(64, 1)

    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)

    # Backward pass and optimization (missing zero_grad())
    loss.backward()  # Gradients accumulate!
    optimizer.step()

    print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/100], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

This example omits the crucial `optimizer.zero_grad()` call.  Gradients from each iteration accumulate, leading to potentially very small effective gradients and effectively halting training. The loss might decrease very slowly or not at all, giving the false impression that the model isn't learning.


**Example 3: Incorrect Implementation (Parameters not in optimizer)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(5, 1)
        self.unregistered_param = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(5)) #This parameter will not be updated!

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.linear2(x) + self.unregistered_param #Using it here
        return x

model = MyModel()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
# Only linear1 and linear2 parameters are registered
optimizer = optim.SGD(list(model.parameters())[:-1], lr=0.01) #Excluding self.unregistered_param

for epoch in range(100):
    inputs = torch.randn(64, 10)
    targets = torch.randn(64, 1)
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/100], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

This example shows a custom model with an unregistered parameter. The optimizer is only updating `linear1` and `linear2`. While `zero_grad()` is correctly used, the `unregistered_param` will not be updated, potentially affecting the model's performance, even though the other parameters will be updated.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation provides comprehensive guides on optimization and automatic differentiation.  Consult advanced deep learning textbooks covering backpropagation and optimization algorithms.  Reviewing source code for well-established PyTorch projects, paying close attention to how they handle optimizer instantiation and gradient updates, provides invaluable insight.  Exploring resources on debugging PyTorch models, specifically focusing on gradient checks, can prove incredibly useful in isolating the source of parameter update failures.  Finally, thoroughly understanding the mechanics of automatic differentiation is crucial for effectively troubleshooting these issues.
