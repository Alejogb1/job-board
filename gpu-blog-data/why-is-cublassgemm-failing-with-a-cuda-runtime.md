The most frequent cause of `cublasSgemm` failures resulting in CUDA runtime errors during GPU-only execution stems from improper memory management and insufficient attention to the underlying CUDA memory model.  My experience debugging numerous high-performance computing applications has shown that seemingly minor oversights in this area consistently lead to these errors.  Specifically, the problem rarely lies within the `cublasSgemm` function itself but rather in how the input matrices are handled before and after the call.  This necessitates a rigorous examination of memory allocation, data transfer, and error handling.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`cublasSgemm` expects its input matrices (A, B, C) and output matrix (C) to reside in device memory (GPU memory) accessible to the CUDA kernel.  A common source of failure is attempting to use host-allocated (CPU memory) matrices directly with `cublasSgemm`.  This results in an illegal memory access and ultimately a CUDA runtime error.  Even if the matrices are allocated on the device, potential issues can arise from:

* **Insufficient memory allocation:**  The matrices' dimensions may exceed the available GPU memory.  This is particularly relevant when dealing with large datasets.  Thorough memory planning, including accounting for potential temporary memory needs within the `cublasSgemm` operation, is crucial.

* **Incorrect memory alignment:**  CUDA kernels, including those underlying `cublasSgemm`, often require specific memory alignment for optimal performance and correctness.  Failing to ensure proper alignment can lead to unpredictable behavior, including runtime errors.  Explicitly aligned memory allocation is advisable.

* **Data transfer errors:**  If data is transferred from host to device (e.g., using `cudaMemcpy`), errors during this transfer can corrupt the data passed to `cublasSgemm`, resulting in unexpected results or runtime failures.  Always check the return value of `cudaMemcpy` for errors.

* **Unreleased memory:**  Failing to release device memory using `cudaFree` after the computation creates memory leaks. While not directly causing immediate failures in `cublasSgemm`, persistent memory leaks eventually exhaust GPU resources, resulting in later errors or application crashes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Usage:**

```c++
#include <cublas_v2.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    cublasHandle_t handle;
    cublasCreate(&handle);

    int m = 1024, n = 1024, k = 1024;
    float alpha = 1.0f, beta = 0.0f;

    float *h_A, *h_B, *h_C, *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_A, m * k * sizeof(float));
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_B, k * n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_C, m * n * sizeof(float));

    //Initialize h_A, h_B, h_C ...

    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, m * k * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, k * n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, m * n * sizeof(float));

    cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A, m * k * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_B, h_B, k * n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


    cublasSgemm(handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, m, n, k, &alpha, d_A, m, d_B, k, &beta, d_C, m);

    cudaMemcpy(h_C, d_C, m * n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    cudaFree(d_A);
    cudaFree(d_B);
    cudaFree(d_C);
    cudaFreeHost(h_A);
    cudaFreeHost(h_B);
    cudaFreeHost(h_C);
    cublasDestroy(handle);

    return 0;
}
```
This example demonstrates correct memory allocation on both host and device, explicit data transfer using `cudaMemcpy`, and proper memory deallocation.  Error checks (omitted for brevity) should be integrated for robust error handling.

**Example 2: Error:  Host memory used directly:**

```c++
// ... (Includes and handle creation as above) ...

float *h_A, *h_B, *h_C;
cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_A, m * k * sizeof(float));
cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_B, k * n * sizeof(float));
cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_C, m * n * sizeof(float));

//Initialize h_A, h_B, h_C ...

// INCORRECT: Using host memory directly with cublasSgemm
cublasSgemm(handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, m, n, k, &alpha, h_A, m, h_B, k, &beta, h_C, m);

// ... (Rest of the code) ...
```
This code will fail because `cublasSgemm` is called with host pointers, leading to a CUDA runtime error.

**Example 3: Error: Insufficient Memory Allocation:**

```c++
// ... (Includes and handle creation as above) ...

//Insufficient memory allocation
cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, m * k * sizeof(float) / 2); // Example: Half the required memory
cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, k * n * sizeof(float));
cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, m * n * sizeof(float));

// ... (Data transfer and cublasSgemm call) ...

// ... (Rest of the code) ...
```

This example will likely crash or produce incorrect results due to insufficient memory allocated for `d_A`.  The CUDA runtime will detect this memory violation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA Programming Guide, the cuBLAS library documentation, and a comprehensive text on parallel programming with CUDA are invaluable resources.  Familiarizing oneself with debugging tools provided within the CUDA toolkit is also essential for effectively identifying and resolving such runtime errors.  Pay close attention to the CUDA error codes returned by all CUDA API functions.  Mastering techniques for profiling and performance analysis will aid in understanding the reasons for any failures.
