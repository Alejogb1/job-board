Batch size exerts a profound influence on the evaluation performance and computational efficiency of TensorFlow neural networks. The choice of batch size, specifically, determines the number of training samples processed collectively during each iteration of gradient descent, impacting both the accuracy of gradient estimates and the overall training speed. Through my experience, spanning numerous projects ranging from image classification on custom satellite imagery to natural language processing models for sentiment analysis, I've witnessed the significant trade-offs associated with different batch size selections. Let’s delve into these effects with concrete examples.

The primary impact of batch size is on the stochasticity of the gradient updates. With a batch size of 1, often referred to as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the model's parameters are updated based on the error derived from a single training instance. This results in noisy gradient updates, which can lead to faster convergence initially, but may also cause the optimization to oscillate and have difficulty settling in a precise local minimum. In contrast, a large batch size, nearing the size of the entire training dataset, offers a more stable, albeit computationally intensive, gradient estimation. However, these large batches can also plateau easily, requiring tuning of other parameters to overcome this effect. A middle ground, characterized by smaller batches, represents a compromise between these extremes, balancing convergence speed and the stability of the gradient updates.

From an evaluation standpoint, when evaluating performance on unseen data, a similar relationship holds true: using a larger batch size is often faster but can miss nuances present in individual instances of data, which can be critical for capturing fine details in the overall performance. This can be particularly observed when dealing with very diverse datasets, where data instances may vary dramatically from one another.

The primary reason for the effects on training is based on how gradient is computed. In a single-batch setting, the loss is calculated per training instance. In contrast, with larger batches, gradients are aggregated or averaged across several instances before the model's parameters are updated. This averaging makes the gradient more stable and allows the model to move in a direction that better minimizes the overall training loss for that batch. The challenge, however, is that this averaged gradient may not correspond precisely to the gradients obtained in the one-instance-at-a-time scenario. Thus, while it offers a more global perspective, it may also miss individual data points and not converge towards more precise local minima.

Now, let us examine some practical code examples and their impact on evaluation results.

**Example 1: Small Batch Size (Batch Size: 32)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Generate dummy data
num_samples = 1000
input_shape = (10,)
num_classes = 2
X = tf.random.normal(shape=(num_samples, *input_shape))
y = tf.random.uniform(shape=(num_samples,), minval=0, maxval=num_classes, dtype=tf.int32)
y = tf.one_hot(y, depth=num_classes)

# Define the model
model = Sequential([
  Flatten(input_shape=input_shape),
  Dense(64, activation='relu'),
  Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Define optimizer and loss
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn, metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model with a small batch size
batch_size = 32
history = model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=batch_size, validation_split=0.2)

# Evaluate the model
evaluation_results_small_batch = model.evaluate(X, y, batch_size=batch_size)
print(f"Evaluation with batch size {batch_size}: Loss = {evaluation_results_small_batch[0]}, Accuracy = {evaluation_results_small_batch[1]}")
```

In this example, a small batch size of 32 is used. The `fit` method computes gradients based on these small batches which introduces some stochasticity, potentially leading to better generalization on the validation data. The evaluation process, performed with the same batch size, similarly assesses the model's performance on small portions of data at a time.

**Example 2: Large Batch Size (Batch Size: 512)**

```python
# ... previous setup (data generation, model definition, optimizer, loss function)

# Train the model with a large batch size
batch_size = 512
history = model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=batch_size, validation_split=0.2)

# Evaluate the model
evaluation_results_large_batch = model.evaluate(X, y, batch_size=batch_size)
print(f"Evaluation with batch size {batch_size}: Loss = {evaluation_results_large_batch[0]}, Accuracy = {evaluation_results_large_batch[1]}")

```

Here, a significantly larger batch size of 512 is employed during both training and evaluation. The gradients during training are now based on larger aggregated updates, which tend to converge more quickly but may end up in a slightly poorer minimum. Consequently, the evaluation results might differ as the model has been trained to minimize the error over larger batches of data. I often notice, with large batch sizes, faster training time, but can often be at the expense of a slightly degraded validation performance, an aspect observed across different architectures.

**Example 3: Varying Batch Size During Training and Evaluation**

```python
# ... previous setup (data generation, model definition, optimizer, loss function)

# Train the model with a large batch size
train_batch_size = 256
history = model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=train_batch_size, validation_split=0.2)

# Evaluate the model with a smaller batch size
evaluation_batch_size = 64
evaluation_results_varying_batch = model.evaluate(X, y, batch_size=evaluation_batch_size)
print(f"Evaluation with batch size {evaluation_batch_size}: Loss = {evaluation_results_varying_batch[0]}, Accuracy = {evaluation_results_varying_batch[1]}")

```

In this last example, the batch size during training (256) differs from the batch size used during the evaluation (64). This scenario illustrates that the evaluation phase, where the goal is to generate metrics, can be influenced by the batching method. It’s not atypical for a smaller batch size during evaluation to provide a finer-grained perspective on the model's performance, potentially uncovering nuances missed by larger batches. However, the choice must be carefully aligned to be representative of how the model is intended to perform during inference.

From these examples, it's evident that batch size is not merely a parameter for computational efficiency but fundamentally influences both training dynamics and the subsequent evaluation of a neural network. The selection of batch size must be judicious, often requiring experimentation, informed by the nature of the dataset and the architecture of the model. While larger batch sizes may accelerate training, they do not necessarily guarantee optimal convergence or evaluation results. In situations where resources are not a limiting factor, it is often beneficial to explore a few different batch sizes to determine which offers the most robust performance for the use case.

For deeper understanding, consider exploring resources such as “Deep Learning” by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville; “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow” by Geron; and various advanced materials available via MIT OpenCourseware, specifically focusing on optimization techniques for neural networks. These resources provide detailed theoretical background and practical implementation strategies related to stochastic optimization and gradient descent, critical elements in batch size selection.
