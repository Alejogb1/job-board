The fundamental method for building Keras models with a defined linear processing flow is by utilizing the `Sequential` API. This approach provides a straightforward way to stack layers in order, where the output of each layer serves as the input to the subsequent one. My experience with developing image classification models has consistently relied on this simple yet powerful construct for defining the foundational architecture. The `Sequential` API excels in creating feedforward neural networks, where data flows in one direction through the layers.

**Explanation of Sequential Model Construction**

A `Sequential` model in Keras is instantiated as a container object. Layers are then added to this container sequentially, using the `add()` method. The order in which layers are added determines the flow of data through the network. Keras implicitly manages the connections between layers; this simplifies model definition significantly. The `Sequential` API automatically infers input shapes for subsequent layers, provided that the first layer receives explicit input shape information or implicitly infers the input shape from a data batch.

The process begins by importing the necessary Keras components: `keras.models.Sequential` to define the model and `keras.layers` for specific layer types. These layers could include dense layers (fully connected), convolutional layers, pooling layers, recurrent layers, or other specialized operations depending on the application. For every layer, arguments such as the number of neurons (for dense layers), number of filters (for convolutional layers), activation function, padding, and others specific to the layer type are specified as named arguments in the `add()` call.

When compiling the `Sequential` model, you must select an optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD), a loss function (e.g., categorical crossentropy, mean squared error) and metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) which will be used during training. The final constructed model can then be used to make predictions, and more importantly, trained on data to adjust its weights according to the specified loss and optimizer. A key aspect of the `Sequential` model is its limitation - it only allows for single input and single output connections per layer which restricts flexibility when creating more complex network structures with branching, multi-input, or multi-output characteristics.

**Code Examples with Commentary**

*Example 1: A Basic Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)*

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,))) # Input layer with 784 features
model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')) # Output layer with 10 classes

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.summary() # Display model architecture
```
This example constructs a simple MLP designed for classification problems with 10 classes, such as the MNIST digit dataset. The input shape of (784,) corresponds to the flattened representation of a 28x28 image. The first `Dense` layer has 64 neurons with 'relu' activation function while the final `Dense` layer has 10 neurons, one for each class, with a 'softmax' activation which outputs a probability distribution. The summary provides useful information such as the number of parameters in the network.

*Example 2: A Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)*
```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1))) # Convolution layer with 32 filters
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) # Pooling layer
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')) # Second convolution layer
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) # Another pooling layer
model.add(layers.Flatten()) # Flatten output to feed into a dense layer
model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')) # Output layer

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.summary()
```

This example shows a basic CNN architecture. The `Conv2D` layers extract features from the input images, using convolutional filters. The `MaxPooling2D` layers reduce the spatial dimensions, and then the `Flatten` layer transforms the multi-dimensional output into a vector. This vector is fed into a dense output layer. The input shape is (28, 28, 1), which is suited for grayscale images of 28 x 28 size. This basic structure can be used as a starting point for more complex image classification or feature extraction tasks.

*Example 3: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM Layers*
```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(None, 10))) # LSTM layer with 64 units
model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')) # Output layer

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
             loss='binary_crossentropy',
             metrics=['accuracy'])

model.summary()
```

This demonstrates a simple RNN designed for sequence data. The `LSTM` layer processes sequences of varying length, accepting an input with shape (None, 10), with the first dimension representing the variable sequence length. The second dimension corresponds to the 10 features in each time step. The output layer is a single neuron with a sigmoid activation, making this suitable for binary classification. This is a very simple RNN and practical applications involve many more layers and often bi-directional architectures.

**Resource Recommendations**

For deepening your understanding, I recommend focusing on the following topics from reputable machine learning and deep learning resources:

1.  **Keras Documentation:** This should be the first port of call for the most precise, up-to-date information on the Keras API including the `Sequential` model. Pay particular attention to the section on model creation and layer properties.
2.  **Textbooks on Deep Learning:** Consult standard deep learning textbooks, which often have chapters specifically focused on designing neural network architectures, and typically contain a great description on layer types and their operation, specifically for the `Sequential` API context. These texts go deep into the theoretical underpinnings and use cases of specific layers and model constructs.
3. **Online Courses:** Many reputable online learning platforms host courses with hands-on practice using Keras. These courses provide practical examples with various network types. Look for material from reputable universities or known instructors to avoid learning deprecated code practices. Concentrate on sections about model building using Keras API, especially when it is related to `Sequential` based models. This will ensure you gain relevant experience to build your own projects.

By leveraging these resources, you can gain a detailed understanding of the `Sequential` API, building upon the fundamentals provided here and adapting your approach as requirements become more complex. The `Sequential` API, while simplistic in concept, forms a cornerstone of many complex neural network architectures that are used in production. Mastering it provides a strong base to learn more complex model structures.
