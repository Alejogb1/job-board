CUDA arrays, while not directly designed for multi-GPU texture mapping in the traditional sense of OpenGL or DirectX, offer a powerful alternative for achieving parallel texture processing across multiple GPUs.  My experience working on high-resolution medical image processing pipelines highlighted the limitations of standard texture-binding approaches when dealing with datasets exceeding the memory capacity of a single GPU.  This necessitates a distributed approach, leveraging CUDA arrays for data distribution and parallel processing.  The key is to understand that we're not using CUDA arrays as direct texture replacements within a graphics API; instead, we utilize them as efficient data structures for transferring and manipulating texture data across GPUs.

**1.  Explanation:**

Traditional texture mapping relies on GPUs having direct access to textures bound to specific texture units.  In a multi-GPU scenario, this direct sharing becomes complex and inefficient.  Instead, we can distribute the texture data across multiple GPUs using CUDA arrays.  Each GPU will hold a portion of the overall texture.  The mapping process then requires a two-step approach:  data distribution and parallel processing.

* **Data Distribution:** The initial texture data needs to be partitioned and copied to each GPU's memory using CUDA's peer-to-peer (P2P) memory access capabilities or via the host. This process is crucial for performance.  Optimal partitioning strategies, like tiling or row-major distribution, depend on the texture's characteristics and the inter-GPU communication bandwidth. Poor partitioning can create significant communication bottlenecks, negating the benefits of multi-GPU processing.

* **Parallel Processing:**  Once the data is distributed, each GPU can independently perform its texture mapping operations on its allocated portion of the texture data. This might involve applying filters, performing transformations, or other pixel-wise operations.  CUDA kernels are used to parallelize these operations on each GPU.  The final result will need to be aggregated, either on the host or on a designated GPU, depending on the application's needs.

Communication between GPUs is a critical consideration.  Efficient inter-GPU communication is essential to minimize latency during the texture processing pipeline. The choice between P2P access and host-mediated transfer depends on the hardware capabilities and data transfer volume.  P2P generally provides superior performance when available.

**2. Code Examples:**

These examples focus on the core concepts; error handling and resource management are omitted for brevity.  Assume necessary CUDA and standard libraries are included.

**Example 1: Data Distribution using CUDA Peer-to-Peer**

```cpp
// Assuming 'textureData' is the initial texture data on GPU 0
// and 'numGPUs' represents the number of available GPUs.

size_t dataSize = textureData.size();
size_t chunkSize = dataSize / numGPUs;

// Enable peer-to-peer access (requires prior configuration)

for (int i = 1; i < numGPUs; ++i) {
  CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpyPeerAsync(
    (void*)gpuArrays[i].ptr, i, 
    (void*)textureData.ptr, 0, 
    chunkSize, stream[i]
  ));
}
cudaStreamSynchronize(stream[numGPUs-1]); // Wait for all transfers
```

This snippet demonstrates the basic principle of distributing a texture array across multiple GPUs using peer-to-peer memory copies. Asynchronous copies are used to overlap data transfer with computation.  It is crucial to manage streams effectively for maximum concurrency.

**Example 2: Parallel Texture Filtering (Simplified)**

```cpp
// Kernel to perform a simple Gaussian blur on a portion of the texture

__global__ void gaussianBlurKernel(const float* input, float* output, int width, int height, int offset) {
  int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x + offset;
  int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  // ... Gaussian blur calculation ... (omitted for brevity)
}

// On each GPU:
gaussianBlurKernel<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(gpuArrays[gpuID], gpuOutputArrays[gpuID], width, height, offset);
```

This example shows a kernel performing a simple Gaussian blur operation on a part of the texture.  `offset` adjusts the starting position on the array based on GPU ID, effectively distributing the work across the available GPUs. The specific blur calculation is omitted for brevity but is a standard image processing operation easily implemented using CUDA.

**Example 3: Result Aggregation on the Host**

```cpp
// After processing on all GPUs, gather results.

std::vector<float> finalResult;
finalResult.resize(dataSize);
size_t chunkSize = dataSize / numGPUs;

for (int i = 0; i < numGPUs; ++i) {
  CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpy(
     finalResult.data() + i * chunkSize,
     gpuOutputArrays[i].ptr,
     chunkSize,
     cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost
  ));
}
```

This demonstrates how to copy the results back to the host from the individual GPUs.  Again, asynchronous copies can be used if necessary to maximize efficiency, followed by a synchronization to ensure the data is available for further processing.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a thorough understanding of CUDA programming, I strongly suggest consulting the official NVIDIA CUDA documentation.  The Programming Guide is essential for learning the fundamental concepts. Mastering parallel programming techniques, particularly synchronization primitives and memory management, is vital.  Consider investing time into learning about different CUDA memory types and their implications on performance. Finally, understanding and optimizing CUDA stream management is a significant factor in building efficient multi-GPU applications.  Exploring the NVIDIA CUDA samples is also highly beneficial, as they offer practical examples of advanced CUDA techniques.
