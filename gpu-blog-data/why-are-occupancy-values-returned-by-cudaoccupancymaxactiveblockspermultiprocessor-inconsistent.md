The inconsistency observed in `cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor`'s returned values stems primarily from the complex interplay between kernel launch parameters, hardware capabilities, and the underlying architecture of the GPU.  My experience optimizing CUDA kernels for high-performance computing, particularly in the context of large-scale simulations, has repeatedly highlighted this issue. The function does not provide a guaranteed maximum; instead, it returns an *estimate* based on readily available information at runtime, which can vary depending on the specific configuration.  This is crucial to understanding why discrepancies arise.


**1.  A Clear Explanation:**

`cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor` aims to provide a reasonable upper bound on the number of concurrently active blocks a multiprocessor (MP) can handle.  However, this calculation is inherently an approximation. The true maximum depends on several factors not directly accessible to the runtime library:

* **Kernel Complexity:**  The number of registers and shared memory used by a kernel significantly impacts its occupancy. A kernel with high register usage might limit the number of concurrently executing blocks, even if sufficient resources appear available.  This is because each block requires a specific number of registers, and the MP has a limited register file size.  Exceeding this limit necessitates context switching between blocks, reducing overall performance and effectively lowering the maximum number of active blocks.

* **Shared Memory Usage:** Similar to register usage, excessive shared memory consumption reduces occupancy. Shared memory is a limited resource per MP.  If multiple blocks contend for a limited shared memory pool, only a subset can be active simultaneously, leading to reduced occupancy.  The allocation and utilization of shared memory by a kernel are critical factors affecting the accuracy of `cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor`.

* **Warp Divergence:**  Instruction-level parallelism within a warp (32 threads) is fundamental to GPU performance.  However, conditional branches can lead to warp divergence, where different threads within a warp execute different instructions. This substantially reduces the efficiency of the MP, effectively diminishing its ability to handle multiple blocks concurrently.  The function cannot accurately predict the degree of divergence a kernel will exhibit.

* **Hardware Variations:** Different GPU architectures have varying micro-architectural characteristics affecting the maximum achievable occupancy.  The reported value accounts for the *general* capabilities of the MP, not the specific nuances of a particular kernel's interaction with those capabilities. Therefore, the same kernel might yield different results on different GPUs, even within the same family.

* **Dynamic Parallelism:**  The utilization of dynamic parallelism, where kernels launch other kernels, introduces further complexity.  The accurate estimation of occupancy becomes even more challenging as the runtime needs to consider resource allocation across multiple levels of kernel execution.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how variations in kernel parameters affect the reported occupancy.  These are simplified examples; real-world scenarios often involve much more intricate kernel designs and complex memory access patterns.

**Example 1: Impact of Register Usage:**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void kernel_reg(int *data, int n) {
  __shared__ int sdata[256]; //Shared memory usage (fixed for this example)
  int tid = threadIdx.x;
  int i;
  int registers[1024]; //Varying register usage - significantly impacts occupancy.

  for(i=0; i < 1024; ++i) registers[i] = i; //High register pressure

  if (tid < n) data[tid] = tid;
}

int main() {
  int size = 1024*1024;
  int *h_data, *d_data;
  cudaMallocHost((void **)&h_data, size * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_data, size * sizeof(int));

  int blocks, threads;
  cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor(&blocks, kernel_reg, 256, 0);
  printf("Max active blocks (high register usage): %d\n", blocks);

  // ... (rest of the CUDA kernel execution and cleanup) ...
  return 0;
}
```

This kernel intentionally uses a large register array.  Running this will likely yield a lower value for `blocks` compared to a version with significantly fewer registers, demonstrating how register usage directly affects the occupancy estimate.


**Example 2: Impact of Shared Memory Usage:**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void kernel_shared(int *data, int n) {
  __shared__ int sdata[256]; //Varying shared memory usage. Consider values like [256, 512, 1024].
  int tid = threadIdx.x;
  if (tid < n) {
    sdata[tid] = tid;
    data[tid] = sdata[tid];
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (CUDA memory allocation and setup as in Example 1) ...

  int blocks, threads;
  cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor(&blocks, kernel_shared, 256, 0);
  printf("Max active blocks (varying shared memory): %d\n", blocks);
  // ... (rest of the CUDA kernel execution and cleanup) ...
  return 0;
}
```

By varying the size of `sdata`, the impact of shared memory usage on the reported maximum active blocks can be observed. Larger `sdata` arrays will likely lead to lower occupancy estimates.


**Example 3:  Influence of Block Size:**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void kernel_blocks(int *data, int n) {
  int tid = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
  if (tid < n) data[tid] = tid;
}

int main() {
  // ... (CUDA memory allocation and setup as in Example 1) ...
  int blocks, threads;

  // Test with different block sizes
  for(int blockSize = 64; blockSize <= 512; blockSize *= 2){
    cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor(&blocks, kernel_blocks, blockSize, 0);
    printf("Max active blocks (block size %d): %d\n", blockSize, blocks);
  }

  // ... (rest of the CUDA kernel execution and cleanup) ...
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the effect of the block size (`blockSize`) on the reported maximum active blocks. Different block sizes will lead to different occupancy estimates due to changes in register and shared memory usage per MP.  Observe the output for different block sizes to understand this effect.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* CUDA C Programming Guide
* CUDA Occupancy Calculator (available as a separate utility or integrated into some development environments)
* NVIDIA's documentation on GPU architecture and micro-architecture details relevant to your specific hardware.



In conclusion, the inconsistency in `cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor`'s output is not a bug but a consequence of the complexities involved in accurately predicting the maximum achievable occupancy for a given kernel.  Understanding the factors influencing occupancy – register usage, shared memory allocation, warp divergence, and hardware characteristics – is crucial for optimizing CUDA kernel performance and interpreting the results provided by this function appropriately.  Remember to consider it an estimate, not a guaranteed maximum, and use profiling tools to measure actual occupancy during kernel execution for accurate performance analysis.
