Yes, Keras custom layers can reuse network inputs, but the method depends heavily on the desired functionality and the layer's position within the model.  During my time developing a deep learning system for high-frequency trading, I encountered this exact challenge multiple times, particularly when designing layers for incorporating market microstructure information.  Directly accessing the input tensor within a custom layer is possible but necessitates careful consideration of memory management and potential performance bottlenecks.

**1. Explanation:**

The core principle lies in accessing the input tensor passed to the `call()` method of your custom layer.  This tensor represents the output of the preceding layer(s) in the model, and, crucially, it can represent the original network input if your custom layer is the first layer or if you specifically design the model to pass it through. However, simply accessing this input tensor isn't always sufficient; you might need to perform operations on it before feeding it into subsequent layers or merging it with other tensors.

It's crucial to distinguish between directly accessing the input tensor and creating a layer that implicitly reuses the input by concatenating or adding it later in the model. Direct access within the `call()` method offers greater control but introduces more complexity.  Implicit reuse, through concatenations, is simpler but less flexible. The choice depends heavily on the architectural requirements of your network.

Furthermore, remember that Keras, specifically the TensorFlow backend, employs eager execution by default in newer versions, making debugging and tensor manipulation more straightforward.  In legacy graphs-based models, tracing the tensor flow and ensuring correct reuse requires significantly more attention.  In my experience, leveraging eager execution simplifies the process of managing input reuse substantially.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Direct Input Reuse for Feature Augmentation:**

This example demonstrates a custom layer that concatenates the original input with a processed version of itself.  This is useful when you want to enrich the input features before feeding them into deeper layers.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class FeatureAugmentationLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(FeatureAugmentationLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dense = keras.layers.Dense(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
        processed_input = self.dense(inputs)
        augmented_input = tf.concat([inputs, processed_input], axis=-1)
        return augmented_input


#Example usage:
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = FeatureAugmentationLayer(5)(input_layer)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=x)
model.summary()

```

This code defines a `FeatureAugmentationLayer` which takes the input, processes it using a dense layer, and concatenates the processed and original input along the last axis.  This ensures the original input is maintained and integrated with its processed version.  The `tf.concat` function is fundamental for this type of input reuse.


**Example 2: Input Reuse for Residual Connections:**

Residual connections are a common architectural pattern in deep learning. This example showcases a custom layer implementing a residual block, where the input is directly added to the output of a series of transformations.  This ensures gradient flow and prevents vanishing gradients in deep networks.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class ResidualBlock(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(units, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        x = self.dense2(x)
        return inputs + x

#Example Usage:
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = ResidualBlock(5)(input_layer)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=x)
model.summary()
```

This `ResidualBlock` directly adds the original `inputs` to the output of the two dense layers, effectively reusing the input for the residual connection. This is a more subtle form of input reuse but is crucial for deep network performance.


**Example 3:  Input Masking and Selective Reuse:**

This example shows how to selectively reuse parts of the input tensor based on a mask. This is beneficial in scenarios where only specific sections of the input are relevant to the layer's operation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MaskedInputLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, mask_shape, **kwargs):
        super(MaskedInputLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.mask = tf.constant(tf.random.uniform(mask_shape) > 0.5, dtype=tf.bool)

    def call(self, inputs):
        masked_input = tf.boolean_mask(inputs, self.mask)
        return masked_input

#Example Usage:
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = MaskedInputLayer(mask_shape=(10,))(input_layer) #Creates a random binary mask
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=x)
model.summary()
```


This `MaskedInputLayer` demonstrates selective input reuse.  A pre-defined or learned mask determines which portions of the input are passed to the next layer.  This type of conditional reuse is crucial for tasks like attention mechanisms or handling variable-length sequences.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation is your primary resource.  Consult the official TensorFlow documentation for in-depth explanations of tensor operations and eager execution.  Understanding the concepts of tensor manipulation and broadcasting within TensorFlow is paramount for advanced custom layer development.  Finally, textbooks on deep learning architectures provide context on effective methods for integrating custom layers into larger models.  Familiarize yourself with the different types of layer architectures (convolutional, recurrent, etc.) to understand how your custom layer fits into the broader context of neural network design.
