In backpropagation through a computational graph within PyTorch, gradients are typically calculated and stored for tensor leaves (those created directly by the user and requiring gradient computation) and for model parameters. However, directly accessing gradients of intermediate nodes – tensors resulting from operations on other tensors – demands a slightly different approach since these aren't automatically retained unless explicitly instructed.

PyTorch, by default, frees up intermediate node gradients to conserve memory during the backward pass, as they are not usually required for user-defined calculations or model updates. These gradients, while transient for the backward pass, are vital if we need to analyze the contribution of specific computational paths or for research-related investigations requiring detailed introspection of the gradient flow. Consequently, to obtain gradients for an intermediate node, we must use the `retain_grad()` method on that specific tensor.

The process involves three fundamental steps: 1) ensuring that the intermediate tensor requires a gradient by tracing the computational path, 2) calling `retain_grad()` on the intermediate tensor before the backward pass, and 3) accessing the accumulated gradient using the `.grad` attribute following the computation of the overall gradient with the `.backward()` method.

Here's an illustrative example: Let's assume I'm experimenting with a custom loss function in an image processing task. I have a latent representation `latent_z` after passing an image through an encoder, and I perform some operations that generate `modified_z`. I'm interested in the gradient of `modified_z` with respect to the loss function.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# 1. Setup input tensor that requires a gradient.
image = torch.randn(1, 3, 28, 28, requires_grad=True)

# 2. Simulate a simple encoder.
encoder = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)
latent_z = encoder(image)

# 3. Introduce a modification to the latent representation
modified_z = latent_z.mean(dim=[2,3]) * 2

# 4. Call retain_grad on the modified tensor.
modified_z.retain_grad()

# 5. Create a mock decoder.
decoder = nn.Linear(16,10)
output = decoder(modified_z)

# 6. Simulate a mock loss function.
loss = output.sum()

# 7. Perform backpropagation.
loss.backward()

# 8. Access the gradient.
print(f"Gradient of modified_z: {modified_z.grad}")
```

In the above code example, the `retain_grad()` method is called on `modified_z` after its computation, before `loss.backward()`.  This ensures that during backpropagation, the gradient of the `loss` with respect to `modified_z` is stored within `modified_z.grad` instead of being discarded. Subsequently, the gradient can be accessed via the `.grad` attribute, making it possible to inspect the influence of `modified_z` on the final `loss`. If `retain_grad()` were omitted, `modified_z.grad` would be `None`.

Here is a second, more detailed use-case. Imagine, for instance, that my project involves a convolutional network with an intermediate layer, and I need to visualize the gradient flow through the intermediate feature maps.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class MyModel(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self):
      super().__init__()
      self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=3)
      self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3)
      self.fc = nn.Linear(64*24*24, 10) # Output of convolution layers 28-3+1=26 26-3+1=24

  def forward(self, x):
      x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
      intermediate = F.relu(self.conv2(x)) # Intermediate output after the first two conv layers
      x = intermediate.view(x.size(0), -1)
      x = self.fc(x)
      return x, intermediate

# 1. Instance of our model
model = MyModel()

# 2. Example input
image = torch.randn(1, 3, 28, 28, requires_grad=True)

# 3. Forward pass through the model
output, intermediate_features = model(image)

# 4. Retain gradient of the intermediate features.
intermediate_features.retain_grad()

# 5. Assume a loss function calculation.
loss = F.cross_entropy(output, torch.randint(0, 10, (1,)))

# 6. Backpropagation
loss.backward()

# 7. Access gradient of intermediate feature maps.
print(f"Gradient shape of intermediate feature maps {intermediate_features.grad.shape}")
```

In this extended example, I explicitly define a model `MyModel` with two convolutional layers, followed by a fully connected layer. The output of the second convolutional layer, `intermediate_features`, is the tensor whose gradient I intend to compute. Similar to the previous example, before calling `.backward()`, `intermediate_features.retain_grad()` is called. Consequently, the computed gradient `intermediate_features.grad` reveals the per-pixel contribution of that intermediate representation towards the loss function, with the shape reflecting the output of the second convolutional layer. Without `retain_grad`, this operation would raise a `None` output.

Lastly, let's look at an application of this gradient tracing within an adversarial attack framework. Here, I would like to create adversarial input noise that specifically influences the activations at a certain layer.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        intermediate = F.relu(self.fc2(x)) # Intermediate layer for manipulation.
        x = self.fc3(intermediate)
        return x, intermediate

# 1. Instance of the model and initialize an input tensor.
model = SimpleNet()
input_image = torch.randn(1, 784, requires_grad=True)

# 2. Forward Pass
output, intermediate_layer = model(input_image)

# 3. Retain the gradient.
intermediate_layer.retain_grad()

# 4. Define adversarial perturbation target.
target_activation = torch.zeros_like(intermediate_layer)
target_activation[0, 10] = 1 # A particular feature in this layer that I am targeting.

# 5. Calculate Loss based on the difference of intermediate layer activation and a target value.
attack_loss = F.mse_loss(intermediate_layer, target_activation)

# 6. Backpropagate the loss for adversarial noise manipulation.
attack_loss.backward()

# 7. Calculate the adversarial perturbation by gradient ascent.
epsilon = 0.01
perturbation = epsilon * input_image.grad.sign()

# 8. Update adversarial image.
adversarial_image = input_image + perturbation

print(f"The shape of our perturbation is {perturbation.shape}")
```

Here, I have introduced an adversarial component where I am trying to perturb the input such that a specific activation within a hidden layer of the network will increase (specifically, the 10th neuron).  By retaining the gradient of `intermediate_layer` and using `mse_loss` with a target activation, the gradient of `input_image` now reflects the sensitivity of the loss with respect to the input image for *that* particular activation within the intermediate layer, guiding the creation of the adversarial example.  This illustrates a scenario where retaining gradients on intermediate nodes allows for more complex targeted manipulation of network behaviours.

To expand knowledge in this domain, I highly recommend investigating the official PyTorch documentation on automatic differentiation and gradient computation. Tutorials on computational graph manipulation, and research papers focusing on gradient-based techniques for model inspection or adversarial attacks, will also offer valuable insights into the practical applications of such techniques.  Additionally, reviewing code examples that employ gradient manipulation, whether in machine learning projects or model analysis repositories, offers a practical approach to learn. By combining theoretical knowledge and real-world code analysis, a robust understanding of gradient computation in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch can be achieved.
