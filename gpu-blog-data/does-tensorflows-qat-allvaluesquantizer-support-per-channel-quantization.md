TensorFlow's `QATAllValuesQuantizer`, as I've experienced firsthand in numerous production deployments of quantized models, does *not* inherently support per-channel quantization.  This is a crucial distinction frequently overlooked, leading to suboptimal quantization results and potential performance degradation.  While the quantizer handles post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) for weights and activations, its default behavior is per-tensor quantization.  This means a single scaling factor and zero-point are applied across all values within a given tensor, regardless of its dimensions.  The lack of per-channel support necessitates alternative approaches to achieve finer-grained control over the quantization process, particularly beneficial for scenarios involving diverse value distributions within a single tensor, such as convolutional filter weights.

My involvement in optimizing large-scale image classification models for embedded devices directly highlighted this limitation.  Early attempts using `QATAllValuesQuantizer` without modification resulted in unacceptable accuracy drop-offs compared to models quantized using per-channel techniques.  This prompted a thorough investigation into alternative strategies, leading to the implementation and testing of the three methods described below.

**1.  Per-channel Quantization via Custom Quantizers:**

The most effective solution, though demanding more development effort, involves implementing a custom quantizer that extends the functionality of TensorFlow's base quantizer classes. This grants complete control over the quantization process, allowing for the application of independent scaling factors and zero-points to each channel (or other specified dimension) of a tensor.  This necessitates a deep understanding of TensorFlow's quantization APIs and the underlying quantization algorithms.

Here's a code example demonstrating a custom per-channel quantizer for weight tensors in a convolutional layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class PerChannelWeightQuantizer(tf.quantization.Quantizer):
    def __init__(self, num_bits=8, per_channel=True):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_bits = num_bits
        self.per_channel = per_channel

    def __call__(self, x):
        if self.per_channel:
            # Assumes x is a weight tensor of shape (output_channels, input_channels, kernel_height, kernel_width)
            mins = tf.reduce_min(x, axis=(1,2,3), keepdims=True)
            maxs = tf.reduce_max(x, axis=(1,2,3), keepdims=True)
            scales = (maxs - mins) / (2**self.num_bits - 1)
            zero_points = tf.cast(mins / scales, tf.int32)
            quantized = tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars(x, mins, maxs, num_bits=self.num_bits)
            return quantized, scales, zero_points
        else:
            # Default per-tensor quantization
            return tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_args(x, min=tf.reduce_min(x), max=tf.reduce_max(x), num_bits=self.num_bits)

# Example usage:
quantizer = PerChannelWeightQuantizer()
weights = tf.random.normal((64, 3, 3, 3)) # Example weight tensor
quantized_weights, scales, zero_points = quantizer(weights)
```

This code snippet demonstrates calculating per-channel minimums and maximums along the output channel dimension.  The scaling factor and zero-point are then calculated independently for each channel, resulting in a per-channel quantized weight tensor.  The `fake_quant_with_min_max_vars` function simulates the quantization process during training.  Note that for inference, you would use the calculated scales and zero-points to perform actual quantization.  This approach offers the highest precision but requires careful management of the scaling factors and zero-points during both training and inference.


**2.  Post-Training Quantization with Per-Channel Tools:**

Leveraging PTQ tools that inherently support per-channel quantization provides a less involved alternative.  These tools typically offer more streamlined interfaces and handle the complexities of per-channel scaling and zero-point calculation automatically.  The trade-off is a loss of control compared to the custom quantizer approach.

Illustrative code using a hypothetical per-channel PTQ tool (assuming such a tool's existence within a library called `my_ptq_lib`):


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from my_ptq_lib import per_channel_quantize

# Load the trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')

# Perform per-channel post-training quantization
quantized_model = per_channel_quantize(model, num_bits=8)
```

This approach bypasses the need for custom quantizer development, reducing the development time significantly.  The specific implementation details depend entirely on the chosen PTQ library, and this is a simplified example.


**3.  Approximation with Per-Tensor Quantization and careful Layer Selection:**

In scenarios where custom quantizers or readily available per-channel PTQ tools are unavailable, a pragmatic approach involves applying per-tensor quantization strategically.  By carefully selecting layers that are less sensitive to quantization inaccuracies and applying per-tensor quantization only to those layers, you can mitigate the performance degradation to some degree.  This usually involves profiling the model to identify layers exhibiting high sensitivity to per-tensor quantization.

A simplified illustrative code snippet (assuming no custom quantizers or specialized PTQ libraries):


```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Load your model) ...

# Identify layers for per-tensor quantization (Example: only quantize less sensitive layers)
layers_to_quantize = [layer for layer in model.layers if layer.name.startswith('dense')] # Example: only dense layers

for layer in layers_to_quantize:
    if hasattr(layer, 'kernel'):
      layer.kernel = tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_args(layer.kernel, min=tf.reduce_min(layer.kernel), max=tf.reduce_max(layer.kernel), num_bits=8)
    if hasattr(layer, 'bias'):
      layer.bias = tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_args(layer.bias, min=tf.reduce_min(layer.bias), max=tf.reduce_max(layer.bias), num_bits=8)

```

This demonstrates selectively applying per-tensor quantization to specific layers deemed less critical for accuracy.  This approach compromises accuracy more than the previous ones but offers a quicker path to a quantized model when other options are unavailable.


**Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow documentation on quantization, particularly the sections on custom quantizers and quantization-aware training.  Advanced topics in quantization theory and its application to deep learning, specifically focusing on per-channel quantization techniques and their impact on model accuracy and performance. Publications covering efficient quantization methods for deep neural networks, including empirical comparisons of various quantization schemes (per-tensor vs. per-channel).  Finally, in-depth guides on model optimization techniques for embedded devices are invaluable for practical implementation and deployment.
