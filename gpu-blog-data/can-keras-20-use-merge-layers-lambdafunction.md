Keras 2.0, while introducing significant architectural changes, retains considerable flexibility in layer manipulation.  The assertion that merge layers, specifically those employing lambda functions or custom functions, are unusable is incorrect.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects during the transition from Keras 1.x to 2.0 highlighted the continued applicability, albeit with nuanced adjustments in syntax and best practices.

**1. Explanation of Merge Layer Functionality in Keras 2.0**

The core functionality of merging layers in Keras 2.0 remains consistent with its predecessor.  The goal – combining the outputs of multiple layers into a single tensor for further processing – is achieved using several methods.  The primary techniques involve using the `concatenate`, `add`, `multiply`, and `average` layers from the `keras.layers` module.  For more intricate merge operations beyond these standard functions, custom functions within a `Lambda` layer continue to be a powerful tool.

It's crucial to understand the expectation of tensor compatibility during merging.  The tensors being merged must have compatible shapes along the concatenation axis (typically the feature dimension).  For example, if merging two layers with shapes (None, 128) and (None, 128), the concatenation will produce a tensor with shape (None, 256) along the default axis (axis= -1).  Discrepancies in other dimensions, such as batch size (None), are automatically handled by Keras.  However, mismatches in the feature dimension will result in a `ValueError`.  Careful consideration of tensor shapes before merge operations is paramount.

The use of lambda functions within `Lambda` layers provides unmatched flexibility for customized merging procedures.  These functions can implement operations not readily available as pre-built layers.  However, it's essential to ensure these custom functions are compatible with TensorFlow's automatic differentiation mechanisms (specifically, the `tf.GradientTape` context) to enable backpropagation during model training.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Concatenation using `concatenate` layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, concatenate

# Define input tensors
input1 = Input(shape=(10,))
input2 = Input(shape=(5,))

# Define dense layers
dense1 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(input1)
dense2 = Dense(32, activation='relu')(input2)

# Concatenate layers
merged = concatenate([dense1, dense2])

# Output layer
output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged)

# Create model
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input1, input2], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

#Example training data (replace with your actual data)
x1_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
x2_train = tf.random.normal((100, 5))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((100, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)

model.fit([x1_train, x2_train], y_train, epochs=10)

```

This example showcases the straightforward use of the `concatenate` layer to merge the outputs of two dense layers.  The inputs are defined as separate input tensors, highlighting Keras's ability to handle multi-input models.

**Example 2: Element-wise addition using `add` layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, add

# Define input tensor
input_tensor = Input(shape=(10,))

# Define two dense layers with the same output shape
dense1 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
dense2 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_tensor)

# Add the layers element-wise
merged = add([dense1, dense2])

# Output layer
output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged)

# Create and compile model (similar to Example 1)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Example training data (replace with your actual data)
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((100, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

```

This example demonstrates merging using the `add` layer.  Note that both dense layers must produce tensors of identical shape for this operation to succeed.

**Example 3: Custom Merge with `Lambda` Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Lambda

# Define input tensors
input1 = Input(shape=(10,))
input2 = Input(shape=(5,))

# Define dense layers
dense1 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(input1)
dense2 = Dense(32, activation='relu')(input2)

# Custom merge function
def custom_merge(tensors):
    x, y = tensors
    return tf.concat([x, y * 2], axis=-1) # Example custom merge operation

# Apply custom merge using Lambda layer
merged = Lambda(custom_merge)([dense1, dense2])

# Output layer
output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged)

# Create and compile model (similar to Example 1)
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input1, input2], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Example training data (replace with your actual data)
x1_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
x2_train = tf.random.normal((100, 5))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((100, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)

model.fit([x1_train, x2_train], y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example showcases the power of the `Lambda` layer for customized merging.  The `custom_merge` function performs a weighted concatenation, doubling the values from the second tensor before merging.  This exemplifies the flexibility of integrating arbitrary tensor operations into your Keras model.  Ensure that the custom function is compatible with TensorFlow’s automatic differentiation capabilities.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of Keras layer functionalities, consult the official Keras documentation.  The TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on tensor manipulation within the TensorFlow framework, which is essential for crafting robust custom merge operations.  Finally, reviewing advanced deep learning textbooks covering neural network architectures and practical implementation strategies will provide valuable context for designing efficient and effective merge layer strategies.  These resources provide the necessary theoretical background and practical examples needed to tackle complex layer integration challenges.
