Accessing neuron weights and inputs within a neural network is fundamentally dependent on the specific framework and the network's architecture.  My experience working on large-scale sentiment analysis projects using TensorFlow and PyTorch has highlighted the subtle yet crucial differences in how this access is managed.  The core concept revolves around understanding the internal representation of the network as a directed acyclic graph, where weights represent the connections between nodes (neurons) and inputs/outputs are associated with specific layers.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Neural networks, at their core, perform weighted sums of inputs to produce outputs. These weights, typically stored as matrices or tensors, are the parameters learned during the training process.  Obtaining these weights involves accessing the internal state of the network's layers.  Similarly, accessing neuron inputs requires tracing the data flow through the network during the forward pass.  The methods for achieving this are framework-specific, but the underlying principles remain consistent.

In most deep learning frameworks, each layer is an object that contains its weights and biases (often bundled together as a single parameter tensor).  During the forward pass, the layer applies its weights to the input data, producing an output that serves as the input to the subsequent layer.  Therefore, accessing input values typically requires hooking into the forward propagation mechanism either through built-in functionalities or by implementing custom layers.

The complexity of accessing this information increases with network complexity.  In simpler networks with clearly defined layers, accessing weight matrices is straightforward. However, in networks involving complex operations like residual connections, attention mechanisms, or custom layers, dedicated methods might be required.  Furthermore, the methods for weight extraction often differ between training and inference phases.  During training, the weights are being updated dynamically, whereas during inference, the weights are fixed.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate weight and input access in TensorFlow and PyTorch.  I've chosen these frameworks due to their extensive use and diverse applications in my own projects.

**Example 1: TensorFlow/Keras**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple sequential model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Access weights of the first dense layer
weights, biases = model.layers[0].get_weights()
print("Weights of the first layer:\n", weights)
print("Biases of the first layer:\n", biases)

# Accessing intermediate layer outputs requires a custom layer or the use of TensorFlow's functional API.
# Demonstrated below with a functional API approach for a layer named 'intermediate'

# Functional API approach
inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', name='intermediate')(inputs)
outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
model_functional = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

# Access intermediate layer outputs (Note: requires input data)
intermediate_layer_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model_functional.input, outputs=model_functional.get_layer('intermediate').output)
sample_input = tf.random.normal((1,10))
intermediate_output = intermediate_layer_model(sample_input)
print("\nIntermediate layer output:\n", intermediate_output)

```

This example shows how to retrieve weights and biases from a Keras sequential model, and how to retrieve intermediate layer outputs using the functional API and a sample input.


**Example 2: PyTorch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple sequential model
model = nn.Sequential(
  nn.Linear(10, 64),
  nn.ReLU(),
  nn.Linear(64, 10)
)

# Access weights and biases of the first linear layer
weights = model[0].weight.detach().numpy()
biases = model[0].bias.detach().numpy()
print("Weights of the first layer:\n", weights)
print("Biases of the first layer:\n", biases)

# Accessing intermediate layer outputs requires hooking into the forward pass
# Demonstrated here using a forward hook

def get_activation(name):
    def hook(model, input, output):
        activation[name] = output.detach()
    return hook

activation = {}
model[0].register_forward_hook(get_activation('layer1'))

sample_input = torch.randn(1,10)
output = model(sample_input)
print("\nIntermediate layer output:\n", activation['layer1'])
```

This PyTorch example demonstrates retrieving weights and biases and accessing intermediate layer activations using forward hooks.  Note that `.detach()` is used to prevent gradients from being computed on the extracted weights.


**Example 3:  Handling Complex Architectures**

For more complex architectures, such as those with residual connections or attention mechanisms, direct weight access may not be sufficient.  In such cases, custom layers or hooks provide more granular control.  For example, within a transformer architecture, extracting attention weights might require specific hooks within the attention mechanism itself.  Consider this conceptual outline:

```python
#Illustrative (not runnable)
class CustomAttentionLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        super().__init__()
        # ... layer components ...

    def forward(self, query, key, value):
        # ... attention computation ...
        self.attention_weights = attention_weights # Store attention weights for later access
        return output

    def get_attention_weights(self):
        return self.attention_weights

# ... within the main model ...
attention_layer = CustomAttentionLayer(...)
# ... later access the weights ...
attention_weights = attention_layer.get_attention_weights()
```

This illustrates the creation of a custom layer to manage and provide access to internal parameters not directly exposed by the framework.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official documentation for TensorFlow and PyTorch are invaluable resources.  Furthermore,  exploring example code repositories on platforms like GitHub for specific network architectures provides practical insights.  Consider studying the source code of popular model implementations to grasp the nuances of weight and input access.  Finally, researching papers describing specific network architectures will provide valuable context on the internal workings of those models.  These approaches, coupled with a deep understanding of the mathematical foundations of neural networks, are essential to effectively navigate the complexities of accessing internal parameters.
