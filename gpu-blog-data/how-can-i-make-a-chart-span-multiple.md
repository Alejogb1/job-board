A fundamental challenge in data visualization, particularly when dealing with multi-faceted datasets, is presenting related information across several distinct plots while maintaining visual coherence. Concatenated plots, where multiple charts are juxtaposed, often suffer from a lack of continuity. A single chart, intended to span across these individual plots, requires careful manipulation of coordinate systems and plot boundaries. This technique is not universally supported by all charting libraries, so implementations vary. I've found success in several approaches, focusing primarily on libraries offering fine-grained control over plot elements.

The core idea involves defining a shared coordinate space for all concatenated plots. Rather than letting each plot generate its own independent system, we must enforce a single, encompassing coordinate system, then map plot-specific data points to it. This is most achievable when the plotting library provides granular control over axes, transforms, and plot regions. Essentially, we’re manually constructing the illusion of a single, large plot by overlaying portions of its visual representation across smaller, distinct plot instances. This process is often iterative, requiring adjustment of plot margins and offsets to eliminate gaps or overlaps.

The first, and perhaps most straightforward approach, relies on explicit coordinate transformation within the chosen library. Libraries like matplotlib (Python) or its equivalent in other languages often allow access to transform objects, which can map data coordinates to pixel coordinates on the canvas. Here's how I would typically manage this in Python:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y1 = np.sin(x)
y2 = np.cos(x)
y_span = np.sin(x/2) * 2  # Chart data that will span all plots

# Define figure and axes
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5), sharey=True) # sharey ensures consistent Y axes

# Adjust spacing between subplots to reduce gaps
plt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)

# First subplot
axes[0].plot(x, y1, label='sin(x)')
axes[0].set_xlim(0, 3.33) # Split the X range
axes[0].set_xticks([0, 3.33]) # Consistent X axis labels
axes[0].set_ylabel("Y-Axis")  # One y label is enough with sharey

# Second subplot
axes[1].plot(x, y2, label='cos(x)')
axes[1].set_xlim(3.33, 6.66)
axes[1].set_xticks([3.33, 6.66])

# Third subplot
axes[2].plot(x, y1, label='sin(x)')
axes[2].set_xlim(6.66, 10)
axes[2].set_xticks([6.66, 10])

# Plot the spanning chart line, manipulating x coordinates
axes[0].plot(x, y_span, color='red', linestyle='--')
axes[1].plot(x, y_span, color='red', linestyle='--')
axes[2].plot(x, y_span, color='red', linestyle='--')

plt.suptitle("Concatenated Plots with a Spanning Chart")
plt.show()
```

In this example, `plt.subplots` is employed to create three adjacent subplots. Crucially, `sharey=True` is used so all plots share a single y-axis scale. The X-axis limits are carefully split to represent segments of the overarching x domain and the `wspace=0` argument removes the default spacing, giving the appearance of abutting plots. The `y_span` data, which should visually continue across all plots, is plotted separately on each axes, creating the desired spanning effect. Though this approach directly draws the chart segment by segment, it is simpler to comprehend and implement. It avoids relying on complex transform objects.

Another tactic, applicable when plotting timeseries data specifically, is to manipulate the x-axis using datetime formatting. This often avoids manually setting the x-axis for each plot, which can be particularly beneficial with large numbers of concatenated charts. This technique relies on an assumption that the x-axis is a continuous datetime range. This is what I did while visualizing production timeseries:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Generate time-based data
start_date = pd.to_datetime('2024-01-01')
dates = pd.date_range(start_date, periods=100, freq='D')
y1 = np.random.randn(100)
y_span = np.random.rand(100) * 3  # spanning data

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'date': dates, 'y1': y1, 'y_span':y_span})

# Create subplots
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5), sharey=True)
plt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)

# Plot data into different subplots based on datetime ranges
for i, (ax, start, end) in enumerate(zip(axes,
                         [df['date'][0], df['date'][30],df['date'][60]],
                         [df['date'][30], df['date'][60],df['date'][-1]])):
    subset = df[(df['date'] >= start) & (df['date'] <= end)]
    ax.plot(subset['date'], subset['y1'], label=f'y1_{i}')
    ax.xaxis_date() # Automatically formats the x axis using datetime info
    if i > 0:
        ax.set_yticklabels([])  #Remove y labels from all subplots except first
        ax.set_ylabel("")
    ax.set_xlim(start, end) # Set axis boundaries using date ranges

    # Plot the spanning line
    ax.plot(subset['date'], subset['y_span'], color='red', linestyle='--', label="span")
    
plt.suptitle("Timeseries Plots with a Spanning Chart")
plt.show()
```

In this snippet, I generated a `pandas` dataframe with a date column. Iterating through the subplots, I filtered data for each subplot based on date ranges. The `xaxis_date()` function handles the datetime display on the x-axis. Similar to the previous example, the spanning `y_span` data is plotted on each subplot to create the desired effect. This technique works well with time-based data without manually having to set ticks.

A third, more general approach involves creating an overlay plot. In this method, you create all plots within the same figure, and strategically move plot areas with transforms. This is significantly more complex than either of the previous methods, but it’s useful when plotting across different axis types. I have used this method mostly when I had to overlay geospatial or non-linear plots in a concatenated manner. This might look like:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data for different axis scales
x1 = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y1 = np.sin(x1)
x2 = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
y2 = np.exp(x2/3)
x_span = np.linspace(0, 1, 100) # spanning data coordinate

# Create figure and base axes
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))
ax0 = fig.add_subplot(111) # Base axes to hold transform calculations

# Calculate where to draw the other axes
box0 = ax0.get_window_extent().transformed(fig.dpi_scale_trans.inverted())
width, height = box0.width, box0.height
x0,y0 = box0.x0, box0.y0

# Create subplots with varying x-axis scales - Using different x axis scales for different data
ax1 = fig.add_axes([x0, y0, width/3, height])
ax2 = fig.add_axes([x0+width/3, y0, width/3, height])
ax3 = fig.add_axes([x0+2*width/3, y0, width/3, height])

# Plot data
ax1.plot(x1, y1, label='sin(x)')
ax2.plot(x2, y2, label='exp(x/3)')
ax3.plot(x1, y1, label='sin(x)')

# Apply a common transform for x-axis of spanning plot data
min_x, max_x = 0,1 # Minimum and maximum value of our "spanning x axis"
transform = ax0.transData.transform
x1_transformed = transform(np.array([min_x, 1*width/3]))[0] # transformed span coordinates for ax1
x2_transformed = transform(np.array([1*width/3, 2*width/3]))[0] # transformed span coordinates for ax2
x3_transformed = transform(np.array([2*width/3, 1*width]))[0] # transformed span coordinates for ax3
x_transforms = [x1_transformed, x2_transformed, x3_transformed]

# Plot the spanning data segments based on relative x-axis positions
y_span = x_span * 1
ax1.plot(x_span*(x_transforms[0][1]-x_transforms[0][0])+x_transforms[0][0], y_span, color='red', linestyle='--')
ax2.plot(x_span*(x_transforms[1][1]-x_transforms[1][0])+x_transforms[1][0], y_span, color='red', linestyle='--')
ax3.plot(x_span*(x_transforms[2][1]-x_transforms[2][0])+x_transforms[2][0], y_span, color='red', linestyle='--')

# Remove the background axes
ax0.set_axis_off()
ax0.set_xticks([])
ax0.set_yticks([])

plt.suptitle("Overlaid Plots with a Spanning Chart")
plt.show()
```

This method uses the `add_axes` call to create custom-sized subplots. The tricky part is calculating the transforms and correctly mapping the data for the spanning chart. I do that by using a central 'base' axes which transforms the x-coordinates of each individual subplots, before finally using those x axis transform values to manually draw the spanning plot. This approach requires significant calculation and is the most complex, but is the most versatile for complicated axis combinations. It effectively overlays the plot areas, creating a combined plot by individually defining the position of each subplot.

For more in-depth understanding, resources focusing on advanced charting with matplotlib, or similar libraries, are recommended. Books detailing specific plotting libraries often cover axis transforms and coordinate system manipulations. Online documentation provided by the libraries themselves is crucial as well, although real world scenarios might require significant reading between the lines. Finally, exploration of example galleries within these library documentations reveals the possibilities achievable through meticulous configuration. When dealing with custom plotting scenarios, a deep dive into the inner workings of the plotting library is a very worthwhile investment.
