The core distinction between PyTorch's `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_` and `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm` lies in their return value.  While functionally similar in their primary operation – clipping gradients to prevent exploding gradients during training – `clip_grad_norm_` performs the clipping *in-place*, modifying the gradients directly, whereas `clip_grad_norm` returns the *norm* of the clipped gradients, leaving the original gradients unchanged.  This seemingly minor difference has significant implications for code structure and performance, particularly within complex training loops.  I've spent considerable time working on large-scale NLP models, and this nuance frequently arises in optimization strategies.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Both functions aim to mitigate the instability caused by exploding gradients, a common issue in deep learning where gradients become excessively large during backpropagation, leading to numerical instability and hindering training convergence.  They achieve this by scaling down the gradients if their norm exceeds a specified threshold.  The norm is typically calculated using the L2 norm (Euclidean norm). The key difference, as emphasized earlier, resides in their modification of the input tensor holding the gradients.

`clip_grad_norm_` directly alters the gradients within the provided parameter list. This is an in-place operation, meaning it modifies the object itself rather than creating a copy.  Its return value is a scalar representing the total norm of the gradients *before* clipping.  If the norm was already below the threshold, the gradients remain untouched, and the function still returns the norm.  The in-place modification is crucial for memory efficiency, especially when dealing with massive models containing millions or billions of parameters.  The gradients are directly altered, avoiding the memory overhead of creating copies.

In contrast, `clip_grad_norm` returns the total norm of the *clipped* gradients. It creates a new tensor holding the clipped gradients but leaves the original gradients unchanged.  This allows for more flexibility in tracking and analyzing the gradient magnitudes during training.  However, this approach comes at the cost of increased memory consumption, especially when dealing with large models and batches.  One might choose this method if further analysis or manipulation of the clipped gradients is necessary beyond simply applying the clipping.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: `clip_grad_norm_` usage:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Sample model and optimizer (replace with your actual model)
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Sample input and target
input = torch.randn(1, 10)
target = torch.randn(1, 1)

# Forward pass
output = model(input)
loss = nn.MSELoss()(output, target)

# Backward pass
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()

# Clip gradients in-place
total_norm = torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)

# Optimization step
optimizer.step()

print(f"Total norm before clipping: {total_norm}")  #Note: This is the pre-clipping norm
```
This example demonstrates the typical workflow using `clip_grad_norm_`. Notice how the gradients are directly modified; there is no need to re-assign them. The returned value, `total_norm`, represents the L2 norm of the gradients *before* the clipping operation was applied.

**Example 2: `clip_grad_norm` usage:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Sample model and optimizer
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Sample input and target
input = torch.randn(1, 10)
target = torch.randn(1, 1)


# Forward pass
output = model(input)
loss = nn.MSELoss()(output, target)

# Backward pass
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()

# Clip gradients (not in-place)
clipped_norm = torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)

# Optimization step (gradients remain unchanged until assigned)
#You must manually assign the clipped gradients if you need them to be updated
#This example shows the norm of the clipped gradient is returned, but the original parameters are not modified
optimizer.step()

print(f"Total norm of clipped gradients: {clipped_norm}")

```

Here, `clip_grad_norm` returns the norm of the *clipped* gradients. The original gradients in `model.parameters()` remain unchanged. To apply the clipping effect, one would need to explicitly handle the returned clipped gradients—a step absent in the `clip_grad_norm_` example. The memory overhead increases as it requires a new tensor to store these clipped gradients.

**Example 3: Demonstrating the difference:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Linear(10,1)
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(),lr=0.01)

#Large gradients to force clipping
for p in model.parameters():
    p.grad = torch.ones_like(p) * 1000

#In-place clipping
norm_inplace = torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
print(f"In-place clipping norm: {norm_inplace}")
print(f"In-place gradients after clipping: {model.weight.grad.norm()}")

#Non-inplace clipping
norm_no_inplace = torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
print(f"Non-inplace clipping norm: {norm_no_inplace}")
print(f"Non-inplace gradients after clipping: {model.weight.grad.norm()}")
```

This example explicitly shows that  `clip_grad_norm_` alters the gradients in place, while `clip_grad_norm` does not.  The gradient norms are printed both before and after each function call to visibly demonstrate this difference.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest consulting the official PyTorch documentation for detailed explanations and examples of these functions, including parameters and error handling. A comprehensive deep learning textbook covering gradient-based optimization techniques will also be beneficial.  Finally, reviewing research papers on optimization algorithms in deep learning can provide deeper insights into the rationale behind gradient clipping and its variants.  Pay close attention to how authors handle memory management in their implementations.  Analyzing open-source implementations of large-scale deep learning models can also be quite instructive in understanding best practices.
