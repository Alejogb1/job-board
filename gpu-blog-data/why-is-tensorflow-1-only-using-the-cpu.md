TensorFlow 1's exclusive reliance on the CPU stems primarily from a missing or improperly configured CUDA toolkit installation, coupled with a lack of explicit GPU device specification within the TensorFlow session.  During my years working on large-scale image recognition projects, I encountered this issue frequently, particularly when transitioning from development environments to production servers with varying hardware configurations.  The core problem lies in TensorFlow's reliance on external libraries to harness GPU acceleration, and a failure to correctly integrate these necessitates fallback to the CPU.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow 1, unlike its successor TensorFlow 2, doesn't automatically detect and utilize available GPUs.  Its GPU support hinges entirely on the CUDA toolkit, a proprietary software development kit provided by NVIDIA, which allows CUDA-enabled GPUs to be accessed and utilized for parallel computation.  Without a correctly installed and configured CUDA toolkit, TensorFlow 1 will default to CPU execution, even if a compatible NVIDIA GPU is present in the system.

Furthermore, even with a correctly installed CUDA toolkit, explicit code is required to instruct TensorFlow 1 to utilize the GPU.  This involves configuring the TensorFlow session to use a specific GPU device.  If this step is omitted, TensorFlow will again resort to the CPU, regardless of available hardware capabilities. The absence of automatic GPU detection, coupled with the mandatory session configuration, frequently led to confusion amongst developers, myself included, often resulting in performance bottlenecks.

Finally, there are cases where the installed CUDA toolkit version might be incompatible with the installed TensorFlow 1 version.  This version mismatch can lead to silent failures, where TensorFlow 1 appears to run without error but internally only utilizes the CPU. Checking for and addressing these version compatibility issues is a crucial part of troubleshooting CPU-only execution.  Error messages are often unhelpful in pinpointing this specific problem.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Incorrect Configuration (CPU-only Execution)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Creates a TensorFlow session without specifying a device
sess = tf.Session()

# ... subsequent TensorFlow operations ...

sess.close()
```

This code snippet demonstrates a common mistake.  While it appears innocuous, the absence of device specification means TensorFlow 1 will default to the CPU. No error is thrown; the code simply runs slower than expected.  In my early experience, this silent failure was a major source of debugging headaches, as performance analysis was often the only way to identify the root cause.


**Example 2: Correct Configuration (GPU Execution - assuming CUDA is correctly installed and the correct TensorFlow version is used)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Checks for available GPUs.  Necessary to prevent crashes if no GPU is available
if tf.test.is_gpu_available():
    with tf.device('/gpu:0'):  # Specifies the first GPU
        # ... subsequent TensorFlow operations requiring GPU acceleration ...
        a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3], name='a')
        b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2], name='b')
        c = tf.matmul(a, b)
        # ...Further operations...
        with tf.Session() as sess:
            result = sess.run(c)
            print(result)
else:
    print("GPU not found.  Falling back to CPU.")
    # ... TensorFlow operations for CPU execution ...
```

This example showcases the proper method.  The `tf.device('/gpu:0')` context manager explicitly directs TensorFlow operations to the first available GPU (indexed as 0). The `tf.test.is_gpu_available()` check provides a robust way to manage scenarios where a GPU might be unavailable, preventing unexpected errors. This conditional approach significantly improved the stability and portability of my projects.



**Example 3: Handling Multiple GPUs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check for available GPUs.
if tf.test.is_gpu_available():
    num_gpus = len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU'))
    if num_gpus > 1:
        with tf.device('/gpu:1'): # Use the second GPU (index 1)
            # ... Operations for GPU 1 ...
        with tf.device('/gpu:0'): # Use the first GPU (index 0)
            # ... Operations for GPU 0 ...
    else:
        with tf.device('/gpu:0'): # Use the single available GPU
            # ... Operations ...
else:
    print("No GPUs detected.  Falling back to CPU.")
    # ... CPU operations ...
```

This more advanced example demonstrates the ability to handle scenarios with multiple GPUs.  The code first identifies the number of available GPUs and then assigns operations to specific devices using their indices. This approach is crucial for maximizing parallel processing capabilities in resource-intensive applications. I found this to be particularly important when scaling up model training to improve training time.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 1 documentation,  the CUDA toolkit documentation, and a comprehensive guide to GPU programming with CUDA are invaluable resources.  Understanding the intricacies of CUDA memory management, kernel launching, and parallel programming concepts is crucial for effective GPU utilization in TensorFlow 1.  Moreover, exploring resources specific to performance profiling and optimization will help in identifying and rectifying performance bottlenecks.  Furthermore, a robust understanding of linear algebra and the underlying mathematical operations of your TensorFlow model is essential for efficient GPU utilization and optimizing code for parallel computation.  Thorough understanding of these resources is vital for troubleshooting and successfully implementing GPU-accelerated TensorFlow 1 applications.
