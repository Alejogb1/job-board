MySQL's optimizer, while generally robust, can sometimes make choices that appear counterintuitive.  My experience troubleshooting performance issues in large-scale data warehousing projects has shown that the culprit behind index neglect in `JOIN` queries frequently stems from data cardinality, predicate selectivity, and the interaction between the chosen join algorithm and the statistics maintained by the MySQL server.  Simply put, the optimizer isn't always omniscient; it makes estimations based on available data, and those estimations can be inaccurate, leading to suboptimal execution plans.

The core issue lies in the optimizer's cost-based approach.  It analyzes the query, considers available indexes, estimates the cost of using each index (or no index at all), and selects the plan it deems least expensive. This cost estimation depends heavily on the statistics MySQL maintains about table data, specifically the distribution of values in indexed columns.  If these statistics are outdated or inaccurate (perhaps due to a lack of recent `ANALYZE TABLE` operations or significant data modification without subsequent statistics updates), the optimizer's cost calculations can be misleading, causing it to bypass an index that would otherwise dramatically improve performance.

Another frequent contributor is the selectivity of the `JOIN` condition.  If the `WHERE` clause predicates involve columns with low cardinality (meaning a small number of distinct values), the optimizer might determine that a full table scan is faster than using an index.  This is because accessing an index and then performing lookups in the data pages might be more expensive than simply scanning the entire table, particularly for smaller tables where the I/O overhead of index usage outweighs the benefit of reduced data access.

Furthermore, the type of `JOIN` used plays a significant role.  Nested-loop joins, for example, are inherently less efficient for large tables than hash joins or merge joins. If the optimizer chooses a nested-loop join (often due to the estimated cost and data characteristics), index usage becomes less crucial, as it would primarily benefit a different join algorithm.  The choice of join algorithm is again guided by the optimizer's cost estimations based on table statistics and query characteristics.

Let's illustrate this with code examples.  I encountered situations mirroring these issues during a project involving customer order history and product details, where performance degraded unexpectedly after a large data import.


**Example 1: Outdated Statistics Leading to Index Neglect**

```sql
-- Table: orders (order_id INT PRIMARY KEY, customer_id INT, order_date DATE)
-- Table: products (product_id INT PRIMARY KEY, product_name VARCHAR(255))
-- Table: order_items (order_id INT, product_id INT, quantity INT)

-- Query with index on order_items.order_id expected to be used, but isn't due to outdated stats.
SELECT o.order_date, p.product_name
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.customer_id = 12345;

-- Solution:  Update statistics using ANALYZE TABLE.
ANALYZE TABLE orders, order_items, products;
```

In this case, a substantial data import into the `orders` table rendered the existing statistics obsolete. The optimizer, relying on outdated cardinality estimations for `customer_id`, incorrectly predicted that a full table scan would be faster than using the index on `order_items.order_id`.  Updating the statistics with `ANALYZE TABLE` forces the optimizer to recalculate costs based on the updated data distribution.


**Example 2: Low Cardinality in JOIN Condition**

```sql
-- Table: users (user_id INT PRIMARY KEY, user_group INT, username VARCHAR(255))
-- Table: permissions (permission_id INT PRIMARY KEY, user_group INT, permission_name VARCHAR(255))

-- Query where user_group has low cardinality.  Index on permissions.user_group might be ignored.
SELECT u.username, p.permission_name
FROM users u
JOIN permissions p ON u.user_group = p.user_group
WHERE u.user_id = 67890;

--Potential Solution:  Refactor the query to use a different join strategy or improve data distribution.
SELECT u.username, p.permission_name
FROM users u
JOIN (SELECT permission_name FROM permissions WHERE user_group = (SELECT user_group FROM users WHERE user_id = 67890)) p ON 1=1
WHERE u.user_id = 67890;
```

Here, `user_group` might have only a few distinct values.  The optimizer estimates that scanning `permissions` (potentially a smaller table) is cheaper than using an index, even though the `WHERE` clause provides a highly specific filter.  Refactoring might involve subqueries or a different join approach, though the best strategy depends heavily on the table sizes and data distributions.


**Example 3: Nested-Loop Join and Index Ineffectiveness**

```sql
-- Table: large_table (id INT PRIMARY KEY, value INT)
-- Table: small_table (id INT PRIMARY KEY, large_table_id INT)

-- Query where optimizer might choose a nested-loop join, rendering index on large_table.id less effective.
SELECT lt.value
FROM large_table lt
JOIN small_table st ON lt.id = st.large_table_id
WHERE st.id = 1;

--Potential Solution: Force a different join algorithm using hints or rewrite the query to be more efficient for the optimizer.
SELECT lt.value
FROM large_table lt
JOIN small_table st ON lt.id = st.large_table_id
FORCE INDEX (PRIMARY)
WHERE st.id = 1;
```

If `large_table` is extremely large, the optimizer might opt for a nested-loop join, iterating through `large_table` for each row in `small_table`.  While an index on `large_table.id` exists, its benefit is diminished because the index is accessed repeatedly for each row in `small_table`.  Forcing a different join algorithm (using hints, with caution) or rewriting the query could improve performance.


In summary, index neglect in MySQL `JOIN` queries isn't typically due to inherent flaws in the optimizer itself but rather stems from the optimizer's cost-based estimations.  These estimations depend on several factors including data statistics, predicate selectivity, and the chosen join algorithm.  Regularly updating statistics, analyzing data cardinality, and carefully considering the potential impact of various join algorithms are crucial for ensuring that indexes are utilized effectively and that queries execute optimally.  Understanding the explain plan is crucial for debugging specific instances and investigating the optimizer's choices.
