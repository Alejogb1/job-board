TensorFlow's powerful ability to represent complex data transformations within deep neural networks often necessitates a deeper understanding of the internal representations formed during the learning process. Visualizing activations of individual layers provides a valuable mechanism for diagnosing model behavior, understanding feature extraction, and identifying potential bottlenecks or unexpected patterns. I've personally found this especially useful when debugging convolutional networks that seem to underperform on certain image classes.

The core principle revolves around capturing the outputs of specific layers during a forward pass of the network and then converting these numerical tensors into a format conducive to visual interpretation. Essentially, instead of only focusing on the final output of the model (e.g., classification probabilities), we intercept the intermediary calculations performed by each layer. These intermediary outputs are the activations, and understanding their spatial or feature-wise characteristics gives insight into the model’s processing pipeline.

Specifically, for a given input, we define a modified forward pass that saves the output tensors of the layers we are interested in. This requires that these output tensors are accessible during the forward execution. TensorFlow’s model API allows for this, especially with its functional API where layer objects can be retrieved. Once captured, the activations are often represented as images for convolutional layers or histograms/heatmaps for fully connected layers. In practice, I often use matplotlib for creating the visualizations and then typically arrange these visualizations into a grid for easier inspection across multiple layers and feature maps.

For instance, in convolutional layers, an activation tensor with shape `[batch_size, height, width, num_filters]` can be visualized by selecting a particular instance from the batch and a specific filter index. The resulting `height x width` tensor will then represent the activation map for that filter in the given input. The values in this map represent the strength of filter activation at different spatial locations in the input. A strong positive value might indicate the presence of a specific pattern, whereas a negative value would indicate its absence. These maps, when displayed as images, often reveal what parts of an input image are activating particular filters within the network.

The interpretation of activations in fully connected layers requires a different approach. Since these layers do not have spatial dimensions, the activation tensors, typically having the shape `[batch_size, num_units]`, represent the strength of activation across individual units within the layer. Visualizations typically include histograms of these activations or heatmaps when comparing across multiple inputs or even units. This gives a perspective on the value distribution of the neuron or across several neurons.

Furthermore, there is an important distinction between visualizing activations of convolutional layers and fully connected layers due to the nature of their processing. Convolutional layer activations correspond to spatial patterns, allowing for feature map visualization, while fully connected layer activations are vectors representing transformed features which don't lend themselves to similar map visualization.

Let's consider a few code examples to illustrate the process of visualizing activations in TensorFlow. Assume we have a pre-trained image classification model, `model`, and we are trying to extract activations of `layer_name`.

**Example 1: Visualizing Convolutional Layer Activations (Single Feature Map)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def visualize_conv_activation(model, layer_name, input_img, feature_map_index):
  """Visualizes a single feature map of a convolutional layer."""
  intermediate_layer_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input,
                                            outputs=model.get_layer(layer_name).output)
  
  activations = intermediate_layer_model.predict(np.expand_dims(input_img, axis=0))
  activations = np.squeeze(activations) # remove batch dimension

  feature_map = activations[:, :, feature_map_index] # Select a feature map
  plt.imshow(feature_map, cmap='viridis')
  plt.title(f'Activation Map - Layer: {layer_name}, Filter: {feature_map_index}')
  plt.show()

# Assume model and input image are already defined.
# For instance, model could be an instance of tf.keras.applications.vgg16.VGG16
# and input_img can be an image loaded using tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img()
# Example Usage:
# visualize_conv_activation(model, 'block3_conv2', input_image, 10)

```

This code snippet shows how to extract the output of the layer named `layer_name` by creating a new model `intermediate_layer_model`. It then uses `predict` on the input image to generate the activations and visualizes a selected feature map. The usage is commented out since you need to ensure that the `model` and `input_image` variables are properly set with a valid TensorFlow model and an input image in the proper tensor format before this function can be used.

**Example 2: Visualizing Convolutional Layer Activations (Grid of Feature Maps)**

```python
def visualize_conv_grid_activation(model, layer_name, input_img, num_maps=8):
  """Visualizes a grid of feature maps from a convolutional layer."""
  intermediate_layer_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input,
                                            outputs=model.get_layer(layer_name).output)
  activations = intermediate_layer_model.predict(np.expand_dims(input_img, axis=0))
  activations = np.squeeze(activations)

  num_filters = activations.shape[-1]
  num_maps = min(num_maps, num_filters) # Limit to actual number of filters

  cols = int(np.ceil(np.sqrt(num_maps)))
  rows = int(np.ceil(num_maps / cols))

  fig, axes = plt.subplots(rows, cols, figsize=(10, 10))
  axes = axes.flatten()  # flatten axes for easier iteration
  
  for i in range(num_maps):
     feature_map = activations[:, :, i]
     axes[i].imshow(feature_map, cmap='viridis')
     axes[i].axis('off') # remove axis ticks
     axes[i].set_title(f'Filter {i}')
  
  for j in range(num_maps, rows * cols): # hide unused axes
    axes[j].axis('off')

  plt.suptitle(f"Activation Maps - Layer: {layer_name}", fontsize=16)
  plt.tight_layout()
  plt.show()

# Example Usage:
# visualize_conv_grid_activation(model, 'block4_conv2', input_image, num_maps=16)

```

This function extends the previous one by visualizing a grid of feature maps. This helps visualize how different filters in a given layer respond to a specific input and gives an overall intuition regarding the various representations learned by the network. As with Example 1, the model and image are expected to be loaded before calling this function.

**Example 3: Visualizing Fully Connected Layer Activations**

```python
def visualize_fc_activations(model, layer_name, input_img):
    """Visualizes the activations of a fully connected layer as a histogram."""
    intermediate_layer_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model.input,
                                             outputs=model.get_layer(layer_name).output)
    
    activations = intermediate_layer_model.predict(np.expand_dims(input_img, axis=0))
    activations = np.squeeze(activations)

    plt.hist(activations, bins=50)
    plt.xlabel("Activation Values")
    plt.ylabel("Frequency")
    plt.title(f"Activation Histogram - Layer: {layer_name}")
    plt.show()

# Example usage:
# visualize_fc_activations(model, 'fc1', input_image)
```

This final snippet focuses on visualizing the outputs of a fully connected layer. Unlike the convolutional examples, here, I chose to display the activations in a histogram to show the distribution of values across all the neurons for the selected input image. The input tensor must be a valid input for the model and must be available before the function is called.

These three code snippets provide fundamental methods to observe how activations in various layer types behave. Adjusting parameters such as `num_maps`, number of bins in the histogram, or even changing the colormap for different visualizations allows you to extract maximum meaning from the obtained results.

For further exploration into techniques related to visualizing neural network behavior, I recommend consulting materials on network interpretability and feature visualization. Books on deep learning theory, specifically those covering topics like feature extraction and the role of intermediate layers, can offer a theoretical perspective. Furthermore, exploring documentation of libraries providing visualization support like matplotlib is crucial. Finally, research papers dedicated to techniques such as gradient-based visualization offer alternative methodologies for understanding what features in the input drive network behavior, complementing the activation-based approach described in this response.
