Java performance optimization is a multifaceted endeavor, often hinging on a deep understanding of the JVM's behavior and the specific characteristics of the application itself.  My experience optimizing high-throughput trading applications has revealed that premature optimization is a significant pitfall, and a robust profiling strategy is paramount before embarking on any code changes. Focusing on algorithmic complexity and data structures before micro-optimizations consistently yields the most significant performance gains.

**1. Algorithmic Complexity and Data Structures:**

The foundation of efficient Java code lies in choosing the right algorithms and data structures.  A poorly chosen algorithm, even with highly optimized code, will always be outperformed by a better algorithm with less-optimized code.  For instance, using a linear search on a large dataset will be considerably slower than using a binary search on a sorted dataset.  Similarly, selecting appropriate data structures—like `HashMap` for fast lookups or `TreeMap` for sorted data—can dramatically improve performance.  I've observed, in my work on low-latency systems, that neglecting this fundamental principle often leads to unacceptable performance bottlenecks.  Focusing on the big O notation of algorithms (e.g., O(n), O(log n), O(n^2)) is crucial in this initial assessment phase.

**2. Effective Use of Java Collections Framework:**

The Java Collections Framework provides a rich set of data structures, but understanding their characteristics is crucial.  For instance, while `ArrayList` offers convenient dynamic resizing, `LinkedList` might be more efficient for frequent insertions and deletions in the middle of the list.  Similarly, `HashMap` provides O(1) average-case lookup time, while `HashSet` offers fast membership checking.  Misusing these structures can significantly impact performance.  I once encountered a performance issue in a project where an `ArrayList` was used for frequent insertions at the beginning of the list, causing frequent array copying and significant performance degradation.  Switching to a `LinkedList` resolved this issue immediately.

**3. JVM Tuning and Garbage Collection:**

The Java Virtual Machine's (JVM) configuration and garbage collection (GC) strategy profoundly influence application performance. Different GC algorithms (Serial, Parallel, CMS, G1GC, ZGC) are optimized for different workloads.  Selecting the appropriate GC algorithm requires careful consideration of the application's memory usage patterns and throughput requirements.  I have extensively experimented with various GC algorithms, and my experience indicates that the G1GC often provides a good balance between throughput and pause times for many server-side applications.  Furthermore, JVM parameters, such as heap size (`-Xmx`, `-Xms`), can be tuned to optimize memory usage and reduce GC overhead.  Profiling tools are essential in identifying appropriate settings. Improperly configured heap sizes can lead to frequent and prolonged garbage collection pauses, severely impacting responsiveness.

**4. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Inefficient String Concatenation:**

```java
// Inefficient String concatenation using '+' operator
String result = "";
for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
    result += i;
}
```

This code creates numerous temporary String objects during each iteration, resulting in significant overhead.  The `StringBuilder` class provides a much more efficient approach:

```java
// Efficient String concatenation using StringBuilder
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
    sb.append(i);
}
String result = sb.toString();
```

`StringBuilder` avoids the creation of intermediate objects, greatly improving performance.  This simple change dramatically reduced execution time in a string processing module I was working on.


**Example 2:  Unnecessary Object Creation:**

```java
// Inefficient object creation within a loop
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
    list.add(new Integer(i));  //Creates new Integer objects repeatedly
}
```

Repeated object creation inside a loop is inefficient.  Autoboxing allows implicit conversion between primitives and their wrapper classes, but excessive use can lead to performance issues.  A better approach leverages `Integer`'s `valueOf` method which may reuse existing `Integer` objects for values in a specific range.  Further, using primitives directly within the loop further minimizes overhead:


```java
// More efficient approach using primitives and Integer.valueOf
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
    list.add(Integer.valueOf(i));
}
// Or even better using primitive int and converting only when needed:
List<Integer> list2 = new ArrayList<>();
int[] array = new int[100000]; // Use a primitive array for faster processing
for(int i = 0; i< 100000; i++){
    array[i] = i;
}
for (int val : array) list2.add(val);

```

This optimized version minimizes object creation, thus improving overall performance.  The third variation showcases the efficiency gain from utilizing primitive data types until a conversion to Integer objects is strictly required.


**Example 3:  Inefficient Array Copying:**

```java
// Inefficient array copying using System.arraycopy
int[] sourceArray = new int[100000];
int[] destinationArray = new int[100000];
System.arraycopy(sourceArray, 0, destinationArray, 0, 100000);
```

While `System.arraycopy` is generally efficient, using `Arrays.copyOf` offers more concise code and comparable performance:

```java
// More efficient array copying using Arrays.copyOf
int[] sourceArray = new int[100000];
int[] destinationArray = Arrays.copyOf(sourceArray, 100000);
```

This approach simplifies code and avoids potential errors associated with manual array copying. This is a subtle but important difference I've frequently observed.  The readability improvement alone is often beneficial.

**5. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding, consult the official Java documentation, specifically sections on the Collections Framework and the JVM.  Thorough exploration of performance tuning guides and best practices for different GC algorithms is crucial.  Investing time in learning advanced profiling techniques and tools will significantly improve your ability to identify and address performance bottlenecks.  Studying the source code of high-performance Java libraries can provide invaluable insights into efficient coding practices.  Finally, understanding concurrency and thread management is vital in optimizing multithreaded applications.
