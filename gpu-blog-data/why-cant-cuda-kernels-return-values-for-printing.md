CUDA kernels operate within a fundamentally different execution model than typical CPU functions.  This is the core reason why direct return values from a kernel, for the purpose of immediate printing, are not supported.  My experience developing high-performance computing applications using CUDA for over a decade has highlighted the significance of this architectural distinction. Kernels execute concurrently across a multitude of threads within a block, and numerous blocks within a grid. A single `return` statement within a kernel thread would lack the necessary mechanism to consolidate results efficiently back to the host.

The design philosophy of CUDA prioritizes data-parallel operations.  Instead of a single return value, the preferred mechanism involves utilizing shared or global memory to accumulate results generated by individual threads. This aggregate data is then copied back to the host for processing and display. Attempting a direct return would create synchronization bottlenecks and defeat the purpose of parallel processing, negating the performance advantages CUDA offers.  The overhead introduced would far outweigh any convenience.  Consider the implications: thousands, even millions, of threads potentially trying to return simultaneously, competing for access to limited resources on the host.  The resulting contention would severely impact performance.

Let's explore this with concrete examples.  The first example demonstrates a flawed approach that attempts a direct return, highlighting its impracticality.  The second refactors this to leverage shared memory for efficient local aggregation.  The third showcases a global memory approach, suitable for significantly larger datasets.

**Example 1:  Illustrating the Flawed Direct Return Approach**

```c++
__global__ void flawedKernel(int *result) {
  int idx = threadIdx.x;
  int value = idx * 2;  //Example calculation

  // Incorrect: Direct return attempt
  // return value; //This line is invalid in CUDA Kernel code.  It will compile with an error.
  result[idx] = value; //Correct method using device memory.
}

int main() {
  int *d_result;
  int *h_result = new int[1024];

  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_result, 1024 * sizeof(int));
  flawedKernel<<<1, 1024>>>(d_result);
  cudaMemcpy(h_result, d_result, 1024 * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  //Print Results
  for (int i = 0; i < 1024; ++i) {
    printf("Thread %d: %d\n", i, h_result[i]);
  }

  cudaFree(d_result);
  delete[] h_result;
  return 0;
}
```

This example shows the correct way to process data within a kernel and store it in device memory (`d_result`) before transferring it back to the host using `cudaMemcpy`. The commented-out `return` statement highlights the invalid attempt of directly returning a value from the kernel.  Compiling this will result in a compiler error.


**Example 2:  Utilizing Shared Memory for Efficient Aggregation**

```c++
__global__ void sharedMemoryKernel(int *result, int size) {
  __shared__ int shared_result[256]; //Shared memory for local aggregation. Adjust size as needed.

  int idx = threadIdx.x;
  int value = idx * 2;

  shared_result[idx] = value;
  __syncthreads(); //Synchronize threads within the block

  if (idx == 0) {
    for (int i = 1; i < blockDim.x; ++i) {
      shared_result[0] += shared_result[i];
    }
    result[blockIdx.x] = shared_result[0];
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation and similar to Example 1) ...
  int numBlocks = (1024 + 255) / 256;  //Calculate number of blocks to process all threads.
  sharedMemoryKernel<<<numBlocks, 256>>>(d_result, 1024);
  // ... (Memory copy and printing similar to Example 1) ...
  return 0;
}
```

Here, shared memory is used to accumulate results within each block. `__syncthreads()` ensures all threads within a block complete their calculations before the reduction operation begins.  The first thread (index 0) in each block is responsible for summing the values and writing the block's aggregate to global memory. This significantly reduces the amount of data transferred to the host, improving efficiency.


**Example 3:  Direct Global Memory Write for Larger Datasets**

```c++
__global__ void globalMemoryKernel(int *result, int size) {
  int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (idx < size) {
    result[idx] = idx * 2;
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation similar to Example 1) ...
  globalMemoryKernel<<<(1024 + 255)/256, 256>>>(d_result, 1024);
  // ... (Memory copy and printing similar to Example 1) ...
  return 0;
}
```

For larger datasets where the overhead of shared memory management might outweigh its benefits, this example demonstrates a straightforward approach of directly writing results to global memory.  Each thread writes its calculated value to its designated location in `result`. This approach is simpler but involves more data transfer to the host.

The choice between shared and global memory depends on the specific problem size and characteristics.  Shared memory offers faster access but has a limited size per block.  Global memory has a larger capacity but slower access times.

In conclusion, the inability to directly return values from a CUDA kernel for immediate printing stems from the inherent parallel nature of kernel execution.  Efficient data handling through shared or global memory, coupled with appropriate memory transfers to the host, provides the correct methodology for retrieving and presenting results.  The examples provided illustrate these techniques, offering different strategies based on specific needs and dataset size.  Understanding these distinctions is crucial for harnessing the full potential of CUDA for high-performance computing.
