I've encountered several situations where Python generators, despite their elegant nature, were detrimental to code clarity and performance. Specifically, the benefits of lazy evaluation and reduced memory footprint become liabilities when debugging complexity increases significantly, or when data is needed in its entirety.

Fundamentally, Python generators utilize the `yield` keyword to produce a sequence of values, on demand. This contrasts with functions that return a single, complete object. The primary advantages are that generators avoid loading an entire dataset into memory at once, making them ideal for processing large or infinite sequences, and enable data processing to occur sequentially, which can improve performance for tasks where only a subset of data is needed. However, these same characteristics can introduce complications in specific contexts.

One key disadvantage is that generators are single-pass iterators. Once a generator has been exhausted, it cannot be reused without re-instantiation. This is markedly different from list-like structures, which can be iterated over multiple times. Consequently, when data needs to be accessed multiple times during a single program execution, the generator must be re-initialized every time, causing redundant processing. Furthermore, attempting to index or slice a generator directly results in a `TypeError`, because generators lack positional access. Converting a generator to a list or tuple would negate the memory efficiency gains that generator aims to produce.

Another significant issue is debuggability. The lazy nature of generators implies that errors may not surface until much later in the execution flow. Furthermore, inspection of the intermediate state within a generator is less trivial than examining a collection. Tracing back exceptions and understanding intermediate states becomes challenging with more complex generators, particularly those involving other iterator chains. Because generators are computed on demand, stepping through the generator’s execution within a debugger may require multiple steps just to reach a single yield point, thus making debugging more time-consuming.

Finally, certain operations fundamentally require access to the entire dataset, where the lazy evaluation of a generator adds overhead with little to no benefit. Sorting, for example, necessitates the complete sequence; therefore, any attempt to use a generator as the input source of a sorting operation would lead to its complete traversal. The same is true for finding the maximum or minimum value of a series, or other computations that require an exhaustive sweep of the entire data space.

Now, let's consider some examples:

```python
def process_data_generator(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line.strip().split(',')

def process_data_list(filename):
    data = []
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            data.append(line.strip().split(','))
    return data

#Scenario 1: Single pass data processing
#The generator version would be appropriate here as the data will only be used once and doesn't need to be kept in memory.
for row in process_data_generator('large_data.csv'):
    process_row(row)

#Scenario 2: Data needs multiple processing passes
#The list version is appropriate here as the data is required multiple times.
data = process_data_list('large_data.csv')
for row in data:
  process_row_type_a(row)
for row in data:
  process_row_type_b(row)
```

In the first code block, `process_data_generator` demonstrates a typical use case for a generator. The file is read line-by-line, processing each row as it is yielded. The processed data is consumed exactly once. By contrast, `process_data_list` loads the entire file into a Python list before it is returned. This is more memory-intensive and only necessary if multiple passes over data is needed. This choice is appropriate when data needs to be processed multiple times, as illustrated in the second section, where two different functions are applied to each row. In the first scenario, using the list version would result in unnecessary memory usage. In the second scenario using the generator version would require multiple loads from the file, negating the advantages.

```python
def complex_generator():
  yield 1
  try:
      result = some_function() #function that might raise an exception
      yield result
  except ValueError:
      yield None #This exception is being caught, but might make debugging difficult in downstream
  yield 3

# Scenario 3: Debugging a generator involving error handling

for value in complex_generator():
  print(value)
  if value is None:
    print("An error occurred during the creation of a generator value.")
    #This might make debugging a challenge as the source of error in 'some_function' is not surfaced explicitly here.
```

The second code example highlights a debugging challenge common with generators. The `complex_generator` includes a `try...except` block, which catches potential `ValueError` exceptions. When `some_function` raises this, it is handled within the generator by returning `None`, which is then yielded. The issue is that the specific error within `some_function` is not surfaced explicitly during the iteration in the consuming code. This approach is reasonable from the perspective of the generator, but for a consumer, it’s more difficult to trace and pinpoint the origin of the exception. This requires adding extra logging or print statements within the generator. The deferred nature of exception propagation also complicates the process. This is compounded when dealing with complex nested generators.

```python
def generator_from_function(data_source):
    for item in data_source:
       yield item*2

def list_from_function(data_source):
  return [item*2 for item in data_source]

data_sequence = [5, 3, 1, 7, 2]

#Scenario 4: Operation that requires complete sequence
# Using the generator would still work but there is no benefit.
# It may also be less clear
sorted_data_gen = sorted(generator_from_function(data_sequence))

#Using the list comprehension version makes more sense
sorted_data_list = sorted(list_from_function(data_sequence))
```

In the third example, I have demonstrated the inappropriate use of a generator within the context of sorting. Both `generator_from_function` and `list_from_function` perform the same transformation; however, using the output from `generator_from_function` within the `sorted` function negates the benefit of lazy evaluation. The sorting operation necessitates that the entire sequence be loaded. While there are no functional differences in this specific instance, the list comprehension in the second version clearly communicates that all of the data is immediately available and used. Using a generator in such a case may lead to misinterpretation or added complexity for very little benefit.

In summary, these examples illustrate that while generators offer memory efficiency through lazy evaluation, they are not universally appropriate. Situations requiring data reuse, complex error handling within generators, and operations that require the full sequence all suggest that other data structures, such as lists or custom iterator classes, may provide a superior and more easily debugged approach.

For additional information and conceptual clarity, I recommend reviewing resources focused on iterator patterns, lazy evaluation, and the official Python documentation on generators. Books covering advanced Python programming techniques often detail specific usage patterns and limitations of generators. Discussions around design patterns and functional programming can also provide insights into appropriate use.
