The core issue with many failing divide-by-two counters implemented with D flip-flops stems from an improper understanding of the feedback loop and the timing characteristics of the flip-flops themselves.  I've debugged similar problems countless times, often finding the root cause in a seemingly minor misunderstanding of how the clock and data inputs are interacting during transitions. A standard D flip-flop, when used for division, needs a very specific setup: the inverted output (Q-bar) is fed back to the D input. Failing to implement this correctly or misunderstanding the propagation delay can result in an erratic or non-functioning circuit.

Let's analyze what a divide-by-two counter *should* do. It must output a signal that changes its state every two clock cycles of the input. This effectively halves the input frequency. The D flip-flop's behavior is defined by the fact that its Q output takes the value of its D input at the active clock edge (rising edge in the common case).  Therefore, to achieve division, we need to create a feedback mechanism that causes the D input to toggle its value on each clock cycle, so that the Q output toggles its state on every second clock edge. Feeding Q-bar back to D accomplishes precisely this.

Now, let's break down why this might not work. The D flip-flop doesn't respond instantaneously. There's a propagation delay from the clock edge to the change in output Q. This delay is not zero, and it’s critical for this circuit to work reliably. If the feedback path is somehow bypassed or the circuit is not clocked correctly, the counter will not perform as expected.

Here are the common error scenarios that I've observed, accompanied by illustrative code examples:

**Example 1: Missing or Incorrect Feedback Connection**

This is the most prevalent error. The D input must receive the *inverted* output of the flip-flop. An attempt to feed back the direct output Q, or even just floating the D input will result in non-predictable behavior. The following Verilog code demonstrates such an error:

```verilog
module bad_divide_by_two (
    input clk,
    output reg q
);

    reg d;

    always @(posedge clk)
    begin
       d <= q; // Incorrect Feedback
       q <= d;
    end

endmodule
```

In this example, `d <= q` creates a latch instead of the desired toggle behavior, and hence the output `q` will simply copy the current state without toggling correctly. It’s likely that after a small initial setup time the output will be stuck at either zero or one depending on noise conditions. This circuit won't act as a divide-by-two counter, it will probably just be a buffer with a delay of some amount of clock cycles, and will be quite unstable. The critical error is that the *inverted* output is not being used in the feedback loop.

**Example 2: Asynchronous Reset Issues**

Often, a flip-flop has an asynchronous reset input.  This reset must be properly managed; if left floating or toggling at arbitrary times, it can disrupt the counter. Let’s assume a reset input is not properly handled:

```verilog
module divide_by_two_reset_error (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    output reg q
);

    reg d;

    always @(posedge clk)
    begin
       if(!rst) // Incorrect Reset Usage
          q <= 1'b0;
       else
           begin
            d <= ~q;
            q <= d;
           end
    end

endmodule
```

Here, the reset input is active-low. However, the `if(!rst)` statement is inside the clocked `always` block. Although it does reset the counter to zero, the `rst` signal needs to stay stable to be effective. When `rst` signal goes low and high asynchronously during clock edges it will lead to unpredictable states. An asynchronous reset *must* be handled using an `always @(posedge clk or negedge rst)` construct or using the synchronous equivalent. Asynchronous resets are inherently risky to use if not handled properly. If you have issues with an asynchronous reset, try implementing it synchronously.

**Example 3: Race Condition Due to Internal Delays**

Although less common, subtle variations in the propagation delays within the FPGA fabric or ASIC can lead to race conditions. This is most often associated with high-speed designs or using an FPGA tool that was configured improperly for the desired target. While less likely in the basic case, it's worth being aware of. This problem won't be solved directly in a standard Verilog implementation, but might be mitigated using clock-domain-crossing circuits, more conservative synthesis settings, or using a double-synchronized implementation.

```verilog
module divide_by_two_with_internal_delay (
    input clk,
    output reg q
);

    reg d;

    always @(posedge clk)
    begin
        d <= ~q;
        #1 q <= d; // Synthetically added delay (sim only)
    end

endmodule
```

In a real implementation, the delay `#1` would represent some amount of gate delay. In the above example, I've added it to make it explicit. While most synthesis and simulation engines will correctly implement the propagation delay as a function of its physical circuit, the addition of the `#` delay is a simulation artifact. The propagation delay of the flip-flop is already in the simulation.  If these delays are not well understood by your synthesizer tools, or they are particularly large in your implementation, you may see intermittent behavior that appears like a race condition. While this is rarely a problem for a simple divide-by-two counter, it does highlight the complex relationship of physical implementation and design that may lead to problems in more complex circuits.

**Correct Implementation:**

The correct implementation, avoiding the above issues, is relatively straightforward:

```verilog
module correct_divide_by_two (
    input clk,
    output reg q
);

    reg d;

    always @(posedge clk)
    begin
        d <= ~q;
        q <= d;
    end

endmodule
```

In this example, the negated output of the flip-flop is correctly fed back to its input using the variable `d`. During every positive edge of the `clk`, the `q` output will toggle to the opposite state, achieving the desired divide-by-two function.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To improve your understanding of digital logic and Verilog, consider the following resources, which I've found particularly helpful over the years:

1.  **Textbooks on Digital Logic Design:** Any foundational text covering flip-flops, sequential circuits, and clocking principles will be invaluable. Focus on timing diagrams and propagation delays. Look for texts specifically on digital design using VHDL and Verilog.

2.  **FPGA Vendor Documentation:**  Each FPGA manufacturer provides comprehensive documentation on their specific families of devices.  Understanding the behavior of flip-flops and the clocking schemes of your chosen FPGA is crucial for robust designs.

3.  **Online Tutorials and Forums:** Numerous reputable websites and online forums dedicated to hardware description languages and digital design are available. These communities can provide practical advice, alternative implementation strategies, and solutions to common design problems. Focus your search on Verilog-specific content. Pay attention to user with a high reputation, they often have great advice.

4.  **Verilog Language Reference Manuals:** Always keep a current copy of the Verilog language reference manual at hand. It is an invaluable resource for ensuring that code follows the proper syntax and for understanding the full semantics of the language.

In summary, the divide-by-two counter is deceptively simple, and its failure often boils down to a misinterpretation of the D flip-flop’s behavior. Carefully examine the feedback path, ensure proper reset handling, and keep timing considerations in mind for a robust design. It is crucial to simulate the design extensively and test the hardware to make sure that the expected behavior matches the actual observed behavior.
