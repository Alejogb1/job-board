Modifying the internal weights of an LSTM kernel directly after initialization in TensorFlow 2 is generally discouraged due to the potential for destabilizing the learning process. However, there are controlled ways to achieve a similar outcome that allows injecting custom values or influencing the initial kernel configuration. The focus should not be on direct, in-place modification but rather on leveraging the framework’s capabilities for custom weight initialization and manipulation within the model architecture.

My experience, spanning several projects involving sequence modeling for financial time series and NLP, has highlighted the importance of careful weight management. Random initialization is crucial for avoiding symmetry within the network and facilitating effective backpropagation. Simply overwriting weights after they have been initialized will disrupt this process, causing training instability, convergence issues, and potentially nullifying the beneficial effects of random initialization.

Instead of attempting a direct kernel modification, which is not an exposed API, I would focus on techniques such as custom weight initializers or manipulating the input data based on the desired influence. The LSTM cell in TensorFlow 2 manages its internal weights as part of the trainable variables within a layer. These weights are dynamically managed during the training loop, so attempts at direct static modification after initialization won't persist or be recognized by the optimization algorithm. To achieve targeted influences, the solution lies in carefully crafting the initial weights or data transformation logic.

Here’s a more specific breakdown of approaches, illustrated with code examples:

**1. Custom Weight Initialization:**

TensorFlow's `keras.initializers` API provides methods for customizing weight initialization. This is the preferred method to introduce specific biases to the initial kernel state. Instead of manipulating the kernel directly, I can create a custom initializer that incorporates my desired "variable." This "variable" is really a specific value or pattern integrated within a carefully constructed initial weight tensor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class CustomInitializer(tf.keras.initializers.Initializer):
    def __init__(self, custom_value):
        super().__init__()
        self.custom_value = tf.constant(custom_value, dtype=tf.float32)

    def __call__(self, shape, dtype=tf.float32):
        # Initialize with random values using glorot_uniform, for example
        initial_weights = tf.keras.initializers.glorot_uniform()(shape, dtype=dtype)
        
        # Add the custom value to a specific subset of the weights
        # Note: The shape of custom value must conform to portion you want to modify.
        # This example add custom_value to the first element of the first gate's weights.
        num_gates = 4 # LSTM has input, forget, output, and cell gates
        input_size = shape[0]
        
        if shape[1] == input_size * num_gates:
            reshaped_value = tf.reshape(self.custom_value, [1,1])
            initial_weights = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(initial_weights, [[0, 0]], reshaped_value)
        
        return initial_weights


# Define a custom value to influence the initial kernel.
custom_influence = 0.5

# Create a custom initializer with the specific value
custom_init = CustomInitializer(custom_influence)

# Create a basic LSTM Layer using the custom initializer
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, kernel_initializer=custom_init, use_bias=False)

# Build the model with dummy data
input_shape = (None, 10)  # Example sequence length of 10
dummy_input = tf.random.normal((32, 10, 1))  # Batch size of 32
_ = lstm_layer(dummy_input)


#Retrieve the initial kernel weights and confirm that the custom value has been inserted.
initial_kernel_weights = lstm_layer.kernel
print(f"Shape of weights: {initial_kernel_weights.shape}")
print(f"First weight value: {initial_kernel_weights[0, 0].numpy()}") # Print just the modified value

```

This example demonstrates the creation of a `CustomInitializer` which injects a specified constant value into the initial weights, modifying the first kernel weight. This approach avoids direct kernel manipulation while still achieving the desired influence. Note that the specific indices used to insert or influence the kernel weights will depend on how you wish to impact the model’s behavior. The code adds this value at the location `[[0,0]]` of the kernel tensor, which assumes the kernel is the standard weight tensor concatenation of all gates. This insertion point can be adjusted as needed.

**2. Data Transformation Before Input:**

Another technique is to alter the input data prior to it being processed by the LSTM layer. This method effectively modifies the input space in such a way that the subsequent processing by the (unmodified) kernel achieves the desired effect. For instance, if I want to amplify or suppress specific features in the input, I would multiply or add values prior to passing the sequence to the LSTM.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a transformation factor
transformation_factor = tf.constant(2.0, dtype=tf.float32)

# Define the LSTM layer
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64)

# Example input data with a batch size of 32 and sequence length of 10
input_data = tf.random.normal((32, 10, 3))

# Modify a specific feature of the input data (e.g., the last feature)
modified_data = tf.concat([input_data[:,:,:-1], input_data[:,:,-1:] * transformation_factor], axis=2)

# Pass the modified data through the LSTM layer
output = lstm_layer(modified_data)

print(f"Shape of the original data {input_data.shape}")
print(f"Shape of the modified data {modified_data.shape}")
print(f"Shape of the output data {output.shape}")
```

This example applies a multiplication factor to the last feature of each input sequence before passing it to the LSTM. The key here is to understand how the modifications to the input will be interpreted by the LSTM and how these transformations influence the learned kernel weights. For complex cases, this method could require careful analysis of the input data and the LSTM’s operational mechanics.

**3. Using Trainable Bias for Initial Influence:**

While directly altering the kernel is not recommended, adding a trainable bias to the output of the LSTM cell can be another means of incorporating a specific influence on the initial state. This does not alter the kernel weights directly but does modify the outputs after the internal computation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf


# Define a bias vector initializer
class ConstantInitializer(tf.keras.initializers.Initializer):
    def __init__(self, initial_bias):
        self.initial_bias = tf.constant(initial_bias, dtype=tf.float32)

    def __call__(self, shape, dtype=tf.float32):
        return tf.fill(shape, self.initial_bias)

# Define a custom bias value to influence the initial state.
initial_bias_val = 0.25
# Create a custom bias initializer
bias_init = ConstantInitializer(initial_bias_val)


# Create an LSTM layer with a custom bias initializer and specify use_bias = True
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, use_bias=True, bias_initializer=bias_init)


# Example input data with a batch size of 32 and sequence length of 10
input_data = tf.random.normal((32, 10, 3))

# Pass the input data through the LSTM layer
output = lstm_layer(input_data)

# Retrieve the trained bias
trained_bias = lstm_layer.bias

print(f"Shape of the output data: {output.shape}")
print(f"Initial bias values: {lstm_layer.bias.numpy()[0:5]}")

```

This final example shows how to establish an initial bias and demonstrate that it is trainable, by using the `use_bias=True` and a custom initializer on the bias weights. After processing, we check the bias tensor and its shape. This bias will shift the output of the LSTM in the initial forward pass, influencing the subsequent processing by the network.

These approaches provide methods to influence the LSTM's computations by manipulating initial weights using custom initializers, the input data, or trainable bias. They are generally preferable to modifying the kernel directly, ensuring the optimization process within TensorFlow is consistent and the gradient backpropagation is correctly handled.

For further exploration, I recommend examining the official TensorFlow documentation specifically on `tf.keras.layers.LSTM`, the various `tf.keras.initializers` available, and the core principles of weight initialization and backpropagation within recurrent neural networks. Additionally, resources that discuss practical considerations for sequence modeling with TensorFlow and strategies for handling unstable training patterns will be highly valuable. Understanding the theoretical foundations of RNNs and LSTMs will provide the necessary context for more precise weight manipulation.
