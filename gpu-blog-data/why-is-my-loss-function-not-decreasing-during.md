When a neural network's loss function fails to decrease during training, a primary suspect is a learning rate that is either too high, causing the optimization process to oscillate or diverge, or too low, causing minimal updates that prevent significant progress. My experience building a custom image classifier for medical scans highlighted this exact issue; initial training runs showed a consistently stagnant loss despite numerous epochs, which led to an investigation of the training dynamics.

Fundamentally, a loss function is a mathematical representation of the error between the network's predictions and the true labels. During training, the goal is to minimize this error, guiding the network's parameters (weights and biases) towards configurations that yield more accurate predictions. Backpropagation calculates the gradients of the loss function with respect to these parameters, and optimization algorithms like gradient descent utilize these gradients to update the parameters iteratively. If the loss fails to decrease, it suggests a failure or inefficiency in this process.

Several factors contribute to a non-decreasing loss. Incorrect initialization of weights can place the network in a region of the loss landscape that is difficult to escape from, preventing gradient descent from reaching an area with lower loss. Similarly, vanishing or exploding gradients, often encountered in very deep networks, can halt learning as updates to earlier layers become negligible or unstable. The chosen batch size can also play a role. Too small a batch may introduce noise in the gradient estimation, causing erratic updates, while too large a batch might flatten the loss landscape, making it difficult for the optimizer to find the minimum. Data quality is another crucial aspect; if the training data contains noise, errors, or insufficient examples, the network might fail to converge.

Regularization methods like L1 or L2 regularization, designed to prevent overfitting, can also hinder progress if their penalties are too strong, effectively stifling parameter updates and hindering learning. Moreover, if the network's architecture is poorly suited for the task, learning may be impossible, as the model lacks the expressive power to capture underlying patterns in the data. Insufficient training data, as well, can lead to underfitting, causing the model to fail to capture the complexity of the problem, resulting in stagnant loss. Incorrect implementation of the loss function or the backward pass can also lead to incorrect gradients, rendering the parameter updates ineffective.

Let's examine some specific scenarios and how to address them:

**Code Example 1: Impact of Learning Rate:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Dummy Data Creation
X_train = torch.randn(100, 10)
y_train = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))
train_dataset = TensorDataset(X_train, y_train)
train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Simple Model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

# Training Setup
model = SimpleModel()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
# 1. Too High Learning Rate
optimizer_high_lr = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1.0) 
# 2. Too Low Learning Rate
optimizer_low_lr = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.00001)
# 3. Moderate Learning Rate
optimizer_moderate_lr = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

num_epochs = 50

# Training function (for this example it only returns the loss to show progression)
def train_model(model, optimizer, criterion, dataloader):
    losses = []
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for data, labels in dataloader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(data)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
        losses.append(loss.item())
    return losses

# Run Training for all three and print last 10 losses.
print("Too High Learning Rate:")
high_lr_losses = train_model(SimpleModel(), optimizer_high_lr, criterion, train_dataloader)
print(high_lr_losses[-10:])

print("\nToo Low Learning Rate:")
low_lr_losses = train_model(SimpleModel(), optimizer_low_lr, criterion, train_dataloader)
print(low_lr_losses[-10:])

print("\nModerate Learning Rate:")
moderate_lr_losses = train_model(SimpleModel(), optimizer_moderate_lr, criterion, train_dataloader)
print(moderate_lr_losses[-10:])
```

This example uses a simple model and synthetic data to demonstrate the impact of different learning rates on training. The high learning rate causes the loss to fluctuate significantly, while the low learning rate leads to minimal progress. The moderate rate leads to a reasonable progression. The commentary highlights that a poorly tuned learning rate can be a common cause of the problem, and emphasizes the need for careful experimentation to identify an appropriate value. I found this pattern consistently in my projects - careful learning rate tuning is crucial.

**Code Example 2: Impact of Incorrect Weight Initialization:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader
import numpy as np

# Dummy Data
X_train = torch.randn(100, 10)
y_train = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))
train_dataset = TensorDataset(X_train, y_train)
train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Simple Model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, init_type):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)
        if init_type == "zeros":
            nn.init.zeros_(self.fc.weight)
            nn.init.zeros_(self.fc.bias)
        elif init_type == "ones":
            nn.init.ones_(self.fc.weight)
            nn.init.ones_(self.fc.bias)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)


# Training Setup
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam

num_epochs = 50
learning_rate=0.001

# Models with different initializations
model_zeros = SimpleModel("zeros")
model_ones = SimpleModel("ones")
model_normal = SimpleModel("normal")
nn.init.normal_(model_normal.fc.weight, 0, 0.01)
nn.init.normal_(model_normal.fc.bias, 0, 0.01)

# Training function
def train_model(model, optimizer, criterion, dataloader):
    losses = []
    optim = optimizer(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for data, labels in dataloader:
            optim.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(data)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optim.step()
        losses.append(loss.item())
    return losses

print("Zero Initialization:")
zero_losses = train_model(model_zeros, optimizer, criterion, train_dataloader)
print(zero_losses[-10:])

print("\nOnes Initialization:")
ones_losses = train_model(model_ones, optimizer, criterion, train_dataloader)
print(ones_losses[-10:])

print("\nNormal Initialization:")
normal_losses = train_model(model_normal, optimizer, criterion, train_dataloader)
print(normal_losses[-10:])
```

In this example, the model is initialized with different strategies. The 'zeros' initialization leads to minimal learning because all neurons in the linear layer are updating identically, while the ones initialization has the same issue. The normal initialization with small random values performs well. This showcases the critical role of proper weight initialization. During my work, a misconfigured weight initialization led to weeks of debugging, underlining the importance of this factor.

**Code Example 3: Impact of Regularization:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Dummy Data
X_train = torch.randn(100, 10)
y_train = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))
train_dataset = TensorDataset(X_train, y_train)
train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Simple Model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)


# Training Setup
model = SimpleModel()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

num_epochs = 50

def train_model(model, optimizer, criterion, dataloader, l2_lambda):
    losses = []
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for data, labels in dataloader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(data)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            l2_reg = torch.tensor(0.)
            for param in model.parameters():
                l2_reg += torch.norm(param)**2
            loss = loss + l2_lambda*l2_reg
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
        losses.append(loss.item())
    return losses

print("No Regularization:")
no_reg_losses = train_model(model, optimizer, criterion, train_dataloader, 0)
print(no_reg_losses[-10:])

print("\nHigh L2 Regularization:")
high_reg_losses = train_model(SimpleModel(), optimizer, criterion, train_dataloader, 1.0)
print(high_reg_losses[-10:])

print("\nModerate L2 Regularization:")
moderate_reg_losses = train_model(SimpleModel(), optimizer, criterion, train_dataloader, 0.001)
print(moderate_reg_losses[-10:])
```

This example shows that while regularization can help generalization, an overly aggressive regularization term can cause loss stagnation. In the case with L2 regularization of 1.0, the loss does not decrease much, while 0.001 provides a small amount of regularization that does not interfere with the optimization. I have seen scenarios where over-regularization prevented proper learning, demonstrating that the regularization parameter requires careful adjustment.

In summary, a non-decreasing loss function during training is a multifaceted problem that requires careful investigation and adjustment of various components. Effective resolution requires systematically exploring the impact of the learning rate, weight initialization strategies, the suitability of the chosen regularization techniques, network architecture, and data quality.

For further guidance, I recommend exploring resources on optimization techniques in deep learning, particularly focusing on gradient descent variants. Understanding the role of hyperparameter tuning, especially the learning rate, batch size, and regularization strength is crucial. Furthermore, research on the impact of different weight initialization methods and network architectures can be beneficial. Deep Learning textbooks and research papers on gradient-based optimization provide valuable knowledge, along with resources on practical deep learning implementations. Analyzing the learning curves and validating network performance on held-out datasets can also offer important insight.
