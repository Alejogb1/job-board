The core issue with the Keras Normalization layer exhibiting seemingly inconsistent behavior with 1D features stems from its inherent design that optimizes for multi-dimensional data. Specifically, the layer performs normalization *across the feature dimension*, not across the sample dimension. This distinction, often overlooked, is critical for understanding its operation and troubleshooting unexpected outcomes with 1D inputs. My work on various time-series analysis pipelines has repeatedly highlighted this interaction, leading me to implement custom preprocessing steps when a different type of normalization is required.

The Keras Normalization layer, as documented, computes the mean and standard deviation statistics based on the input's *axis 0* during its initial fit. In a scenario involving tabular data with multiple features, axis 0 represents the batch size, and normalization is thus applied to each feature independently across the batch. However, when faced with 1D data (e.g., a single time series), axis 0 still represents the batch size, but now axis 1, which would normally represent the features, no longer exists. Therefore, the statistics are calculated per sample. This leads to the following behavior: during the `adapt` stage, the mean and variance are computed per input in your batch. Then, when the data is normalized by the `call` method, it is normalized against its per-sample learned mean and variance. If you provide a single sample, this sample will be normalized against *itself*.

This behavior is quite different from typical scaling operations applied in preprocessing steps, such as standard scaling applied before feeding data into the model. Those standard scaling operations usually have a mean and variance that are calculated using the *entire* dataset across batches. The Keras Normalization layer expects an axis representing different features and normalizes along that axis. When this axis is absent, it still performs the same operation, but the interpretation is very different. It is important to clarify that this behavior is by design. The design choice is optimized for deep learning models that typically deal with data containing multiple features, where it is important to have each feature normalized individually.

To further elaborate with concrete examples, consider the following scenarios:

**Example 1: Demonstrating Per-Sample Normalization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the Normalization layer
normalizer = tf.keras.layers.Normalization(axis=0) # explicitly set to 0

# Generate synthetic 1D data.
data = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]], dtype=np.float32)

# Adapt the normalizer.
normalizer.adapt(data)

# Apply normalization.
normalized_data = normalizer(data)

print("Original Data:\n", data)
print("\nNormalized Data:\n", normalized_data.numpy())
print("\nLayer mean", normalizer.mean.numpy())
print("Layer variance", normalizer.variance.numpy())
```

In this example, five 1D inputs were passed to the `adapt` function. The `Normalization` layer computed a unique mean and variance for *each individual sample*. When the normalization was applied, each sample was effectively normalized against *itself*. The output is close to zero, due to the very low variance. This is a direct consequence of each sample being considered a single "feature" and being scaled independently. The mean of each sample is the value of that sample, and the variance is the sample's variance (close to zero given the singular nature of the sample).

**Example 2: Illustrating Effect with Uniform Data**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the Normalization layer
normalizer = tf.keras.layers.Normalization(axis=0)

# Create 1D data where each sample has the same value.
data = np.array([[5], [5], [5], [5], [5]], dtype=np.float32)


# Adapt the normalizer
normalizer.adapt(data)

# Apply normalization
normalized_data = normalizer(data)

print("Original Data:\n", data)
print("\nNormalized Data:\n", normalized_data.numpy())
print("\nLayer mean", normalizer.mean.numpy())
print("Layer variance", normalizer.variance.numpy())
```
In this scenario, although all samples in the training data are identical, the `adapt` function calculates the mean and variance for each sample *individually*, resulting in the mean equal to 5 and the variance equal to zero for every sample. As a consequence, the normalized output is nearly zero. This highlights that the normalization is not based on the *global* distribution of the data when the input is one-dimensional. It computes normalization per input data sample.

**Example 3: Correct Usage with Reshaped Data**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the Normalization layer
normalizer = tf.keras.layers.Normalization(axis=-1)

# Create 1D data.
data = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]], dtype=np.float32)

# Adapt the normalizer.
normalizer.adapt(data)

# Apply normalization.
normalized_data = normalizer(data)

print("Original Data:\n", data)
print("\nNormalized Data:\n", normalized_data.numpy())
print("\nLayer mean", normalizer.mean.numpy())
print("Layer variance", normalizer.variance.numpy())
```

In this example, we have reshaped our 1D data as (1,5) using NumPy before providing it as input. This now allows the `Normalization` layer to operate over the 5 "features" present in the sample, which now makes sense as feature normalization. In this case, the normalizer now calculates a single mean and variance per feature within the sample.

To address the behavior observed, one would consider several alternate options, depending on the specific requirement. If the aim is to normalize each sample individually, without any knowledge from previous samples, then the default behavior might be suitable for some rare situations. However, if a standard scaling is needed across the entire dataset and all the samples, one needs to employ alternative scaling preprocessing techniques instead of the Keras `Normalization` layer.

For implementing standard scaling (where all samples contribute to a global mean and variance) before the model, consider preprocessing the data using libraries like scikit-learn which offers `StandardScaler`. For scenarios involving time-series data, a `TimeSeriesScaler` from dedicated time-series libraries would be more suitable. These libraries offer functionalities that allow fitting scalers on the entire dataset and applying the scaling transformation.

Furthermore, consider using custom layers for advanced preprocessing needs. By defining a custom layer that implements the desired normalization behavior, one has finer control over how the normalization is performed and avoids unintended consequences. Using a custom `tf.keras.layers.Layer` is a great approach if a custom normalization is needed.
In summary, the Keras `Normalization` layer's behavior with 1D inputs is not a bug but rather a result of its design, intended to normalize across the feature axis. Understanding this fundamental characteristic is critical for utilizing the layer effectively and for selecting the appropriate preprocessing techniques for your input data. This understanding prevents unexpected results. Always carefully consider the dimensionality and the desired behavior before selecting a normalization method. It's vital to align the preprocessing stage with your data structure and requirements.
