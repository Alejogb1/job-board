The core incompatibility between TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2.2 stems from the fundamental shift in execution model: the transition from a static computational graph in TF1.x to an eager execution paradigm in TF2.2.  This seemingly simple change necessitates significant code restructuring to maintain functionality.  My experience migrating large-scale production models from TF1.x to TF2.x highlighted the critical differences repeatedly, particularly concerning session management, variable handling, and the `tf.compat.v1` module's limitations.

**1.  Explanation of the Incompatibilities**

TensorFlow 1.x relied heavily on the concept of a static computational graph.  Before any computation occurred, the entire graph, representing the sequence of operations, had to be explicitly defined.  This graph was then executed within a `tf.Session()`.  Variables were initialized and managed within this session's lifecycle.  This approach, while potentially leading to optimized execution, presented a rigid structure.

TensorFlow 2.2, conversely, embraces eager execution by default.  Operations are executed immediately as they are encountered, mirroring Python's imperative style.  This dramatically alters the workflow.  The explicit graph construction and session management are largely unnecessary.  Variables are automatically managed, eliminating much of the boilerplate associated with `tf.Session.run()` calls and variable initialization within a session.

The resulting incompatibilities manifest in several key areas:

* **Session Management:** TF1.x code relies heavily on `tf.Session()` for executing the graph.  This is completely absent in TF2.2's eager execution environment.  Attempts to utilize `tf.Session()` in TF2.2 will trigger errors.

* **Variable Handling:**  The way variables are defined, initialized, and accessed differs significantly.  TF1.x requires explicit variable initialization using `tf.global_variables_initializer()` and running this operation within a session.  TF2.2 handles variable initialization automatically, unless specific control is required.

* **Control Flow:**  While TF1.x supported control flow (loops, conditionals) within the static graph, it often demanded more intricate graph construction techniques.  TF2.2's eager execution simplifies control flow, allowing for more straightforward Pythonic code structures.

* **API Changes:** Many functions and APIs were either deprecated or substantially altered between versions.  `tf.contrib` modules, prevalent in TF1.x, were largely removed or replaced in TF2.2.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's examine three illustrative scenarios highlighting the shift:

**Example 1: Simple Linear Regression (TF1.x)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TF1.x style
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 1])
W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))
y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b

loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y - y_true))
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01)
train = optimizer.minimize(loss)

sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

# Training loop (simplified)
for i in range(1000):
    sess.run(train, feed_dict={x: data_x, y_true: data_y})

sess.close()
```

This code defines the graph, initializes variables within a session, and then executes the training loop.  Directly running this in TF2.2 will result in errors due to the absence of `tf.Session()` and the automatic variable initialization handling.

**Example 2:  Simple Linear Regression (TF2.2)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TF2.2 style
x = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([100, 1]))
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1]))
y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b

loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y - y_true))

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(0.01)

for i in range(1000):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = tf.matmul(x, W) + b
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y_true))
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, [W, b])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, [W, b]))
```

This TF2.2 equivalent uses eager execution. Variables are automatically initialized. The `tf.GradientTape()` context manager handles automatic differentiation, streamlining the training process. The `tf.keras.optimizers` API is preferred over the low-level optimizers from TF1.x.  Note the elimination of `tf.Session()` and explicit variable initialization.

**Example 3: Using tf.compat.v1 (Partial Migration)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_v2_behavior() # Important!

# Attempting to use TF1.x constructs within TF2.2 using compat module
x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 1])
W = tf.compat.v1.Variable(tf.zeros([1, 1]))
b = tf.compat.v1.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))
y = tf.matmul(x, W) + b

# ...rest of the TF1.x code using compat...
```

While `tf.compat.v1` provides access to TF1.x functions, relying on this extensively isn't recommended for long-term maintainability.  This approach attempts to bridge the gap but sacrifices the advantages of the TF2.2 execution model.  Furthermore, not all TF1.x functionality is reliably emulated. This approach should only be used for a transitional period during the migration process.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation for both 1.x and 2.x provides comprehensive guides and API references.  Examining the migration guides specifically dedicated to transitioning from TF1.x to TF2.x is crucial.  Exploring tutorials and examples showcasing best practices in TF2.2 is essential for acquiring proficiency in the new execution model.  Books focused on TensorFlow 2.x offer more in-depth explanations and advanced techniques.  Additionally, the TensorFlow community forums and Stack Overflow are invaluable resources for troubleshooting and seeking assistance during the migration process.  Consulting code examples from established open-source projects that have already completed similar migrations can also accelerate the process and showcase effective solutions.
