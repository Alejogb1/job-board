The fundamental issue arises from `pickle`'s inability to serialize objects inherently tied to the execution context, specifically those managed by the `_thread._local` mechanism. These objects, designed to be thread-specific, lack the necessary context when deserialized in a different thread or process. The core problem isn’t with `pickle` itself, but rather with how `_thread._local` manages data, which directly contravenes `pickle`'s requirements for object serialization.

`_thread._local` provides each thread with its own copy of an object, ensuring data isolation and preventing race conditions. This is achieved by associating data with the thread's identifier rather than the object itself. When you instantiate a `_thread._local` object, it initially contains no data. Only when you set an attribute on this instance within a specific thread does data become attached. Critically, this association is ephemeral and tied to the runtime environment of the thread. Serialization tools like `pickle`, however, aim to create a static representation of an object's state that can be restored elsewhere; they essentially demand that an object's data is stored within the object and not derived from its environment. When `pickle.dump()` encounters an object that internally leverages `_thread._local`, it tries to serialize the object’s state which does not contain the per-thread data. Because the association to the thread is not a part of the object's direct state and cannot be serialized, the process fails with a `TypeError`.

The `pickle` module attempts to serialize objects by recursively traversing their attributes. For objects with associated `_thread._local` instances, this often leads to a `TypeError` because `pickle` cannot directly access or store the data residing within the thread's local storage mechanism. The error messages specifically indicate an issue with pickling `_thread._local` instances, as `pickle` cannot extract the relevant thread-specific values. Instead, `pickle` tries to serialize the `_thread._local` object itself and fails because they are neither picklable nor intended to be directly pickled. A common point of confusion is that the `_thread._local` object seems empty to `pickle`, as it stores values per thread and not in the instance itself.

The most common scenario I’ve encountered involved using classes or modules that implicitly rely on `_thread._local`, often within libraries handling asynchronous tasks or managing context-local data like database connections or request-specific information within a web application. The issue manifests when trying to save these context-aware objects for later use, for instance by storing them in a cache or sending them to another process or thread.

Here's a practical example illustrating this:

```python
import threading
import pickle
import _thread

class ThreadLocalData:
    def __init__(self):
        self._local_data = _thread._local()

    def set_data(self, value):
        self._local_data.value = value

    def get_data(self):
        return getattr(self._local_data, 'value', None)


shared_object = ThreadLocalData()

def worker_thread():
    shared_object.set_data("Thread-specific data")
    try:
       pickled_object = pickle.dumps(shared_object) # Raises TypeError
    except TypeError as e:
       print(f"Error: {e}")
    print("Finished thread")
    
thread = threading.Thread(target=worker_thread)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

In this snippet, `ThreadLocalData` uses `_thread._local` to store thread-specific data. When the `pickle.dumps()` line executes within the `worker_thread`, the `TypeError` is raised. `pickle` attempts to serialize `shared_object`, but the `_local_data` attribute points to an instance of `_thread._local`, which is not serializable.

A common misconception is that the `_thread._local` is responsible for creating errors. However, `_thread._local` works as intended, while pickling fails because it does not know how to serialize it. The thread-specific data is not stored within the `_thread._local` instance, but instead is managed by Python's internal thread storage.

A second example might involve the usage of contextvars from Python 3.7:

```python
import contextvars
import pickle

ctx_var = contextvars.ContextVar('my_var')

def worker_function():
  ctx_var.set(123)
  try:
    pickled_context = pickle.dumps(ctx_var) # raises TypeError
  except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

worker_function()
```
Here, we use `contextvars`, which internally manage context-specific data similarly to `_thread._local`. The key observation is that `pickle` has a problem not only with `_thread._local` objects directly, but also with mechanisms which are inherently bound to an execution context. Attempting to pickle the `contextvars.ContextVar` will lead to a very similar error as previously. This underscores the point that it's not the object but its contextual relationship which is problematic for pickle.

Finally, an example where the issue arises as a dependency, which is often a cause of confusion:

```python
import logging
import pickle

logger = logging.getLogger("my_logger")

try:
  pickled_logger = pickle.dumps(logger)  # Raises TypeError
except TypeError as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}")
```
Even though the logging library does not directly use `_thread._local` in an obvious manner, `logging`'s implementation, particularly when dealing with thread-specific handlers, can lead to dependencies that involve `_thread._local`. `pickle` attempts to serialize the logger's internal state, which might include objects that are not picklable. This example highlights that the issue can manifest indirectly through dependencies that use thread-local storage. It reinforces that the error may occur even if you are not directly creating `_thread._local` instances in your code.

Several strategies can be adopted to work around this problem. The most direct approach is to avoid pickling objects that contain or indirectly use `_thread._local` or related context-specific objects. This often entails restructuring your code to store the actual values that are required for serialization in a dedicated structure or moving the pickling operations to contexts where the thread-local storage is not necessary. If data associated with the thread local storage is required, you should explicitly retrieve that data from the thread local object, create a serializable object and then pickle that. Alternatively, consider using alternative serialization libraries that might be better suited for handling context-specific data, although this is typically outside the scope of standard Python use cases.

For those encountering this issue, further resources are available within Python's documentation regarding `pickle`, `_thread`, and `contextvars`. Additionally, studying object serialization techniques and concurrency paradigms will aid in creating applications less susceptible to these kinds of serialization issues. Exploring alternatives like `dill`, which attempts to serialize more Python objects than `pickle`, can be beneficial for use cases that allow this extra dependency. Finally, understanding the principles of object oriented programming and design patterns is critical to avoid creating issues that may require usage of these hard to serialize objects.
