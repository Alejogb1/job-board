Deep neural networks, often characterized by their substantial depth, present unique challenges beyond the typical shallow architectures.  Building models with over 100 layers in TensorFlow requires careful consideration of computational resources, architectural design, and mitigation strategies for vanishing/exploding gradients. Based on my experience developing convolutional architectures for high-resolution image analysis, exceeding 100 layers becomes feasible, even necessary, when tackling highly complex data representations, but it mandates a structured approach.

The first critical element is layer composition. Simply stacking standard convolutional or dense layers will invariably lead to performance degradation due to optimization difficulties. Instead, we need to incorporate specific building blocks that facilitate efficient gradient propagation. Residual connections, introduced in ResNet architectures, are paramount for deep networks. They allow gradients to flow directly through shortcut paths, bypassing several layers, thus mitigating vanishing gradients. Each "residual block" typically consists of a few convolutional layers, often with batch normalization, followed by an addition operation where the input to the block is added to the output, resulting in residual learning. A deep network is therefore not a sequence of purely sequential layers, but more a composition of residual blocks.

Secondly, we need to address memory limitations.  Deep networks, especially those with extensive feature maps, consume significant memory, both during forward and backward passes. To combat this, techniques such as gradient checkpointing can help. Gradient checkpointing trades off computation for memory by only storing intermediate activations for selected layers. During backpropagation, the intermediate activations for non-checkpointed layers are recalculated, allowing us to reduce memory footprint, but at the cost of additional computation time. Furthermore, consider memory-efficient data handling practices such as loading data in batches, optimizing data types (e.g., using `tf.float16` or `tf.bfloat16` where appropriate), and leveraging the performance enhancements available in `tf.data.Dataset`.

Lastly, appropriate initialization and regularization techniques are fundamental.  Poor weight initialization can exacerbate gradient problems early in training.  Using methods like Xavier or He initialization provides a robust starting point by scaling the initial weights based on layer dimensions. Batch normalization is crucial; it not only speeds up training but also contributes to gradient stability by normalizing activations within mini-batches. Regularization techniques, like weight decay, can combat overfitting, particularly when you have a large number of parameters in your deep network. Additionally, implementing dropout at regular intervals can further enhance the model's generalization capabilities. We may also wish to consider techniques like Stochastic Depth, that are designed to improve generalisation.

Here are three code examples demonstrating aspects of building very deep networks in TensorFlow.

**Example 1: Implementation of a Basic Residual Block**

This example showcases how to construct a single residual block within TensorFlow. The structure includes two convolutional layers, batch normalization, ReLU activations, and a shortcut connection.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def residual_block(x, filters, stride=1):
    # First conv layer
    shortcut = x # Save x, for addition.
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size=3, strides=stride, padding='same')(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.ReLU()(x)

    # Second conv layer
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size=3, padding='same')(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(x)

    # Shortcut connection
    if stride != 1 or shortcut.shape[-1] != filters:
        shortcut = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size=1, strides=stride, padding='same')(shortcut)
        shortcut = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(shortcut)

    x = tf.keras.layers.Add()([x, shortcut]) # Addition.
    x = tf.keras.layers.ReLU()(x)
    return x


# Example usage of a single block:
input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(32, 32, 3))
output_tensor = residual_block(input_tensor, filters=64)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs = input_tensor, outputs = output_tensor)
model.summary()
```

The code defines a function `residual_block` that encapsulates the necessary operations for one residual block. If the output of the two convolutions does not have the same shape as the shortcut, a convolutional layer is used on the shortcut to align dimensions. This example can be used as a base for more complex and multiple layers of residual blocks.

**Example 2: Construction of a Deep CNN using Multiple Residual Blocks**

This example demonstrates how to stack multiple residual blocks to form a deeper convolutional neural network. The concept is easily extended to more layers, but weâ€™ll demonstrate a shallow version for clarity. The initial and final layer will be standard conv layers.

```python
def build_deep_cnn(input_shape, num_blocks, filters):
    inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size=7, strides=2, padding='same')(inputs)
    x = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.ReLU()(x)
    
    for i in range(num_blocks):
        x = residual_block(x, filters, stride = 1)
        if i%2 == 1: # Stride is 2 every other block
             x = residual_block(x, filters*2, stride = 2) # Doubling filters at each skip connection.
             filters *= 2

    x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x) # Assuming 10 classes.

    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)
    return model


input_shape = (224, 224, 3)
num_blocks = 8
initial_filters = 64
model = build_deep_cnn(input_shape, num_blocks, initial_filters)
model.summary()
```

The `build_deep_cnn` function constructs the deep network by iteratively calling `residual_block`. A `stride` parameter on selected calls of the residual block reduces the feature map dimensionality, and increases the number of feature channels. A final global average pooling and dense layer complete the architecture, ready for a classification task with 10 classes. You would adjust this output dense layer based on your desired number of classes.

**Example 3: Implementation of Gradient Checkpointing**

This code shows how to integrate gradient checkpointing using `tf.recompute_grad`. This example demonstrates the `recompute_grad` functionality using a simple model, which can easily be replaced with the more complex network above.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.ops import custom_gradient

def custom_layer(x):
    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024)(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.ReLU()(x)
    return x

@custom_gradient
def recompute_grad_layer(x):
  def grad_fn(dy):
    return tf.recompute_grad(custom_layer, x, dy)
  return custom_layer(x), grad_fn
  

def build_checkpointed_model(input_shape, num_blocks):
    inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = inputs

    for _ in range(num_blocks):
        x = recompute_grad_layer(x) # Apply gradient checkpointing

    x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x) # Assuming 10 classes
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)
    return model

input_shape = (2048,)
num_blocks = 10
checkpointed_model = build_checkpointed_model(input_shape, num_blocks)
checkpointed_model.summary()
```

Here, `recompute_grad_layer` uses `tf.recompute_grad` to avoid storing the activations of `custom_layer`. During backpropagation, the `custom_layer` function is recalculated within the backward pass, saving memory. `custom_layer` can be substituted with more complex blocks. Note that gradient checkpointing comes at the cost of additional forward passes during backpropagation, and thus additional compute time.

For further exploration, I recommend investigating the original ResNet paper and its derivatives. Additionally, research articles and books discussing large-scale neural network training, such as those focusing on parallel training techniques, batch normalization, and optimizers will be helpful. Specific textbooks on deep learning architectures and implementation details can provide in-depth practical knowledge. Finally, the TensorFlow documentation itself is a valuable resource for implementation-specific considerations.
