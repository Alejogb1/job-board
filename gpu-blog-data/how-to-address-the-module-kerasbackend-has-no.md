The 'module 'keras.backend' has no attribute 'symbolic'' error, typically encountered when utilizing TensorFlow with Keras, arises primarily from an incompatibility between the specific versions of TensorFlow, Keras, and sometimes, the installation environment. This error signals that the `symbolic` attribute, which was a key component for graph manipulation in older versions of Keras, is no longer available in the backend as it once was. This attribute’s functionality has been incorporated differently, or directly into TensorFlow operations, especially after Keras became integrated within the TensorFlow API. Based on my experience debugging numerous deep learning projects, the underlying issue often stems from outdated code trying to interface with a newer TensorFlow/Keras combination, or occasionally, from a corrupted environment.

To effectively address this error, it's crucial to understand the historical context. Prior to Keras' integration into TensorFlow (typically before TensorFlow 2.0), Keras had its own backend, which could be either TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. The `keras.backend.symbolic` attribute was used to access backend-specific symbolic tensor operations. Post-integration, TensorFlow functions serve these purposes directly. Thus, attempting to utilize `keras.backend.symbolic` when working with modern TensorFlow+Keras is no longer valid.

The primary solution, therefore, is to refactor the code to remove dependency on the deprecated `keras.backend.symbolic` attribute. This usually involves migrating to TensorFlow-native operations, particularly when constructing custom layers or losses. Instead of manipulating Keras’ symbolic tensors, TensorFlow’s built-in tensor API should be utilized. Furthermore, verifying compatible versions of TensorFlow, Keras, and any GPU drivers becomes critical for avoiding such runtime errors.

Let's examine three scenarios with corresponding code examples demonstrating how to navigate this error.

**Scenario 1: Custom Loss Function relying on `keras.backend.symbolic`**

Suppose we had a custom loss function from an older project that was trying to leverage symbolic tensors for internal calculations. The faulty code might look something like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K
from keras.losses import Loss

class CustomLoss(Loss):
    def __init__(self, name='custom_loss'):
        super().__init__(name=name)

    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        y_true_sym = K.symbolic(y_true)
        y_pred_sym = K.symbolic(y_pred)
        # Further operations with symbolic tensors
        return K.mean(K.square(y_true_sym - y_pred_sym))
```

Here, we are explicitly attempting to create symbolic tensor representations using `K.symbolic(y_true)` and `K.symbolic(y_pred)`, which will lead to the attribute error in newer TensorFlow/Keras environments. This is completely unnecessary because TensorFlow tensors already function as symbolic graph elements within a TensorFlow environment. The corrected code removes this problematic symbolic conversion. Instead, it leverages TensorFlow’s native tensor operations directly.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.losses import Loss

class CustomLoss(Loss):
    def __init__(self, name='custom_loss'):
        super().__init__(name=name)

    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        # Use TensorFlow tensor operations directly
        return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))
```

By replacing `K.symbolic` with direct TensorFlow tensor operations (e.g., `tf.reduce_mean`, `tf.square`), this version is now fully compatible and doesn’t rely on any deprecated features. The crucial point here is understanding that modern Keras models, built within TensorFlow, automatically generate computational graphs using TensorFlow tensors. There is no requirement to manually interact with a symbolic representation layer within Keras.

**Scenario 2: Custom Layer with `keras.backend.symbolic` Usage**

A similar issue occurs when constructing custom Keras layers where there is legacy code using symbolic tensors. Observe a situation where a custom layer attempts to modify the internal activations using `keras.backend.symbolic`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K
from keras.layers import Layer

class CustomLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def call(self, inputs):
        inputs_sym = K.symbolic(inputs)
        # Symbolic operations to modify the inputs
        processed_inputs_sym = inputs_sym + 1
        return processed_inputs_sym
```

Again, this generates the "no attribute 'symbolic'" error. The revised code utilizes TensorFlow’s operational capabilities. Note that the need for a variable initialisation has been excluded for conciseness but in a real-world scenario, it should be included.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.layers import Layer

class CustomLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Directly operate on the input tensors
        processed_inputs = inputs + 1
        return processed_inputs
```

This refactoring replaces the `K.symbolic` call and directly increments the input tensors, leveraging TensorFlow operations without introducing redundant symbolic representations. The `call` method operates on regular TensorFlow tensors, seamlessly integrating into the TensorFlow computation graph.

**Scenario 3: Older Custom Callbacks and Utilities**

In some legacy codebases, especially with custom utilities or callbacks, the `keras.backend.symbolic` may have been used to access intermediate tensor values during training, or when modifying the internal graph. For example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras.backend as K
from keras.callbacks import Callback

class CustomCallback(Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
    if logs and 'loss' in logs:
        # Attempting to access symbolic tensor
        symbolic_loss = K.symbolic(logs['loss'])
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Loss (symbolic) = {symbolic_loss}")
```
This will result in the attribute error. Access to metrics and tensor values should be performed using regular TensorFlow operations on the available training context. A corrected example would be:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.callbacks import Callback

class CustomCallback(Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
     if logs and 'loss' in logs:
         loss_value = logs['loss'] # Log is already a numerical value in tensor form
         print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Loss = {loss_value}")
```

Here, the metric values within `logs` are already numerical representations (which are internally computed using TensorFlow), thus, the `K.symbolic` step is completely superfluous and unnecessary. Directly utilizing the existing values is the correct approach.

To prevent the recurrence of this error, meticulous adherence to modern TensorFlow conventions is necessary. Specifically, always utilize the standard TensorFlow tensor APIs for operations within custom layers, loss functions, or other Keras components, instead of expecting to find a `keras.backend.symbolic` function. Regularly check for deprecated APIs and adhere to the TensorFlow documentation.

For further clarification and a better grasp of tensor handling within TensorFlow and Keras, I highly recommend delving into the official TensorFlow documentation and the Keras API reference. Books focusing on advanced deep learning techniques using TensorFlow are also beneficial. Additionally, research blog posts that illustrate how to work with TensorFlow tensors for custom loss functions and layers will help in migrating any older code. Exploring the examples provided in the official TensorFlow GitHub repositories can further clarify any confusion in this area. Focusing on these resources should considerably enhance understanding and reduce the chances of facing this specific error.
