Optimizing neural style transfer, specifically in Keras, often encounters a performance bottleneck due to the iterative nature of the gradient descent process. The Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm, a quasi-Newton method, presents a potentially more efficient alternative to standard gradient descent when optimizing the loss function inherent to style transfer. I've encountered this during my previous work refining high-resolution image generation pipelines, finding that switching optimizers can dramatically affect convergence speed and final output quality.

L-BFGS, unlike methods like Adam or SGD, leverages an approximation of the Hessian matrix to accelerate convergence. This approximation, while not as computationally expensive as computing the full Hessian, still incorporates second-order information, offering a more informed gradient direction than first-order methods. Consequently, fewer iterations may be required to reach a satisfactory solution for the style transfer optimization problem.

In standard neural style transfer, the objective is to minimize a composite loss function comprising two primary components: content loss and style loss. Content loss aims to maintain the semantic essence of the input content image, while style loss captures the artistic features of the style reference image. These losses are typically computed by extracting feature maps from different layers of a pre-trained convolutional neural network, often a VGG architecture, and comparing them between the generated image, the content image, and the style image. The style and content losses are weighted before being summed to create the final composite loss function that is minimized.

The challenge with traditional gradient descent methods is that they primarily use the gradient magnitude to adjust parameters, which can result in oscillations and slow convergence, particularly in highly non-convex loss landscapes, common to style transfer. L-BFGS, however, attempts to anticipate the curvature of the loss landscape to make larger, more targeted parameter adjustments, which should, theoretically, lead to faster convergence.

The applicability of L-BFGS in Keras requires a slight modification to the typical training setup. Keras' `model.fit` method is intended for iterative training using mini-batches, which is not suited for L-BFGS, as L-BFGS typically operates on a full batch. The approach instead is to explicitly use the Keras backpropagation machinery and couple it with the SciPy `minimize` function, which offers L-BFGS implementation. This entails defining a function that computes the composite loss and its gradient, then passing this function along with the initial generated image to the `minimize` function.

Let's illustrate with three code examples. The first sets up the necessary imports, model, and loss functions. It leverages VGG19, widely used for style transfer, and defines functions to calculate content and style losses based on extracted feature maps.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.applications import vgg19
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def load_and_preprocess_image(image_path, target_size):
    img = keras.utils.load_img(image_path, target_size=target_size)
    img = keras.utils.img_to_array(img)
    img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)
    img = vgg19.preprocess_input(img)
    return tf.convert_to_tensor(img, dtype=tf.float32)

def gram_matrix(x):
    x = tf.transpose(x, (2, 0, 1))
    features = tf.reshape(x, (tf.shape(x)[0], -1))
    gram = tf.matmul(features, tf.transpose(features))
    return gram

def content_loss(content_features, generated_features):
    return tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(generated_features - content_features))

def style_loss(style_features, generated_features):
    style_gram = gram_matrix(style_features)
    generated_gram = gram_matrix(generated_features)
    channels = int(style_features.shape[-1])
    size = int(style_features.shape[1] * style_features.shape[2])
    return tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(generated_gram - style_gram)) / (4.0 * (channels**2) * (size**2))


def compute_loss(generated_image, content_image, style_image, model, content_layers, style_layers, content_weight, style_weight):
    model_outputs = model(tf.concat([generated_image, content_image, style_image], axis=0))
    generated_outputs = model_outputs[:1]
    content_outputs = model_outputs[1:2]
    style_outputs = model_outputs[2:]

    total_content_loss = 0.0
    for i, layer in enumerate(content_layers):
         total_content_loss += content_loss(content_outputs[i], generated_outputs[i])
    
    total_style_loss = 0.0
    for i, layer in enumerate(style_layers):
        total_style_loss += style_loss(style_outputs[i], generated_outputs[i])
    
    total_loss = content_weight * total_content_loss + style_weight * total_style_loss
    return total_loss
```

This code defines necessary loss functions along with loading and preprocessing images. The `gram_matrix` function calculates the gram matrix, crucial for style representation. The `compute_loss` function calculates the composite loss from content and style contributions. Crucially, we pass all images through the model in one batch for efficiency.

The second example sets up the Keras VGG19 model, defines content and style layers and then creates a gradient function to supply to scipy.optimize.minimize.

```python
def build_vgg19_model(content_layers, style_layers):
    vgg = vgg19.VGG19(include_top=False, weights='imagenet')
    vgg.trainable = False
    outputs = [vgg.get_layer(name).output for name in content_layers + style_layers]
    model = keras.Model([vgg.input], outputs)
    return model

def compute_gradients_and_loss(generated_image_np, content_image_np, style_image_np, model, content_layers, style_layers, content_weight, style_weight):
   generated_image = tf.convert_to_tensor(generated_image_np.reshape(1,*generated_image_np.shape),dtype=tf.float32)
   with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      tape.watch(generated_image)
      loss = compute_loss(generated_image,content_image_np,style_image_np, model, content_layers, style_layers, content_weight, style_weight)
   
   grads = tape.gradient(loss, generated_image)
   return loss.numpy().astype('float64'), grads.numpy().flatten().astype('float64')


def minimize_with_lbfgs(generated_image_np, content_image_np, style_image_np, model, content_layers, style_layers, content_weight, style_weight, max_iterations):
    loss_and_grad_func = lambda x: compute_gradients_and_loss(x, content_image_np, style_image_np, model, content_layers, style_layers, content_weight, style_weight)
    result = minimize(loss_and_grad_func, generated_image_np.flatten(), method='L-BFGS-B', jac=True, options={'maxiter': max_iterations, 'disp':True})
    
    return result
```

Here we create the VGG19 model and extract its relevant intermediate layers. The `compute_gradients_and_loss` function then computes both the loss value and the gradient, crucial for L-BFGS optimization. We leverage `tf.GradientTape()` for automatic differentiation. Finally, the `minimize_with_lbfgs` function uses scipy `minimize` with the L-BFGS algorithm.

The final example ties it all together by loading the images, defining hyper parameters, performing the optimization and then finally saving the results.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':

    content_path = "content.jpg"
    style_path = "style.jpg"
    
    image_size = (256, 256)

    content_image = load_and_preprocess_image(content_path, image_size)
    style_image = load_and_preprocess_image(style_path, image_size)
    generated_image = tf.random.normal(content_image.shape, mean=0.5, stddev=0.2)
    generated_image_np = generated_image.numpy()

    content_layers = ['block4_conv2']
    style_layers = ['block1_conv1','block2_conv1', 'block3_conv1', 'block4_conv1', 'block5_conv1']

    content_weight = 0.025
    style_weight = 1.0
    max_iterations = 100

    model = build_vgg19_model(content_layers, style_layers)

    result = minimize_with_lbfgs(generated_image_np, content_image, style_image, model, content_layers, style_layers, content_weight, style_weight, max_iterations)

    generated_image_final = result.x.reshape(generated_image.shape)
    generated_image_final = np.clip(generated_image_final, -1, 1) # Ensure within the range
    generated_image_final = (generated_image_final * 127.5 + 127.5) # Reverse pre-processing
    generated_image_final = np.clip(generated_image_final, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8) # Ensure values are correct for image display
    generated_image_final = np.squeeze(generated_image_final, axis=0)

    final_image = keras.utils.array_to_img(generated_image_final)
    final_image.save("result.png")

```

This script loads images, sets content and style layer selections, weights, and optimization parameters, and performs the style transfer optimization using L-BFGS through the scipy `minimize` function.  Finally, the generated image is saved to disk.

While L-BFGS can potentially optimize Keras-based style transfer implementations, several caveats should be noted. Its reliance on a full batch gradient makes it unsuitable for large images due to memory constraints. L-BFGS doesn't natively use GPUs. The initial image plays a significant role, and starting from a noise image often leads to artifacts. The content and style layers, weights, and the number of iterations will need fine-tuning to achieve desirable results. Additionally, due to the second-order information, the `compute_gradients_and_loss` function is typically more computationally expensive per iteration when compared to first-order methods. Despite these caveats, L-BFGS often requires fewer iterations for convergence than the iterative methods typically used in Keras, especially when fine-tuning parameters, therefore optimizing the style transfer process.

For further study on neural style transfer, I recommend examining the original Gatys et al. paper on artistic style transfer for a deeper understanding of the loss functions used. Also, explore the SciPy documentation regarding the L-BFGS algorithm and its usage. Finally, studying general literature on optimization techniques for neural networks can help provide an understanding of the performance difference between first-order and second-order gradient optimization methods.
