LSTM-based encoder-decoder networks, particularly those implemented in TensorFlow 2.x, can exhibit NaN (Not a Number) outputs during training primarily due to numerical instability arising from gradient explosions or vanishing gradients. This issue isn’t inherent to LSTMs themselves, but rather to how their recurrent nature and the surrounding network architecture interact, especially under specific conditions. My experience troubleshooting similar problems in a time series forecasting project revealed that these NaN outputs can stem from a combination of factors, all ultimately impacting the optimization process.

The core mechanism that causes the NaN issue is the computation of the gradient during backpropagation. Gradients are calculated by propagating the error backward through the network layers, including the recurrent connections within the LSTM cells. With repeated multiplications of weight matrices in the recurrent steps, gradients can either exponentially grow or shrink. When gradients become too large (gradient explosion), floating-point numbers overflow, resulting in NaN values. Conversely, vanishing gradients cause updates to the weights to become negligibly small, essentially stalling learning. Specifically, problems with exploding gradients are often exacerbated by improper initialization or learning rates, and can also reveal issues with loss functions themselves.

The encoder-decoder architecture, by its nature, often involves longer sequences than a single LSTM might see in another context, increasing the number of recurrent steps. This makes it more susceptible to these numerical instabilities. The output of an LSTM at each time step is a combination of the previous output and the current input, transformed by weights. Over long sequences, these transformations accumulate, making the gradient path unstable.

The output layer also plays a crucial role. If the activation function in the final layer is unbounded, such as the sigmoid or ReLU used inappropriately, and there are no precautions taken within the architecture, the output can grow to extreme values, leading to overflow and hence NaNs when converted for example into probabilities.

Here are three common scenarios I’ve observed and the corresponding solutions, expressed in TensorFlow 2.x code:

**Example 1: Unstable Learning Rate and Unbounded Activation Function**

In this scenario, the learning rate was set too high, and the final activation function was not a bounded one. This led to the initial output quickly exploding. The relevant parts are shown below:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class Encoder(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units, embedding_dim, vocab_size):
        super(Encoder, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=False, return_state=True)

    def call(self, x):
        embedded_x = self.embedding(x)
        output, state_h, state_c = self.lstm(embedded_x)
        return output, state_h, state_c


class Decoder(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units, embedding_dim, vocab_size):
        super(Decoder, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
        self.fc = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation = 'sigmoid')  #Problematic unbounded activation

    def call(self, x, initial_state):
        embedded_x = self.embedding(x)
        output, state_h, state_c = self.lstm(embedded_x, initial_state=initial_state)
        output = self.fc(output)
        return output, state_h, state_c

#Problematic learning rate setting
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

```

**Commentary:**

The `sigmoid` activation function is unbounded. Even though it can return a number between 0 and 1, it does not prevent very large values from preceding the activation. Coupled with a high learning rate, the gradients tend to increase exponentially and become NaN. The solution here was to switch to a `softmax` activation function in the final dense layer and to also lower the learning rate:

```python
class Decoder(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units, embedding_dim, vocab_size):
        super(Decoder, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
        self.fc = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation = 'softmax') #Fixed with softmax


    def call(self, x, initial_state):
        embedded_x = self.embedding(x)
        output, state_h, state_c = self.lstm(embedded_x, initial_state=initial_state)
        output = self.fc(output)
        return output, state_h, state_c

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001) #Lower learning rate

```

This change stabilizes training. The softmax constrains all of the outputs to sum to 1, preventing them from reaching extremely large values. The reduced learning rate further slows the speed at which gradients can grow during backpropagation, addressing the issue at its root.

**Example 2: Improper Weight Initialization**

In this case, the model utilized a relatively small number of LSTM units. The weights were initialized with the default Glorot uniform initializer. With long sequences this resulted in diminishing gradients initially and thus extremely slow learning. Then, suddenly, with a few very high gradient examples, the loss would abruptly jump and the output would turn NaN.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class Encoder(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units, embedding_dim, vocab_size):
        super(Encoder, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=False, return_state=True)

    def call(self, x):
        embedded_x = self.embedding(x)
        output, state_h, state_c = self.lstm(embedded_x)
        return output, state_h, state_c


class Decoder(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units, embedding_dim, vocab_size):
        super(Decoder, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
        self.fc = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation = 'softmax')

    def call(self, x, initial_state):
        embedded_x = self.embedding(x)
        output, state_h, state_c = self.lstm(embedded_x, initial_state=initial_state)
        output = self.fc(output)
        return output, state_h, state_c


# Problematic initialisation
encoder = Encoder(units=16, embedding_dim=256, vocab_size=1000)
decoder = Decoder(units=16, embedding_dim=256, vocab_size=1000)


# Loss function and optimizer (these were fine)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_object = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
```

**Commentary:**

The default Glorot initialization worked fine in some conditions, but was not optimal. The solution was to utilize a different initialization method, specifically orthogonal initialization which helps to preserve gradients better in the recurrent layers, and also to increase the number of LSTM units. This change is reflected below:

```python
class Encoder(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units, embedding_dim, vocab_size):
        super(Encoder, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=False, return_state=True, kernel_initializer = tf.keras.initializers.Orthogonal()) #changed initializer

    def call(self, x):
        embedded_x = self.embedding(x)
        output, state_h, state_c = self.lstm(embedded_x)
        return output, state_h, state_c

class Decoder(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units, embedding_dim, vocab_size):
        super(Decoder, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=True, return_state=True, kernel_initializer = tf.keras.initializers.Orthogonal()) #changed initializer
        self.fc = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation = 'softmax')

    def call(self, x, initial_state):
        embedded_x = self.embedding(x)
        output, state_h, state_c = self.lstm(embedded_x, initial_state=initial_state)
        output = self.fc(output)
        return output, state_h, state_c


#Fixed intitialization and larger network
encoder = Encoder(units=64, embedding_dim=256, vocab_size=1000)  # Increased units
decoder = Decoder(units=64, embedding_dim=256, vocab_size=1000)  # Increased units
```

This orthogonal initialization technique tends to preserve more information during backpropagation, reducing the chances of vanishing gradients early in training, and thus reducing the probability of extremely high gradients later.

**Example 3: Lengthy Sequences without Gradient Clipping**

In a translation project, I encountered the NaN problem when the sequences were unusually long, often exceeding 100 time steps. The learning rate was appropriately small, the activation function was correct and weights were initialized well, but with these longer sequences, exploding gradients were still occurring. The relevant code is shown:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class Encoder(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units, embedding_dim, vocab_size):
        super(Encoder, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=False, return_state=True, kernel_initializer = tf.keras.initializers.Orthogonal())


    def call(self, x):
        embedded_x = self.embedding(x)
        output, state_h, state_c = self.lstm(embedded_x)
        return output, state_h, state_c


class Decoder(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units, embedding_dim, vocab_size):
        super(Decoder, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=True, return_state=True, kernel_initializer = tf.keras.initializers.Orthogonal())
        self.fc = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation = 'softmax')

    def call(self, x, initial_state):
        embedded_x = self.embedding(x)
        output, state_h, state_c = self.lstm(embedded_x, initial_state=initial_state)
        output = self.fc(output)
        return output, state_h, state_c


optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
```

**Commentary:**

While initializations and learning rates were well-chosen, longer sequences still allowed for extreme gradient propagation. The solution was to implement gradient clipping which forces the magnitude of the gradient to be within a fixed range. The change is illustrated below:

```python
def train_step(input_seq, target_seq, encoder, decoder, optimizer, loss_object):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        enc_output, enc_hidden, enc_cell = encoder(input_seq)
        dec_input = tf.expand_dims( [0] * input_seq.shape[0], axis=1)
        dec_hidden, dec_cell = enc_hidden, enc_cell
        all_logits = []
        for t in range(target_seq.shape[1]):
            logits, dec_hidden, dec_cell = decoder(dec_input, [dec_hidden, dec_cell])
            all_logits.append(logits)
            dec_input = tf.expand_dims(target_seq[:, t], axis=1)
        output_tensor = tf.concat(all_logits, axis = 1)
        loss = loss_object(target_seq, output_tensor)

    variables = encoder.trainable_variables + decoder.trainable_variables
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, variables)

    #Implement Gradient Clipping
    gradients = [tf.clip_by_norm(grad, 5.0) for grad in gradients] #Clip magnitude to 5.0
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, variables))

    return loss

```

By clipping the gradients to a maximum norm of 5.0, the model becomes more stable. This prevents extremely large updates to the weights, allowing for convergence even with lengthy sequences. It should be noted that the choice of the clipping value can be considered a hyperparameter to be optimized for the specific problem.

In summary, the occurrence of NaN values in encoder-decoder LSTM networks using TensorFlow 2.x results from instabilities in the gradient calculation and propagation. This often stems from unsuitable configurations, including improper activation functions, poor initializations, the absence of gradient clipping, and learning rates that are too high. Addressing these issues through careful design, testing, and modification of the network architecture, initialization scheme, and training procedure enables more stable training and accurate outputs. Further guidance can be found in textbooks dedicated to recurrent neural networks and deep learning optimization techniques, as well as online repositories documenting best practices in TensorFlow training.
