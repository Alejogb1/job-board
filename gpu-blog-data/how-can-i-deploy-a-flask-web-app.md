Deployment of a Flask application leveraging TensorFlow on Heroku often encounters slug size limitations due to the significant size of the TensorFlow library. I’ve personally wrestled with this issue across several machine learning projects, learning firsthand that a direct, naive deployment strategy will almost invariably fail. The core challenge lies in minimizing the application's dependency footprint while preserving functionality. Several proven techniques, centering on selective dependency installation, buildpack configuration, and external resource utilization, can mitigate this problem.

The most common culprit for exceeding Heroku’s slug limit is the full TensorFlow library itself. A standard `pip install tensorflow` in a requirements.txt file pulls in a substantial package which includes support for various hardware and software configurations, much of which is superfluous for a basic inference-focused deployment. The first crucial step is to avoid installing the entire package, instead focusing on the specific requirements for our Flask application. For instance, if the model is CPU-based, the GPU-focused libraries included in the full installation are unnecessary bloat.

**Selective Dependency Installation**

Instead of directly specifying `tensorflow` in the `requirements.txt`, I recommend using the TensorFlow lightweight package. For CPU-based inference, I utilize `tensorflow-cpu`. For CPU-based model training, I incorporate `tensorflow` or a compatible version that meets the project’s needs. Crucially, it’s important to avoid including other heavy libraries that you are not actively using. The inclusion of `tensorflow-hub`, while useful, can add substantial weight if you are only running local model inference. I often build my requirements iteratively and assess the package size. 

**Code Example 1: Modified `requirements.txt`**

```
Flask==2.3.2
tensorflow-cpu==2.11.0 # or the specific cpu based version you need
gunicorn==20.1.0
numpy==1.23.5
```

This `requirements.txt` reduces the installed TensorFlow libraries to their bare minimum, significantly shrinking the final slug. Note the explicit pinning of versions for reproducibility and to prevent inadvertent package updates that could unintentionally increase slug size. In my experience, consistent versioning has proven to avoid future deployment headaches.

**Buildpack Management**

Heroku uses buildpacks to precompile application dependencies. The default Python buildpack might not optimize TensorFlow adequately, particularly regarding binary compatibility and resource utilization. I've found that adding a custom buildpack step to clean up cached files can lead to tangible space savings. This involves specifying custom buildpack order and potentially adding a post-compile script. I also recommend using a dedicated Python version buildpack, as this improves build determinism, which is particularly important in larger teams. For example, I specify the specific python version. I have noted that using specific python minor versions can improve compatibility with ML libraries.

**Code Example 2: `heroku-buildpack-order.txt`**

```
heroku/python
https://github.com/jontewks/heroku-buildpack-google-chrome
```

The `heroku-buildpack-order.txt` file ensures that the Python buildpack runs first, followed by a custom buildpack like the example here. This ensures dependencies are installed with correct environment settings before other steps.

It’s important to note that buildpacks can impact dependency resolution and execution. Therefore, experimenting with the order is sometimes needed. Using a `post_compile` script in `setup.sh` could allow me to further clean up unwanted files.

**External Model Storage**

Perhaps the most impactful technique to reduce slug size when deploying a TensorFlow application on Heroku, is to externalize the model weights and architectures. Pre-trained TensorFlow models, particularly large ones, can add tens or hundreds of megabytes to the final slug. I avoid including model files directly within the application repository. Instead, I either store the model files on cloud storage, such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage. During initialization, the Flask application would download the necessary models. I have also used private repositories for storing the weights. This effectively separates the code from large static assets.

**Code Example 3: Model Loading from S3**

```python
import boto3
import tensorflow as tf
import os

def load_model_from_s3(bucket_name, model_key, local_model_path):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    s3.download_file(bucket_name, model_key, local_model_path)
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model(local_model_path)
    return model

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s3_bucket = os.environ.get('S3_BUCKET_NAME')
    s3_model_key = 'my_model/model.h5'  # Key where the model is stored
    local_model_path = 'local_model.h5'

    if not s3_bucket:
        raise ValueError("S3 bucket environment variable not set.")

    try:
        model = load_model_from_s3(s3_bucket, s3_model_key, local_model_path)
        print("Model loaded successfully from S3.")
        # You can now use the 'model' object for inference
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
```

This Python snippet illustrates how to download a model from S3, utilizing environment variables for secure bucket identification. This prevents hardcoding credentials, a key security practice. The model is downloaded once during application startup and cached on the Heroku ephemeral filesystem. It should be noted that the ephemeral file system of Heroku is cleared when the application is restarted, requiring the model to be reloaded. While convenient, you can create another directory within the heroku app, but that needs to be done when you deploy as there is no direct access to the virtual container.

This externalization approach drastically reduces the slug size and makes your deployments more nimble. Furthermore, it allows you to update models without requiring a full application redeployment, providing greater flexibility.

**Resource Recommendations**

For in-depth understanding of Heroku deployment strategies:
* Refer to the official Heroku documentation for Python applications.
* Review buildpack development guidelines from Heroku.
* Examine the TensorFlow installation guides, particularly focusing on lightweight installations.
* Investigate cloud storage provider documentation for secure file storage practices, focusing on credential management and data transfer techniques.

In conclusion, deploying a Flask application with TensorFlow on Heroku within the slug size limit requires thoughtful planning and execution. Employing techniques such as selective package installation, strategic buildpack configuration, and offloading model data are pivotal to achieving successful deployment. Avoid directly using generic, broad installations of libraries like TensorFlow; opt instead for specialized, lean options, specifically `tensorflow-cpu`. The methods I’ve outlined are drawn from multiple projects that I have had personal experience with, and I recommend iterating on these approaches to find the best approach for each deployment scenario. This careful approach is essential to overcome the slug size constraints on Heroku and successfully deploy applications.
