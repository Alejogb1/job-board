Decreasing the time step in a Runge-Kutta solver doesn't guarantee convergence; in fact, it can exacerbate numerical instability, leading to divergence. This is often masked by the initial appearance of improved accuracy, but subtle errors accumulate, ultimately dominating the solution. My experience troubleshooting similar issues in astrophysical simulations – specifically, N-body problems modeling galactic dynamics – has highlighted the crucial role of local error propagation and the inherent limitations of numerical methods in handling stiff systems.

The core issue stems from a misunderstanding of the trade-off between accuracy and stability. While a smaller time step reduces the local truncation error at each step, it simultaneously increases the total number of steps needed to cover a given time interval. The cumulative effect of rounding errors, even minute ones inherent in floating-point arithmetic, becomes significant over many iterations.  This is especially pronounced in stiff systems, characterized by vastly differing timescales influencing the solution.  A small time step might resolve the fast timescale adequately, but it can also amplify the instability arising from the interaction with slower timescales.

Let's clarify this with a clear explanation. Runge-Kutta methods, particularly higher-order variants like the fourth-order method (RK4), are based on approximating the solution's derivative using a weighted average of slopes evaluated at different points within a single time step.  The accuracy improves with higher-order methods, as they incorporate more information about the function's behavior.  However, the inherent assumption is that the function's behavior is smooth and well-behaved within each time step.  If the system is stiff, characterized by rapidly changing solution components, this assumption breaks down.  Even a minuscule time step may not capture the fast variations adequately, leading to accumulated errors that progressively deviate the solution from the true trajectory.

Another contributing factor is the choice of the Runge-Kutta method itself.  While RK4 is popular, it may not be the most suitable for all problems.  Implicit methods, such as implicit Euler or implicit Runge-Kutta methods (IRK), are designed to handle stiff systems more effectively.  They achieve better stability by incorporating information from the future time step into the current step's calculation. This allows them to implicitly account for the rapid changes inherent in stiff systems, reducing the influence of accumulated errors.


Here are three code examples illustrating different scenarios and their implications.  These are written in Python, leveraging the `scipy.integrate` library for convenience.  Remember that these are simplified illustrations; real-world applications often necessitate more sophisticated error control and adaptive step-size techniques.

**Example 1: A Simple, Non-Stiff System (RK4)**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint

def simple_ode(y, t):
    # A simple, non-stiff ODE (e.g., exponential decay)
    return -y

t = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)  # Fine time steps
y0 = 1
sol = odeint(simple_ode, y0, t)

# This will behave well even with very small time steps.
# Accuracy improves as time step decreases.
```

This example demonstrates a simple, non-stiff system where the RK4 method behaves as expected.  Decreasing the time step (increasing the number of points in `np.linspace`) generally improves accuracy with minimal computational overhead.

**Example 2: A Stiff System (Explicit RK4)**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint

def stiff_ode(y, t):
    # A stiff ODE (e.g., involves rapidly decaying and slowly changing components)
    return [-1000*y[0] + 1000*y[1], y[0] - y[1]]

t = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)  # Fine time steps
y0 = [1, 0]
sol = odeint(stiff_ode, y0, t, rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-6)

# Instability might arise here despite small time steps due to stiffness.
# Even with refined tolerances, convergence may not be achieved.
```

Here, we introduce a stiff system, highlighting the potential for instability.  Despite using a fine time step and setting strict relative and absolute tolerances (`rtol` and `atol`), the explicit RK4 method might still struggle to converge or exhibit oscillations due to the inherent stiffness.


**Example 3: A Stiff System (Implicit Method)**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp

def stiff_ode(t, y): # Note the order of arguments
    return [-1000*y[0] + 1000*y[1], y[0] - y[1]]

t_span = (0, 1)
y0 = [1, 0]
sol = solve_ivp(stiff_ode, t_span, y0, method='Radau', dense_output=True)

# Implicit methods like Radau are better suited for stiff systems.
# They usually offer better stability and convergence.
```

This example replaces the explicit RK4 with an implicit method (`Radau`), a type of implicit Runge-Kutta method often well-suited to stiff problems. `solve_ivp` offers a flexible interface for different ODE solvers. The choice of `Radau` (or another implicit method) is crucial for handling the stiffness efficiently.  Note the argument order in the `stiff_ode` function.  `solve_ivp` expects the independent variable first.

In conclusion, the failure of a Runge-Kutta solver to converge as the time step decreases points toward either a stiff system or the cumulative effect of rounding errors. Using explicit methods on stiff systems often leads to oscillations or divergence, even with fine time steps.  Addressing this requires either employing implicit methods or implementing adaptive time-stepping algorithms to dynamically adjust the time step based on local error estimates.  Exploring different methods and understanding the nature of the system being solved is key to selecting the most appropriate numerical approach.  Furthermore, consulting relevant numerical analysis texts and exploring specialized ODE solvers within numerical libraries is strongly recommended.  A deeper understanding of error analysis and numerical stability is essential for successfully tackling complex simulations.
