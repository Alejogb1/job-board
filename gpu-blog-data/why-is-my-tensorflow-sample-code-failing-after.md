The most common reason for TensorFlow sample code failure after seemingly successful installation stems from environment inconsistencies, specifically concerning Python version, package dependencies, and CUDA/cuDNN compatibility if utilizing GPU acceleration.  Over the course of my decade working with TensorFlow across diverse projects – from large-scale image recognition models to real-time anomaly detection systems – I've encountered this issue repeatedly.  The problem rarely lies within the TensorFlow installation itself, but rather in the intricate interplay between TensorFlow and its supporting ecosystem.

Let's systematically address potential causes and solutions.  First, verifying the Python environment's integrity is paramount.  TensorFlow's compatibility with Python versions is explicitly stated in its documentation.  Using a Python version outside the supported range—often a minor version mismatch—frequently results in import errors or runtime exceptions.  This is because TensorFlow's internal workings rely on specific features and behaviors implemented across various Python releases.  A seemingly successful `pip install tensorflow` doesn't guarantee compatibility if the Python interpreter itself is incompatible.  

Second, dependency management plays a critical role. TensorFlow relies on a collection of supporting libraries, such as NumPy, which may have their own version constraints. Conflicting versions – say, an older NumPy incompatible with the installed TensorFlow version – can silently lead to subtle errors that manifest only during runtime.  Furthermore, if you've installed TensorFlow using a package manager like conda, ensuring that all related packages are managed within the same environment is crucial. Mixing pip and conda installations often creates dependency hell, resulting in unpredictable behavior.

Third, GPU acceleration, while beneficial for performance, introduces significant complexity.  If your code is configured for GPU usage but the necessary CUDA toolkit and cuDNN library are absent or improperly configured, TensorFlow will fail to initialize correctly, often resulting in cryptic error messages referencing unavailable GPU resources.  Even if CUDA and cuDNN are installed, version mismatches between these components and TensorFlow can cause instability.  It's essential to consult the official TensorFlow documentation for precise version compatibility requirements.  

Now, let's illustrate these points with code examples.


**Example 1: Python Version Mismatch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
import sys
print(sys.version)
```

This simple code snippet reveals both the TensorFlow version and the Python interpreter's version. This allows for a direct comparison against the officially supported versions documented in the TensorFlow release notes. If a mismatch is detected, consider creating a new, isolated Python environment using `venv` or `conda` specifically tailored to the required Python version, then reinstalling TensorFlow within that environment.


**Example 2: Dependency Conflicts**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
print(tf.__version__)
print(np.__version__)
```

This example checks the versions of TensorFlow and NumPy.  Discrepancies here may indicate dependency issues. In such cases, consider using a requirements.txt file to specify exact package versions, ensuring consistency across different installations and environments:

```
tensorflow==2.10.0
numpy==1.23.5
```

Installing these using `pip install -r requirements.txt` guarantees that the correct versions are installed, minimizing potential conflicts.


**Example 3: GPU Configuration Check (with error handling)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
    gpu_available = True
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error checking GPU availability: {e}")
    gpu_available = False

if gpu_available:
    print("GPU support enabled.")
    # ... Your GPU-intensive TensorFlow code here ...
else:
    print("GPU support disabled.  Falling back to CPU.")
    # ... Your CPU-based TensorFlow code here (or exit gracefully) ...
```

This code attempts to detect available GPUs. If it encounters an error (e.g., CUDA or cuDNN not found), it gracefully handles the exception and proceeds using CPU computation. This approach is crucial for robust code that can adapt to varying hardware configurations without crashing.  Remember to thoroughly check your CUDA and cuDNN installation against the requirements outlined in the TensorFlow documentation for the specific version you are using.  Incorrect versions, even when installed, can lead to subtle runtime errors.


In summary, resolving TensorFlow sample code failures after a seemingly successful installation involves a methodical approach of investigating Python version compatibility, dependency conflicts using a version-controlled approach, and thorough verification of GPU acceleration configurations, including CUDA and cuDNN.  The provided code examples facilitate this diagnostic process.  Furthermore, diligently consulting the official TensorFlow documentation for your specific version is indispensable.  Properly managing the environment, especially when dealing with GPUs, is the key to consistent and reliable TensorFlow execution.  Always remember to carefully examine any error messages presented by the runtime, as these often contain crucial clues to pinpoint the underlying issues. Remember to consult relevant TensorFlow documentation for detailed information on installation, compatibility, and troubleshooting procedures.
