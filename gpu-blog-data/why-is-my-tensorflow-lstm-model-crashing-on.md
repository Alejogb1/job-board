The observed behavior of a TensorFlow LSTM model crashing on the GPU after the first epoch strongly suggests an issue related to memory management or device resource exhaustion, which commonly manifests after the initial forward and backward passes. Initial allocation and graph building happen in the first epoch, and subsequent epochs trigger previously allocated memory regions, making memory leaks or excessive usage more prominent.

My experience, particularly while fine-tuning a sequence-to-sequence model for natural language generation, has repeatedly shown that the memory demands of an LSTM, especially when trained with long sequences or deep architectures, are deceptively high. The initial epoch might run fine due to TensorFlow's on-demand allocation strategy, but subsequent epochs reveal the limitations. The most frequent root causes involve inefficient use of the GPU’s limited memory or improper tensor handling within the model definition itself.

Specifically, I will address several aspects that contribute to this error. First, it’s critical to understand how TensorFlow allocates GPU memory. By default, TensorFlow attempts to claim all available GPU memory. While this is sometimes beneficial for optimal performance when memory constraints are not present, this can lead to Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors, particularly when the model’s memory requirements increase due to the calculations during the training loop.

Secondly, issues can arise from using excessively large mini-batch sizes. Larger batch sizes can initially seem more efficient due to improved GPU utilization but they drastically increase the memory footprint. The gradients computed during backpropagation are particularly memory-intensive. They require storage proportional to the size of the activation tensors generated during the forward pass. When the model is very deep or contains a high number of parameters, this storage requirement multiplies.

A common but less obvious problem lies in how TensorFlow tensors are handled within custom training loops or within the model itself. For instance, the accumulation of intermediary tensors during backpropagation that aren't explicitly cleared can lead to memory leaks, compounding the problem each epoch.  Similarly, creating new tensors within each loop without reusing or clearing previous ones can exhaust available memory. It is crucial to explicitly handle tensor lifetimes, using `tf.Variable` instances where needed rather than creating new tensors on every step.

Furthermore, issues could stem from specific layers within the LSTM network if they use excessive activations or parameters. A large number of LSTM cells or high-dimensional embedding vectors can contribute significantly to GPU memory consumption. Attention mechanisms, especially when dealing with very long sequences, can create significant temporary tensors that consume considerable memory. The interplay of recurrent connections in LSTMs with the backpropagation-through-time algorithm naturally puts substantial strain on GPU resources.

I will now present code examples illustrating these points, along with commentary.

**Example 1: Inefficient Batch Size and Model Complexity**

This example showcases an LSTM model trained on a small dataset with an improperly sized mini-batch and a large number of LSTM units.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Generate synthetic data
num_samples = 1000
seq_len = 50
input_dim = 10
num_classes = 2
x_train = tf.random.normal((num_samples, seq_len, input_dim))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((num_samples,), minval=0, maxval=num_classes, dtype=tf.int32)
y_train = tf.one_hot(y_train, depth=num_classes)

# Model definition with large batch size and LSTM units
batch_size = 512 # This will likely cause problems
lstm_units = 256 # This can be excessive
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(lstm_units, input_shape=(seq_len, input_dim)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Optimizer, loss and training
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
epochs = 2

for epoch in range(epochs):
    print(f"Starting epoch {epoch+1}")
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      logits = model(x_train)
      loss = loss_fn(y_train, logits)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
```

Here, the `batch_size` is significantly large given the dataset's size, and the number of `lstm_units` is also high. While this example will likely run for the first epoch, on a device with limited resources, the combined effect of a large batch and numerous LSTM units will usually cause an out-of-memory error in the second or subsequent epochs. The error usually happens when tensors resulting from the first epoch are still held in GPU memory, while new memory is required to store tensors for the second epoch, and there is insufficient memory to hold both. Reducing batch size and the number of LSTM units can resolve this, at the cost of potential training speed and expressivity respectively.

**Example 2: Unnecessary Tensor Creation in the Loop**

This demonstrates how creating new tensors repeatedly within the training loop can cause memory leaks and crashes over epochs.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Simplified dataset
num_samples = 100
seq_len = 20
input_dim = 5
num_classes = 2
x_train = tf.random.normal((num_samples, seq_len, input_dim))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((num_samples,), minval=0, maxval=num_classes, dtype=tf.int32)
y_train = tf.one_hot(y_train, depth=num_classes)

# Model Definition (simplified)
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(32, input_shape=(seq_len, input_dim)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Optimizer, loss function
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
epochs = 2

def training_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      logits = model(x)
      loss = loss_fn(y, logits)

    # The problem: New gradients are created on each step
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
    
    return loss

for epoch in range(epochs):
    print(f"Starting epoch {epoch+1}")
    for i in range(len(x_train)):
        x = tf.expand_dims(x_train[i], axis=0)
        y = tf.expand_dims(y_train[i], axis=0)
        loss = training_step(x, y)
```

Here, the problem is not so much the model itself, but rather how we are stepping through training data and applying gradients. The inner `for` loop over the `x_train` dataset uses `tf.expand_dims()` to create a new tensor at every training step, which, combined with the gradients computed, contributes to accumulating tensors on the GPU. This causes an unnecessary memory burden, leading to a crash. The key is to either iterate through mini-batches of data, and not one by one, or pre-allocate the memory using `tf.Variable` objects, rather than creating entirely new tensors at every step.

**Example 3: Explicit Memory Management using tf.Variables and Data Batching**

This example illustrates a more memory-efficient way of training an LSTM, incorporating data batching and `tf.Variable` for accumulator variables.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Simplified dataset
num_samples = 1000
seq_len = 20
input_dim = 5
num_classes = 2
x_train = tf.random.normal((num_samples, seq_len, input_dim))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((num_samples,), minval=0, maxval=num_classes, dtype=tf.int32)
y_train = tf.one_hot(y_train, depth=num_classes)

# Model Definition (simplified)
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(32, input_shape=(seq_len, input_dim)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Optimizer, loss function
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()

batch_size = 32 # Using mini-batches

# Custom training step for batched data
def training_step_batched(x_batch, y_batch):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      logits = model(x_batch)
      loss = loss_fn(y_batch, logits)

    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

epochs = 2

for epoch in range(epochs):
    print(f"Starting epoch {epoch+1}")
    for i in range(0, len(x_train), batch_size):
        x_batch = x_train[i:i+batch_size]
        y_batch = y_train[i:i+batch_size]
        loss = training_step_batched(x_batch, y_batch)
```

In this corrected code, we use the same model as before, but instead of iterating through the training data one example at a time, we create batches of data. This batching improves memory usage and GPU efficiency as well. Further, no extra temporary tensors are created inside the loop for each data point.

To further optimize memory usage, explicit configuration of GPU memory growth is crucial in some situations and can be enabled using TensorFlow API commands.  Additionally, one could explore gradient accumulation techniques where gradients are accumulated over several mini-batches before performing an update to model weights to further reduce GPU memory footprint.

To summarize, addressing GPU memory crashes with LSTM models involves a multifaceted strategy. First, carefully adjust batch sizes and model complexity. Second, be mindful of how tensors are created and handled within training loops and model implementations, avoiding unnecessary temporary tensors. Batching the input data is a great way to do this. Lastly, adopt explicit memory management practices, including controlling TensorFlow's memory allocation behaviors.

For further study, I suggest consulting resources that delve into advanced TensorFlow concepts, such as custom training loops, memory management and profiling, and techniques for efficient model building. Exploring the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on performance optimization and resource management, is also invaluable. Finally, focusing on research publications pertaining to memory-efficient neural network training can offer additional insights into avoiding such crashes.
