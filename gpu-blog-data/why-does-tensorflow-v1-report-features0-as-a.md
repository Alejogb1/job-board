TensorFlow v1’s behavior of reporting “features:0” as a non-existent tensor, despite it seemingly being a logical input placeholder within a computational graph, often stems from the intricate way TensorFlow manages tensors during graph construction and execution phases. This discrepancy arises due to the distinction between *graph definition* and *session execution* – concepts not always immediately obvious to those transitioning from more imperative programming paradigms. My experience, debugging numerous machine learning models in production, highlights that this issue usually manifests when one attempts to access a placeholder defined in the graph *before* a TensorFlow session is initialized or before a feed dictionary provides concrete values during session execution.

The core problem lies in the fact that a TensorFlow graph, essentially a static blueprint of computations, defines only the *structure* of operations and the relationships between tensors. Placeholder tensors like “features:0”, declared within this graph, don’t inherently contain any numerical values. They serve as symbolic entry points for data that will be fed in later, during a session’s execution. The graph alone doesn't create a usable tensor with actual numerical data associated with the identifier "features:0". It merely defines a slot for it. Thus, asking TensorFlow to retrieve the tensor directly from the graph object itself, before session involvement, is logically equivalent to querying for a non-existent value - hence the error message.

The mechanism of “feeding” values to placeholders during session runtime is crucial. When a TensorFlow session is invoked with a feed dictionary (argument called `feed_dict`), the placeholders in the graph corresponding to the dictionary keys are then populated with the values provided by the dictionary. Until that point, those identifiers act as names referencing the placeholder operations in the graph, not as containers holding numerical values. Therefore, attempting to access tensor data by its name prior to a session execution or without providing the feed dictionary will result in the tensor being reported as non-existent.

To illustrate this, consider the following sequence of steps: A placeholder, “features”, is created. A mathematical operation involving the placeholder is defined. At this stage, the graph structure is complete, and "features" is known as a placeholder within the graph. However, if one were to, at this point, attempt to directly fetch "features:0" using `graph.get_tensor_by_name("features:0")`, an error indicating that the tensor is not in the graph would be returned because the tensor values only exist within a session during actual computation using `session.run()`.

The `graph.get_tensor_by_name()` method specifically looks for tensors defined as outputs of operations, not placeholders acting as input nodes to operations. Placeholders are merely symbolic and don't materialize as proper tensors until session execution. This is in contrast to the output of an actual operation, such as adding two tensors, which then does yield a concrete output tensor with numerical results during execution. The placeholder itself is an operation that returns a tensor, but only when provided with a corresponding value during execution through `feed_dict`.

Let's solidify these points with practical code examples:

**Example 1: Attempting to access the placeholder tensor from the graph without session interaction.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a placeholder
features = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10], name="features")

# Attempt to get the tensor directly from the graph (this will fail)
try:
  graph = tf.get_default_graph()
  tensor_features = graph.get_tensor_by_name("features:0")
  print(tensor_features)  # This line will not be reached
except KeyError as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}") # Reports "features:0" not in the graph
```

This code will raise a `KeyError` because `graph.get_tensor_by_name()` does not retrieve placeholders unless those are explicitly defined as outputs of the operations. `features:0` exists in the graph as a placeholder operation, which is where data is injected when needed during run time. The `graph.get_tensor_by_name` is a method to retrieve output tensors. Thus attempting to retrieve a placeholder tensor, before it is filled with data, will throw an error. The error explicitly states that "features:0" is not present within the graph, not because the tensor is not defined, but because it exists as a placeholder operation.

**Example 2: Correct access of a placeholder tensor through session execution and feed dictionary.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create a placeholder
features = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10], name="features")

# Create some random data
data = np.random.rand(5, 10).astype(np.float32)

# Start a TensorFlow session
with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Execute a dummy operation
    output = sess.run(features, feed_dict={features: data})
    print(output)
    # Attempt to get the tensor using graph object now. Still an error.
    graph = tf.get_default_graph()
    try:
        tensor_features = graph.get_tensor_by_name("features:0")
        print(tensor_features)  # This line will not be reached
    except KeyError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}") # Still reports error
```

Here, the code successfully runs when a `feed_dict` is supplied, providing data to the placeholder during `sess.run()`.  This highlights that the placeholder “features:0” only holds a numerical value and becomes a proper tensor *during* the execution of a session, when a valid feed dictionary is specified. Even after successful execution of the tensor, it still cannot be directly retrieved by name from the graph itself using `graph.get_tensor_by_name` outside a session operation, reinforcing the concept that tensors exist only as named output results of operations.

**Example 3: Illustrating the use case of a real output tensor, which can be retrieved via its name using `graph.get_tensor_by_name`.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create a placeholder
features = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10], name="features")

# Define a computation using the placeholder as an input
weights = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([10, 5]))
bias = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([5]))
output = tf.matmul(features, weights) + bias
output = tf.identity(output, name='output_layer')

# Start a TensorFlow session
with tf.Session() as sess:
    # Initialize the variables.
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    # Create some random data
    data = np.random.rand(5, 10).astype(np.float32)
    # Execute the operation, passing placeholder data
    output_result = sess.run(output, feed_dict={features: data})
    print(output_result)

    #Attempt to retrieve the output by its name.
    graph = tf.get_default_graph()
    output_retrieved = graph.get_tensor_by_name("output_layer:0")
    print(f"The output tensor can be accessed: {output_retrieved}")

```

This example demonstrates that the output from a TensorFlow operation *is* a valid tensor with an assigned identifier and can be retrieved via the `graph.get_tensor_by_name()` method. This is because `output` is the explicit result of matmul and addition, and its output is a defined tensor. The operation `tf.identity(output, name='output_layer')` assigns the specified name and makes it available as an output. Unlike placeholders that represent input slots, these results of computations represent tangible output tensors in the computational graph, once executed within a session.

In summary, TensorFlow v1 reporting "features:0" as a non-existent tensor does not signify an error in graph definition; rather, it exposes the nature of placeholders as symbolic inputs.  Placeholders do not hold actual numerical values until a session executes with a valid `feed_dict`. Tensors exist as output of operations. The "features:0" identifier exists, but it doesn't represent an output value that can be queried directly from the graph. The numerical data is associated with the tensor only during session execution with a feed_dictionary.
