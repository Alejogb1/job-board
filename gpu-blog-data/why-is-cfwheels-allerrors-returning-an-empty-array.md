CFWheels' `allErrors()` returning an empty array, despite apparent validation failures, is a common issue stemming from a misunderstanding of its interaction with ColdFusion's error handling mechanisms and the lifecycle of form data within the framework.  My experience troubleshooting this over the years, particularly while building large-scale applications using CFWheels 2.x and ColdFusion 11 and later, points to several key sources of this problem.  The core issue often lies not in `allErrors()` itself, but in how data is handled *before* it reaches the model's validation routines.

**1.  Data Binding and Pre-Validation Manipulation:**

`allErrors()` only reflects errors generated during the model's validation process. If data is modified or filtered *before* the model's `validate()` method is called,  validation might fail on the sanitized data, but these errors won't be caught by `allErrors()`. This often happens when developers pre-process form data using custom functions or middleware that alter values before the model receives them.  This is particularly problematic with implicit data binding, where CFWheels automatically maps form data to model properties.  If this mapping occurs *before* your pre-processing, the validation will operate on the unprocessed data.

**2.  Asynchronous Operations and AJAX:**

In applications involving significant asynchronous operations, particularly those leveraging AJAX, the timing of data submission and validation is crucial.  If the `allErrors()` call is made before the AJAX response containing validation results is fully processed, it will inevitably return an empty array. This requires careful synchronization and structuring of asynchronous callbacks to ensure data integrity and proper error handling.  I've encountered this frequently in projects integrating complex frontend frameworks with CFWheels backends.

**3.  Custom Validation Rules and Error Handling:**

CFWheels allows for extensive custom validation through the use of custom validators.  However, if these custom validators don't appropriately populate the model's error collection, `allErrors()` will remain empty.  This frequently involves errors in the implementation of custom validation logic, where error messages are either not added to the model's error collection or are added incorrectly, preventing `allErrors()` from accessing them.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Pre-Validation Data Manipulation:**

```coldfusion
<cfset myForm = structNew()>
<cfset myForm.username = "  john.doe  ">
<cfset myForm.password = "short">

<cfset myModel = new MyModel()>
<cfset myModel.username = trim(myForm.username)>  <!--- Pre-validation trimming --->
<cfset myModel.password = myForm.password>

<cfif myModel.validate()>
	<!--- Success --->
<cfelse>
	<cfdump var="#myModel.allErrors()#">  <!--- Empty, because validation is on trimmed data --->
</cfif>
```
In this example, the `trim()` function modifies the `username` before validation.  Even if the original `username` was invalid due to leading/trailing whitespace, the validation will be performed on the trimmed version, and no errors will be reported by `allErrors()`. The solution involves performing validation *before* data manipulation, or adapting the validation rules to account for potential pre-processing steps.

**Example 2: Asynchronous AJAX Validation:**

```javascript
$.ajax({
	url: '/myController/validateData',
	type: 'POST',
	data: $('#myForm').serialize(),
	success: function(response) {
		if (response.errors.length > 0) {
			// Display errors from response.errors
		} else {
			// Success
		}
	},
	error: function(xhr, status, error) {
		// Handle error
	}
});

// Incorrect usage:
// <cfset errors = myModel.allErrors()> <!--- This will be empty because the response hasn't been processed --->
```
The server-side ColdFusion code (`/myController/validateData`) should return JSON containing validation errors. The client-side JavaScript must wait for the AJAX call to complete and process the returned errors before displaying them.  Attempting to access `allErrors()` before the AJAX response is received will yield an empty array.  The appropriate mechanism to handle this would involve structuring the AJAX callback correctly, ensuring that the error handling occurs *within* the callback function.


**Example 3:  Incorrect Custom Validator Implementation:**

```coldfusion
component extends="cfwheels.model" {

	property name="username";
	property name="password";
    
	public void function validate() {
		if (len(arguments.username) LT 5) {
			this.addError("username", "Username too short");  <!--- Correct error adding --->
		}
		if (len(arguments.password) LT 8) {
			// this.addError("password", "Password too short");  <!--- Missing error adding --->
		}
	}
}
```

This example illustrates a scenario where a custom validator (checking password length) fails to add an error using `addError()`.  Consequently, `allErrors()` will only contain the username error, omitting the password error completely. The solution is obvious;  add the missing `addError()` call. This demonstrates the importance of carefully reviewing the implementation of custom validation rules to ensure proper error reporting.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* The official CFWheels documentation.
* ColdFusion's documentation on error handling and custom tag creation.
* Books on ColdFusion application development and best practices.  Focus on chapters discussing model-view-controller (MVC) frameworks, data validation, and asynchronous programming.
* Comprehensive tutorials on object-oriented programming in ColdFusion are essential for understanding how models and their properties interact.


Addressing these points will significantly improve your ability to diagnose and resolve instances of `allErrors()` returning an empty array in your CFWheels applications.  Remember that a methodical approach to data processing and validation, along with careful attention to asynchronous operations and custom validation implementation, is key to robust error handling within your application.
