The appearance of NaN (Not a Number) or Inf (Infinity) values in a GPU input tensor after an update almost invariably stems from numerical instability during a preceding computation.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects for the last decade has shown this to be the most common culprit, often masked by the inherent parallelism of GPU operations.  Pinpointing the exact source requires careful examination of the computation pipeline, paying particular attention to operations prone to generating these problematic values.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

NaN and Inf values propagate rapidly through calculations.  A single NaN in an input tensor can lead to an entire tensor being filled with NaNs after just a few matrix multiplications or element-wise operations.  Similarly, an Inf, if involved in a multiplication or division, can quickly contaminate the entire dataset.  The key to debugging this lies in understanding the potential sources of numerical instability within your specific computation.  These primarily include:

* **Division by Zero:** This is the most straightforward cause.  If any element in a denominator tensor is zero (or extremely close to zero, leading to overflow), the result will be Inf.  GPU hardware doesn't handle these gracefully; rather, it propagates the Inf.

* **Square Root of Negative Numbers:**  Attempting to calculate the square root of a negative number directly results in a NaN. This can be subtle, arising from intermediate calculations where a variable inadvertently takes on a negative value.

* **Overflow and Underflow:**  These occur when the magnitude of a number exceeds the representable range of the floating-point data type (e.g., `float32`).  Overflow typically results in Inf, while underflow produces a value close to zero, potentially leading to subsequent division-by-zero errors.

* **Logarithm of Zero or Negative Numbers:** The natural logarithm (and other logarithmic functions) are undefined for zero and negative numbers, resulting in NaNs.

* **Trigonometric Function Errors:**  Certain arguments can cause trigonometric functions like `arctan2` to return NaN or Inf under specific conditions, particularly with near-zero or very large values.

* **Incorrect Data Initialization:**  Improperly initialized tensors, such as those containing uninitialized memory or NaN values from the outset, are a less common but equally problematic source.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Division by Zero**

```python
import numpy as np
import cupy as cp

# CPU calculation for demonstration
cpu_array = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 0.0, 4.0], dtype=np.float32)
cpu_result = np.divide(1.0, cpu_array)
print(f"CPU Result: {cpu_result}")

# GPU calculation
gpu_array = cp.array([1.0, 2.0, 0.0, 4.0], dtype=cp.float32)
gpu_result = cp.divide(1.0, gpu_array)
print(f"GPU Result: {gpu_result}")

#Inspecting for NaN and Inf
print(f"CPU NaN Count: {np.isnan(cpu_result).sum()}")
print(f"GPU NaN Count: {cp.isnan(gpu_result).sum()}")
print(f"GPU Inf Count: {cp.isinf(gpu_result).sum()}")
```

This example clearly demonstrates how a zero in the denominator causes Inf on the GPU.  Note the use of `cupy` for GPU computation, mirroring my workflow in prior projects involving large-scale image processing.  The CPU calculation, for comparison, uses `numpy`.


**Example 2: Square Root of Negative Number**

```python
import numpy as np
import cupy as cp

cpu_array = np.array([-1.0, 4.0, 9.0], dtype=np.float32)
cpu_result = np.sqrt(cpu_array)
print(f"CPU Result: {cpu_result}")

gpu_array = cp.array([-1.0, 4.0, 9.0], dtype=cp.float32)
gpu_result = cp.sqrt(gpu_array)
print(f"GPU Result: {gpu_result}")

print(f"CPU NaN Count: {np.isnan(cpu_result).sum()}")
print(f"GPU NaN Count: {cp.isnan(gpu_result).sum()}")
```

This showcases the propagation of NaNs resulting from the square root of a negative number.  The identical behavior on both CPU and GPU highlights that the issue is inherent in the operation itself, not a specific GPU artifact.


**Example 3: Overflow**

```python
import numpy as np
import cupy as cp

cpu_array = np.array([1e38, 1e38], dtype=np.float32)
cpu_result = cpu_array * cpu_array
print(f"CPU Result: {cpu_result}")

gpu_array = cp.array([1e38, 1e38], dtype=cp.float32)
gpu_result = gpu_array * gpu_array
print(f"GPU Result: {gpu_result}")

print(f"CPU Inf Count: {np.isinf(cpu_result).sum()}")
print(f"GPU Inf Count: {cp.isinf(gpu_result).sum()}")
```

Here, we observe overflow from multiplying very large numbers.  The resulting Inf values underscore the importance of understanding the limitations of the chosen floating-point precision (`float32` in this case).  Using `float64` might offer a larger dynamic range, but with increased memory consumption.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting numerical analysis textbooks focusing on floating-point arithmetic and error propagation.  The documentation for your specific deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) should also contain information about handling numerical instability.  Finally, a strong foundation in linear algebra is crucial for understanding the potential for numerical errors in matrix operations.  Thorough testing and debugging techniques, including using debuggers to step through your code, are essential for isolating the root cause.  Pay close attention to intermediate variable values. Examining the data at different stages of your pipeline can pinpoint exactly where the NaN or Inf first appear.
