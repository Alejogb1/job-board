TensorFlow itself, primarily a Python-centric framework, does not directly expose a stable, officially supported C or C++ API specifically for high-level object detection tasks like training or utilizing pre-trained models in their entirety. However, components of the TensorFlow ecosystem, combined with judicious use of its lower-level C++ core, enable creating object detection pipelines within C/C++ applications, albeit with a more involved approach compared to its Python counterpart. This response outlines how, based on my experience, a robust object detection system can be constructed using C++ and the available TensorFlow infrastructure.

The crux of the matter lies in understanding that the core TensorFlow runtime, which performs the actual tensor computations, is implemented in C++. This runtime is accessible via a C API and also a C++ API. The challenge, and why a direct “object detection” API doesn’t exist, is that the higher-level abstractions, like the `tf.keras` layers used to build object detection models, are primarily in Python. We need to bridge this gap.

The fundamental mechanism is exporting a trained TensorFlow model (typically in SavedModel format) from Python and then loading and running that SavedModel within the C++ environment. This avoids having to recreate the neural network architecture and weights in C++ from scratch. While the SavedModel format is designed to be language-agnostic, direct support for features like data augmentation and model training pipelines is significantly limited in the C++ environment. This is why pre-training models is usually handled in Python.

The first step, and a foundational one, involves loading the SavedModel. This is where the TensorFlow C++ API comes into play directly. I've found the `tensorflow::SavedModelBundle` to be the primary tool here. A basic code structure would look like this:

```c++
#include "tensorflow/cc/saved_model/loader.h"
#include "tensorflow/cc/saved_model/tag_constants.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/platform/env.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/platform/types.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/public/session.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/protobuf/meta_graph.pb.h"

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  tensorflow::Session* session;
  tensorflow::SavedModelBundle bundle;
  tensorflow::SessionOptions session_options;
  tensorflow::RunOptions run_options;

  const std::string export_dir = "/path/to/your/saved_model"; // Replace with your actual path

  tensorflow::Status load_status = LoadSavedModel(session_options, run_options, export_dir, {tensorflow::kSavedModelTagServe}, &bundle);

  if (!load_status.ok()) {
     std::cerr << "Error loading saved model: " << load_status.ToString() << std::endl;
     return 1;
  }

  session = bundle.GetSession();

  // At this point, the model is loaded and ready for inference.
  std::cout << "Model loaded successfully." << std::endl;

  // Model inference code will go here.
  
  return 0;
}
```

This example initializes a TensorFlow session and loads a SavedModel from a specified directory. It illustrates the basic setup needed to interact with a trained model. Note, the `export_dir` needs to be replaced with the actual path where your trained model was exported. Error handling with `tensorflow::Status` is critical, as indicated in the code.

The key challenge now becomes preparing the input data for the model in the format it expects. Object detection models typically expect an input tensor representing the image (or a batch of images). Further, the model’s output typically will be tensors that require post processing to determine bounding boxes and associated classes. This is where the lack of a dedicated API becomes evident. We need to manually construct input tensors and process the output tensors.

Building on the previous example, and assuming the model expects an image as a `uint8` tensor, and produces multiple output tensors, the inference step can be structured as follows:

```c++
  // Assuming preprocessed image data is loaded into a uint8_t array called image_data
  // and its dimensions are width, height and channels

  int width = 640;  // Example
  int height = 480; // Example
  int channels = 3; // Example
  
  std::vector<uint8_t> image_data(width * height * channels); //Load or generate image data here 
  
  tensorflow::Tensor input_tensor(tensorflow::DT_UINT8, tensorflow::TensorShape({1, height, width, channels}));
  
  auto input_tensor_mapped = input_tensor.flat<uint8_t>().data();
  std::copy(image_data.begin(), image_data.end(), input_tensor_mapped);
  
  std::vector<std::pair<std::string, tensorflow::Tensor>> inputs = {
    { "input_tensor_name", input_tensor } // Replace input_tensor_name with the name of your model's input tensor
  };
  
  std::vector<std::string> output_names = {
      "detection_boxes", // Example output tensor name
      "detection_scores",// Example output tensor name
      "detection_classes"// Example output tensor name
  }; // Replace with actual output tensor names.
  
  std::vector<tensorflow::Tensor> outputs;
  
  tensorflow::Status run_status = session->Run(inputs, output_names, {}, &outputs);

    if (!run_status.ok()) {
        std::cerr << "Error during inference: " << run_status.ToString() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    
    //Process the output tensors
    // e.g. bounding boxes, detection scores, classes are extracted from 'outputs' tensor vector
  
  std::cout << "Inference complete" << std::endl;
```

In this example, the `input_tensor` is constructed from raw image data.  `inputs` is a vector of pairs, where each pair contains the name of an input placeholder within the model and a tensor containing data for that placeholder. The model output tensors (detection boxes, scores, and classes in the example) are retrieved after the `session->Run` call. The tensor names "input\_tensor\_name", "detection\_boxes", "detection\_scores", "detection\_classes" need to be replaced with the names of your respective tensors as defined by the SavedModel. Note that the output tensors from the network will have specific layouts (shape) that must be understood to access the information they contain.

Finally, extracting information from the output tensors often involves data manipulation to extract bounding boxes, classification labels, and confidence scores.  Depending on the specific object detection model, additional steps like Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) might be required.  This requires careful study of your trained model and tensor shapes it produces.  The `tensorflow::Tensor` class has a number of `flat<>`, `matrix<>`, and `tensor<>` template member functions to allow you to access the underlying data in a raw type.

To showcase a more concrete example of post processing, assuming the "detection\_boxes" tensor is output in the format of `[batch, num_detections, 4]`, the following code demonstrates how to access bounding box coordinates, assuming `outputs[0]` holds the detections boxes:

```c++
  if(outputs.size() > 0){
     tensorflow::Tensor &boxes_tensor = outputs[0];
     auto boxes = boxes_tensor.tensor<float, 3>();

     int num_detections = boxes.dimension(1);

      for (int i = 0; i < num_detections; ++i) {
          float ymin = boxes(0,i,0);
          float xmin = boxes(0,i,1);
          float ymax = boxes(0,i,2);
          float xmax = boxes(0,i,3);
          
          //Use the extracted bounding box coordinates ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax
           std::cout << "Detection " << i << ": ymin=" << ymin << ", xmin=" << xmin << ", ymax=" << ymax << ", xmax=" << xmax << std::endl;
       }
  }
```

This example directly accesses the tensor data using `tensor<float,3>`, where the `<float,3>` specifies that the tensor data is float type, and has a rank of 3. Note that this requires careful understanding of how the `detection_boxes` tensor was organized by your specific object detection model. A similar methodology can be employed to retrieve `detection_scores` and `detection_classes` from other tensors in the `outputs` vector.

In summary, while no direct, high-level C/C++ object detection API exists, TensorFlow's core C++ runtime, combined with the SavedModel format, allows the inference of trained object detection models in C++. The critical steps involve: loading the SavedModel, preparing the input tensors, running inference, and post-processing the output tensors according to the model’s design. This process demands meticulous handling of data structures, tensor manipulation, and model-specific understanding, requiring greater manual effort than with the high-level Python API.  

For further study of the various functionalities used, the official TensorFlow C++ API documentation (usually found in the TensorFlow source code itself or on the official TensorFlow website), as well as specific guides on SavedModel loading and inference are recommended. Understanding the SavedModel format and its associated Protocol Buffer definition will also be highly beneficial. A deep understanding of tensor operations and shapes is also essential.
