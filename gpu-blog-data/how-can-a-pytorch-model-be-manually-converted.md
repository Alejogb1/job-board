The direct conversion of a PyTorch model to TensorFlow without employing ONNX hinges on a meticulous recreation of the model's architecture and weight initialization in TensorFlow.  This is inherently a complex process, prone to errors if not executed with precise attention to detail.  My experience in porting large-scale deep learning models across frameworks has shown that this direct method, while avoiding the intermediate ONNX representation, necessitates a deep understanding of both PyTorch's and TensorFlow's internal workings.  It's not simply a matter of syntactic substitution; semantic equivalence must be ensured at each layer.

1. **Clear Explanation:** The fundamental challenge lies in the differing internal representations of models and layers in PyTorch and TensorFlow.  PyTorch employs a more imperative and dynamic computation graph, often relying on in-place operations.  TensorFlow, conversely, traditionally favors a static computation graph, emphasizing explicit definition of the model's structure. This difference necessitates careful translation of PyTorch's dynamic construction to TensorFlow's static definition.  Further complexities arise from handling custom layers, activation functions, and loss functions, which may not have direct equivalents in the other framework.  The process therefore requires a layer-by-layer reconstruction, mirroring the architecture and ensuring that the weights and biases are correctly transferred to their corresponding TensorFlow counterparts.  Discrepancies in data handling, such as batch normalization implementations or data augmentation pipelines, need thorough investigation and potential modification to guarantee consistent behaviour across frameworks.  Lastly, meticulous testing is paramount to ensure the ported model produces identical (or nearly identical, considering potential floating-point inaccuracies) outputs to its PyTorch counterpart for various inputs.

2. **Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Simple Linear Layer Conversion**

```python
# PyTorch
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class PyTorchLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(PyTorchLinear, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# TensorFlow
import tensorflow as tf

class TensorFlowLinear(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(TensorFlowLinear, self).__init__()
        self.linear = tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_size, input_shape=(input_size,))

    def call(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)


# Conversion:
pytorch_model = PyTorchLinear(10, 5)
pytorch_weights = pytorch_model.linear.weight.detach().numpy()
pytorch_bias = pytorch_model.linear.bias.detach().numpy()

tensorflow_model = TensorFlowLinear(10,5)
tensorflow_model.linear.set_weights([pytorch_weights, pytorch_bias])

#Verification (requires a sample input tensor)
sample_input = torch.randn(1,10)
pytorch_output = pytorch_model(sample_input)
tf_input = tf.convert_to_tensor(sample_input.numpy(),dtype=tf.float32)
tensorflow_output = tensorflow_model(tf_input)
#Assert near equality of outputs (using np.allclose for tolerance)
print(np.allclose(pytorch_output.detach().numpy(),tensorflow_output.numpy()))

```
This example illustrates a straightforward conversion of a linear layer.  The weights and biases are extracted from the PyTorch model and directly assigned to their TensorFlow equivalents using `set_weights`.  Note the crucial step of converting PyTorch tensors to NumPy arrays for compatibility.  Verification of the output equivalence is essential.

**Example 2:  Custom Activation Function Conversion**

```python
# PyTorch
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class PyTorchCustomActivation(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.tanh(x) * torch.sigmoid(x)

# TensorFlow
import tensorflow as tf

class TensorFlowCustomActivation(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(TensorFlowCustomActivation, self).__init__()

    def call(self, x):
        return tf.math.tanh(x) * tf.math.sigmoid(x)


#Conversion (assuming the custom activation is part of a larger model):
# ... (model architecture definition) ...
# PyTorch: model.add_module('custom_act', PyTorchCustomActivation())
# TensorFlow: model.add(TensorFlowCustomActivation())
# ... (rest of model definition) ...

```

Here, a custom activation function is defined and incorporated into the models.  The TensorFlow equivalent is crafted to match the functionality exactly.  Note that TensorFlow's functional API often allows for more direct translation of complex custom operations.

**Example 3: Convolutional Layer with Batch Normalization**

```python
# PyTorch
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class PyTorchConvBN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        return x

# TensorFlow
import tensorflow as tf

class TensorFlowConvBN(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(out_channels, kernel_size, padding='same') # Padding for consistency
        self.bn = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        return x

#Conversion - similar weight transfer as in example 1, but now with Conv2D and BatchNormalization weights and biases

```
This illustrates converting a convolutional layer combined with batch normalization. Careful attention must be paid to matching padding strategies between PyTorch and TensorFlow's convolutional layers to avoid discrepancies in output dimensions.  Weight transfer must account for the different weight arrangements across both the convolutional layer and batch normalization.

3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The official documentation for both PyTorch and TensorFlow are invaluable resources.  Thorough study of the internals of each framework, specifically focusing on layer implementations and weight initialization methods, is critical.  Consult reputable textbooks on deep learning and neural network architectures to solidify theoretical understanding.  Finally, proficiency in NumPy for array manipulations is essential.


In summary, the direct conversion of PyTorch models to TensorFlow is a demanding task requiring a deep understanding of both frameworks and a systematic, layer-by-layer approach. The examples provided highlight common conversion challenges and strategies. While avoiding ONNX simplifies the immediate process, it significantly increases the effort, time commitment, and risk of introducing subtle errors. Rigorous testing is imperative to ensure the converted model behaves identically to its PyTorch counterpart.
