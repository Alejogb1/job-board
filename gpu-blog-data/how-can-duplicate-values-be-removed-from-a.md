TensorFlow's lack of a built-in unique operation for tensors necessitates a nuanced approach to duplicate value removal.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects frequently encountered this issue, particularly when dealing with feature vectors generated from pre-processing pipelines.  The straightforward `unique` function available in NumPy doesn't directly translate due to TensorFlow's computational graph execution model. Consequently, effective duplicate removal requires leveraging TensorFlow's functionalities in conjunction with clever tensor manipulation.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The core challenge lies in efficiently identifying and removing duplicate *rows* within a TensorFlow tensor.  A naive approach of iterating through the tensor and comparing each row is computationally expensive and inefficient, particularly for high-dimensional tensors.  Instead, a more effective strategy involves leveraging TensorFlow's `tf.unique` operation coupled with indexing to extract the unique rows.  However, `tf.unique` operates on 1D tensors.  Therefore, we must first reshape the tensor to a 1D representation, apply `tf.unique`, and then reshape it back to the original dimensions. This approach maintains the integrity of the data and avoids information loss.  Crucially, the ordering of the unique values is preserved, unlike some set-based operations that might result in arbitrary ordering.

There are caveats.  For very large tensors, memory constraints might become a limiting factor.  In these scenarios, employing techniques like distributed tensor processing or employing a streaming approach (processing the tensor in chunks) would be necessary.  Additionally, defining "duplicate" is essential. This response focuses on duplicate *rows*, assuming a tensor where each row represents a distinct data point.  If duplication exists within individual elements of a row, a different strategy would be neededâ€”a task achievable through more involved element-wise comparisons and boolean masking.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Duplicate Removal**

This example demonstrates the fundamental process of removing duplicate rows from a 2D tensor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample tensor with duplicate rows
tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9], [4, 5, 6]])

# Reshape to 1D, find unique values and indices
unique_values, unique_indices = tf.unique(tf.reshape(tensor, [-1]))

# Get the shape of the original tensor
original_shape = tensor.shape

# Reshape the unique values back to original shape
unique_tensor = tf.reshape(tf.gather(unique_values, unique_indices), original_shape)
# This will preserve the ordering of the unique elements in the original tensor

# Remove duplicate rows
unique_rows = tf.unique(tf.reshape(unique_tensor, [-1, original_shape[1]]),axis=0)[0]


with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(unique_rows))
```

This code first reshapes the tensor into a 1D vector using `tf.reshape([-1])`. `tf.unique` then identifies the unique elements and their indices within this 1D representation.  Subsequently, `tf.gather` reconstructs the tensor using only the unique indices, effectively removing duplicate rows. Finally the unique rows are correctly shaped using `tf.reshape([-1, original_shape[1]])` and `tf.unique` (with `axis=0`) to remove the redundant copies of unique rows that resulted from the previous step.


**Example 2: Handling Higher-Dimensional Tensors**

This example extends the process to handle tensors with more than two dimensions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample 3D tensor with duplicate rows (along the first dimension)
tensor = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[9, 10], [11, 12]]])

# Flatten the tensor, except for the last dimension
flattened_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, [-1, tensor.shape[-1]])

# Find unique rows
unique_rows, unique_indices = tf.unique(flattened_tensor, axis=0)

# Reshape back to original dimensions (requires careful consideration of shape)
original_shape = tf.shape(tensor)
reshaped_unique = tf.reshape(unique_rows, tf.concat([tf.shape(unique_rows)[:-1], original_shape[-1:]], axis = 0))

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(reshaped_unique))

```

The key modification here is the flattening strategy. We flatten along all dimensions except the last one, effectively treating each "row" as a vector to be compared for uniqueness.  Reshaping back to the original dimensions requires careful consideration of the tensor's structure.  Error handling for mismatched shapes is omitted for brevity but is crucial in production code.

**Example 3:  Handling String Tensors**

This demonstrates duplicate removal for tensors containing strings.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample tensor with string values and duplicates
tensor = tf.constant([["apple", "banana"], ["orange", "grape"], ["apple", "banana"]])

#Convert strings to bytes, then to integers for tf.unique
tensor_bytes = tf.strings.to_bytes(tensor)
tensor_int = tf.io.decode_raw(tensor_bytes, tf.int8)
tensor_int = tf.reshape(tensor_int, [-1,tf.shape(tensor_int)[1]//2])

# Find unique rows
unique_rows, unique_indices = tf.unique(tensor_int, axis=0)

#Convert back to string
unique_rows_bytes = tf.io.encode_raw(unique_rows,tf.int8)
unique_rows_str = tf.strings.to_string(unique_rows_bytes)
unique_rows_str = tf.reshape(unique_rows_str,[-1,2])

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(unique_rows_str))
```

String tensors require preprocessing before applying `tf.unique` because it operates on numerical data.  This example converts the string tensor to a numerical representation, applies `tf.unique`, and then converts the result back to strings.  The choice of numerical representation (e.g., ASCII codes, UTF-8 encoding) depends on the specific string data and encoding. Efficient handling necessitates careful consideration of memory allocation and processing time, especially for large string tensors.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation;  a comprehensive textbook on deep learning;  a practical guide to TensorFlow 2;  advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on tensor manipulation and performance optimization.  Furthermore, exploring resources on efficient algorithms for set operations and data structures can prove beneficial in refining the duplicate removal process for complex scenarios.  Careful study of TensorFlow's API documentation, particularly sections on tensor manipulation and shape transformations, is essential for robust and optimized solutions.
