Passing a dictionary of tensors to a Keras model necessitates a nuanced understanding of Keras' input specifications and the inherent flexibility offered by the functional API.  My experience developing a multi-modal sentiment analysis model heavily relied on this technique, specifically handling textual and visual features represented as distinct tensors.  Directly feeding a dictionary to a `Sequential` model isn't feasible; the functional API provides the necessary control.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras' `Sequential` model expects a single input tensor.  When dealing with multiple input sources, each potentially requiring distinct preprocessing or having varying shapes, a `Sequential` model becomes inadequate.  The functional API, however, allows for the definition of arbitrarily complex models with multiple inputs and outputs.  This is achieved by creating individual input layers for each tensor within the dictionary, processing them through separate sub-models (potentially sharing layers), and finally merging their outputs (if necessary) before feeding them to the final output layer.

The key is to define an input layer for each key in your dictionary.  These layers must specify the expected tensor shape (number of dimensions, and size of each dimension) corresponding to the data type they will receive.  Subsequent layers process each input tensor individually, and the results are then combined – perhaps by concatenation, averaging, or more sophisticated methods – before a final layer provides the model's prediction.

The functional API's flexibility extends to handling varying tensor shapes within the same dictionary key across different samples.  This is crucial for handling variable-length sequences or images of varying resolutions, for instance.  However, careful consideration of batching and padding strategies (for sequences) is essential to maintain compatibility with Keras' training loop.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Multi-Input Model with Concatenation**

This example demonstrates a scenario where two tensors, representing textual and numerical features, are concatenated before feeding into a dense network.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, concatenate

# Define input layers
text_input = Input(shape=(100,), name='text') # Assuming 100-dimensional text embeddings
numeric_input = Input(shape=(5,), name='numeric') # Assuming 5 numerical features

# Define processing layers for each input
text_dense = Dense(64, activation='relu')(text_input)
numeric_dense = Dense(32, activation='relu')(numeric_input)

# Concatenate the processed inputs
merged = concatenate([text_dense, numeric_dense])

# Define the output layer
output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged) # Binary classification example

# Create the model
model = keras.Model(inputs=[text_input, numeric_input], outputs=output)

# Compile and train the model (placeholder)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# model.fit(...)
```

**Commentary:**  This code explicitly defines two input layers, `text_input` and `numeric_input`, corresponding to the keys of a dictionary passed as input.  These are processed separately before concatenation using `concatenate`. This combined representation is then passed to the output layer.  The `keras.Model` constructor takes a list of input layers and the output layer, explicitly defining the model architecture.

**Example 2: Handling Variable-Length Sequences**

This example illustrates how to process a dictionary containing a variable-length sequence and a fixed-length feature vector.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense, Embedding, Masking

# Define input layers
sequence_input = Input(shape=(None,), name='sequence') # Variable-length sequence
feature_input = Input(shape=(10,), name='features') # Fixed-length feature vector

# Embedding and LSTM for sequence processing (assuming integer sequences)
embedding_layer = Embedding(10000, 128) # Vocabulary size of 10000, embedding dimension 128
embedded_sequence = embedding_layer(sequence_input)
masked_sequence = Masking(mask_value=0)(embedded_sequence) # Handle padding with 0s
lstm_output = LSTM(64)(masked_sequence)

# Process fixed-length features
feature_dense = Dense(32, activation='relu')(feature_input)

# Concatenate and output
merged = concatenate([lstm_output, feature_dense])
output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged)

# Create the model
model = keras.Model(inputs=[sequence_input, feature_input], outputs=output)

# Compile and train the model (placeholder)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# model.fit(...)
```

**Commentary:** This code showcases handling variable-length sequences using an LSTM.  `Masking` is crucial for handling padded sequences, ensuring that padding tokens don't influence the LSTM's computations.  The `None` in `shape=(None,)` signifies variable sequence length.  The rest of the structure parallels Example 1.


**Example 3: Multi-Input with Separate Output Branches**

This example showcases a scenario where multiple inputs lead to separate output predictions, reflecting a multi-task learning setup.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense

# Define input layers
image_input = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1), name='image') # Example: MNIST-like image
text_input = Input(shape=(100,), name='text') # Text embedding

# Separate processing branches
image_branch = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax') # 10 classes for image classification
])(image_input)

text_branch = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax') # 10 classes for text classification
])(text_input)

# Create the model with multiple outputs
model = keras.Model(inputs=[image_input, text_input], outputs=[image_branch, text_branch])

# Compile and train the model (placeholder - requires handling multiple losses)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=['categorical_crossentropy', 'categorical_crossentropy'], loss_weights=[0.5, 0.5], metrics=['accuracy'])
# model.fit(...)
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates using the functional API to create a model with two separate output branches, processing `image_input` and `text_input` independently.  The model is compiled with multiple losses, one for each output branch.  The `loss_weights` argument allows weighting the relative importance of each loss during training.

The Keras documentation on the functional API.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning covering neural network architectures and training methodologies.  A practical guide to TensorFlow and its ecosystem.


This detailed explanation, coupled with the provided examples, should equip you to effectively pass dictionaries of tensors to Keras models using the functional API. Remember to carefully consider data preprocessing, padding strategies (if applicable), and the appropriate merging/combination techniques depending on the nature of your data and the task at hand.  My extensive work on multi-modal models has consistently proven the functional API's versatility and robustness in this context.
