TensorFlow's `GradientTape` returning `None` for all variables typically indicates a mismatch between the variables being watched and the operations within the tape's recording scope.  In my experience troubleshooting complex neural network architectures, this often stems from issues concerning variable creation, scope management, and the proper usage of `tf.GradientTape.watch`.  Let's explore the root causes and illustrate solutions through code examples.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core functionality of `tf.GradientTape` relies on observing tensor operations performed within its context.  Crucially, it only tracks gradients for tensors that are explicitly "watched" using `tf.GradientTape.watch()`. Variables, while tensors themselves, are not automatically watched.  If you fail to explicitly watch a variable before performing calculations involving it within the `GradientTape` context, the tape will not track its gradients. Consequently, `gradient()` will return `None` for that variable because the tape has no recorded information to compute its gradient.

Furthermore, issues arise when variables are created *outside* the `GradientTape`'s `with` block.  The tape only records operations within its scope.  Creating a variable externally, and then using it inside the tape, will not result in gradient tracking unless explicitly watched *within* the tape's context.  Incorrect usage of control flow structures (e.g., `tf.cond`, loops) can also obscure the intended variable usage, effectively preventing proper gradient tracking.  Finally, improperly defined custom layers or loss functions may unintentionally create variables outside the tape's scope, leading to the `None` gradient issue.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: Incorrect Variable Watching**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
y = tf.Variable(2.0)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  z = x * y  # GradientTape doesn't record gradients for x and y automatically.

dz_dx, dz_dy = tape.gradient(z, [x, y]) 
print(dz_dx, dz_dy) # Output: None None
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental problem. While `x` and `y` are variables, the `GradientTape` doesn't automatically track them. To fix this, we must explicitly `watch` them:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
y = tf.Variable(2.0)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch(x)
  tape.watch(y)
  z = x * y

dz_dx, dz_dy = tape.gradient(z, [x, y])
print(dz_dx, dz_dy) # Output: tf.Tensor(2.0, shape=(), dtype=float32) tf.Tensor(1.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
```


**Example 2: Variable Creation Outside Tape Scope**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0) # Variable created outside the tape's scope

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = x * 2
  z = y + 1

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(dz_dx) #Output: None
```


Here, variable `x` is initialized before the tape's context.  Even though it's used within the `with` block, it wasn't created there, leading to the `None` gradient.  The solution necessitates moving the variable creation inside the tape's scope:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    x = tf.Variable(1.0) #Variable now created inside the tape's scope
    y = x * 2
    z = y + 1

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(dz_dx) #Output: tf.Tensor(2.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)

```

**Example 3:  Incorrect Control Flow**

Improper use of control flow can also cause this issue. Consider a scenario involving conditional operations:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(x)
    if x > 0:
        y = x * 2
    else:
        y = x
    z = y + 1

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(dz_dx) # Output: tf.Tensor(2.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
```

This example correctly computes the gradient because the operation involving `x` (multiplication by 2) occurs within the tape's scope. However, subtle changes in control flow can break this. For instance, if `y` were defined outside the conditional statement, but assigned a value conditionally, the gradient might be lost if the condition prevents the watched variable from participating in the tape's tracked operations.  Careful consideration of variable usage within conditional blocks and loops is critical for correct gradient computation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is the primary resource. Pay close attention to the sections detailing `tf.GradientTape`, automatic differentiation, and best practices for building and training models.  Explore the examples provided in the documentation; they often illustrate common pitfalls and effective solutions.  Furthermore, I strongly recommend delving into texts and online courses dedicated to advanced TensorFlow topics, focusing specifically on automatic differentiation and computational graph manipulation. Mastering these concepts is vital for resolving issues concerning gradient computation within complex TensorFlow applications.  Reviewing open-source projects which utilize TensorFlow extensively can also provide valuable insights into best practices.  Finally, proficiency in debugging TensorFlow code using tools such as `tf.debugging` utilities will enhance your troubleshooting abilities significantly.
