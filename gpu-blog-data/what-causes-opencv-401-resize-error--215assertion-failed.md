The OpenCV 4.0.1 `resize` function's assertion error (-215:Assertion failed) !dsize.empty() typically arises from an invalid or missing output size specification. My experience troubleshooting image processing pipelines, particularly those migrating across OpenCV versions, has consistently pointed to the criticality of explicitly defining the `dsize` parameter when not providing scale factors.  Specifically, this error indicates that the destination size (`dsize`) argument passed to `cv::resize` is either empty, improperly constructed, or not provided when neither `fx` nor `fy` (scale factors) are utilized. This signals a fundamental misunderstanding of how OpenCV determines output dimensions during resizing operations.

The `cv::resize` function in OpenCV, when used without explicit scale factors `fx` and `fy`, relies entirely on the `dsize` parameter to determine the target image dimensions. This `dsize` parameter is a `cv::Size` object which encapsulates the target width and height. An empty or improperly configured `cv::Size` object results in the assertion failure, as the function has no way of determining the desired output resolution. Furthermore, if only scale factors are supplied and `dsize` is not set, OpenCV will implicitly calculate output size from the product of scale and source dimensions. When both scale factors are zero and `dsize` is unset, or a combination of scale factors is set and `dsize` is explicitly set to empty or invalid, this assertion will trigger. Incorrect handling or propagation of size specifications is a common source of this error, often stemming from incomplete parameter validation within the larger application context. It's imperative to examine the surrounding code to ensure that the `cv::Size` object passed as `dsize` is valid and contains the intended dimensions before calling the resize function. The root cause typically involves insufficient error checking or data transformation failures upstream that impact the construction of the `dsize`.

To illustrate, consider the following scenarios which produce the error and its appropriate fixes:

**Code Example 1: Empty `dsize` Object**

```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    cv::Mat image = cv::imread("input.jpg", cv::IMREAD_COLOR); // Ensure 'input.jpg' exists

    if (image.empty()) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Could not load image." << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }

    cv::Size dsize; // Empty dsize; Causes error
    cv::Mat resized_image;
    
    try{
        cv::resize(image, resized_image, dsize); // This will throw -215 assertion
    }
    catch(const cv::Exception& e){
        std::cerr << "OpenCV Exception caught: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
   
    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* In this example, an empty `cv::Size` object, `dsize`, is declared without initialization.  When `cv::resize` is called with this empty object as the `dsize` parameter, and neither `fx` nor `fy` scale factors were provided, the assertion error is thrown as the output dimensions are undefined.  The `try`/`catch` block demonstrates how OpenCV exceptions can be caught for better error handling, providing more informative debug information. The core error here is the lack of dimensional data when using the `dsize` parameter alone.

**Code Example 2: Correct Usage of `dsize`**

```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    cv::Mat image = cv::imread("input.jpg", cv::IMREAD_COLOR); // Ensure 'input.jpg' exists

    if (image.empty()) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Could not load image." << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }

    cv::Size dsize(image.cols/2, image.rows/2); // Correct dsize
    cv::Mat resized_image;
    
    try{
        cv::resize(image, resized_image, dsize);
         cv::imwrite("resized_output.jpg", resized_image);
    }
    catch(const cv::Exception& e){
         std::cerr << "OpenCV Exception caught: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }
    

    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* This corrected example initializes the `dsize` object with a valid width and height, specifically half of the original image’s dimensions. Now, `cv::resize` has a valid destination size and the assertion is avoided.  I’ve found that explicitly creating a size based on some calculation of the original image parameters tends to be the most robust approach to debugging these issues. This example also includes a save of the output image, which is useful for debugging purposes.

**Code Example 3: Error Propagation from Invalid Size Calculation**

```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <iostream>

// Hypothetical function that can result in size error
cv::Size calculate_size(int factor) {
    if(factor <= 0)
        return cv::Size(); // Returns empty size due to invalid factor

     return cv::Size(100 * factor, 100 * factor);
}

int main() {
    cv::Mat image = cv::imread("input.jpg", cv::IMREAD_COLOR); // Ensure 'input.jpg' exists

    if (image.empty()) {
        std::cerr << "Error: Could not load image." << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }
   
    int factor = 0; // Intentionally invalid factor
    cv::Size calculated_size = calculate_size(factor);
    cv::Mat resized_image;

    try{
       cv::resize(image, resized_image, calculated_size);
    }
     catch(const cv::Exception& e){
        std::cerr << "OpenCV Exception caught: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

*Commentary:* This example illustrates a common issue: an intermediate function, `calculate_size`, produces an empty `cv::Size` object because of a flawed calculation or invalid input (`factor`). This result propagates to `cv::resize`, causing the familiar assertion failure. This situation showcases how error handling must extend beyond the immediate call to `cv::resize` to address the root source. It highlights the importance of meticulously examining data flow throughout the program to ensure that size specifications are consistently valid. I’ve spent hours tracking down similar issues in larger image processing pipelines.

In summary, the `(-215:Assertion failed) !dsize.empty()` error indicates the `dsize` parameter of `cv::resize` is not properly initialized with target dimensions when scale factors are not provided. The solution involves ensuring `dsize` is initialized with valid `cv::Size` object that dictates the target width and height before calling `cv::resize`. Error checking should extend beyond the immediate call to include data transformations and upstream calculations related to `dsize` preparation. Proper error handling in the form of `try`-`catch` blocks is essential for identifying the source of such issues, and proper debugging of intermediate values using tools like IDE debuggers is crucial.

For a deeper understanding of OpenCV's image processing modules, including `resize`, I recommend exploring the official OpenCV documentation. Resources such as "Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision in C++ with the OpenCV Library" by Gary Bradski and Adrian Kaehler, and "OpenCV 4 for Secret Agents" by Joseph Howse provide a practical approach to understanding the usage of these functions and debugging common issues, particularly with regards to handling sizes and related data structures. These books offer comprehensive coverage on the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementation details of common image processing routines. Additionally, online tutorials and resources such as the OpenCV website, provide detailed information and code examples on how to best use this functionality.
