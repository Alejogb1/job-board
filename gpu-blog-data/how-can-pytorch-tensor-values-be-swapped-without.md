The core challenge in swapping PyTorch tensor values without affecting the original tensor and maintaining gradient tracking lies in understanding PyTorch's computational graph and the distinction between in-place operations and creating new tensors.  In-place operations (using methods like `tensor.add_`, `tensor.mul_`, etc.) modify the tensor directly, disrupting the gradient tracking mechanism.  Creating copies, while preserving the original, ensures gradients are correctly computed during backpropagation.  Over the years, I've encountered this in numerous projects involving complex neural network architectures, especially when implementing custom layers or loss functions requiring sophisticated tensor manipulation.

My approach consistently involves leveraging PyTorch's cloning capabilities and the `detach()` method to achieve the desired behavior.  This approach guarantees that the original tensor remains untouched, preserving its computational history for accurate gradient calculation, while simultaneously allowing for manipulation of a detached copy.  Let's illustrate this with concrete examples.

**1. Cloning and Detached Swapping**

This method directly addresses the prompt by creating copies of the tensors before swapping.  It's the most straightforward approach for clarity and correctness, especially in scenarios where you need to retain the original tensor's gradient history for future operations within the model.

```python
import torch

# Initialize tensors;  Note: requires_grad=True for gradient tracking.
tensor_a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
tensor_b = torch.tensor([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], requires_grad=True)

# Create detached clones
tensor_a_copy = tensor_a.clone().detach()
tensor_b_copy = tensor_b.clone().detach()

# Swap values using a temporary variable.  Avoid in-place operations.
temp = tensor_a_copy.clone()
tensor_a_copy = tensor_b_copy
tensor_b_copy = temp

# Verify the original tensors remain unchanged.
print("Original tensor_a:", tensor_a)
print("Original tensor_b:", tensor_b)

# Perform operations on the swapped copies
result = tensor_a_copy.sum() + tensor_b_copy.mean()
result.backward()

# Verify that gradients are correctly computed for original tensors.
print("Gradient of tensor_a:", tensor_a.grad)
print("Gradient of tensor_b:", tensor_b.grad)

#Illustrates that gradients are calculated on the original tensors, not their copies.
```

The `detach()` method is crucial here.  It disconnects the copy from the computation graph, preventing unintended gradient modifications to the original tensors during backpropagation. The `clone()` method, in contrast, creates a copy that retains the `requires_grad` property.  Direct assignment (`tensor_a_copy = tensor_b_copy`) efficiently swaps the references without explicit looping.


**2.  Indexed Assignment with Detached Copies (Advanced)**

This technique is more nuanced and useful when swapping specific elements within tensors rather than entire tensors.  It's particularly applicable in situations involving sparse tensor updates or when dealing with high-dimensional data where cloning entire tensors becomes computationally expensive.

```python
import torch

tensor_c = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]], requires_grad=True)
tensor_d = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]], requires_grad=True)

# Indices to swap
indices = (0, 0)  #Swap the top left element

#Create copies and detach them.
tensor_c_copy = tensor_c.clone().detach()
tensor_d_copy = tensor_d.clone().detach()

# Swap elements at specified indices using advanced indexing.
temp_value = tensor_c_copy[indices].clone()
tensor_c_copy[indices] = tensor_d_copy[indices]
tensor_d_copy[indices] = temp_value

print("Original tensor_c:", tensor_c)
print("Original tensor_d:", tensor_d)
print("Modified tensor_c_copy:", tensor_c_copy)
print("Modified tensor_d_copy:", tensor_d_copy)

#Further operations on copies
result = torch.sum(tensor_c_copy)

result.backward()
print("tensor_c.grad:", tensor_c.grad)
print("tensor_d.grad:", tensor_d.grad)


```

This demonstrates efficient element-wise swapping without unnecessary copying of the entire tensor. Advanced indexing and the `clone()`/`detach()` combination is a powerful tool for precise manipulations within tensors.


**3.  Using `torch.where` for Conditional Swapping**

This method is particularly elegant when the swap condition is not straightforward, such as exchanging elements based on a mask or a threshold.  It's computationally efficient and integrates well with other PyTorch operations.

```python
import torch

tensor_e = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)
tensor_f = torch.tensor([5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0], requires_grad=True)

# Condition: swap elements where tensor_e > 2
condition = tensor_e > 2

# Create detached copies
tensor_e_copy = tensor_e.clone().detach()
tensor_f_copy = tensor_f.clone().detach()


tensor_e_copy = torch.where(condition, tensor_f_copy, tensor_e_copy)
tensor_f_copy = torch.where(condition, tensor_e, tensor_f_copy)


print("Original tensor_e:", tensor_e)
print("Original tensor_f:", tensor_f)
print("Modified tensor_e_copy:", tensor_e_copy)
print("Modified tensor_f_copy:", tensor_f_copy)

#Further operations
result = torch.sum(tensor_e_copy)
result.backward()
print("tensor_e.grad:", tensor_e.grad)
print("tensor_f.grad:", tensor_f.grad)


```

`torch.where` facilitates conditional swapping based on the `condition` tensor.  This approach can be very effective for tasks such as applying a mask, thresholding operations and more complex swapping rules.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on automatic differentiation and tensor operations, is invaluable.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning (specifically one that covers PyTorch implementation details) would provide a strong theoretical foundation.  Furthermore, exploration of PyTorch's source code (for those comfortable with C++) can offer deep insights into the internal mechanisms of tensor operations and gradient computations.  Finally, reviewing advanced tutorials and research papers on custom PyTorch layers and loss functions offers practical knowledge regarding tensor manipulation in complex contexts.
