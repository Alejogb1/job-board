TensorFlow's reporting of mismatched array sizes typically stems from inconsistencies between the expected shapes of tensors and their actual shapes during computation.  This discrepancy doesn't necessarily indicate a bug in TensorFlow itself, but rather an error in the data pipeline or the model's architecture, frequently related to batching, reshaping, or dynamic tensor creation.  I've encountered this issue countless times over the years in various projects, ranging from simple image classification to complex reinforcement learning environments. The root cause is often subtle, requiring careful examination of data flow and tensor manipulations.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core problem lies in the mismatch between the tensor shapes TensorFlow *expects* at a specific operation and the shapes it *actually receives*.  This expectation is often implicitly defined within the model's architecture (e.g., through layer definitions) or explicitly set during data preprocessing or tensor manipulation steps.  A mismatch can arise from several sources:

* **Incorrect Data Preprocessing:**  If the input data isn't properly shaped or batched before feeding it to the model, the tensors passed to the layers will have unexpected dimensions. For instance, if a model expects input tensors of shape (batch_size, 28, 28, 1) (for example, MNIST images), but receives tensors of shape (28, 28, 1), or even (batch_size, 28, 28), TensorFlow will raise an error because the layers are designed to work with the specific expected shape.

* **Layer Misconfiguration:** Defining layers with incompatible input/output shapes within the model itself can also cause these errors. For example, if a convolutional layer's output is fed into a densely connected layer without flattening the output, the shape mismatch will trigger an error.

* **Dynamic Tensor Shapes:** When working with variable-length sequences or dynamically shaped inputs, careful handling is crucial. If the shape of tensors changes unexpectedly during runtime (e.g., due to conditional logic), it's imperative to ensure that subsequent operations are compatible with the potential range of shapes.  Lack of proper shape validation can lead to runtime mismatches.

* **Incorrect Reshaping Operations:** Operations like `tf.reshape` or `tf.transpose` are frequent culprits. A simple typo or misunderstanding of the intended shape can result in incorrectly reshaped tensors, leading to mismatches further down the pipeline.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Preprocessing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect data preprocessing: Missing batch dimension
images = tf.random.normal((100, 28, 28)) #Shape is (100,28,28), expected is (100,28,28,1) for MNIST

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# This will throw a shape mismatch error because the input shape is (100, 28, 28) instead of (100, 28, 28, 1).
model.predict(images) 
```

This example demonstrates how omitting the channel dimension in the image data will cause a shape mismatch. The `Conv2D` layer expects a 4D tensor, but receives a 3D tensor.  Adding  `images = tf.expand_dims(images, axis=-1)` before passing it to the model would rectify this.


**Example 2: Layer Misconfiguration**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  # Missing Flatten layer; output of MaxPooling2D is still 4D
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') 
])

images = tf.random.normal((100, 28, 28, 1))
# This will throw a shape mismatch error because the Dense layer expects a 2D input, not a 4D input.
model.predict(images)
```

This highlights an issue where the output of a convolutional layer (4D tensor) is directly fed into a dense layer.  The `Dense` layer requires a flattened 2D input, hence the need for a `tf.keras.layers.Flatten()` layer between the pooling and the dense layer.


**Example 3: Incorrect Reshaping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 20))

# Incorrect reshape: Attempting to reshape into an incompatible shape
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, (5, 5)) #Will cause ValueError: Cannot reshape a tensor with 200 elements to shape [5,5](10 elements)


#Correct reshape
correct_reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor,(2,100))

print(correct_reshaped_tensor.shape)

```

This example showcases a common error in reshaping tensors.  The total number of elements must remain constant after reshaping. Attempting to reshape a 10x20 tensor into a 5x5 tensor is invalid because it changes the total number of elements.  Always double-check the total number of elements before and after reshaping.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest revisiting the official TensorFlow documentation on tensor manipulation and layer definitions.  Pay close attention to shape parameters and use debugging tools like TensorFlow's debugger (`tfdbg`) or Python's debugger (`pdb`) to inspect tensor shapes at various points within your code. Mastering the `tf.shape` function is also essential for runtime shape verification and debugging.  Finally, familiarize yourself with best practices for handling variable-length sequences and dynamic shapes.  Careful planning and rigorous testing, especially involving various input sizes, are invaluable in preventing these types of errors.
