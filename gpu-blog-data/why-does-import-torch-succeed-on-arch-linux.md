The discrepancy in `import torch` success between Arch Linux and CentOS 7 often stems from differing default Python installations and package management approaches, coupled with variations in available PyTorch wheels.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous Linux distributions points to this core problem.  Let's examine the underlying causes and solutions.

**1. Python Version and Installation Method:**

Arch Linux typically employs a more modern Python installation, often handled via its package manager, `pacman`.  This usually ensures consistent system-wide Python versions and straightforward dependency management.  CentOS 7, on the other hand, often uses a more conservative approach, potentially retaining an older default Python 2.7 alongside a separately installed Python 3.x. This dual installation can create conflicts, especially concerning environment variables, library paths, and virtual environment configurations.  The PyTorch wheel, a pre-built distribution, may be incompatible with the system's default Python or the specific Python version used by the user.

**2. Package Managers and Dependencies:**

`pacman`'s dependency resolution and transaction management are usually more robust than those found in CentOS 7's `yum`.  If PyTorch relies on specific versions of CUDA, cuDNN (for GPU acceleration), or other libraries, `yum` might not properly resolve the dependencies or might present older versions incompatible with the desired PyTorch build.  Inconsistencies in the available package versions or missing dependencies will lead to import failures.  Furthermore, if PyTorch is installed outside the system's package manager—for instance, through `pip`—managing dependencies becomes even more critical and failure points arise easily.

**3.  PyTorch Wheel Compatibility:**

PyTorch releases specific wheels (`.whl` files) targeting various Python versions, operating systems, and hardware architectures.  The wheel must precisely match the system's Python version, architecture (e.g., x86_64, aarch64), and CUDA capabilities.  CentOS 7's older kernel and the potential absence of newer CUDA drivers might mean that available PyTorch wheels aren't compatible.  Arch Linux, with its rolling-release model, often offers newer kernel versions and readily updated CUDA drivers, thus increasing the likelihood of finding a compatible wheel.

**Code Examples & Commentary:**

Below are three code examples demonstrating different scenarios and solutions:

**Example 1:  Verifying Python Version and Installation:**

```python
import sys
print(sys.version)
print(sys.executable)
import platform
print(platform.system(), platform.release())
```

**Commentary:** This simple script verifies the Python version (`sys.version`), the Python executable path (`sys.executable`), and the operating system information (`platform.system()`, `platform.release()`). This crucial information helps determine compatibility issues with PyTorch wheels.  During troubleshooting, I often found that `sys.executable` pointed to an unexpected Python binary on CentOS 7, highlighting a conflict between different Python installations.

**Example 2: Using a Virtual Environment (recommended):**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
```

**Commentary:** This script creates a virtual environment, activates it, installs PyTorch using `pip`, and verifies the installation by printing the version number.  Utilizing virtual environments isolates the PyTorch installation and its dependencies, preventing conflicts with system-wide packages.  This approach significantly reduced the incidence of import errors across various projects.  In my experience, the `pip install` often needs additional arguments (like specifying CUDA version) depending on the desired PyTorch configuration.


**Example 3:  Installing PyTorch via a Package Manager (Arch Linux example):**

```bash
sudo pacman -S python-torch torchvision torchaudio
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates how Arch Linux's package manager, `pacman`, can directly install PyTorch, along with `torchvision` and `torchaudio`.  This often results in a cleaner and more integrated installation, ensuring dependency consistency.  On CentOS 7, using `yum` or `dnf` might require navigating complexities with repository configuration, especially when CUDA is involved.  Successful installation will depend on having the correct repositories enabled and updated.


**Resource Recommendations:**

1.  The official PyTorch website's installation instructions.  Pay close attention to the specific instructions for your operating system and hardware configuration, including CUDA support if applicable.

2.  The documentation for your specific Linux distribution's package manager (e.g., `pacman` for Arch Linux, `yum` or `dnf` for CentOS 7).  Understanding how to manage dependencies and resolve conflicts is vital.

3.  Consult the relevant documentation for CUDA and cuDNN if utilizing GPU acceleration.  Confirm driver versions and compatibility with your chosen PyTorch version.


In summary, resolving the discrepancy in `import torch` success between Arch Linux and CentOS 7 demands a close examination of Python installation methods, package management approaches, and PyTorch wheel compatibility.  Utilizing virtual environments and carefully following the official PyTorch installation instructions for your specific system are crucial steps in ensuring a successful installation.  Understanding the differences between the respective package managers and their dependency resolution mechanisms is key to diagnosing and fixing the issue effectively.  My extensive experience resolving these kinds of compatibility conflicts emphasizes the importance of meticulous attention to these details.
