The size and shape of a TensorFlow `MapDataset` derived from `tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset` aren't directly ascertainable through a single attribute.  Instead, it's a function of the underlying CSV file's structure and the transformations applied within the `MapDataset`.  My experience working with large-scale datasets for image classification and natural language processing projects has reinforced this understanding: the dataset's characteristics are dynamic, determined at runtime by the data and the mapping function.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

`tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset` creates a `Dataset` object where each element is a dictionary.  The keys of this dictionary correspond to the column names in your CSV, and the values are the respective column entries for a given row.  The inherent size – the number of elements – is determined solely by the number of rows in your input CSV.  However, the shape of each element (the dictionary) is dictated by the number of columns and their data types.  Crucially, the `MapDataset` transforms this initial structure.  A mapping function applied via `.map()` can alter the shape and even the type of each element.  This means the shape isn't a fixed property but rather dependent on the transformation logic.

For instance, if your CSV has columns "feature1", "feature2", and "label", the initial `Dataset` will yield dictionaries like `{'feature1': value1, 'feature2': value2, 'label': value3}`.  Applying a `.map()` function that converts "feature1" and "feature2" into tensors, say, of shape (10,) would reshape that element to contain tensors instead of scalars.  Further, if your map function added a new computed feature, the dictionary's size would expand.  Therefore, determining the size and shape post-mapping requires understanding both the input CSV and the specific transformations applied.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic CSV Loading and Shape Inspection:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'data.csv' exists with columns 'feature1', 'feature2', 'label'
dataset = tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset(
    'data.csv',
    batch_size=32,  # Batching influences observed shape during iteration
    label_name='label',
    num_epochs=1
)

# Inspect the shape of a single batch
for batch in dataset:
    print(batch)  # Observe keys and shapes; they may vary depending on data types in CSV
    for key, value in batch.items():
        print(f"Key: {key}, Shape: {value.shape}")
        break #Only check the shape of the first column of the first batch for brevity.
    break # Break after the first batch for brevity.


```

This example demonstrates obtaining a `Dataset` and inspecting the shape of a *batch* of data.  The crucial point is that the shape isn't inherent to a single data point but rather to a batch.  The batch size is a parameter we control. Note that `num_epochs=1` ensures the dataset is processed only once; otherwise, the loop would continue indefinitely.  The output reveals the structure of a batch; the inner shape of tensors in the batch reflects the data types and the mapping function (if any).


**Example 2:  Mapping Function to Modify Shape:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

dataset = tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset(
    'data.csv',
    batch_size=32,
    label_name='label',
    num_epochs=1
)

def transform(features, label):
    features['feature1'] = tf.reshape(tf.cast(features['feature1'], tf.float32), (1, -1))
    return features, label

transformed_dataset = dataset.map(transform)

for batch in transformed_dataset:
    print(batch) # Observe the change in the shape of 'feature1' due to reshaping.
    for key, value in batch.items():
        print(f"Key: {key}, Shape: {value.shape}")
        break #Only check the shape of the first column of the first batch for brevity.
    break # Break after the first batch for brevity.
```

Here, the `.map()` function modifies the shape of the "feature1" column by reshaping it into a 1D tensor.  The output will clearly illustrate this alteration in the shape of the `feature1` element within the dictionary structure.  The rest of the dataset's properties remain largely unaffected, except for the potentially updated shape of a single element of a batch.  Note that error handling for data type consistency would be needed in production-level code.



**Example 3: Adding a Computed Feature:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

dataset = tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset(
    'data.csv',
    batch_size=32,
    label_name='label',
    num_epochs=1
)

def add_feature(features, label):
    features['feature3'] = features['feature1'] + features['feature2']
    return features, label

augmented_dataset = dataset.map(add_feature)

for batch in augmented_dataset:
    print(batch) #Observe that a new key 'feature3' is now present.
    for key, value in batch.items():
        print(f"Key: {key}, Shape: {value.shape}")
        break #Only check the shape of the first column of the first batch for brevity.
    break # Break after the first batch for brevity.

```

This example showcases how adding a new feature expands the dictionary structure of each element.  "feature3" will have the shape influenced by the data types of "feature1" and "feature2". The resultant shape is dependent on the underlying data and the calculations performed within the `add_feature` function.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data`, specifically the sections detailing `Dataset` transformations and the `make_csv_dataset` function.  A comprehensive text on data structures and algorithms would provide a solid theoretical foundation for understanding data manipulations efficiently.  Finally, reviewing examples and tutorials related to data preprocessing and augmentation in TensorFlow will offer valuable practical insight into common shape manipulations within `MapDataset` contexts.  These resources provide the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge to effectively handle diverse scenarios encountered when working with `make_csv_dataset` and its transformations.
