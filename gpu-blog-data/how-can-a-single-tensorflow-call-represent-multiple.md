The inherent difficulty in representing multiple normal priors within a single TensorFlow call for Bayesian logistic regression stems from the need to manage correlated or independent prior distributions efficiently.  My experience working on large-scale Bayesian inference projects highlighted the computational inefficiencies arising from naive implementations.  Directly incorporating multiple independent priors often necessitates looping structures or inefficient tensor manipulations, hindering scalability.  However, leveraging TensorFlow's inherent vectorization capabilities and appropriate probability distribution parameterizations, a concise and computationally efficient single-call solution becomes feasible.

**1. Explanation:**

Bayesian logistic regression aims to infer posterior distributions over the model parameters (weights and bias) given observed data and prior beliefs.  The prior belief is typically represented as a probability distribution over the model parameters.  When we have multiple parameters, and we wish to model them with different normal priors (e.g., each weight has its own prior mean and variance), a naive approach would involve separate TensorFlow operations for each prior.  This is inefficient and scales poorly with the number of parameters.

The key to achieving a single-call representation lies in exploiting TensorFlow's ability to perform operations on tensors. We can represent all prior parameters (means and variances for each weight and the bias) as tensors. The shape of these tensors is crucial: the first dimension should correspond to the number of parameters, while the second dimension (if needed) accommodates the parameters of each prior distribution (mean and standard deviation).  Then, the probability density function (PDF) of the multivariate normal distribution can be computed in a vectorized manner, resulting in a single TensorFlow operation to evaluate the prior's contribution to the posterior. This vectorized approach avoids explicit loops, significantly improving computational efficiency, especially with high-dimensional parameter spaces.

Crucially, the choice between independent and correlated priors influences the tensor structure. Independent priors imply a diagonal covariance matrix, simplifying the calculations. Correlated priors require a full covariance matrix, increasing the computational cost but providing the flexibility to capture dependencies between parameters.  The log-probability of the priors is then included within the overall loss function to perform posterior inference via methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Variational Inference (VI).

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Independent Normal Priors**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

# Number of parameters (weights and bias)
num_params = 10

# Prior parameters: means and standard deviations for each parameter
prior_means = tf.random.normal([num_params])
prior_stds = tf.ones([num_params])  # For simplicity, all stds are 1

# Model parameters (initialised randomly)
params = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([num_params]))

# Define the prior distribution (independent normals)
prior = tfp.distributions.Normal(loc=prior_means, scale=prior_stds)

# Compute the log-probability of the prior (vectorized)
log_prior = tf.reduce_sum(prior.log_prob(params))

# ... (Rest of the Bayesian logistic regression model, including likelihood and loss function)
```

This example leverages `tfp.distributions.Normal` to create a batch of normal distributions, one for each parameter.  The `log_prob` method is then applied to the entire parameter vector, producing a vector of log-probabilities, subsequently summed for the overall prior log-likelihood. This is a single TensorFlow call, encompassing all prior calculations.


**Example 2: Correlated Normal Priors**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

# Number of parameters
num_params = 5

# Prior mean vector
prior_mean = tf.random.normal([num_params])

# Prior covariance matrix (must be positive definite)
prior_cov = tf.eye(num_params) + tf.random.normal([num_params, num_params]) # add noise for non-diagonal
prior_cov = tf.linalg.set_diag(prior_cov, tf.abs(tf.linalg.diag_part(prior_cov))) #ensure positive diagonal


# Model parameters
params = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([num_params]))

# Define the prior distribution (multivariate normal)
prior = tfp.distributions.MultivariateNormalFullCovariance(loc=prior_mean, covariance_matrix=prior_cov)

# Compute the log-probability of the prior (single call)
log_prior = prior.log_prob(params)

# ... (Rest of the Bayesian logistic regression model)

```

Here, `tfp.distributions.MultivariateNormalFullCovariance` handles the correlated case.  The entire prior log-probability is calculated in a single TensorFlow operation using `log_prob`. The covariance matrix captures the dependencies between parameters. Note that ensuring the covariance matrix is positive definite is critical for valid probability calculations.


**Example 3:  Mixture of Normal Priors**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

num_params = 3
num_mixtures = 2

# Prior parameters for each mixture component
prior_means = tf.random.normal([num_mixtures, num_params])
prior_stds = tf.ones([num_mixtures, num_params])

# Mixture weights (must sum to 1)
mixture_weights = tf.constant([0.6, 0.4]) #Example weights

# Model parameters
params = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([num_params]))

# Define mixture components
components = [tfp.distributions.Normal(loc=prior_means[i], scale=prior_stds[i]) for i in range(num_mixtures)]

# Define the mixture distribution
prior = tfp.distributions.Mixture(cat=tfp.distributions.Categorical(probs=mixture_weights), components=components)

# Compute the log-probability of the prior
log_prior = prior.log_prob(params)

# ... (Rest of the Bayesian logistic regression model)
```
This example shows how to incorporate a mixture of Gaussians as a prior.  Each component is defined separately, then combined using `tfp.distributions.Mixture`, allowing for more complex prior specifications within a single TensorFlow call for log-probability computation.

In summary, by leveraging TensorFlow's tensor operations and appropriate probability distributions from TensorFlow Probability,  the incorporation of multiple normal priors (independent or correlated, or even mixtures thereof) into Bayesian logistic regression can be achieved within a single, computationally efficient TensorFlow call, bypassing the inefficiencies of iterative approaches.  The key is careful design of tensor shapes to represent prior parameters and the selection of suitable TensorFlow Probability distributions to match the chosen prior structure.
