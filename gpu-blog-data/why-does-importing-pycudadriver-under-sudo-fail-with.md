The root cause of encountering "libcurand.so.10: cannot open shared object file" when importing `pycuda.driver` under `sudo` stems from discrepancies in the environment variables, particularly `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, between the user account and the root account. Specifically, the libraries required by CUDA, like `libcurand.so.10`, are not accessible to the Python process when it's elevated to root privileges. This discrepancy occurs because `sudo` often executes commands with a minimized environment for security reasons, not inheriting user-defined shell configurations.

When a regular user installs CUDA, the necessary library paths are usually appended to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` within that user's shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`). When `python`, or a Python script importing `pycuda`, is executed by that user, the CUDA libraries are readily discoverable. However, when `sudo` is employed, it often resets or modifies environment variables, causing the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to revert to a default setting, thereby removing the location of the CUDA libraries. As a result, `pycuda.driver`, internally relying on these CUDA libraries, cannot locate `libcurand.so.10`, resulting in the failure. This is not an issue of PyCUDA or CUDAâ€™s installation being flawed; rather, the execution environment lacks the required information.

The `sudo` command, by design, provides a clean execution environment. This security feature is to prevent unintended variable exposure, such as the potential hijacking of user-specific configurations or modifications. When using sudo, only a select few environment variables are passed to the elevated execution, specifically those considered safe. The absence of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, or an incomplete one, is thus deliberate and standard behavior of the command.

Here are three Python code examples illustrating common scenarios and resolutions, along with detailed explanations of each context:

**Example 1: Demonstrating the failure under sudo**

```python
# File: cuda_import_failure.py
import pycuda.driver as cuda
print("CUDA Driver imported successfully")
```

Running this script as a regular user:

```bash
python cuda_import_failure.py
```
would likely succeed given that the user's `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` contains paths to CUDA libraries. However, executing it with sudo:
```bash
sudo python cuda_import_failure.py
```
would result in the `ImportError: libcurand.so.10: cannot open shared object file` error.
**Commentary:** This example clearly shows the problematic scenario. The error occurs specifically when the script is executed under sudo, highlighting that the user's normal shell environment is not transferred and the library path needed is not automatically included.

**Example 2: Explicitly setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH within the sudo command**
```python
# File: cuda_import_success.py
import os
import pycuda.driver as cuda
print("CUDA Driver imported successfully")
```
Executing this script with `sudo` by directly providing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
```bash
sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64 python cuda_import_success.py
```
This command sets the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` within the scope of the sudo execution, pointing to the directory where the CUDA libraries, including `libcurand.so.10`, are typically located.  Note that the exact path `/usr/local/cuda/lib64` is only an example and the actual CUDA library path may vary. This approach works well in a one-time basis, or simple executions but might not be suitable for more complicated executions.
**Commentary:** This demonstrates one method of overcoming the error. We pass the required library path to sudo, allowing the Python script to locate `libcurand.so.10`.  This is a direct solution, but it requires knowing the exact location of CUDA libraries and is not a persistent fix.

**Example 3: Modifying the sudoers file (less recommended for standard users)**

```bash
sudo visudo
```
Within the editor, add the following line (replacing user with the actual user name):
```
Defaults        env_keep += "LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
Defaults:user  env_keep += "LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```
Then attempt to execute the script again under sudo. This should no longer throw the error.

```bash
sudo python cuda_import_success.py
```
**Commentary:** This approach enables `sudo` to pass the user's `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the executed command. This solution should be used cautiously, because this may violate the intended security implementation of `sudo`.  Modifying the `sudoers` file should be done with care, as mistakes can lead to system instability or security issues.  A better practice is to use the solution in Example 2 if your use case is not overly complex, or if you do not have the ability to modify `sudoers`.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a more comprehensive understanding of how the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` impacts program execution, especially regarding dynamic libraries, examine documentation regarding shared libraries and dynamic linking principles within Linux system administration resources.

For guidance on managing environment variables effectively, consult documentation on environment variables within your operating system's command-line documentation (e.g., `man bash` or `man zsh`). These documents often include the scope, precedence and usage of variables such as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

For safe `sudo` usage, consider consulting documentation on the `sudo` command itself (e.g., `man sudo` or `man sudoers`). This can provide a deeper understanding of its security features, implications, and safe modification practices.  The documentation on the `env_keep` option in `sudo` configuration would also be helpful.
Understanding these core concepts and how `sudo` handles environment variables is crucial when working with libraries that rely on dynamic linking, especially those that rely on environment settings specific to users. It's advisable to prioritize maintaining a secure and predictable system when adjusting user environment settings.  The key is to provide the needed information in the execution context.
