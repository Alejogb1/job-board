TensorFlow 2's lack of a built-in mechanism for directly logging weight norms during training necessitates a custom solution.  My experience developing and deploying large-scale neural networks highlights the importance of meticulous monitoring, and weight norm tracking is crucial for diagnosing issues like exploding or vanishing gradients and understanding model behavior.  Directly accessing and recording these norms requires leveraging TensorFlow's custom callback functionality and its tensor manipulation capabilities.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The approach involves creating a custom TensorFlow callback. This callback will hook into the training loop at specific intervals (e.g., after each epoch or a specified number of steps).  Within the callback, we'll access the model's weights using the `model.layers` attribute.  Each layer typically holds its weights as a `tf.Variable`.  We then compute the desired norm (e.g., L1, L2, or Frobenius norm) for each weight tensor. Finally, we log these norms using TensorFlow's built-in logging functionality or by writing them to a file for later analysis.  Efficient computation is critical, especially with large models, thus we'll utilize TensorFlow's optimized tensor operations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Logging L2 Norms After Each Epoch**

This example demonstrates logging the L2 norm of all weight tensors after each epoch.  It utilizes TensorFlow's `tf.norm` function for efficient computation and the `csv` module for straightforward data storage.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import csv

class WeightNormCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, log_file):
        super(WeightNormCallback, self).__init__()
        self.log_file = log_file

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        with open(self.log_file, 'a', newline='') as csvfile:
            writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
            writer.writerow([epoch])  #Epoch number
            for layer in self.model.layers:
                if hasattr(layer, 'kernel'): #Check for existence of weights
                    norm = tf.norm(layer.kernel).numpy()
                    writer.writerow([layer.name, norm])

#Example usage
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

log_file = 'weight_norms.csv'
with open(log_file, 'w', newline='') as csvfile: #Create the log file initially
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(['Epoch', 'Layer', 'L2 Norm']) #Header for the csv

callback = WeightNormCallback(log_file)
model.fit(np.random.rand(100,10), np.random.rand(100,10), epochs=10, callbacks=[callback])
```

This code defines a callback that iterates through layers, extracts kernel weights (if present), computes the L2 norm, and appends the results to a CSV file.  The `hasattr` check handles layers without trainable weights.  The file is created and its header written before training begins.  Error handling could be further improved for production scenarios.


**Example 2: Logging Multiple Norms at Specified Intervals**

This example extends the functionality to log both L1 and L2 norms at specific training steps, offering a more granular view of weight evolution.  It leverages TensorFlow's `tf.summary` for logging within TensorBoard.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MultiNormCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, log_dir, interval=100):
        super(MultiNormCallback, self).__init__()
        self.log_dir = log_dir
        self.interval = interval
        self.step = 0

    def on_train_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        self.step += 1
        if self.step % self.interval == 0:
            with tf.summary.create_file_writer(self.log_dir).as_default():
                for layer in self.model.layers:
                    if hasattr(layer, 'kernel'):
                        l1_norm = tf.norm(layer.kernel, ord=1)
                        l2_norm = tf.norm(layer.kernel, ord=2)
                        tf.summary.scalar(f'{layer.name}/l1_norm', l1_norm, step=self.step)
                        tf.summary.scalar(f'{layer.name}/l2_norm', l2_norm, step=self.step)

#Example Usage
log_dir = 'logs/scalar_example'
callback = MultiNormCallback(log_dir, interval=100)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='mse')
model.fit(np.random.rand(100,10), np.random.rand(100,1), epochs=10, callbacks=[callback])

```

This example uses `on_train_batch_end` for more frequent logging.  It employs TensorBoard for visualization, which allows for easier monitoring of the norm trends over time.  The `interval` parameter offers control over logging frequency.  The use of f-strings improves code readability.


**Example 3: Handling Bias Terms and Different Layer Types**

This example shows how to handle bias terms and different layer types (e.g., convolutional layers). It demonstrates a more robust approach to accessing layer weights, ensuring compatibility across various network architectures.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class RobustNormCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, log_dir):
        super(RobustNormCallback, self).__init__()
        self.log_dir = log_dir

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        with tf.summary.create_file_writer(self.log_dir).as_default():
            for layer in self.model.layers:
                for weight in layer.weights:
                    norm = tf.norm(weight)
                    tf.summary.scalar(f'{layer.name}/{weight.name}/l2_norm', norm, step=epoch)

#Example Usage
log_dir = 'logs/robust_norm'
callback = RobustNormCallback(log_dir)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='categorical_crossentropy')
model.fit(np.random.rand(100,28,28,1), np.random.rand(100,10), epochs=10, callbacks=[callback])
```

This code iterates through all weights within each layer, calculating and logging norms for both kernel and bias weights. Itâ€™s designed to be more flexible and adaptable to different network architectures. The use of `weight.name` for naming the summary ensures clarity in TensorBoard.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   TensorFlow documentation: The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on callbacks, tensor manipulation, and logging.
*   TensorBoard tutorials: TensorBoard is invaluable for visualizing training metrics, including the logged weight norms.  The tutorials provide guidance on effective visualization.
*   Advanced TensorFlow concepts:  Understanding concepts like custom training loops and eager execution can aid in creating more sophisticated monitoring solutions.  A strong grasp of linear algebra is also beneficial.



By employing these methods, you can effectively track weight norms during TensorFlow 2 training, leading to improved model understanding and troubleshooting capabilities.  Remember to adapt the code examples to your specific model architecture and monitoring requirements.  Thorough testing is crucial before deployment in a production environment.
