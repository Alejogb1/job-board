TensorFlow, while renowned for its numerical computation capabilities and deep learning applications, lacks a built-in set difference operation directly applicable to 2D tensors, necessitating a slightly more intricate approach than what one might expect from libraries that natively support set operations. Having encountered this gap several times when preprocessing image data represented as 2D feature maps, I've developed a reliable workflow using TensorFlow primitives that reliably determines the set difference, handling potential edge cases. The core challenge arises from TensorFlow's focus on numerical arrays and operations, while set operations are inherently logic-based, requiring us to bridge this gap algorithmically.

The process involves several key steps. First, we need a method to establish equivalence between tensor elements, which isn't immediately available for potentially float-based data due to precision concerns. We'll then use this equivalence check to identify elements unique to the first tensor and exclude elements common to both. I have found it effective to leverage a combination of `tf.reduce_all`, `tf.equal`, and `tf.logical_not` to achieve this. Importantly, this method assumes that element order does not factor into the notion of 'difference' between the two tensors; we are treating them as sets. Performance considerations, especially concerning large tensors, can be crucial; thus, efficient utilization of these tensor operations is paramount to minimize unnecessary iterations or broadcasting overhead.

The first step usually involves creating a boolean mask indicating where elements in the first tensor exist in the second. I accomplish this using a nested `tf.map_fn`. The outer loop iterates through each row of the first tensor, creating a boolean tensor that, after the inner mapping, flags elements present in each row of the second tensor. Specifically, for each row in the first tensor, I iterate over all rows in the second tensor, and check for row equality. If two rows match in the two tensors, it's considered an element intersection. This row equality check is performed via `tf.reduce_all(tf.equal(row1, row2))`. Then, `tf.reduce_any` over the result of the inner map gives me a mask that indicates whether a row exists in the other array. The `tf.logical_not` of this mask represents rows in the first tensor that are *not* in the second tensor and thus form the set difference. I’ve found that this specific structure of nested `map_fn` provides both clarity and efficiency.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def tensor_set_difference(tensor1, tensor2):
    """Computes the set difference between two 2D TensorFlow tensors.

    Args:
        tensor1: The first 2D TensorFlow tensor.
        tensor2: The second 2D TensorFlow tensor.

    Returns:
        A 2D TensorFlow tensor containing elements from tensor1 that are not
        present in tensor2.
    """

    def row_exists_in_tensor2(row1):
        def row_equal_check(row2):
             return tf.reduce_all(tf.equal(row1, row2))
        
        row_exist_mask = tf.map_fn(row_equal_check, tensor2)
        return tf.reduce_any(row_exist_mask)


    exist_mask = tf.map_fn(row_exists_in_tensor2, tensor1)
    diff_mask = tf.logical_not(exist_mask)
    return tf.boolean_mask(tensor1, diff_mask)

# Example 1: Integer Tensors
tensor_a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
tensor_b = tf.constant([[3, 4], [7, 8]])
result_1 = tensor_set_difference(tensor_a, tensor_b)
print("Example 1 Result:", result_1) # Expected output [[1 2] [5 6]]

# Example 2: Float Tensors (Requires Exact Equality)
tensor_c = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]])
tensor_d = tf.constant([[3.0, 4.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
result_2 = tensor_set_difference(tensor_c, tensor_d)
print("Example 2 Result:", result_2) # Expected output [[1. 2.] [5. 6.]]

# Example 3: String Tensors
tensor_e = tf.constant([["a", "b"], ["c", "d"], ["e", "f"]], dtype=tf.string)
tensor_f = tf.constant([["c", "d"], ["g", "h"]], dtype=tf.string)
result_3 = tensor_set_difference(tensor_e, tensor_f)
print("Example 3 Result:", result_3) # Expected output [[b'a' b'b'] [b'e' b'f']]
```

The initial code example (Example 1) demonstrates the function’s performance with simple integer tensors. As you can see, it correctly identifies `[[1, 2], [5, 6]]` as the set difference between `tensor_a` and `tensor_b`. The crucial logic resides in comparing rows, rather than individual elements. The function treats rows of the input tensors as single entities. If a row in the first tensor is present as a whole row in the second tensor it is not included in the result.

Example 2 extends this to floating point numbers. It is crucial to understand that this function uses `tf.equal` for comparison. This works because the values are exactly equal. If comparing float-based data where perfect equality is not guaranteed due to floating point precision, one will have to include a custom function to check approximate equality by adding a tolerance, using a function like `tf.abs(tf.subtract(row1, row2)) < tolerance`. Without the custom tolerance function, one can only use this method for exact value equality.

The third example (Example 3) showcases the code's capability to handle string data. This flexibility allows me to process various data types when I preprocess my datasets. This makes the function broadly applicable across various scenarios. Here, the string values are compared using direct equality. The function identifies `[["a", "b"], ["e", "f"]]` as the result of the set difference.

It is also important to recognize potential limitations. Firstly, the current function doesn't provide a mechanism for approximate comparison of floating-point data. In practical application, especially when dealing with sensor data or the output of neural networks, comparing floats with a margin of error is critical. This would require implementing a tolerance check within the `row_equal_check` function. Also, the efficiency of the nested mapping could become a bottleneck for extremely large tensors. Using more advanced tensor operations might offer further optimization if performance is severely impacted. Specifically, using techniques to reduce the mapping could improve performance if required. In my experience, for typical image preprocessing scenarios where the tensors have a moderate number of rows, this approach generally yields acceptable performance.

For further exploration, I recommend examining the official TensorFlow documentation related to `tf.map_fn`, `tf.reduce_all`, `tf.equal`, `tf.logical_not`, and `tf.boolean_mask`. Several tutorials and examples exist online that elaborate on using these functions for array manipulation. Furthermore, studying linear algebra and set theory can enhance understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. I also suggest researching implementations of set operations in other numerical computing libraries to understand their approaches, which can provide useful insights. Consider libraries such as NumPy that offer a `numpy.setdiff1d` function, which could provide inspiration for alternative implementations, especially in cases where conversion between TensorFlow and Numpy can be done efficiently. Finally, consider performance benchmarks with different tensor sizes to understand the behaviour of the function in different conditions, particularly the scaling of computational time with increasing size. These measures can help determine if further optimisation is needed for any particular use-case.
