The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) specification, while not directly exposing a mechanism for retrieving environment variables, defines a process where these variables become available to containers. My experience deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters has repeatedly demonstrated that accessing these variables relies on understanding the interaction between the CRI and the underlying container runtime. The CRI, essentially an API, orchestrates container lifecycle events, and environment variables are transmitted during container creation.

The CRI's focus is on *how* containers are run, not *what* data they possess post-creation. Thus, there isn't a function like `GetContainerEnvVars()` within the CRI API. Instead, the CRI transmits environment variables as part of the `ContainerConfig` structure during the `RunPodSandbox` and `CreateContainer` calls, or equivalent. The container runtime (e.g., containerd, CRI-O) then implements the mechanics of passing these variables down to the container process.

Specifically, within the `CreateContainerRequest`, there is a field named `Config` of type `ContainerConfig`. Inside this `ContainerConfig`, you’ll find a field `Envs` which is a slice of type `KeyValue`. Each `KeyValue` struct consists of two strings, `Key` and `Value`, which together represent a single environment variable. The container runtime implementation receives this information, maps the `KeyValue` array into the operating system’s environment variable mechanism during the container’s process startup. The key point here is that the container runtime handles the transfer of the environment variables; the CRI only facilitates their initial transmission during container creation.

Therefore, the question of 'accessing via the CRI' is slightly misleading. Post-creation, the CRI doesn’t provide a direct queryable method for environment variables. To get the environment variables, you interact with either the operating system inside the running container or using a specific API call through the container runtime if available which is container runtime implementation dependent..

Let's examine how these environment variables are specified and how we can theoretically observe this process at different levels. Note that for all examples, the language of the request could change based on the specific CRI implementation and library being used; this shows the core structure.

**Code Example 1: Hypothetical CRI Request (gRPC)**

This example illustrates how environment variables are included in the CRI request. Note that this is a simplified pseudo-code view of what a gRPC service call to a CRI implementation might look like, not an actual working code snippet. Assume that the CRI gRPC service is exposed through some interface named `RuntimeService`.

```protobuf
// Hypothetical proto definition for CRI
service RuntimeService {
  rpc CreateContainer(CreateContainerRequest) returns (CreateContainerResponse);
}

message KeyValue {
  string key = 1;
  string value = 2;
}

message ContainerConfig {
  string image = 1;
  repeated KeyValue envs = 2;
}


message CreateContainerRequest {
  string podSandboxId = 1;
  ContainerConfig config = 2;
}

message CreateContainerResponse {
  string containerId = 1;
}
```

*Commentary:*

In this example, a `CreateContainerRequest` is sent to `RuntimeService.CreateContainer()`. This request includes `podSandboxId` and a `ContainerConfig`. The `ContainerConfig` has the `envs` field, a repeated field of type `KeyValue`. The container runtime receives this request, unpacks the variables from the `envs` list, and applies them before starting the container. In a real-world context, this translation from CRI representation to operating system representation happens internally within the container runtime. Note this example is deliberately simplified; real messages contain much more data, such as mounts, and image pull credentials.

**Code Example 2: Example of Setting Environment Variables Through Kubernetes YAML**

This example is higher-level than the CRI itself, but it is how most Kubernetes users set environment variables. The Kubernetes API Server internally uses the CRI to instruct a node's container runtime on what action to take.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: my-image:latest
      env:
        - name: MY_VAR
          value: "my_value"
        - name: ANOTHER_VAR
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: my-config
              key: my-config-key
```

*Commentary:*

This Kubernetes Pod definition shows how environment variables `MY_VAR` and `ANOTHER_VAR` are set. `MY_VAR` has a static value of `"my_value"`. `ANOTHER_VAR`’s value is derived from a config map named “my-config” and the specific key `my-config-key`. Kubernetes, when instructed to create this pod, internally translates this specification into the `CreateContainerRequest` as specified in our first code example. Kubernetes' kubelet agent interacts with the CRI, passing the extracted variables via `ContainerConfig` to the container runtime. This example demonstrates where the `KeyValue` structures originally defined in the CRI example become defined for a workload.

**Code Example 3: Accessing Environment Variables Within a Running Container (Bash)**

This example illustrates that once a container is running, the CRI is no longer involved in the process of accessing environment variables. The variables are present in the container's operating system, available through the standard mechanisms.

```bash
# inside a container shell
echo $MY_VAR
# my_value

printenv | grep ANOTHER_VAR
# ANOTHER_VAR=value_from_configmap
```

*Commentary:*

This example shows how to access the environment variables set using the Kubernetes YAML from the previous example, once inside a shell within the container.  The `echo $MY_VAR` command directly prints the value of the `MY_VAR` environment variable. The `printenv` command lists all environment variables. We pipe this through `grep` to filter for the variable `ANOTHER_VAR`. Accessing environment variables through the operating system is a standard practice and independent from the underlying container runtime.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of the CRI, I suggest looking at the following resources. First, read the official Kubernetes documentation, specifically the sections discussing CRI and container runtimes. This provides valuable context on the high-level architecture and how Kubernetes interacts with CRI implementations. Second, examine the source code for a CRI implementation like containerd or CRI-O. This provides the most detailed insight into the exact data structures and mechanisms used. Finally, delve into the gRPC specification and tutorials to understand how the CRI itself is exposed via protocol buffers. This gives you insight on how the messages are structured and how they get passed over the wire. Careful study of these resources provides a strong foundation for understanding how environment variables are propagated from the Kubernetes API all the way into your containers. Note that due to the evolving nature of this space, version specific documentation should be referenced at all times. Understanding the CRI and its underlying implementations will empower a more granular understanding of how containerized environments function, and allow one to manage them more effectively.
