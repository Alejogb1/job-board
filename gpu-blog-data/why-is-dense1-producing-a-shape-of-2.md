The discrepancy between the expected output shape (1,) and the actual output shape (2,) from a `dense_1` layer in a neural network typically stems from a misunderstanding of how the layer's input shape interacts with its units parameter, particularly when dealing with single-sample inputs.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on sequence-to-sequence models and time series forecasting, often tracing it to improper handling of batch size or the inherent dimensionality of the input data.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `dense` layer, a fundamental building block in neural networks, performs a linear transformation followed by an activation function.  The crucial parameter is `units`, which defines the dimensionality of the output space.  If `units=1`, you anticipate a single output value. However, the output shape isn't solely determined by `units`. The batch size, implicitly or explicitly defined in the input tensor, significantly impacts the final shape.

A batch size of 1 indicates a single data sample is processed at a time.  One might expect that with `units=1`, the output would be a tensor of shape (1,).  The reality is more nuanced.  If your input data is already one-dimensional, the `dense` layer interprets the single element as representing a feature vector of size one.  The transformation, therefore, yields a single output *per feature*.  Hence, if your input has two features, even with a batch size of 1 and `units=1`, the output will have a shape (2,)—one output value for each of the two input features. The crucial point here is that the `dense` layer is not treating the entire input as a single entity but rather as a vector of individual features.

To achieve an output of shape (1,), you need to ensure your input data has a single feature. Alternatively, you might need to reshape your input or apply a subsequent operation, like a reduction (mean, max, etc.), to collapse the multiple outputs from the dense layer into a single scalar.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Input Shaping Leading to (2,) Output**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrectly shaped input: two features
input_data = np.array([[1.0, 2.0]])

# Define the dense layer
dense_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1)

# Perform the transformation
output = dense_1(input_data)

# Observe the output shape
print(output.shape)  # Output: (1, 2)  Note: This will be (1, 2) with TF2 and later, (2,) with TF1.
```

In this example, the input `input_data` has two features.  Even though `units=1`, the `dense` layer processes each feature independently, resulting in a (1, 2) (TF2+) or (2,) (TF1) shaped tensor (the difference arises from how TensorFlow handles the default batch size).

**Example 2: Correct Input Shaping Leading to (1,) Output**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Correctly shaped input: single feature
input_data = np.array([[1.0]])

# Define the dense layer
dense_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1)

# Perform the transformation
output = dense_1(input_data)

# Observe the output shape
print(output.shape)  # Output: (1, 1)
```

Here, the input `input_data` has only one feature, ensuring the `dense` layer produces a (1, 1) shaped tensor—a single output for the single input feature.

**Example 3: Using Reshape and Reduction for (1,) Output with Multiple Features**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Input with multiple features
input_data = np.array([[1.0, 2.0]])

# Define the dense layer
dense_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1)

# Perform the transformation
intermediate_output = dense_1(input_data)

# Reshape to facilitate reduction.  Different versions of tensorflow might output different shapes, which makes reshape necessary for consistency.
reshaped_output = tf.reshape(intermediate_output, [-1])

# Reduce to a single scalar value (using mean as an example)
final_output = tf.reduce_mean(reshaped_output)

# Observe the final output shape
print(final_output.shape)  # Output: ()  A scalar
```

This example demonstrates a strategy to handle multiple features.  The output of `dense_1` is reshaped to facilitate applying a reduction operation (here, `tf.reduce_mean`). The `tf.reduce_mean` operation collapses the multiple outputs into a single scalar value, achieving the desired (1,) or scalar shape. Note that reshaping is not always necessary but highly recommended for ensuring consistency across different tensorflow versions and backend implementations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of tensor operations in TensorFlow/Keras, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  The Keras documentation provides comprehensive details on layer functionalities, including the `dense` layer. A strong grasp of linear algebra principles will also greatly aid in comprehending the underlying transformations.  Finally, studying the source code of various neural network architectures implemented in Keras can provide valuable insights into how input and output shapes are managed in practice. These resources, along with practical experimentation, are essential for mastering the intricacies of neural network design and troubleshooting shape-related issues.
