The "Requested tensor connection from unknown node" error in Keras typically stems from a mismatch between the model's architecture as defined and the weights loaded into it.  This discrepancy often arises from inconsistencies during model saving and loading, particularly when dealing with custom layers, model sub-classing, or modifications made to the model's structure after initial training.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous large-scale projects, involving both TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x, points to several common causes, which I will detail below.

**1.  Inconsistent Model Architectures:**

The core problem lies in the serialization and deserialization process.  Keras saves model weights and architecture separately. While the weights themselves are relatively straightforward, the architecture definition can be subtly altered inadvertently, leading to this error. This is especially true when working with custom layers or when employing techniques like model checkpointing, where the model's structure might not be perfectly preserved across different versions.  A slight change – a forgotten layer, an altered activation function, a different number of units in a dense layer – creates an incompatibility.  The loaded weights attempt to connect to nodes that no longer exist in the newly defined model, resulting in the error.  Simply ensuring that the model architecture you define for loading exactly mirrors the architecture at the time of saving is often sufficient to solve this problem.

**2.  Custom Layers and Serialization:**

Custom layers require careful consideration during serialization. If you haven't correctly implemented the `get_config()` method within your custom layer class, the architecture information might not be fully captured during saving.  This means the loaded model will not reconstruct the custom layers accurately, leading to the "unknown node" error.  Furthermore, any dependencies or external references used within your custom layers need to be managed appropriately to ensure the loaded model can re-create these elements.  I've seen instances where a custom layer relied on a specific global variable that wasn't saved and restored correctly, resulting in the failure.

**3.  Model Sub-classing and Layer Naming:**

Using model sub-classing offers great flexibility, but introduces potential pitfalls when dealing with weight loading. If the names of the layers in your subclassed model differ from those expected by the loaded weights, the connection will fail.  While not strictly required in all cases, consistent layer naming across model definitions greatly simplifies debugging. This was a significant learning point for me while developing a complex generative model involving nested subclassed networks. Precisely naming layers helps to avoid ambiguity and ensures the correct mapping of weights during the load process.

Let's illustrate these points with code examples:


**Example 1: Simple Model Mismatch:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Model definition during training
model_train = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model_train.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
# ... training ...
model_train.save('my_model.h5')


# Incorrect model definition during loading
model_load = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(12, activation='softmax') # INCORRECT: Number of units changed
])

try:
    model_load.load_weights('my_model.h5')
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading weights: {e}") # This will likely raise the "unknown node" error
```

Here, the number of units in the output layer is inconsistent between the trained model and the loaded model, causing the error.


**Example 2:  Custom Layer Issue:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(10, units), initializer='random_normal', name='my_weight')

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

    #Crucial for proper serialization
    def get_config(self):
        config = super(MyCustomLayer, self).get_config()
        config.update({'units': self.units})
        return config

model_train = keras.Sequential([MyCustomLayer(units=32), keras.layers.Dense(10)])
#...Training...
model_train.save('custom_layer_model.h5')

model_load = keras.Sequential([MyCustomLayer(units=32), keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model_load.load_weights('custom_layer_model.h5') # This should work correctly

```

This example demonstrates a correctly implemented custom layer with `get_config()`, enabling proper serialization and deserialization.  Omitting `get_config()` would likely lead to the error.


**Example 3: Model Subclassing:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyModel(keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', name='dense_layer_1') # explicit naming
        self.dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='dense_layer_2')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)

model_train = MyModel()
# ... training ...
model_train.save_weights('subclass_model.h5')

model_load = MyModel()
model_load.load_weights('subclass_model.h5') # This should load correctly

```

This example uses model sub-classing and explicit layer naming.  Inconsistencies in the layer names between `model_train` and `model_load` would lead to the "unknown node" error.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation,  Keras's documentation, and  a reputable textbook on deep learning focusing on TensorFlow/Keras are excellent resources. Carefully reviewing the sections on model saving, loading, and custom layers is crucial. Pay close attention to the examples provided in those resources to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.  Furthermore, learning to utilize debugging tools within your IDE can prove invaluable in pinpointing the precise location of the architecture mismatch.  Consistent and meticulous code practices, including version control, will also greatly aid in avoiding these types of errors.
