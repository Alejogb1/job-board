The core mechanism behind TensorFlow/Keras's batched SGD implementation hinges on the interplay between the `optimizer` object and the `fit` method.  It's not a simple single-step process; rather, it involves a carefully orchestrated sequence of operations that leverage TensorFlow's computational graph capabilities for efficiency. My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks has underscored this point repeatedly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow/Keras doesn't directly implement SGD *within* the `tf.keras.optimizers.SGD` class in a way that explicitly iterates over individual data points. Instead, it relies on the underlying TensorFlow graph execution to handle the minibatch calculations.  The `fit` method of a `tf.keras.Model` is responsible for orchestrating the training loop.  This loop comprises the following stages concerning SGD:

a) **Data Shuffling and Batching:** Before training begins, the dataset is typically shuffled (unless specified otherwise) to ensure randomness and prevent biases arising from data order.  This shuffled dataset is then divided into minibatches of a specified size.  This batch size is a hyperparameter controlled by the user.

b) **Forward Pass:** For each minibatch, the model performs a forward pass. This involves feeding the minibatch into the model's layers, computing activations, and ultimately obtaining a prediction. The loss function is then calculated comparing predictions with the corresponding ground truth labels.

c) **Gradient Calculation:** TensorFlow automatically computes the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's trainable weights using automatic differentiation.  This is a crucial feature that makes deep learning development significantly easier.  The gradients are computed across the entire minibatch, representing the average gradient over those examples.

d) **Gradient Update:** The `optimizer` object (in this case, `tf.keras.optimizers.SGD`) uses these computed gradients to update the model's weights.  The standard SGD update rule is:

`w = w - learning_rate * gradient`

where `w` represents the weights, `learning_rate` is a hyperparameter specifying the step size, and `gradient` is the average gradient calculated over the minibatch.  Importantly, this update is applied *simultaneously* to all weights in the model.  This is different from updating weights sequentially for each data point. The efficiency gain here is substantial, especially with large datasets and models.

e) **Iteration:** Steps (b), (c), and (d) are repeated for every minibatch until the entire dataset has been processed (one epoch). This process is repeated for multiple epochs, dictated by the `epochs` parameter in the `fit` method.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple SGD with MNIST**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 784)
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 784)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='sgd',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)
```

This example demonstrates a basic implementation.  The `optimizer='sgd'` uses the default SGD optimizer with its default learning rate. The `batch_size=32` specifies that the dataset will be processed in minibatches of 32 samples.  The `fit` method handles the batch processing and weight updates implicitly.

**Example 2:  Customizing SGD parameters**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (data loading as in Example 1) ...

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  # ... (model architecture as in Example 1) ...
])

sgd_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01, momentum=0.9) # custom learning rate and momentum

model.compile(optimizer=sgd_optimizer,
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=64)
```

Here, we illustrate customizing the SGD optimizer.  We explicitly define an `SGD` object, setting the learning rate to 0.01 and adding momentum (another optimization technique).  This demonstrates greater control over the optimization process.


**Example 3:  Monitoring training progress with callbacks**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (data loading and model definition as in Example 1 or 2) ...

class MyCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1} Loss: {logs['loss']:.4f}, Accuracy: {logs['accuracy']:.4f}")

model.compile(optimizer='sgd',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32, callbacks=[MyCallback()])
```

This exemplifies using a custom callback function to monitor training progress.  The `on_epoch_end` method is executed at the end of each epoch, printing the loss and accuracy. This provides insight into the training dynamics and allows for early stopping if needed. This doesn't directly reveal how SGD handles batches, but highlights the surrounding processes during training.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation provides thorough explanations of optimizers and the `fit` method.  The book "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet offers a practical and detailed guide to Keras and its functionalities.  Furthermore, consulting research papers on stochastic gradient descent and its variants will provide a deeper theoretical understanding.  Finally, a comprehensive review of linear algebra and calculus is beneficial for grasping the underlying mathematical principles.
