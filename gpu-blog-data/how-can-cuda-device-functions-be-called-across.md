CUDA device functions, unlike host functions, present unique challenges regarding their linkage across multiple translation units (source files).  The key issue stems from the necessity for the compiler to manage the function's visibility and ensure consistent symbol resolution across independently compiled object files.  My experience working on a large-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation project underscored this precisely; distributing the computational kernels across multiple source files for better code organization led to numerous linker errors until the correct compilation strategy was implemented.

The primary obstacle lies in the default compilation behaviour of the NVIDIA CUDA compiler (nvcc).  Unless explicitly specified, each translation unit is compiled independently, resulting in locally scoped device functions.  Consequently, when linking these object files, the linker is unable to resolve references to device functions defined in one unit and called in another.  This necessitates a specific compilation strategy leveraging the `-dc` flag and explicit declaration mechanisms.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The solution involves compiling each translation unit containing CUDA device functions into separate `.cu.o` object files using the `-dc` flag (device compilation only).  Crucially,  a header file must declare these functions, allowing other translation units to include this declaration and, subsequently, refer to the function correctly without compiling the function definition.  The final linking phase involves combining these `.cu.o` object files, along with any host code object files, using the `nvcc` linker. The linker will then correctly resolve the symbols based on the declarations in the header file.  Failure to perform this step, resulting in implicit linkage, would lead to unresolved symbols during the linking phase.

This differs significantly from standard C/C++ compilation, where the linker implicitly handles symbol resolution across various translation units for functions declared and defined in different files.   CUDA necessitates explicit control over this process due to the distinct compilation phases for the host and device code.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Device Function Across Translation Units**

* **`kernel.h` (Header File):**

```cpp
#ifndef KERNEL_H
#define KERNEL_H

__global__ void addKernel(const float* a, const float* b, float* c, int n);

#endif
```

* **`kernel.cu` (Device Function Implementation):**

```cpp
#include "kernel.h"

__global__ void addKernel(const float* a, const float* b, float* c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}
```

* **`main.cu` (Host Code):**

```cpp
#include "kernel.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  // ... Host code to allocate memory, copy data, launch kernel, and copy results ...
  return 0;
}
```

**Compilation Command:**

```bash
nvcc -dc kernel.cu -o kernel.cu.o
nvcc main.cu kernel.cu.o -o executable
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental approach.  The header file (`kernel.h`) declares the device function, which is then defined in `kernel.cu` and used in `main.cu`.  Crucially, `kernel.cu` is compiled separately using `-dc` to generate the `.cu.o` object file, before being linked with `main.cu`.


**Example 2:  Multiple Device Functions in Different Files**

This illustrates handling multiple device functions spread across several translation units.

* **`kernel1.h` (Header File):**

```cpp
#ifndef KERNEL1_H
#define KERNEL1_H

__global__ void kernel1(float* data, int n);
__global__ void kernel2(float* data, int n);

#endif
```

* **`kernel1.cu` (Device Function Implementation):**

```cpp
#include "kernel1.h"

__global__ void kernel1(float* data, int n){
  //Implementation of kernel1
}
```

* **`kernel2.cu` (Device Function Implementation):**

```cpp
#include "kernel1.h"

__global__ void kernel2(float* data, int n){
  //Implementation of kernel2
}
```

* **`main.cu` (Host Code):**

```cpp
#include "kernel1.h"
// ... Host code to use kernel1 and kernel2 ...
```

**Compilation Command:**

```bash
nvcc -dc kernel1.cu -o kernel1.cu.o
nvcc -dc kernel2.cu -o kernel2.cu.o
nvcc main.cu kernel1.cu.o kernel2.cu.o -o executable
```


**Example 3:  Namespace to Avoid Name Collisions**

For larger projects, namespaces are essential to avoid naming conflicts.

* **`kernel_namespace.h` (Header File):**

```cpp
#ifndef KERNEL_NAMESPACE_H
#define KERNEL_NAMESPACE_H

namespace mykernels {
  __global__ void complexKernel(int* data, int n);
}

#endif
```

* **`kernel_namespace.cu` (Device Function Implementation):**

```cpp
#include "kernel_namespace.h"

namespace mykernels {
  __global__ void complexKernel(int* data, int n){
    //Implementation of complexKernel
  }
}
```

* **`main.cu` (Host Code):**

```cpp
#include "kernel_namespace.h"

int main() {
  // ... Host code to use mykernels::complexKernel ...
  return 0;
}
```

**Compilation Command:**  Similar to Example 2, but with appropriate file names.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The NVIDIA CUDA C Programming Guide provides comprehensive details on CUDA programming, covering compilation and linking procedures.  The CUDA Toolkit documentation offers further specifics on the `nvcc` compiler and its options.  Finally, a thorough understanding of C/C++ compilation and linking processes is invaluable.  Consult relevant textbooks or online resources for a comprehensive understanding of these fundamental concepts.


In summary, the successful calling of CUDA device functions across translation units requires meticulous attention to compilation flags (`-dc`), header file declarations, and the order of files during the linking stage.  Ignoring these aspects will inevitably lead to linker errors, a common pitfall encountered in larger CUDA projects, particularly those involving collaborative development efforts.  The provided examples and suggested resources should equip developers with the necessary knowledge to effectively manage this crucial aspect of CUDA programming.
