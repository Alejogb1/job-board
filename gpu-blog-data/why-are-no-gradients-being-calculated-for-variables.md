The absence of gradient calculations for variables within a custom model subclass typically stems from the variables not being properly registered as trainable parameters within TensorFlow or PyTorch's computational graph.  This oversight prevents the automatic differentiation mechanisms from tracking their changes during the forward pass, thus resulting in zero gradients during the backward pass.  I've encountered this issue numerous times while developing complex architectures for image segmentation and encountered a few common root causes.  I'll elaborate on the issue and provide solutions using TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, and a more generalized approach applicable to both frameworks.


**1. Clear Explanation**

The core problem lies in how deep learning frameworks manage model parameters.  These frameworks employ automatic differentiation to compute gradients efficiently.  This process relies on constructing a computational graph, where nodes represent operations and edges represent data flow.  Variables designated as trainable parameters are included in this graph, enabling the framework to track their derivatives during backpropagation.  When a variable is not explicitly marked as trainable, itâ€™s excluded from the graph's automatic differentiation process, leading to zero gradients.  This often manifests in custom model subclasses where developers inadvertently create variables that are not recognized as model parameters.  Furthermore, subtle errors in how these variables interact within the model's forward pass can also lead to this issue.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

**Example 1: TensorFlow/Keras**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
        # INCORRECT: This variable is not a Keras layer, thus not trainable
        self.gamma = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([64]), name="gamma") 

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        # INCORRECT: This doesn't register gamma for gradient calculation
        x = x * self.gamma
        return x

model = MyModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Training loop - gradients for self.gamma will be zero.
for epoch in range(10):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        loss = model(tf.random.normal([1,32])) # Example input
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables) # self.gamma missing
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
```

In this example, `self.gamma` is a `tf.Variable` but it's not a Keras layer.  Keras's `trainable_variables` property only returns trainable weights from its layers. Therefore, during training, the optimizer will not update `self.gamma` because it's not included in the set of variables tracked by the gradient tape.  The correct approach would be to make `gamma` a part of a layer or explicitly add it to `trainable_variables`.

**Example 2: TensorFlow/Keras (Corrected)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
        self.gamma = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([64]), name="gamma", trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        x = x * self.gamma
        return x

model = MyModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Training loop - gradients for self.gamma will be calculated now.
for epoch in range(10):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        loss = model(tf.random.normal([1,32])) # Example input
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))

```

Here, setting `trainable=True` explicitly registers `self.gamma` as a trainable variable, correctly incorporating it into the automatic differentiation process.  This ensures gradients are calculated and the variable is updated during training.


**Example 3: PyTorch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(32, 64)
        # INCORRECT:  Not a registered parameter
        self.beta = torch.randn(64, requires_grad=True)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        # INCORRECT: PyTorch won't track gradients for this.
        x = x * self.beta
        return x

model = MyModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

#Training loop - gradients for beta will be zero.
for epoch in range(10):
    x = torch.randn(1, 32)
    y = model(x)
    loss = y.mean() #Example Loss Function
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

Similar to the TensorFlow example, `self.beta` is not a registered parameter of the model. PyTorch automatically tracks gradients for parameters registered within the `nn.Module`, accessed through `model.parameters()`.  Therefore, the optimizer will not update `self.beta`.


**Example 4: PyTorch (Corrected)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(32, 64)
        self.beta = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(64)) # Correct way to register parameter

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = x * self.beta
        return x

model = MyModel()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

#Training loop - gradients for beta will now be calculated.
for epoch in range(10):
    x = torch.randn(1, 32)
    y = model(x)
    loss = y.mean() #Example Loss Function
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

The correction uses `nn.Parameter` to register `self.beta` as a trainable parameter of the model.  This explicitly informs PyTorch to include it in the computation graph and track gradients during backpropagation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of automatic differentiation and computational graphs in deep learning frameworks, I would recommend consulting the official documentation for TensorFlow and PyTorch.  These documents thoroughly explain the intricacies of parameter management and gradient calculation within each framework.  Additionally, textbooks on deep learning, particularly those focusing on the mathematical foundations, will provide a robust theoretical background that will be invaluable in troubleshooting such issues.  Finally, searching relevant forums and question-answer sites (such as Stack Overflow) with targeted keywords focusing on the specific framework and error messages encountered can prove beneficial for targeted solutions to similar problems.
