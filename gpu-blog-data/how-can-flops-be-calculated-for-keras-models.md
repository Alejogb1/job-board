Directly measuring FLOPS (floating-point operations per second) for Keras models within TensorFlow 2.x isn't a straightforward operation provided by inherent TensorFlow functions.  My experience in optimizing large-scale deep learning models has shown that a direct FLOPS count requires a more nuanced approach leveraging TensorFlow's graph capabilities and careful consideration of the model's architecture.  There's no single function call; rather, it involves inferring FLOPS from the model's computational graph.  This necessitates understanding the operations within each layer and aggregating their individual FLOP contributions.

The core challenge stems from the dynamic nature of TensorFlow's execution.  The computational graph isn't always fully defined until runtime, particularly with control flow operations or variable-length input sequences.  Therefore, static analysis alone is insufficient.  However, we can leverage TensorFlow's profiling tools and custom analysis to achieve a reasonably accurate FLOPS estimate.

**1.  Explanation of Methodology:**

My approach involves a three-step process: model graph extraction, operation analysis, and FLOP summation.  First, we obtain the TensorFlow graph representing the Keras model.  This graph details the sequence of operations and their interdependencies.  Second, we analyze each operation within the graph, identifying the type of operation (e.g., matrix multiplication, convolution) and its input tensor dimensions.  This allows us to determine the number of floating-point operations involved in each operation.  Third, we sum the FLOPS count for all operations within the graph to obtain the total FLOPS for a single forward pass.  Note, this provides FLOPS *per inference* and does not directly translate to FLOPS/second without timing measurements.  To obtain FLOPS/second, we would time the inference and divide the total FLOPS by that time.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Dense Network FLOP Estimation**

This example demonstrates a rudimentary approach for a simple dense network, assuming only matrix multiplications and additions are significant.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#Manual FLOP Calculation (oversimplified)
def estimate_flops_dense(layer):
    if isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.Dense):
      W = layer.weights[0].shape
      X = (784,) if layer.name=='dense' else layer.input_shape[1:] #handle input shape
      return 2 * np.prod(W) * np.prod(X) #2 for multiplication and addition
    else:
        return 0

total_flops = sum(estimate_flops_dense(layer) for layer in model.layers)
print(f"Estimated FLOPs: {total_flops}")

```

This code provides a highly simplified estimation.  It ignores biases, activations (ReLU and Softmax have their own computational costs), and potential optimizations TensorFlow performs.  It serves as a foundational example to illustrate the principle of manually calculating FLOPS based on layer types and shapes.


**Example 2:  Incorporating Convolutional Layers**

For convolutional layers, the FLOP calculation becomes more complex, requiring consideration of kernel size, strides, padding, and the number of input and output channels.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

def estimate_flops_conv(layer):
  if isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.Conv2D):
    filters, kernel_size, input_shape = layer.filters, layer.kernel_size, layer.input_shape
    output_shape = layer.compute_output_shape(input_shape)
    flops = 2 * np.prod(filters) * np.prod(kernel_size) * np.prod(output_shape[1:])
    return flops
  elif isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.Dense): #handle dense layer
    W = layer.weights[0].shape
    X = layer.input_shape[1:]
    return 2 * np.prod(W) * np.prod(X)
  else:
    return 0

total_flops = sum(estimate_flops_conv(layer) for layer in model.layers)
print(f"Estimated FLOPs: {total_flops}")

```

This example adds a convolutional layer and a corresponding FLOP estimation function.  It's still an approximation, neglecting factors like the computational cost of activation functions and pooling operations.


**Example 3:  Leveraging TensorFlow Profiler (More Accurate Approach)**

While manual estimations are useful for understanding the underlying calculations, a more accurate estimation can be obtained through TensorFlow's profiler.  However, the profiler provides detailed timing information rather than directly reporting FLOPS. We infer FLOPS using execution time and a measure of operations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Placeholder for a more sophisticated FLOP estimation that
# accounts for many different tensor operations
# For illustrative purpose, we use an approximated flop count from example 2

approx_flops = total_flops  # from example 2


dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)

start_time = time.time()
model(dummy_input)
end_time = time.time()
execution_time = end_time - start_time

flops_per_second = approx_flops / execution_time

print(f"Approximate FLOPs per second: {flops_per_second}")

```

This example showcases a rudimentary integration with timing measurements.  In a real-world scenario, a more precise FLOP count (replacing `approx_flops`) would need to be derived.  The profiler can help in obtaining a better approximation by examining the operations executed during the forward pass.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of TensorFlow's profiling capabilities, consult the official TensorFlow documentation.  Examine materials on graph visualization and operation analysis within TensorFlow.  Furthermore, studying publications on deep learning model optimization and performance profiling will enhance your understanding of efficient FLOP estimation strategies.  Specific focus on papers and documentation addressing profiling tools within TensorFlow is crucial.  Understanding linear algebra optimizations relevant to deep learning is also beneficial.
