The crucial determinant of received data dimensionality and shape isn't the data itself, but the system's interpretation of it.  My experience working on high-frequency trading systems highlighted this repeatedly; a raw data stream—for instance, market depth updates—could be represented in several ways, each with distinct dimensionality and shape.  The underlying data structure employed by the receiving system directly impacts how this dimensionality and shape are perceived.

**1. Explanation:**

Dimensionality refers to the number of independent features or variables describing each data point. A single temperature reading is one-dimensional, while a sensor reading encompassing temperature, humidity, and pressure is three-dimensional. Shape, in the context of data structures like NumPy arrays or Pandas DataFrames, refers to the arrangement of these data points: a vector is one-dimensional, a matrix two-dimensional, a tensor three-dimensional, and so on.  Shape is closely tied to how the dimensionality of the data is organized.  For example, 100 temperature readings over time could be represented as a one-dimensional array of length 100 (shape (100,)), but if each reading includes a timestamp, it would be a two-dimensional array (shape (100, 2)) where each row represents a reading with its corresponding time.

Confusion often arises when dealing with nested or hierarchical data structures.  A JSON payload containing multiple sensor readings, each with timestamps and associated metadata, can lead to a highly complex shape. The dimensionality remains consistent within each sensor reading, but the overall shape reflects the nesting.  Accurate determination necessitates understanding the data's structure and the system's chosen representation.  This is further complicated by data transformation processes.  For example, feature engineering often changes both the dimensionality and shape.  Principal Component Analysis (PCA), for instance, can reduce dimensionality while maintaining much of the original data variance. The resultant shape will reflect this dimensionality reduction.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Vector**

```python
import numpy as np

# One-dimensional data: a series of stock prices
stock_prices = np.array([150.25, 150.75, 151.00, 150.90, 151.50])

print(f"Dimensionality: {stock_prices.ndim}")
print(f"Shape: {stock_prices.shape}")
```

This code represents stock prices as a one-dimensional NumPy array. The `ndim` attribute returns 1, indicating one-dimensional data, and the `shape` attribute shows the array's length as (5,).

**Example 2: Matrix Representation of Sensor Data**

```python
import numpy as np

# Two-dimensional data: temperature and humidity readings over time
sensor_data = np.array([[25.2, 60.5],
                       [25.5, 61.0],
                       [25.8, 61.2],
                       [25.6, 60.8]])

print(f"Dimensionality: {sensor_data.ndim}")
print(f"Shape: {sensor_data.shape}")
```

Here, sensor data—temperature and humidity—are organized as a matrix, resulting in two-dimensional data (ndim=2).  The shape (4, 2) shows four readings, each with two features.

**Example 3:  Handling Nested JSON Data**

```python
import json
import pandas as pd

# Sample JSON data with nested sensor readings
json_data = """
[
  {"sensor": "A", "timestamp": "2024-10-27T10:00:00", "reading": {"temp": 20, "pressure": 1012}},
  {"sensor": "B", "timestamp": "2024-10-27T10:00:00", "reading": {"temp": 22, "pressure": 1015}}
]
"""

data = json.loads(json_data)
df = pd.json_normalize(data, record_path=['reading'], meta=['sensor', 'timestamp'])
print(df)
print(f"Shape of DataFrame: {df.shape}")
```

This illustrates dealing with nested JSON. The `pd.json_normalize` function flattens the nested structure into a Pandas DataFrame, creating a tabular representation, simplifying analysis of the data's shape and dimensionality. The shape of the DataFrame reflects the structure after flattening.  Further manipulation might be required depending on the intended analysis.  Note that while the individual sensor readings have a simple dimensionality (two features), the overall structure has a shape defined by the number of readings and features.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of data structures and dimensionality, I recommend consulting standard texts on linear algebra, multivariate statistics, and data structures and algorithms.  Specific books on NumPy, Pandas, and JSON handling for your chosen programming language will also be invaluable.  Additionally, exploring the documentation for these libraries is crucial for practical implementation.  Finally, dedicated texts on data cleaning and preprocessing provide essential context on how data transformation can impact dimensionality and shape.
