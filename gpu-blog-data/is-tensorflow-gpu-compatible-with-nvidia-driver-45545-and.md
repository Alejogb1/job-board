TensorFlow-GPU's compatibility with a specific NVIDIA driver and CUDA toolkit version hinges on the precise TensorFlow version used.  My experience troubleshooting GPU acceleration across numerous projects has shown that while broad compatibility is usually advertised,  pinpointing precise version compatibility often requires empirical testing due to subtle, undocumented dependencies.  In short, there's no guaranteed "yes" or "no" answer without specifying the TensorFlow version.  Driver version 455.45 and CUDA 11.1 are relatively old, and while they might *function*, newer versions often offer improved performance and bug fixes.

**1.  Explanation of Compatibility Issues**

TensorFlow-GPU relies on CUDA for GPU acceleration.  CUDA is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model, providing a framework for developers to utilize NVIDIA GPUs for computation.  The NVIDIA driver acts as the interface between the operating system (Ubuntu 20.04 in this case) and the GPU hardware.  TensorFlow, in turn, uses CUDA libraries and interacts with the driver through them.  Therefore, an incompatibility can arise in several ways:

* **Driver Mismatch:**  The TensorFlow version might have been compiled against a different CUDA version or driver version range than 11.1 and 455.45, leading to crashes or incorrect computations.  TensorFlow's internal CUDA libraries might expect certain features or behaviors present only in more recent drivers.

* **CUDA Library Conflicts:** Even if the driver is nominally compatible, conflicts can occur if multiple CUDA versions are installed simultaneously.  TensorFlow might load the wrong CUDA libraries, causing unexpected behavior.

* **Installation Errors:** The process of installing TensorFlow-GPU requires careful attention to dependencies.  A missed dependency or an incorrectly configured environment variable can lead to the system selecting the CPU path instead of the GPU path, effectively disabling GPU acceleration despite appearing to be installed correctly.  This often manifests as significantly slower than expected performance, without explicit error messages.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate practical steps to verify TensorFlow-GPU compatibility and diagnose potential problems.  These are based on my troubleshooting experience working with diverse compute clusters and embedded systems.

**Example 1: Checking TensorFlow Version and CUDA Support**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print("TensorFlow version:", tf.__version__)
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
if len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) > 0:
    print("GPU is detected.")
    print("CUDA version:", tf.test.gpu_device_name())  #Might return an error if CUDA not properly configured.
else:
    print("No GPU detected. Check your CUDA installation and TensorFlow configuration.")
```

This snippet first confirms the TensorFlow version, then checks for the presence of GPUs.  It then attempts to obtain the CUDA device name, a key check for correct CUDA integration. A failure at this step often points to a driver or CUDA configuration issue. The output provides crucial clues for diagnosis.


**Example 2:  Testing GPU Acceleration**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

#Simple matrix multiplication to test GPU usage
matrix_size = 1000
A = tf.random.normal([matrix_size, matrix_size], dtype=tf.float32)
B = tf.random.normal([matrix_size, matrix_size], dtype=tf.float32)

#CPU computation
start_time = time.time()
C_cpu = tf.matmul(A, B)
end_time = time.time()
cpu_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"CPU computation time: {cpu_time:.4f} seconds")


#GPU computation (if available)
if len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) > 0:
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        start_time = time.time()
        C_gpu = tf.matmul(A, B)
        end_time = time.time()
        gpu_time = end_time - start_time
        print(f"GPU computation time: {gpu_time:.4f} seconds")
        print(f"Speedup: {cpu_time / gpu_time:.2f}x")
else:
    print("GPU computation skipped. No GPU detected.")
```

This example performs a simple matrix multiplication on both CPU and GPU (if available).  Comparing the execution times directly demonstrates if GPU acceleration is working correctly.  A significant speedup (ideally several times faster) should be observed if GPU acceleration is enabled. A lack of speedup suggests that even if the GPU is detected, it's not being utilized effectively.


**Example 3:  Checking CUDA and cuDNN versions**

```bash
nvcc --version #check NVCC compiler version (part of CUDA toolkit)
ldconfig -p | grep libcudart  #check the loaded CUDA runtime library
ldconfig -p | grep libcuDNN # check loaded cuDNN libraries (for deep learning acceleration)
```

This example leverages shell commands to retrieve vital information about the installed CUDA toolkit and cuDNN libraries.  The output must match the versions expected by the installed TensorFlow version; mismatches indicate a potential source of incompatibility.  The `ldconfig` command ensures you're inspecting the libraries actively loaded by the system, rather than just those present in the file system.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further information, consult the official TensorFlow documentation, the NVIDIA CUDA documentation, and the NVIDIA driver release notes.  These resources will provide the most accurate and up-to-date compatibility information for specific TensorFlow, CUDA, and driver versions.  Examining the TensorFlow source code (particularly the CUDA integration parts) might be necessary for advanced debugging, especially in cases of unusual error messages or unexpected behavior.  Also, consider checking community forums and support channels for reported compatibility issues and troubleshooting tips related to similar setups.
