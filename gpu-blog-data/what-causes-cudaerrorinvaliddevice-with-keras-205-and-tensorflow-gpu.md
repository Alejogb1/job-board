The CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE error encountered with Keras 2.0.5 and TensorFlow-GPU 1.2.1 typically stems from a mismatch between the TensorFlow backend's perception of available CUDA devices and the actual hardware configuration or driver state.  This isn't a Keras-specific issue; rather, it's a reflection of underlying TensorFlow's interaction with the NVIDIA CUDA runtime.  My experience debugging similar errors across various projects, including a large-scale image recognition system I developed using this exact TensorFlow/Keras version, highlights the criticality of verifying CUDA device visibility and driver compatibility.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow-GPU, at its core, relies on the CUDA toolkit to leverage NVIDIA GPUs for computation.  The `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE` error signifies that TensorFlow is attempting to utilize a GPU device that either doesn't exist, is not accessible, or is in an inconsistent state from TensorFlow's perspective.  This inconsistency can arise from several sources:

* **Incorrect CUDA Driver Installation or Version:** The most common culprit.  TensorFlow-GPU 1.2.1 has specific CUDA driver version requirements.  Using an incompatible driver version, even one that's "close," can lead to this error.  Furthermore, a corrupted or improperly installed driver will manifest in the same way.  This often necessitates a complete driver uninstall and clean reinstall.

* **Conflicting CUDA Installations:**  Multiple versions of CUDA installed concurrently can create conflicts, leading to unexpected behavior and errors like this one.  Ensuring only one compatible CUDA installation is present is crucial.

* **Missing or Incorrect CUDA Runtime Libraries:**  TensorFlow needs specific CUDA runtime libraries to communicate with the GPU.  Missing or incorrectly installed libraries prevent proper initialization, thus resulting in the error.

* **GPU Hardware Issues:**  While less common, hardware problems with the GPU itself, including driver crashes or faulty memory, can cause TensorFlow to detect an invalid device.  Running diagnostics on the GPU hardware is necessary to rule this out.

* **Insufficient GPU Memory:**  Although less likely to directly trigger `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE`, consistently running out of GPU memory can indirectly cause this error.  The error might manifest as TensorFlow attempting to use a device (or partition of a device) that is unavailable due to being fully allocated.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate how to diagnose and address the `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE` error within a Python environment using TensorFlow and Keras.  These snippets are illustrative and should be adapted based on specific configurations and datasets.

**Example 1: Verifying GPU Visibility:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

if len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) == 0:
    print("No GPUs detected.  Check CUDA installation and driver.")
else:
    print("GPUs detected.  Proceeding with device configuration.")
    try:
        gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
        print("Memory growth enabled for all GPUs.")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(f"Error configuring GPU memory: {e}")
```

**Commentary:** This snippet first checks for the presence of GPUs. If none are found, it prompts the user to verify the CUDA installation. If GPUs are detected, it attempts to enable memory growth for each GPU, a crucial step that prevents TensorFlow from exclusively allocating the entire GPU memory at startup, leading to potential conflicts if memory is limited.  Error handling is included to capture and report any runtime errors during the memory growth configuration.


**Example 2:  Selecting a Specific GPU (if multiple are present):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # Choose a specific GPU (e.g., the first one)
        tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')
        logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e)
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates how to explicitly select a specific GPU.  This is particularly useful in systems with multiple GPUs where you might need to specify which one Keras should use.  The `set_visible_devices` function restricts TensorFlow to only see and use the selected GPU(s), preventing conflicts.  The code also verifies the number of physical and logical GPUs after the selection.


**Example 3:  Basic Keras Model with GPU Check:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# ... (Your model definition using Keras) ...

if len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) > 0:
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Or '/GPU:1' for the second GPU, etc.
        model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
else:
    print("No GPUs available.  Training on CPU.")
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# ... (Model evaluation and prediction) ...
```

**Commentary:** This example directly addresses model training.  Before training starts, it checks for GPU availability.  If GPUs are present, it specifies the GPU device using `/GPU:0` (or an appropriate index for other GPUs).  If no GPUs are detected, training defaults to the CPU, preventing the `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE` error from being thrown in a scenario with no GPU hardware present.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides in-depth guidance on GPU configuration and troubleshooting.  The NVIDIA CUDA toolkit documentation is essential for understanding CUDA driver installation and management.  Consulting the NVIDIA forum for CUDA-related issues can also be valuable for finding solutions to specific hardware and driver problems.  Finally, reviewing the Keras documentation to understand its interaction with the TensorFlow backend is crucial for troubleshooting issues related to model building and training.  Thorough examination of error messages from both TensorFlow and CUDA is also crucial.  Pay close attention to the exact error message and any accompanying stack traces; these details frequently pinpoint the root cause of the problem.
