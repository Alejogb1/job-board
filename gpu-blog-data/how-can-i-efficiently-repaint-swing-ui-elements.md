My primary experience with custom Swing components involved developing a visualization tool for complex network topologies. The core challenge wasn't initially drawing the nodes and edges, but maintaining a responsive user interface when dealing with thousands of these elements simultaneously. Inherent Swing behavior, coupled with naive repainting approaches, led to significant performance bottlenecks. Efficient repainting, therefore, demands a deep understanding of how Swing manages its rendering pipeline and how to leverage these mechanisms to avoid unnecessary redraws.

The default repaint mechanism in Swing often results in over-rendering. Calling `repaint()` on a component schedules a full redraw of that component and all its children. When dealing with large custom components, such as a custom `JPanel` displaying many visual elements, this can cause cascading repaints that strain the event dispatch thread (EDT). The key to efficient repainting is to minimize the area that needs to be redrawn and to avoid redundant repaint calls.

Instead of blindly calling `repaint()`, one should strive for *targeted repainting*. Swing provides the `repaint(int x, int y, int width, int height)` method, which allows specifying the exact rectangular area to be redrawn. By carefully tracking which portions of the component have actually changed, I found it possible to significantly reduce the rendering workload. For instance, if only a single node in a large network visualization was moved, only the bounding box around that node, and its prior position, should be redrawn, not the entire canvas.

Furthermore, double buffering can alleviate visual artifacts during repaints, especially when performing several small updates in quick succession. Double buffering ensures that rendering is performed off-screen, and the fully rendered image is then swapped to the screen, avoiding flicker. While many Swing components already employ double buffering, custom components may benefit from explicitly enabling it. This can be done when constructing a custom component by ensuring the `isDoubleBuffered` property is set to `true`.

Below are examples illustrating various repaint strategies:

**Example 1: Naive Repaint (Inefficient)**

This example demonstrates the typical, but flawed approach of simply redrawing the entire component when any changes are made. Consider a custom `JPanel` representing a grid of squares, where a user can click to change the color of a square.

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter;
import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;

public class NaiveGrid extends JPanel {
    private final int[][] grid;
    private final int gridSize = 100;
    private final int squareSize = 10;

    public NaiveGrid() {
        grid = new int[gridSize][gridSize];
        addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
                int row = e.getY() / squareSize;
                int col = e.getX() / squareSize;
                grid[row][col] = (grid[row][col] + 1) % 3;
                repaint();  // Inefficient: redraws the whole grid
            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        for (int row = 0; row < gridSize; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < gridSize; col++) {
                switch (grid[row][col]) {
                    case 0 -> g.setColor(Color.WHITE);
                    case 1 -> g.setColor(Color.BLUE);
                    case 2 -> g.setColor(Color.RED);
                }
                g.fillRect(col * squareSize, row * squareSize, squareSize, squareSize);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Naive Grid");
        frame.add(new NaiveGrid());
        frame.setSize(gridSize * 10, gridSize * 10);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

In this naive version, each click triggers a repaint of the entire `NaiveGrid` component, even if only one square changes. This approach quickly becomes problematic with larger grids, resulting in noticeable lag.

**Example 2: Targeted Repaint**

This example shows how to use targeted repaint to redraw only the changed square, leading to improved performance. I use a `Rectangle` object to denote the region that needs to be repainted.

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter;
import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;

public class TargetedGrid extends JPanel {
    private final int[][] grid;
    private final int gridSize = 100;
    private final int squareSize = 10;

    public TargetedGrid() {
        grid = new int[gridSize][gridSize];
        addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
                int row = e.getY() / squareSize;
                int col = e.getX() / squareSize;
                grid[row][col] = (grid[row][col] + 1) % 3;
                repaint(col * squareSize, row * squareSize, squareSize, squareSize); // Targetted repaint
            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        for (int row = 0; row < gridSize; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < gridSize; col++) {
                switch (grid[row][col]) {
                    case 0 -> g.setColor(Color.WHITE);
                    case 1 -> g.setColor(Color.BLUE);
                    case 2 -> g.setColor(Color.RED);
                }
                 g.fillRect(col * squareSize, row * squareSize, squareSize, squareSize);
            }
        }
    }

     public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Targeted Grid");
        frame.add(new TargetedGrid());
        frame.setSize(gridSize * 10, gridSize * 10);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }

}
```

In this improved version, `repaint(col * squareSize, row * squareSize, squareSize, squareSize)` is invoked, ensuring that only the specific square is redrawn. This reduces the rendering workload drastically, especially for larger grids. This is crucial for applications where frequent UI updates are expected, such as an interactive visualization where each interaction should feel fluid.

**Example 3: Leveraging Double Buffering**

This example focuses on using double buffering with targeted repaints to reduce flicker. This is especially noticeable when multiple small changes occur rapidly. While many components already utilize it, we explicitly ensure itâ€™s activated here.

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter;
import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;

public class DoubleBufferedGrid extends JPanel {
    private final int[][] grid;
    private final int gridSize = 100;
    private final int squareSize = 10;

    public DoubleBufferedGrid() {
        setDoubleBuffered(true); // Explicitly enabling double buffering
        grid = new int[gridSize][gridSize];
        addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
                int row = e.getY() / squareSize;
                int col = e.getX() / squareSize;
                grid[row][col] = (grid[row][col] + 1) % 3;
                repaint(col * squareSize, row * squareSize, squareSize, squareSize); // Targeted Repaint
            }
        });
    }

    @Override
    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        for (int row = 0; row < gridSize; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < gridSize; col++) {
                switch (grid[row][col]) {
                    case 0 -> g.setColor(Color.WHITE);
                    case 1 -> g.setColor(Color.BLUE);
                    case 2 -> g.setColor(Color.RED);
                }
                g.fillRect(col * squareSize, row * squareSize, squareSize, squareSize);
            }
        }
    }

       public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Double Buffered Grid");
        frame.add(new DoubleBufferedGrid());
        frame.setSize(gridSize * 10, gridSize * 10);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }

}
```

By setting `setDoubleBuffered(true)` in the constructor, we ensure that all painting is done offscreen, and the completed image is then displayed.  Combined with the targeted repaint, we achieve both efficiency and visual smoothness.

For resources, I highly recommend exploring Swing's official documentation, especially the sections related to custom painting and performance optimizations. The book "Filthy Rich Clients: Developing Animated and Graphical UIs" provides in-depth knowledge about optimizing Swing and related graphics concepts, which can help grasp the inner workings of rendering. In addition, carefully studying the `JComponent` and `RepaintManager` classes in the Java API documentation will provide a solid understanding of the relevant repaint mechanisms. These resources have served me well in tackling the challenges inherent in building high-performance Swing applications.
