A 3D convolution with depth equal to the input depth is *not* generally equivalent to a 2D convolution, despite sharing similarities in certain specific situations. The crucial distinction lies in how the convolutional kernel interacts with the input volume along the depth dimension. While a 2D convolution operates solely on a single spatial plane, the 3D convolution, even with a depth equal to input depth, fundamentally operates across the entire input volume, yielding information that a 2D convolution cannot capture.

Specifically, consider the following: in a 2D convolution, a 2D kernel is slid across the width and height of the input image, performing element-wise multiplication and summation. The result is a feature map which represents spatial features in that particular channel. Critically, it does not consider inter-channel relationships. In contrast, a 3D convolution with depth `D` (where `D` is the input depth) takes a *3D kernel* and slides it across the *entire input volume*. Even if the kernel's depth is equal to the input depth, it does not reduce to a 2D operation. The core distinction is that the 3D kernel interacts with all input channels simultaneously through weights connecting these channels. Thus, the output, even if spatially equivalent to a 2D convolution, would incorporate inter-channel relationships not learned by a 2D convolution.

Over several projects I have observed this difference materialize; for example, in processing volumetric medical images like CT scans, 3D convolutions are crucial for capturing the spatial relationships across all dimensions. If a 2D convolution were applied slice-by-slice, information related to the organ structures that span multiple slices would be lost, rendering the resulting feature maps less effective. While you can, in a special situation achieve equivalent behavior, in a general case this is not true. The key aspect is that a 3D convolution with depth equal to input depth *can* learn an identity kernel which applies a similar transformation to each of the channels independently, and this is *not* what a 2D kernel will ever produce unless you explicitly design the 2D convolution to learn this behaviour.

To illustrate with a concrete example, suppose we have an input tensor of shape `(batch_size, height, width, depth)` representing a color image, where `depth` is usually 3 (RGB). If we perform a 2D convolution with a filter of size (3, 3), this convolution will take place channel by channel and produce feature maps representing spatial information inside each color channel, however, there is no interaction between these color channels. Now, if we perform a 3D convolution with kernel size `(3, 3, 3)` on the same input tensor, the convolution will take place on the full volume (height, width, depth) and produce feature maps representing interactions *across* these channels.

Here are three code examples using TensorFlow that highlight this distinction:

**Example 1: 2D Convolution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Input: batch_size, height, width, depth
input_tensor = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1, 32, 32, 3), dtype=tf.float32)

# 2D Convolution
conv2d = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=(3, 3), padding='same')
output_2d = conv2d(input_tensor)

print("2D Convolution Output Shape:", output_2d.shape)
```

*Commentary:* This snippet demonstrates a standard 2D convolution. The `Conv2D` layer operates on each channel independently. The resulting `output_2d` tensor has the shape `(1, 32, 32, 16)`, indicating that 16 feature maps were produced, each of which only considered spatial information within each of the 3 initial channels. Critically, the weights of the convolution filter *do not* operate on different color channels at the same time.

**Example 2: 3D Convolution with Depth Equal to Input Depth**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Input: batch_size, height, width, depth
input_tensor = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1, 32, 32, 3), dtype=tf.float32)

# 3D Convolution with depth equal to input depth
conv3d = tf.keras.layers.Conv3D(filters=16, kernel_size=(3, 3, 3), padding='same')
output_3d = conv3d(input_tensor)

print("3D Convolution Output Shape:", output_3d.shape)
```

*Commentary:* Here, we have a 3D convolution. While the `kernel_size`'s depth component matches the input tensor's depth, the key difference lies within the convolutionâ€™s operation. The `Conv3D` layer learns filter weights connecting the three channels. The output shape is `(1, 32, 32, 16)`, similar to the 2D convolution, the 3D kernel has learned weights that *simultaneously* transform all 3 channels using the same filter. This represents a significant difference in the way features are computed. The output channels represent interactions between the input depth channels, rather than features from each channel independently.

**Example 3: 3D Convolution with Depth One**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Input: batch_size, height, width, depth
input_tensor = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1, 32, 32, 3), dtype=tf.float32)

# 3D Convolution with depth one
conv3d_depth1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv3D(filters=16, kernel_size=(3, 3, 1), padding='same')
output_3d_depth1 = conv3d_depth1(input_tensor)

print("3D Convolution with Depth 1 Output Shape:", output_3d_depth1.shape)

```

*Commentary:* This example showcases a 3D convolution with the kernel having depth of 1. This convolution will operate on each depth channel of the input independently. The output shape is `(1, 32, 32, 16)`. Crucially this is similar to how a 2D convolution would operate. This case demonstrates when you want to treat each channel independently, which is what a standard 2D convolution will do.

In summary, while a 3D convolution with depth equal to the input depth may *appear* to perform a similar spatial operation to a 2D convolution by producing output with similar dimensions, the underlying computation is fundamentally different. The 3D convolution leverages inter-channel relationships, capturing information that a 2D convolution cannot. This distinction is important in numerous applications, particularly when dealing with volumetric data or where inter-channel dependencies are essential.

For further study, I recommend reviewing documentation on convolution operations within TensorFlow and PyTorch. I would also suggest exploring papers detailing the mathematical foundations of convolutional neural networks, particularly focusing on the difference between 2D and 3D convolutions. Additionally, examining real-world examples from computer vision or medical imaging literature where 3D convolutions are used would be instructive to understand the necessity of a 3D convolution over 2D, and what can be gained with the additional dimension, particularly when the kernel depth matches input depth.
