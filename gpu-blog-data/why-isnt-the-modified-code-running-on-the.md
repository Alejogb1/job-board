The discrepancy in GPU utilization between the original MNIST code and its modified version likely stems from a mismatch in data handling or kernel launch configuration, rather than a fundamental incompatibility with the GPU architecture itself.  In my experience optimizing deep learning models for GPU execution, I've encountered this issue numerous times, often traced back to subtle differences in how tensors are managed and operations are dispatched.  The original code, presumably leveraging established libraries, correctly handles data transfer and kernel execution, while the modification introduces a break in this optimized pipeline.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Efficient GPU computation relies on a structured process.  First, data needs to be transferred to the GPU's memory. This is often a bottleneck, so minimizing data transfers is critical. Second, the computation must be expressed as kernels, small, parallelizable units of work launched on the GPU. Third, the results must be transferred back to the CPU's memory for further processing.  The efficiency hinges on all three steps being optimized. A poorly written or inadequately configured kernel launch, inefficient data transfer, or an incorrect usage of memory management mechanisms will significantly hinder performance, potentially preventing GPU usage altogether.

Issues may arise from several sources: incorrect data types, dimension mismatches in tensor operations, improper memory allocation on the GPU, a failure to utilize the appropriate CUDA streams or asynchronous operations, or a lack of proper synchronization between CPU and GPU operations.  Furthermore, even a seemingly minor change, such as altering the loop structure or adding a seemingly innocuous function call, could inadvertently disrupt the optimized flow.  Modern GPU programming relies on highly optimized libraries and frameworks; deviation from their prescribed patterns can lead to suboptimal results.

I've seen instances where a seemingly minor change, like replacing a built-in function with a custom implementation, negates GPU acceleration because the custom function lacks the necessary annotations or optimized implementation for GPU execution.  Similarly, relying on CPU-centric data structures within a GPU kernel can cripple performance.  The GPU requires data to be structured in a way that allows for efficient parallel processing.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Type**

```python
import cupy as cp

# Original (working) code
x_gpu = cp.asarray(x_cpu, dtype=cp.float32) # Correct data type
y_gpu = cp.matmul(W_gpu, x_gpu)

# Modified (failing) code
x_gpu = cp.asarray(x_cpu, dtype=cp.float64) # Incorrect data type; may lack GPU support or be inefficient
y_gpu = cp.matmul(W_gpu, x_gpu)
```

Commentary: This example highlights the importance of data types. While `cp.float64` (double-precision) might offer higher accuracy, it can significantly reduce performance, or even prevent GPU usage entirely, depending on the GPU's capabilities and the library's support.  CuPy, for instance, might not have optimized kernels for double-precision on all GPUs.  The original code, using `cp.float32` (single-precision), is generally preferred for its speed in deep learning contexts.

**Example 2: Unintentional CPU Fallback**

```python
import numpy as np
import cupy as cp

# Original (working) code
x_gpu = cp.asarray(x_cpu)
result_gpu = cp.sum(x_gpu) # Entire operation on GPU

# Modified (failing) code
x_gpu = cp.asarray(x_cpu)
x_cpu = cp.asnumpy(x_gpu) #Unnecessary data transfer to CPU
result_cpu = np.sum(x_cpu) # Computation on CPU
result_gpu = cp.asarray(result_cpu) # Transfer back to GPU (inefficient)
```

Commentary: This demonstrates a common pitfall: inadvertently transferring data back to the CPU.  The modified code unnecessarily moves the data back to the CPU for summation, completely bypassing GPU acceleration.  Effective GPU programming necessitates keeping operations within the GPU's memory space as much as possible.  Always verify that your operations are conducted within the CuPy or equivalent GPU-oriented library to ensure GPU utilization.


**Example 3: Kernel Launch Configuration Issues**

```python
import cupy as cp

# Original (working) code: Optimized kernel launch
kernel = cp.RawKernel(kernel_code, 'my_kernel')
kernel(grid=(blocks_per_grid, 1, 1), block=(threads_per_block, 1, 1), args=(x_gpu, y_gpu))

# Modified (failing) code: Incorrect grid/block configuration
kernel = cp.RawKernel(kernel_code, 'my_kernel')
kernel(grid=(1,1,1), block=(1,1,1), args=(x_gpu, y_gpu))
```

Commentary: This example focuses on the kernel launch parameters.  The `grid` and `block` parameters define the execution configuration on the GPU.  Incorrect values may result in underutilization or failure.  The original code shows a proper configuration adapted to the problem size. The modified code, using only a single thread, completely fails to utilize the parallel processing power of the GPU. Finding the optimal `grid` and `block` sizes often requires experimentation and profiling to match the hardware and problem dimensions effectively.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   Comprehensive CUDA programming guides provided by NVIDIA.  These resources cover various aspects of GPU programming, including kernel design, memory management, and performance optimization.
*   Documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). They offer examples and best practices for GPU usage.
*   Advanced CUDA optimization textbooks.  These books provide in-depth coverage of techniques to maximize GPU performance.
*   Profiling tools.  These tools help identify bottlenecks in GPU code, allowing for targeted optimization.


By carefully examining data transfer mechanisms, kernel launch parameters, and data types, and by utilizing the appropriate profiling tools, one can often pinpoint the reasons for unexpected GPU behavior.  The key is maintaining data residency on the GPU as much as possible and ensuring proper utilization of parallel processing capabilities offered by the hardware.  My own experience shows that systematic debugging, coupled with a strong understanding of GPU architectures and programming paradigms, is essential for successful GPU utilization in demanding tasks like deep learning.
