Coalesced memory access is not merely crucial for texture and surface performance in CUDA; it's fundamentally determinative of performance.  My experience optimizing rendering pipelines for large-scale simulations taught me this starkly. Non-coalesced accesses lead to significant performance degradation, often orders of magnitude slower than their coalesced counterparts. This stems from the underlying architecture of the GPU's memory controllers.  Understanding this is key to efficiently leveraging CUDA's capabilities.

**1. Explanation:**

CUDA threads are grouped into warps, typically 32 threads per warp.  When a warp accesses global memory, the hardware attempts to coalesce these accesses into a single memory transaction.  This means that ideally, all 32 threads in a warp access consecutive memory locations.  If the accesses are not consecutive, multiple memory transactions are required, significantly increasing memory latency and ultimately slowing down the kernel execution.

Textures and surfaces in CUDA are specialized memory structures optimized for efficient read access. However, they still adhere to the principles of coalesced memory access. While the hardware performs some optimizations behind the scenes to improve access patterns, poorly structured texture or surface fetches will inevitably lead to non-coalesced accesses, negating the potential performance gains.  This is particularly noticeable in scenarios involving irregular data access patterns or when dealing with large texture data sets.

Consider a texture representing a heightmap used for terrain rendering. If each thread in a warp attempts to fetch height values from disparate locations in the heightmap, the memory access will be non-coalesced.  Conversely, if the threads access consecutive height values, the access will be coalesced, resulting in a much faster execution.

The performance penalty of non-coalesced memory access is exacerbated by the significant latency associated with global memory access.  Shared memory, on the other hand, offers much lower latency but is limited in size.  Therefore, careful consideration of memory access patterns is crucial for optimizing performance.  In the context of textures and surfaces, this translates to structuring your data and access patterns to maximize coalesced accesses.  This often involves techniques like padding, tiling, and restructuring data to improve spatial locality.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Non-Coalesced Texture Fetch**

```cuda
__global__ void nonCoalescedTextureFetch(const float2* texData, float* output, int width, int height) {
    int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

    if (x < width && y < height) {
        int index = y * width + x; //Non-coalesced access; indices are not consecutive for threads in a warp
        output[index] = tex2D(tex, x, y).x; //texture access
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates a scenario where each thread in a warp accesses a texture element based on its unique (x, y) coordinates.  If the threads within a single warp have widely scattered (x,y) coordinates, their accesses will not coalesce.  The resulting performance will be suboptimal.  The non-consecutive indexing `index = y * width + x;` is the prime culprit here.


**Example 2: Coalesced Texture Fetch**

```cuda
__global__ void coalescedTextureFetch(const float2* texData, float* output, int width, int height) {
    int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y; //Each thread in a warp shares the same y coordinate

    if (x < width && y < height) {
        for (int i = 0; i < blockDim.x; ++i){
            int index = y * width + x + i;
            if (x + i < width)
               output[index] = tex2D(tex, x + i, y).x; //Coalesced access for threads within a warp
        }

    }
}
```

This improved version attempts to enforce coalesced memory access. Threads within a warp share the same `y` coordinate, and each thread accesses consecutive `x` coordinates.  This ensures that the accesses from a single warp will be coalesced.  Note the loop that iterates through multiple texture elements within the warp, ensuring maximum coalescence.  The loop is essential; otherwise, only one texture access per warp would be efficient.  This approach, however, requires careful management of thread block dimensions to avoid out-of-bounds access.


**Example 3: Utilizing Shared Memory for Improved Coalescence**

```cuda
__global__ void sharedMemoryOptimizedTextureFetch(const float2* texData, float* output, int width, int height) {
    __shared__ float sharedTexData[TILE_WIDTH * TILE_HEIGHT]; //TILE_WIDTH and TILE_HEIGHT are appropriately sized for warp size

    int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int tx = threadIdx.x;
    int ty = threadIdx.y;

    if (x < width && y < height) {
        //Load tile into shared memory
        int tileX = x / TILE_WIDTH;
        int tileY = y / TILE_HEIGHT;
        int sharedX = tx + tileX * TILE_WIDTH;
        int sharedY = ty + tileY * TILE_HEIGHT;

        sharedTexData[ty * TILE_WIDTH + tx] = tex2D(tex, sharedX, sharedY).x;
        __syncthreads(); //Synchronize threads before accessing shared memory

        //Process data in shared memory
        output[y * width + x] = sharedTexData[ty * TILE_WIDTH + tx];
    }
}
```

This final example introduces shared memory to further enhance performance. A tile of texture data is loaded into shared memory, enabling subsequent accesses within the warp to be performed from the much faster shared memory.  The `__syncthreads()` call ensures all threads within the warp have loaded their data before accessing it, preventing race conditions.  This approach requires careful consideration of tile size and data organization to ensure optimal shared memory usage.

Through years of working with CUDA, I've observed that diligently following these principles consistently translates into significant performance improvements, particularly for complex applications like real-time rendering and scientific computation where texture and surface performance are paramount.  Ignoring coalesced memory access leads to severely suboptimal performance and often necessitates extensive debugging and optimization efforts later on. A robust understanding of this concept is foundational to achieving truly efficient CUDA code.
