Utilizing the GPU capabilities of an AWS SageMaker ml.t3.2xlarge instance requires a fundamental understanding that this instance type, by design, lacks a physical GPU. It is a CPU-optimized instance intended for general-purpose workloads, including those involving machine learning model development but not GPU-intensive tasks like training deep neural networks or large-scale inference where substantial parallelism is advantageous. Consequently, you cannot “leverage” a GPU directly on this particular instance. The ‘ml’ designation in SageMaker simply denotes instances suitable for machine learning, not that they inherently contain GPUs. Instead, you must either select a SageMaker instance type equipped with a GPU or utilize SageMaker's managed service offerings designed to offload GPU-specific computations.

The key misunderstanding here often stems from the fact that software libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch often have GPU support built-in. When these libraries are initialized on a CPU-only instance, they will detect the absence of a GPU and default to CPU execution. While these libraries can still process workloads, the computation will be significantly slower for tasks that would benefit from GPU parallelism. Therefore, attempting to use `torch.cuda.is_available()` or `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` on an ml.t3.2xlarge will unequivocally return `False` or an empty list, respectively, indicating the absence of a detectable GPU.

To address the need for GPU acceleration within the SageMaker ecosystem, three primary approaches are relevant: leveraging SageMaker's training jobs, using SageMaker inference endpoints with GPU-backed instances, and using managed notebook instances with appropriately selected hardware.

**1. SageMaker Training Jobs:**

This method allows you to offload your model training process to a managed environment with GPU instances. You prepare your training code, specify a suitable SageMaker training instance type (such as `ml.p3.2xlarge` or `ml.g4dn.xlarge`), and SageMaker will handle provisioning the hardware, executing your training script, and managing all associated infrastructure. You do not directly interact with the GPU itself, but your computation takes advantage of it within the managed environment.

```python
# Example of a minimal training script (train.py) using TensorFlow
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def create_dummy_model():
  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
  ])
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  return model

if __name__ == '__main__':
  model = create_dummy_model()
  x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 784)
  y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=0)
  model.save('my_model.h5')

# This script is saved as train.py

# Below demonstrates how you'd use this within SageMaker Python SDK
import sagemaker
from sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlow

role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()
estimator = TensorFlow(
    entry_point='train.py',
    role=role,
    instance_count=1,
    instance_type='ml.p3.2xlarge', #Crucially: A GPU instance
    framework_version='2.11',
    py_version='py39',
    output_path = 's3://your-bucket/output', #Replace with your s3 bucket
    source_dir='./', #directory containing train.py
)

estimator.fit()
```

This example illustrates a basic TensorFlow training job using the SageMaker Python SDK. The crucial part is `instance_type='ml.p3.2xlarge'`, which tells SageMaker to provision an instance with a suitable GPU.  The training script will execute within this GPU-backed environment.  The dummy model is saved as 'my_model.h5' within the job, which in turn is then transferred into the specified s3 bucket. Notice that we didn't make any changes to the model code to enable GPU usage. This is because, under the hood, tensorflow detects if a GPU is available and uses it automatically if it is. This approach requires modification of the underlying SageMaker configurations rather than the model code itself. The `source_dir` parameter specifies where your Python code resides and ensures it is available in the training job's container.

**2. SageMaker Inference Endpoints with GPU Instances:**

After training, you might want to deploy your model as an inference endpoint. Again, utilizing a GPU instance is possible using managed SageMaker endpoints. Similar to training, the selection of the appropriate instance type during endpoint creation ensures GPU support.

```python
# Code Snippet illustrating how to deploy a saved model to a GPU-backed endpoint.

import sagemaker
from sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlowModel

role = sagemaker.get_execution_role()

model = TensorFlowModel(
    model_data='s3://your-bucket/output/tensorflow-training-your_job_name/output/model.tar.gz', #Location of model.tar.gz created during Training. Ensure correct path
    role=role,
    framework_version='2.11',
    py_version='py39',
)

predictor = model.deploy(
    initial_instance_count=1,
    instance_type='ml.g4dn.xlarge',  #Crucially: A GPU instance
)

# Example of using endpoint for prediction with a random input
import numpy as np

input_data = np.random.rand(1, 784)

# The predictor object can be used as follows.
output = predictor.predict(input_data)

print(output)

predictor.delete_endpoint() #Clean up your endpoint
```

This code showcases deployment using a `TensorFlowModel` object. Note the crucial parameter `instance_type='ml.g4dn.xlarge'`, which designates a GPU-enabled instance.  The model loading and inference operations will now take advantage of the GPU's parallel processing capabilities for significantly faster prediction times if applicable. This setup is suitable for real-time or near-real-time inference. After deployment, the `predictor` object can be used for making predictions, utilizing the underlying GPU. Don't forget to delete your endpoint when you no longer need it to avoid unnecessary costs.

**3. Managed SageMaker Notebook Instances with GPU instances:**

You can launch a SageMaker Notebook instance with an appropriate GPU-equipped instance type. While you are directly interacting with an interactive notebook environment, under the hood, this option does allocate a physical GPU for computations initiated from within the notebook. Note this method is different from the situation in the original question wherein the notebook instance lacked a GPU.

```python
# Illustrating the notebook environment: How to check for GPU availability
import torch
import tensorflow as tf

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print("PyTorch is using GPU!")
    print("Number of available GPUs:", torch.cuda.device_count())
    print("Current device:", torch.cuda.current_device())
else:
    print("PyTorch is not using GPU.")


if tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'):
    print("TensorFlow is using GPU!")
    print("Available GPUs:", tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))

else:
    print("TensorFlow is not using GPU.")
```

This snippet demonstrates how to confirm GPU access within the notebook. If the notebook instance you created was backed by a GPU, then these checks will report the presence and usage of the GPU hardware within the managed environment. The output would reflect that both PyTorch and TensorFlow can access and utilize the GPU. The instance selection during notebook creation is the critical factor in whether this output is positive. Note this script will return false in the scenario of the original question since the notebook instance in that case would not be GPU enabled.

In summary, leveraging a GPU in the SageMaker ecosystem involves selecting the appropriate infrastructure (instance type) for your specific task - whether it is training, model deployment, or interactive exploration within a notebook - rather than expecting a CPU-centric instance to perform GPU-accelerated computations directly. The approach is dependent on the infrastructure configuration rather than changes in your model code itself.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I would recommend studying the official AWS SageMaker documentation on training jobs, inference endpoints, and notebook instances. The documentation provides comprehensive information on instance types, configurations, and the specifics of using each component effectively. Also exploring the documentation of the specific frameworks (Tensorflow, PyTorch) regarding their GPU utilization functionalities would be valuable. Furthermore, researching community resources and blogs focused on practical SageMaker implementations can greatly assist with practical implementations and resolving common challenges.
