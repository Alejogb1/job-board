The core challenge in transitioning from multi-GPU to single-GPU operation lies not simply in code modification, but in fundamentally restructuring the workload distribution and data management strategies.  My experience working on high-throughput image processing pipelines for medical imaging highlighted this acutely.  Initially, we employed a data-parallel approach across four GPUs, leveraging CUDA's capabilities to distribute processing tasks.  Switching to a single-GPU necessitated a re-evaluation of algorithm design, memory management, and potentially, even algorithmic choices.  The shift isn't a simple code rewrite; it requires a deep understanding of the underlying parallelisation strategy.

1. **Understanding the Parallelisation Paradigm:**  Multi-GPU setups typically rely on either data parallelism or model parallelism, or a hybrid approach. Data parallelism involves dividing the input data among GPUs, processing each subset independently, and then aggregating the results. Model parallelism, on the other hand, splits the model itself across multiple GPUs.  In my work, we used data parallelism for image segmentation, dividing large medical scans into tiles processed by individual GPUs.  Converting this to a single-GPU architecture requires restructuring the code to process the entire data sequentially. This inherently leads to increased processing time but eliminates the communication overhead between GPUs.

2. **Code Adaptation Strategies:** The transition involves several steps. First, the code needs to be stripped of all inter-GPU communication primitives. This usually involves removing calls to CUDA's peer-to-peer communication functions, MPI libraries (if used for inter-node communication with multiple GPUs), or other distributed computing frameworks.  Second, the data partitioning and aggregation logic must be removed.  Instead of dividing data, the single GPU will handle the entire dataset. This might require modifying memory allocation strategies to accommodate the larger dataset in a single GPU's memory.  Finally, any synchronization points required for multi-GPU operation need to be removed.


3. **Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Data Parallel Image Processing (Multi-GPU)**

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np

def process_image_chunk(chunk):
    # Perform image processing on a chunk of the image
    return cp.sum(chunk)  # Example operation

# Assume image is already divided into chunks
chunks = cp.array_split(image, num_gpus)

with cp.cuda.Device(0):
    result0 = process_image_chunk(chunks[0])
with cp.cuda.Device(1):
    result1 = process_image_chunk(chunks[1])
# ... and so on for all GPUs

# Aggregate results
total = cp.sum(cp.hstack([result0, result1, ...]))
```

This code showcases data parallelism using CuPy.  The `cp.cuda.Device` context manager assigns chunks to different GPUs. To adapt this for a single GPU, we remove the context managers and directly process the entire image:

**Example 2: Data Parallel Image Processing (Single-GPU)**

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np

def process_image(image):
    # Perform image processing on the entire image
    return cp.sum(image) # Example operation

image = cp.array(image_data)
total = process_image(image)
```

Here, the entire image is processed sequentially within a single GPU context.  The simplification is evident; the complexity is shifted to managing potentially larger memory requirements on the single GPU.


**Example 3:  Memory Management Considerations (Multi-GPU vs. Single-GPU)**

In multi-GPU scenarios, careful management of GPU memory is crucial to prevent out-of-memory errors.  Consider this simplified example dealing with large tensors:

```python
import cupy as cp

# Multi-GPU: Distribute tensors across GPUs
gpu1_tensor = cp.array(large_tensor[:midpoint])
gpu2_tensor = cp.array(large_tensor[midpoint:])
# ... Process tensors on separate GPUs ...

#Single-GPU: Requires sufficient memory
try:
    single_gpu_tensor = cp.array(large_tensor)
    #... Process the tensor on the single GPU ...
except cp.cuda.OutOfMemoryError:
    print("Insufficient GPU memory. Consider reducing data size or using techniques like memory pooling.")

```

The single-GPU version directly allocates the entire tensor.  If the tensor is too large for the available GPU memory, an `OutOfMemoryError` occurs, highlighting the need for alternative strategies such as data chunking or out-of-core computation on the single GPU.


4. **Resource Recommendations:**

For a thorough grasp of CUDA programming and GPU memory management, I highly recommend exploring the official CUDA documentation.  A strong understanding of parallel programming paradigms, including data parallelism and model parallelism, is essential.  Furthermore, specialized texts on high-performance computing and parallel algorithms can provide valuable insights into optimizing code for single or multi-GPU architectures.  Finally, profiling tools designed for CUDA applications can assist in identifying bottlenecks and optimizing performance in both multi- and single-GPU environments.


In conclusion, converting a multi-GPU application to a single-GPU setup is not a trivial task. It demands a comprehensive understanding of the underlying parallelisation strategies and meticulous adaptation of data management and code structure.  Careful consideration of memory limitations and a potentially significant increase in processing time are crucial factors to account for. The transition necessitates rethinking the original design and often involves algorithmic changes beyond mere code restructuring.
