Tensor selection based on index tensor boundaries requires a nuanced understanding of advanced indexing in array-oriented programming languages like Python with NumPy or TensorFlow/PyTorch.  My experience working on large-scale geophysical simulations heavily involved manipulating high-dimensional tensors, often necessitating precisely this type of indexing.  The key is recognizing that index tensors themselves define ranges, not just single indices.  This enables flexible and efficient selection of tensor sub-regions without explicit looping.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The core concept lies in leveraging broadcasting rules coupled with boolean indexing and advanced array slicing.  An index tensor doesn't merely point to a single element; it can specify a range or a collection of indices within a target tensor's dimensions.  This is facilitated by creating index tensors whose shapes are compatible, via broadcasting, with the dimensions of the target tensor.  The values within these index tensors determine the selection.  For example, if a 3D tensor represents spatial data (x, y, z), an index tensor could define a cuboid region of interest by specifying starting and ending indices along each axis.  This approach proves superior to explicit nested loops in terms of performance, especially for high-dimensional tensors and complex selection criteria.

Boolean indexing further enhances this capability.  One can create a boolean tensor of the same shape as the target tensor, where `True` values indicate elements to be selected, and `False` values indicate elements to be excluded.  This boolean tensor acts as a mask, efficiently selecting elements based on arbitrary conditions applied element-wise.  Combining boolean indexing with index tensors allows for highly specific and sophisticated selections.  For instance, one could select only elements within a specific cuboid region *and* satisfying a certain threshold based on the tensor's values.

Understanding broadcasting is crucial.  NumPy and similar libraries will implicitly expand the dimensions of smaller index tensors to match the target tensor, enabling concise and efficient indexing. This automatic alignment simplifies the process of defining intricate selections.  However, it's vital to ensure shape compatibility to avoid unexpected broadcasting behaviors.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Slicing with Index Tensors**

```python
import numpy as np

# Target tensor: 3D array
data_tensor = np.arange(24).reshape((2, 3, 4))

# Index tensors specifying a sub-region:
start_indices = np.array([0, 1, 2])
end_indices = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Selecting the sub-region (note the slicing syntax with index tensors)
sub_tensor = data_tensor[start_indices, :end_indices, :]

print(data_tensor)
print(sub_tensor)
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward selection using index tensors to define start and end indices along each axis. Note that the `:` in the second dimension means we select all elements along that axis between the specified start and end indices.  This approach is highly adaptable; the `start_indices` and `end_indices` could be computed dynamically based on various criteria.


**Example 2: Boolean Indexing and Selection**

```python
import numpy as np

# Target tensor
data_tensor = np.random.rand(3, 4, 5)

# Boolean condition: selecting elements greater than 0.5
boolean_mask = data_tensor > 0.5

# Applying the mask to select elements
selected_elements = data_tensor[boolean_mask]

print(data_tensor)
print(boolean_mask)
print(selected_elements)
```

Here, a boolean mask is generated by applying a condition element-wise to the `data_tensor`.  This mask then directly selects elements where the condition holds true. This exemplifies how boolean indexing offers a powerful tool for selective tensor manipulation.


**Example 3: Combining Index Tensors and Boolean Indexing**

```python
import numpy as np

# Target tensor
data_tensor = np.random.rand(4, 5, 6)

# Index tensors defining a sub-region
x_indices = np.array([1, 2])
y_indices = np.arange(3)

# Boolean condition: selecting elements greater than 0.7 within the sub-region
boolean_mask = data_tensor[x_indices, y_indices, :] > 0.7

# Selecting elements based on both index tensors and the boolean condition.
selected_elements = data_tensor[x_indices, y_indices, :][boolean_mask]

print(data_tensor[x_indices, y_indices, :])
print(boolean_mask)
print(selected_elements)
```

This combines the strengths of both techniques.  A sub-region is defined first using index tensors. Then, a boolean condition refines the selection within that sub-region.  The efficiency stems from performing the boolean operation on a smaller, pre-selected subset of the tensor, rather than the entire tensor.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend studying the documentation for NumPy's advanced indexing capabilities, exploring textbooks on numerical computation and scientific computing, and consulting publications specializing in high-performance computing and array-based programming.  Mastering broadcasting rules is paramount.  Furthermore, the official documentation for TensorFlow and PyTorch offers valuable insights into tensor manipulation and optimized indexing strategies tailored to their respective frameworks.  A strong grasp of linear algebra will provide a foundational understanding of the underlying mathematical structures.
