No, PyTorch officially supports CUDA on NVIDIA GPUs with a compute capability of 3.5 or higher. The Quadro K2100M, a mobile GPU released in 2013, possesses a compute capability of 3.0, rendering it incompatible with current versions of PyTorch for hardware-accelerated deep learning using CUDA. My experience porting a legacy computer vision system last year highlighted this very issue. We had to replace several older mobile workstations, including some featuring the K2100M, because their integrated GPUs were insufficient to efficiently train a model developed with recent PyTorch releases.

The underlying reason for this limitation is the evolutionary nature of both hardware and software. NVIDIA continuously develops new GPU architectures, each introducing more advanced features and instruction sets. To leverage these capabilities, CUDA libraries, which interface between the hardware and software, must be updated. PyTorch, in turn, is built upon these CUDA libraries and requires a minimum supported compute capability to ensure optimal performance and access to necessary functionalities like tensor cores and optimized matrix operations. GPUs below this threshold, like the K2100M, lack the architectural features required for these CUDA library operations used by PyTorch.

While a system with a K2100M can run Python code and even potentially utilize CPU-based PyTorch implementations, which are significantly slower, it won't benefit from the massive parallelism offered by GPUs. The absence of hardware acceleration fundamentally changes the development experience; tasks that might take minutes on a compatible GPU could take hours or even days on the CPU. This makes the K2100M unsuitable for the computationally intensive operations involved in training, and even in real-time inference with, modern neural networks. It is not merely a performance bottleneck; the CUDA runtime will fail to recognize the GPU’s architecture when attempting to load and run the compiled CUDA kernels.

To provide a more concrete understanding, consider the following scenario: Assume I have a basic PyTorch convolutional neural network that I am attempting to train. If I had a compatible GPU, the code would run as follows:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Check for GPU availability
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    print("CUDA is available. Running on GPU.")
else:
    device = torch.device("cpu")
    print("CUDA is NOT available. Running on CPU.")


# Define a simple CNN
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2,2)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16*16*16, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Create an instance of the model and move it to the device
model = SimpleCNN().to(device)

# Create dummy data
inputs = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32).to(device)
targets = torch.randint(0, 10, (1,)).to(device)

# Define Loss and Optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Example training loop - not real training
for _ in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print("Training loop completed.")
```
In this first code example, the `torch.cuda.is_available()` function determines if a CUDA-enabled GPU is recognized by PyTorch.  If a K2100M was present, `torch.cuda.is_available()` would return `False`, causing the code to execute on the CPU. The model and dummy data, assigned to the device using `.to(device)`, would then be allocated to the CPU rather than the GPU. The training itself would proceed, albeit at a far slower pace.

Let's explore a second example focused on explicit CUDA device selection, as you might see when you have a mixed environment with multiple GPUs:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Check for available CUDA devices
num_devices = torch.cuda.device_count()

if num_devices > 0:
    # Attempt to use the first CUDA device (usually the primary GPU)
    try:
        device = torch.device("cuda:0")
        print(f"Using CUDA device: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
    except RuntimeError as e:
         print(f"Error: {e}")
         device = torch.device("cpu")
         print("Falling back to CPU")
else:
    device = torch.device("cpu")
    print("No CUDA devices found. Running on CPU.")

# Define a simple CNN (same as above)
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2,2)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16*16*16, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Create an instance of the model and move it to the device
model = SimpleCNN().to(device)

# Create dummy data
inputs = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32).to(device)
targets = torch.randint(0, 10, (1,)).to(device)

# Define Loss and Optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Example training loop
for _ in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

print("Training loop completed.")

```

Here, `torch.cuda.device_count()` is utilized to determine the quantity of available CUDA-enabled GPUs. While a K2100M would not register, this is still critical for debugging GPU issues. The code attempts to explicitly target “cuda:0,” the first enumerated GPU. If there were other compatible GPUs, we could modify the number following the 'cuda:' prefix. If a compatible GPU is not available, such as in the case of a machine with only the K2100M, a runtime error would occur when attempting to allocate the device, which results in a graceful fallback to the CPU.

Finally, imagine a situation where you intend to force the CUDA backend even knowing that the K2100M isn’t supported, perhaps through improper configuration:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Attempt to force usage of CUDA (incorrectly)
try:
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    print("Attempting to force CUDA usage...")

    # Define a simple CNN
    class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
            self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
            self.relu = nn.ReLU()
            self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2,2)
            self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
            self.fc = nn.Linear(16*16*16, 10)

        def forward(self, x):
            x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
            x = self.flatten(x)
            x = self.fc(x)
            return x


    # Create an instance of the model and move it to the device
    model = SimpleCNN().to(device)

    # Create dummy data
    inputs = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32).to(device)
    targets = torch.randint(0, 10, (1,)).to(device)


    # Define Loss and Optimizer
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

    # Example training loop
    for _ in range(10):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    print("Training loop completed.")



except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    print("CUDA support failed, ensure that you have a compatible CUDA-enabled GPU installed.")

```
In this example, even if we explicitly define the device as “cuda,” the underlying CUDA runtime will throw an exception since the GPU is not recognized as a CUDA compatible device due to the insufficient compute capability. The try/except block catches the exception, indicating that hardware acceleration is not available for this specific GPU. Such an error emphasizes the importance of verifying the compute capability of your graphics card.

For anyone working with PyTorch, understanding the hardware requirements for GPU acceleration is essential. I would recommend carefully consulting the PyTorch documentation for system requirements. NVIDIA provides detailed specifications for their GPUs, including compute capability, on their website. The CUDA Toolkit documentation also outlines supported architectures. Further, community forums related to deep learning and PyTorch can provide valuable insights into compatibility issues encountered by other users.  Finally, reviewing the release notes for each PyTorch version is crucial, as hardware support can change as PyTorch and the CUDA ecosystem evolve. A clear understanding of these factors helps avoid the kind of performance issues and frustration I have personally experienced with legacy hardware like the K2100M.
