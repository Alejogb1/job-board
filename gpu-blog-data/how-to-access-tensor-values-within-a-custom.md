Accessing individual tensor values within a custom Keras loss function requires careful consideration of how TensorFlow, and by extension Keras, operates on tensors during the training process. Crucially, these operations occur within a symbolic graph, meaning we're not dealing with concrete numbers at the loss function definition phase, but rather with symbolic placeholders that represent these values. Directly accessing "values" in the traditional programming sense, such as through indexing or assignment, is not possible until the computation graph is executed within a TensorFlow session, or in Keras through the `fit` method. My experience with model debugging has taught me that misinterpreting this crucial difference leads to common errors.

The loss function, provided as an argument to the Keras model, receives tensors as input. These input tensors are typically `y_true` (the ground truth labels) and `y_pred` (the modelâ€™s predictions). These are not Python arrays or NumPy arrays in the conventional sense. They are TensorFlow tensors, representing a batch of data. It's essential to manipulate these tensors using TensorFlow operations. We need to create a graph of operations that TensorFlow will eventually execute when processing batches of input data. We cannot directly pull scalar values or modify the tensors in place. Instead, TensorFlow functions are used to perform all necessary transformations.

Here's how you typically operate:

1. **Avoid Pythonic indexing or `numpy` operations within the loss function:** These will cause errors as they attempt to work on the symbolic tensors, not concrete numerical values.

2. **Utilize TensorFlow operations:** `tf.math`, `tf.reduce_*`, `tf.gather`, and other TensorFlow functions are necessary. For example, if you need the mean of an array use `tf.reduce_mean`, or if you need to take the absolute value, use `tf.abs`.

3. **Think in terms of tensors, not numbers:** Loss functions are evaluated for an entire batch of data simultaneously, so the tensor represents the entire batch, and scalar operations operate on each member of that batch. This can be initially counter-intuitive if one is used to manipulating a single number at a time.

Below are three code examples demonstrating different scenarios and correct approaches within a Keras loss function:

**Example 1: Simple Mean Squared Error with Manual Adjustment**

This example demonstrates how to calculate mean squared error with a small modification to the predicted values. I have seen numerous cases of data bias which required this kind of simple but necessary operation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def custom_mse_adjustment(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Calculates mean squared error after adding 0.1 to each prediction
    """
    adjusted_pred = y_pred + 0.1  # Add 0.1 to each predicted value
    squared_diff = tf.math.square(y_true - adjusted_pred)
    mean_squared_error = tf.reduce_mean(squared_diff)
    return mean_squared_error


# Sample Data and Model
input_shape = (10,)
model = keras.Sequential([
  keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
  keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_mse_adjustment)

X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=2)

```

**Commentary:**

-   The `custom_mse_adjustment` function takes `y_true` and `y_pred` tensors as input.
-   We use `tf.math.add` to add 0.1 to the `y_pred` tensor, producing a new tensor (`adjusted_pred`). The 0.1 will be applied to every member of the batch.
-   `tf.math.square` calculates the square of the difference.
-   `tf.reduce_mean` calculates the average of the squared errors for the batch, returning a single scalar tensor which becomes the loss.
-   The function operates on entire tensors using TensorFlow functions; no direct value access is required.

**Example 2: Weighted Loss based on Predicted Value Range**

This example showcases a more complex scenario where the loss is weighted based on the ranges of the predicted values. This pattern is applicable in situations where we need to give different weight to errors according to the predicted value, for example when predicting probability distributions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def custom_weighted_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Calculates a weighted loss where the weight is higher if y_pred is
    outside a range.
    """
    low_range = 0.2
    high_range = 0.8
    
    #Create masks: 1 if outside range, 0 if inside
    mask_low = tf.cast(y_pred < low_range, dtype=tf.float32)
    mask_high = tf.cast(y_pred > high_range, dtype=tf.float32)
    
    weight = 1.0 + 2.0 * (mask_low + mask_high)  # Apply weight outside the range
    
    loss = tf.math.squared_difference(y_true, y_pred)
    weighted_loss = loss * weight
    
    return tf.reduce_mean(weighted_loss)


# Sample Data and Model
input_shape = (10,)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_weighted_loss)

X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=2)
```

**Commentary:**

-   `tf.cast(condition, dtype)` converts the boolean result of `y_pred < low_range` into floating point 0s and 1s for masking.
-   `tf.math.squared_difference` calculates the squared difference between predictions and true labels.
-   The `weight` tensor is computed by adding 2.0 if the predicted values are outside the specified ranges, therefore creating a weighted loss.
-   The weighted loss is then calculated, and then we find the average across the entire batch.

**Example 3: Loss based on a specific element of the predicted tensor**

This example shows how to access specific elements of predicted tensors, using the `tf.gather` function. This is crucial when a prediction might be represented by an array or vector rather than a scalar, and you need to apply a loss to one or several selected elements.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def custom_element_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Calculates loss based on only the second value of each
    prediction. It expects y_pred to have shape (batch_size, 3).
    """
    selected_element = tf.gather(y_pred, [1], axis=-1)
    loss = tf.math.squared_difference(y_true, selected_element)
    return tf.reduce_mean(loss)

# Sample Data and Model
input_shape = (10,)
output_shape = 3 # Prediction now 3 values per instance
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
    keras.layers.Dense(output_shape)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_element_loss)

X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=2)
```
**Commentary:**

-   `tf.gather(tensor, indices, axis)` extracts a set of values along a specified axis of a tensor. Here we are using `indices=[1]` to extract the 2nd element (index 1) of every prediction. We are using `axis=-1` to target the last axis, which is the one that holds the array of predictions. This implies that `y_pred` is expected to have a shape where the last dimension is at least of size 2. The shape of `selected_element` becomes `(batch_size, 1)`.
-   The function only uses that element to calculate the squared difference, then produces the average as the loss.
-   This shows how you can select particular elements within tensors, instead of operating on the whole tensor. This functionality has been key for several problems I had when working with structured outputs.

When debugging Keras loss functions, I typically utilize a few strategies. One is to simplify the loss function incrementally, initially replacing the custom logic with a simple MSE or even zero, then progressively adding complexity while checking after each small modification that the training process is still progressing as expected. Another is to use TensorFlow's eager execution mode (enabled by calling `tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)`), which allows for a more Python-like debugging environment, with the ability to print out tensor values within the functions as they are called. This strategy can reveal unexpected tensor dimensions or types that might cause issues in the graph execution stage.

For further exploration, I suggest referencing the official TensorFlow documentation on tensor operations. Study the `tf.math`, `tf.reduce`, `tf.gather`, and other functions that manipulate tensors. Understanding the difference between graph mode execution and eager execution also provides better insight into the behavior of Keras and TensorFlow. The TensorFlow tutorials and examples, which often present loss function examples, are also a valuable resource. I also suggest studying the code of existing loss functions to understand best practices.
