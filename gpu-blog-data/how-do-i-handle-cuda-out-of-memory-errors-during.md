CUDA out-of-memory errors during matrix multiplication stem primarily from insufficient GPU memory to accommodate the input matrices, intermediate results, and the CUDA kernel's execution overhead.  My experience debugging high-performance computing applications, particularly those involving large-scale linear algebra, reveals that this is rarely a simple matter of increasing GPU memory; effective solutions demand a nuanced understanding of memory management within the CUDA framework.  This necessitates strategies that minimize memory usage and optimize data transfer.

**1.  Understanding Memory Allocation and Management in CUDA**

CUDA's memory hierarchy involves several distinct memory spaces: global memory (the largest, slowest, and shared across all threads), shared memory (fast, small, and accessible only within a thread block), and registers (the fastest, smallest, and private to each thread).  Effective matrix multiplication hinges on judiciously utilizing these memory spaces.  Naive implementations often allocate both input matrices and the result matrix in global memory, leading to out-of-memory issues, especially when dealing with matrices exceeding several gigabytes.  Overlooking the potential for intermediate results also exacerbates the problem.

Furthermore, understanding the nuances of memory allocation is crucial.  `cudaMalloc` allocates memory on the GPU, while `cudaFree` deallocates it.  Failing to free allocated memory leads to memory leaks, contributing to out-of-memory errors, especially in applications with iterative computations.  Efficient memory management, therefore, requires careful planning of allocation and deallocation steps.

**2.  Strategies for Mitigating Out-of-Memory Errors**

Several strategies can address out-of-memory errors in CUDA matrix multiplication.  These include tiling, using shared memory, and performing computation in smaller batches.

**a) Tiling:**  Tiling divides the matrices into smaller blocks (tiles) that fit comfortably within the GPU's memory.  The multiplication is then performed tile by tile, with intermediate results being stored and managed efficiently.  This reduces the peak memory usage at any given time.

**b) Shared Memory Optimization:** Utilizing shared memory for storing smaller portions of the input matrices and accumulating partial results significantly speeds up computation and reduces reliance on slower global memory access. The locality of shared memory leads to considerable performance improvements.

**c) Batched Computation:** Processing the matrices in smaller batches reduces the memory footprint per iteration.  This strategy is particularly beneficial when dealing with exceptionally large matrices that cannot be processed entirely within a single kernel launch.


**3. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate these strategies in CUDA C++.  These examples assume familiarity with CUDA programming concepts and are simplified for clarity.  Real-world applications would necessitate more sophisticated error handling and performance optimizations.

**Example 1: Naive (Error-Prone) Implementation**

```cpp
__global__ void matrixMultiplyNaive(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int width) {
  int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

  if (row < width && col < width) {
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int k = 0; k < width; ++k) {
      sum += A[row * width + k] * B[k * width + col];
    }
    C[row * width + col] = sum;
  }
}
```

This naive implementation allocates all matrices in global memory, leading to out-of-memory errors for large matrices.  No attempt is made to optimize memory access or usage.

**Example 2: Tiled Matrix Multiplication**

```cpp
__global__ void matrixMultiplyTiled(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int width, int tileSize) {
  __shared__ float tileA[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];
  __shared__ float tileB[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];

  int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
  int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  float sum = 0.0f;

  for (int k = 0; k < width; k += tileSize) {
    tileA[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = A[(row)*width + k + threadIdx.x];
    tileB[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = B[(k + threadIdx.y)*width + col];
    __syncthreads(); // Synchronize threads within the block

    for (int i = 0; i < tileSize; ++i) {
      sum += tileA[threadIdx.y][i] * tileB[i][threadIdx.x];
    }
    __syncthreads();
  }

  if (row < width && col < width) {
    C[row * width + col] = sum;
  }
}
```

This example incorporates tiling, using shared memory (`tileA` and `tileB`) to hold smaller portions of the matrices.  `__syncthreads()` ensures proper synchronization within the thread block.  This approach significantly reduces global memory access and is less prone to out-of-memory errors.  `TILE_SIZE` is a compile-time constant that should be tuned based on the GPU's capabilities.

**Example 3: Batched Matrix Multiplication**

```cpp
__global__ void matrixMultiplyBatched(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int width, int batchSize) {
  int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (idx < batchSize) {
    int row = idx % width; //Calculate the row and column index within the batch
    int col = idx / width;
    float sum = 0.0f;
    for (int k = 0; k < width; ++k) {
      sum += A[row * width + k] * B[k * width + col];
    }
    C[row * width + col] = sum;
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates batched processing. Instead of multiplying the entire matrices at once, it processes smaller sections (`batchSize` elements).  The kernel is launched multiple times to process the entire matrices, dividing the workload and minimizing memory requirements per launch. The calculation of row and column indices ensures correct mapping within the batch.


**4. Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration, I recommend consulting the CUDA C++ Programming Guide, the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation, and any relevant textbooks on parallel computing and GPU programming.  Understanding the nuances of memory coalescing and warp divergence will be crucial for optimizing performance and memory usage further.  Analyzing memory usage patterns using profiling tools is also invaluable for identifying memory bottlenecks.  Experimentation with different tiling sizes and batch sizes is also necessary for optimal performance in diverse hardware setups.
