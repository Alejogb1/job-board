The appearance of NaN (Not a Number) in training loss, despite seemingly valid input data, often stems from numerical instability within the gradient calculation process, not necessarily from problems directly within the dataset itself.  In my experience troubleshooting neural networks over the past decade, I've encountered this issue numerous times; it frequently arises from subtle interactions between activation functions, optimizer choices, and the scaling of input features.  The problem isn't always immediately evident in simple data inspections.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

NaN values during training typically propagate from an undefined mathematical operation within the loss function's calculation or its gradient computation. This can happen in several ways:

* **Exploding Gradients:**  Extremely large gradients can lead to numerical overflow, resulting in NaN values.  This frequently occurs in deep networks or those using certain activation functions (like sigmoid or tanh without appropriate scaling)  where the gradient magnitude is amplified through the layers. The optimizer struggles to handle these excessively large numbers, ultimately producing NaN values in the weights and subsequently the loss.

* **Division by Zero:**  The loss function or its derivative might involve a division operation.  If the denominator approaches or reaches zero during training, a NaN will result. This can be caused by data issues (though you've stated your data is within range, it might contain values that lead to such divisions indirectly) or by the network learning parameters that cause such conditions.

* **Logarithm of Non-positive Values:**  Many loss functions utilize logarithmic functions (e.g., binary cross-entropy, which is common in classification). If the input to the logarithm is zero or negative, NaN is generated. This can happen if the network outputs probabilities outside the [0, 1] range, often caused by issues with the activation function (e.g., a sigmoid output slightly less than 0 due to numerical precision limitations).

* **Numerical Precision Limitations:**  Even with theoretically sound calculations, the limited precision of floating-point numbers can lead to subtle errors that accumulate during training. These subtle inaccuracies might manifest as NaN values, especially during prolonged training runs with complex computations.

Determining the exact cause requires careful examination of the loss function, the network architecture, the activation functions employed, the optimizer used, and the range of the input data.  It is crucial to investigate both the forward pass (calculating the loss) and the backward pass (calculating the gradients).


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate potential issues and solutions with Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

**Example 1: Exploding Gradients with Sigmoid and inadequate scaling.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Unscaled Data
X = np.random.rand(100, 10) * 1000  # Large values
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(100, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

try:
    model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Training failed: {e}")

#Solution: Data scaling using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler before training
```

Commentary:  The large values in X might lead to exploding gradients due to the sigmoid activation. The abrupt failure during training underscores the problem.  Preprocessing, for example, using `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler`, to scale features between 0 and 1 would mitigate the problem.

**Example 2:  Logarithm of Zero/Negative Values in Binary Cross-entropy.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Introduce a potential problem: force predicted probabilities outside [0,1] range.
model.layers[-1].bias.assign([10.0])

try:
  model.fit(X, y, epochs=1)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
  print(f"Training failed: {e}")

```

Commentary: Forcing a large bias in the output layer can cause the sigmoid output to be close to 1 or 0, leading to numerical issues in the binary cross-entropy loss, which involves taking the logarithm of the predicted probabilities.  This highlights the need to monitor the output values of the network. Regularization techniques might help prevent such extreme values.

**Example 3:  Numerical Instability due to a complex loss function and Optimizer Choice.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# A complex loss function â€“ prone to numerical issues
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.math.log(1 + tf.abs(y_true - y_pred))**2)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])


X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.random.rand(100, 1)

model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss=custom_loss) #RMSprop can be particularly susceptible

try:
    model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Training failed: {e}")
```

Commentary: This example demonstrates how a custom loss function, especially one with potential for numerical instability (like the one shown), combined with a potentially sensitive optimizer (RMSprop), can lead to NaN values.  Switching optimizers (like Adam or SGD with careful learning rate selection), simplifying the loss function, or implementing gradient clipping can improve numerical stability.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of numerical stability in deep learning, I would suggest exploring the relevant chapters in standard deep learning textbooks by Goodfellow et al. and Bishop.  Furthermore, research papers focusing on gradient clipping, optimizer optimization, and techniques for mitigating numerical instability in neural network training would be invaluable.  Consulting the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, etc.) on numerical precision, and handling of floating-point numbers is also essential.  Finally, I'd advise reviewing the source code of widely used loss functions and optimizers for deeper understanding of their implementations and potential numerical pitfalls.
