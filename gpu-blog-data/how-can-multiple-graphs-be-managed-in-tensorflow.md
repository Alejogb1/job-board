TensorFlow, from my experience working on large-scale model deployments, inherently uses a default graph for all operations unless specified otherwise. This single, global graph can quickly become unwieldy when dealing with multiple models, especially during development or complex experimentation. Effectively managing separate computational graphs is crucial for maintaining code modularity, facilitating resource isolation, and enabling efficient multi-model scenarios.

The primary mechanism for handling multiple graphs in TensorFlow is the explicit creation and manipulation of `tf.Graph` objects. Rather than implicitly using the default graph, I recommend creating separate `tf.Graph` instances for each logical unit of computation, such as individual models or distinct data preprocessing pipelines. Once instantiated, a graph acts as its own isolated computation environment, preventing any unintended variable or operation conflicts. To execute operations defined within a specific graph, a TensorFlow `tf.Session` must be opened within the context of that graph.

I often employ this approach to concurrently train multiple models with potentially conflicting operations, or to manage training and evaluation phases as distinct graph entities. The fundamental practice involves encapsulating model definitions and associated operations within functions that accept a `tf.Graph` as input. This allows me to dynamically create and manage different graphs without hardcoding the default graph or introducing variable name clashes.

The `tf.Graph` class provides methods such as `as_default()` which temporarily sets a specific graph as the default within its context, and `device()` which can be used to control where operations are placed. This is important for managing resource allocation in multi-GPU environments. To effectively handle the graph and related `tf.Session`, `with` statements are used to ensure correct resource allocation and clean up. Let's move on to illustrating this with some code examples.

**Example 1: Creating and Using Multiple Graphs**

In this first example, I'll demonstrate the basic creation and usage of two separate graphs to perform simple addition operations. This highlights how operations within one graph don’t impact the other.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_and_run_graph(graph_name, operation_values):
  """Creates a graph, defines an operation, and executes it.

  Args:
      graph_name (str): The name to assign to the graph for debugging purposes.
      operation_values (tuple): Two integer values to add within the graph.

  Returns:
      int: The result of the addition operation.
  """
  graph = tf.Graph()
  with graph.as_default():
    a = tf.constant(operation_values[0], name='a')
    b = tf.constant(operation_values[1], name='b')
    c = tf.add(a, b, name='add_op')

    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      result = sess.run(c)
      print(f"Graph '{graph_name}': Result of {a.numpy()} + {b.numpy()} = {result}")
      return result


if __name__ == '__main__':
    result1 = create_and_run_graph("Graph_1", (5, 3))
    result2 = create_and_run_graph("Graph_2", (10, 20))

    print(f"Results from Graph 1: {result1}, and Graph 2: {result2}")
```

Here, `create_and_run_graph` encapsulates graph creation, operation definition, and execution. Each call generates a distinct graph named 'Graph_1' and 'Graph_2'. The `with graph.as_default()` statement ensures all operations within the block are assigned to the respective graph and not the global default graph. Two constants 'a' and 'b', along with an add operation 'c', are defined for each. Crucially, the variable names are the same across the two graphs but this does not cause conflicts since they exist in separate graph contexts. Subsequently, a session is created using `with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess` inside the `as_default()` block, and the 'c' node is evaluated via `sess.run(c)`. This pattern clearly showcases the use of isolated computation environments.

**Example 2: Multiple Model Management**

In more realistic scenarios, graphs would represent complex model definitions. This next example demonstrates handling two distinct models, each within their graph context. This represents a common need when exploring different architectural choices.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def build_model(graph, model_name, input_dim, output_dim):
    """Builds a simple linear model in the provided graph."""
    with graph.as_default():
      weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((input_dim, output_dim)), name=f'{model_name}_weights')
      bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((output_dim,)), name=f'{model_name}_bias')
      input_placeholder = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, input_dim), name=f'{model_name}_input')
      output = tf.matmul(input_placeholder, weights) + bias
      return input_placeholder, output


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Build model 1
    graph1 = tf.Graph()
    input_tensor_1, output_tensor_1 = build_model(graph1, 'Model_A', 5, 3)

    # Build model 2
    graph2 = tf.Graph()
    input_tensor_2, output_tensor_2 = build_model(graph2, 'Model_B', 10, 5)


    # Execute operations for model 1
    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph1) as sess1:
      sess1.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
      input_data_1 = tf.random.normal((10, 5)).numpy() #Example input with shape that matches the placeholder
      output_data_1 = sess1.run(output_tensor_1, feed_dict={input_tensor_1: input_data_1})
      print(f"Model A Output: {output_data_1.shape}")

    # Execute operations for model 2
    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph2) as sess2:
      sess2.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
      input_data_2 = tf.random.normal((20, 10)).numpy() # Example input with shape that matches the placeholder
      output_data_2 = sess2.run(output_tensor_2, feed_dict={input_tensor_2: input_data_2})
      print(f"Model B Output: {output_data_2.shape}")
```

In this example, `build_model` creates a simple linear model defined within the provided graph, including variables and placeholders. Again, we see variable names such as 'weights' and 'bias' being reused in each model’s graph. This time, we pass an explicit `graph` object to the `tf.compat.v1.Session` constructor when creating the session instead of using `as_default()`. Each model uses different dimensions.  We then initialize the variables within the sessions and run the models using sample input data, demonstrating independent execution.

**Example 3: Resource Allocation with Device Context**

Resource management is critical for model performance. The following example shows device placement using `tf.device`. This approach is often helpful for distributing operations across multiple GPUs.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_device_specific_graph(device_name):
    """Creates a graph and forces operations on a specific device.

    Args:
        device_name (str): Device name for operation placement (e.g., '/GPU:0', '/CPU:0').

    Returns:
        tf.Graph: The created graph.
    """
    graph = tf.Graph()
    with graph.as_default():
      with tf.device(device_name): #force operation on a device
        a = tf.constant(2, name='a')
        b = tf.constant(3, name='b')
        c = tf.add(a, b, name='add_op')
    return graph

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create graph for GPU (if available, otherwise it will default to CPU)
    gpu_graph = create_device_specific_graph('/GPU:0')
    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=gpu_graph) as sess_gpu:
      result_gpu = sess_gpu.run('add_op:0')
      print(f"Result on GPU (if available): {result_gpu}")

    # Create graph for CPU
    cpu_graph = create_device_specific_graph('/CPU:0')
    with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=cpu_graph) as sess_cpu:
      result_cpu = sess_cpu.run('add_op:0')
      print(f"Result on CPU: {result_cpu}")
```

In this case, we force operations within each `create_device_specific_graph` onto a specific device using `with tf.device(device_name)`. This example creates two graphs: one targeted for `/GPU:0` and the other for `/CPU:0`. The code utilizes the operation name (add_op:0) instead of a tensor to access the result. This demonstrates explicit device placement. If a GPU is not available, the operations will default to the CPU. In the case of multiple GPUs, one could create further graphs and operations assigned to '/GPU:1', '/GPU:2' etc. This mechanism is essential for controlling how resources are consumed during computation.

For further exploration into TensorFlow graph management, I strongly advise consulting the official TensorFlow documentation. While the documentation provides more extensive explanations and additional methods not covered here, pay specific attention to sections covering 'tf.Graph', 'tf.compat.v1.Session', and the device placement API. Additionally, practical examples related to distributed training, and multi-task learning within the available TensorFlow examples would enhance your understanding. The TensorFlow API guides are another valuable resource.
