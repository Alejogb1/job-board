The core challenge in modifying a `tf.data.Dataset` after batching lies in the inherent immutability of `Dataset` objects.  Directly altering a batched `Dataset` isn't possible; instead, one must transform the data *before* batching or use specialized mapping functions to process the already batched tensors.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects has highlighted this limitation repeatedly, prompting the development of efficient preprocessing strategies.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `tf.data.Dataset` API in TensorFlow is designed for efficient data pipeline construction.  Its strength lies in its composability: you chain transformations to create a complex pipeline from simple data sources.  However, once a `Dataset` is batched using `batch()`, the underlying data structure is optimized for efficient batch processing.  Attempting to directly modify the contents of a batch – for example, adding a new feature to each example within the batch – requires a different approach than simply appending to a list in typical Python programming.

The key is to understand that batching is a final, optimization step.  Modifications should happen *before* this stage.  If modifications need to be performed on already batched data, this involves applying a transformation to each batch element.  This typically means using `map()` to apply a function to every batch, carefully considering the tensor shapes and broadcasting rules within the function.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Pre-batching Modification**

This example demonstrates adding a new feature to each data element *before* batching.  This is the most efficient method, as it avoids the overhead of processing already-batched tensors.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample data
data = {'feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'feature2': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]}
labels = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

# Create a dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))

# Add a new feature.  Note that this operates on individual elements.
def add_feature(data_element, label):
  new_feature = data_element['feature1'] * 2
  new_data = {**data_element, 'feature3': new_feature}
  return new_data, label

dataset = dataset.map(add_feature)

# Batch the dataset
batch_size = 2
batched_dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)

# Iterate and print to verify
for data_batch, label_batch in batched_dataset:
  print(data_batch)
  print(label_batch)

```

In this scenario, the `add_feature` function processes each individual data point before batching occurs. This leads to better performance compared to modifying batches afterwards.


**Example 2: Post-batching Modification using `map()`**

This example demonstrates modifying already-batched data using `map()`.  The function within `map()` now operates on entire batches, requiring careful handling of tensor shapes and broadcasting.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample batched dataset (simulated for brevity)
batched_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(
    ({'feature1': [[1, 2], [3, 4]], 'feature2': [[5, 6], [7, 8]]}, [[9, 10], [11, 12]])
).batch(2)

#Modify the batched dataset
def modify_batch(data_batch, label_batch):
  new_feature = tf.reduce_sum(data_batch['feature1'], axis=1, keepdims=True)
  new_data = {**data_batch, 'feature3': new_feature}
  return new_data, label_batch

modified_dataset = batched_dataset.map(modify_batch)

# Iterate and print
for data_batch, label_batch in modified_dataset:
    print(data_batch)
    print(label_batch)
```

Here, `modify_batch` operates on the entire batch at once, summing elements in `feature1` to create `feature3`. Note the use of `tf.reduce_sum` and `keepdims=True` to ensure correct tensor shapes.  Incorrect handling of tensor dimensions is a common source of errors when modifying batched datasets.


**Example 3:  Handling Variable-length Sequences within Batches**

This example tackles a more complex scenario: modifying variable-length sequences within a batch.  Padding is crucial here to maintain consistent tensor shapes.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample data with variable-length sequences
sequences = [([1, 2, 3], 1), ([4, 5], 0), ([6, 7, 8, 9], 1)]

# Create a dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(sequences)

# Pad sequences to a maximum length
dataset = dataset.padded_batch(2, padded_shapes=([None], []), padding_values=(0, 0))

# Modify batched sequences (e.g., add a new element to each sequence)
def modify_variable_length(sequences, labels):
  padded_sequences = tf.pad(sequences, [[0, 0], [0, 1]], constant_values=0) #add a zero to the end of each sequence
  return padded_sequences, labels

modified_dataset = dataset.map(modify_variable_length)


# Iterate and print
for sequences_batch, labels_batch in modified_dataset:
  print(sequences_batch)
  print(labels_batch)
```

This example uses `padded_batch` to handle sequences of varying lengths, making the subsequent modification via `map()` possible.  Ignoring padding and shape inconsistencies is a frequent cause of errors during these operations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data.Dataset`;  TensorFlow's official tutorials focusing on data preprocessing and dataset manipulation; a comprehensive guide to TensorFlow's tensor manipulation functions;  a text on numerical computation with TensorFlow; and a practical guide to building TensorFlow pipelines for large-scale datasets.  Thorough understanding of NumPy array manipulation is also highly beneficial.
