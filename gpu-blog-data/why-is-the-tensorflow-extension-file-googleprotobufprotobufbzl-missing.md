The absence of `google/protobuf/protobuf.bzl` within a TensorFlow project, particularly one built from source, typically indicates a discrepancy in how Bazel is configured to locate external dependencies. This file isn't intended to exist directly within the TensorFlow repository; rather, it acts as a configuration point, telling Bazel where to find the protobuf dependency, usually through a method like an external repository rule. Over my years of working on custom TensorFlow builds, I’ve frequently encountered this issue, each time requiring careful examination of the workspace setup. The problem primarily arises when either the protobuf dependency hasn’t been declared correctly, the declared location is invalid, or the build environment lacks sufficient information to locate the dependency’s `bzl` files.

Fundamentally, Bazel relies on specific declarations within the `WORKSPACE` file to manage external dependencies. These declarations, often using rules like `http_archive` or `git_repository`, inform Bazel where to download and extract dependency code. When a project, such as TensorFlow, tries to import `google/protobuf/protobuf.bzl` from an unspecified location, Bazel, naturally, cannot resolve the path. It assumes the dependency should be accessible given its specified resolution strategy, often leading to build failures. In the case of Protocol Buffers, a common way of using Bazel to fetch it is by defining an external repository in the `WORKSPACE` and making it available through the `@protobuf` alias.

Let's consider a common scenario where the missing `protobuf.bzl` causes an issue. In my experience, the failure manifest as an error during the `bazel build` process when TensorFlow attempts to construct its computational graph. This error usually surfaces because a rule within TensorFlow’s Bazel files requires functions or macros defined within `google/protobuf/protobuf.bzl`. Because the file isn't found, the rules referencing these definitions fail to operate correctly. The error message would be something akin to “cannot find label `google/protobuf/protobuf.bzl`”. The root cause always points back to a missing or misconfigured external repository for Protocol Buffers in the `WORKSPACE`.

Here are three code examples illustrating possible scenarios and their resolutions. These examples are based on common configurations I’ve observed and worked through.

**Example 1: Missing `http_archive` declaration**

This first example showcases a very basic error: no declaration for Protocol Buffers whatsoever. A hypothetical, minimal `WORKSPACE` file would not contain any reference to `protobuf`.

```python
# WORKSPACE

# Example: Missing protobuf declaration.
# This will fail with "cannot find label @protobuf//:protobuf.bzl"

load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

# Example, but missing protobuf:

# http_archive(
#    name = "protobuf",
#    sha256 = "some_hash_value",
#    urls = ["https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/archive/v3.21.12.tar.gz"],
# )
```

**Commentary:** In this scenario, the commented-out `http_archive` call, which would have declared the external Protobuf dependency, has not been added to the workspace. Consequently, when any TensorFlow rule attempts to use definitions within the protobuf repository (via the standard `@protobuf` alias) Bazel will throw a “cannot find” error. The fix here is to include the `http_archive` call, fetching the required Protobuf archive. This establishes the necessary dependency in the Bazel environment. The precise URL and SHA hash will depend on the desired protobuf version.

**Example 2: Incorrect dependency name**

The second example highlights a scenario where the `http_archive` declaration is present, but the name assigned to the dependency doesn’t match what’s used in the TensorFlow build files. This situation is quite common when using copy-pasted configurations that aren’t completely vetted.

```python
# WORKSPACE

load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

# Example: Incorrect name, using "my_protobuf" rather than "protobuf"
http_archive(
    name = "my_protobuf", #Incorrect name, TensorFlow assumes "protobuf"
    sha256 = "some_hash_value",
    urls = ["https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/archive/v3.21.12.tar.gz"],
)
```

**Commentary:** In this configuration, the `http_archive` rule retrieves the protobuf source code correctly, but it assigns it the name "my\_protobuf" instead of the standard "protobuf". When a TensorFlow build file references `@protobuf//:protobuf.bzl`, Bazel can't find a repository named "protobuf" that contains this file. It looks for the file under the name of the declared repository name. This mismatch leads to the same missing file error as Example 1. The remedy is to consistently use "protobuf" as the name of the Protobuf external dependency. It is a convention enforced by TensorFlow’s build system, not an inherent requirement of Bazel itself.

**Example 3: Using `rules_proto` with misconfigured `protobuf_version`**

This last example demonstrates a more complex use case. When using the `rules_proto` Bazel rules, the `protobuf_version` parameter needs to be configured to point to an available Protobuf dependency. Failing to do so results in similar errors to our previous cases, even if there is a dependency available, if it is not accessible or declared through the `rules_proto` configuration mechanism.

```python
# WORKSPACE
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")
load("@bazel_rules_proto//proto:repositories.bzl", "rules_proto_dependencies", "protobuf_repositories")

rules_proto_dependencies()

protobuf_repositories()

#Example: Incorrect versioning

#protobuf_version = "3.19.4" #Incorrect, no Protobuf available under this alias in `rules_proto`
#protobuf_version = "v3.21.12" #Correct name

# http_archive(
#    name = "protobuf",
#    sha256 = "some_hash_value",
#    urls = ["https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/archive/v3.21.12.tar.gz"],
# )
```

**Commentary:** In this scenario, the `rules_proto` setup is used to manage Protocol Buffers and associated tooling. The `protobuf_version` is either misconfigured or commented out. While the `protobuf_repositories` rule may appear to resolve this conflict, in the absence of a specific version, or using an unavailable version, Bazel will fail to locate `protobuf.bzl` or, more broadly, the required protobuf tools. The core issue here isn't necessarily the missing external dependency, but that `rules_proto` is configured to reference an unavailable or misidentified version of it. The fix is to ensure `protobuf_version` corresponds to a correctly resolved version of the protobuf dependency, either through the `http_archive` method demonstrated in the other examples or by relying on an already resolved version through an external dependency manager. The specific approach depends on the project's requirements and constraints. In these example, the solution is to either use the `protobuf_repositories` and a valid version identifier, such as the commented out `v3.21.12`, or fetch the repository directly and declare the correct dependency name, as in the previous examples.

In summary, resolving the missing `google/protobuf/protobuf.bzl` error requires a methodical approach focusing on the `WORKSPACE` file configuration. I always start by confirming that the Protobuf external dependency is correctly declared using a standard approach like `http_archive`, or via the `rules_proto` Bazel rules. I then verify that the names used in the dependency declaration and in the TensorFlow build files are consistent. Finally, I double-check if any tooling, such as `rules_proto`, mandates specific versioning or declaration semantics, ensuring they're adequately met.

For further guidance, I recommend consulting resources like the official Bazel documentation, specifically the sections on external dependencies and repository rules. Additionally, the documentation for `rules_proto` provides comprehensive information on how to configure Protocol Buffer usage within a Bazel project. While not specific to this issue, the TensorFlow build system documentation also provides good general guidance on structuring Bazel build files for TensorFlow from source. Reviewing these will assist in diagnosing future issues and building more resilient build configurations.
