The root cause of Bazel's failure to compile BoringSSL on a Raspberry Pi 3 during TensorFlow builds frequently stems from inadequate toolchain configuration and mismatched architectures within the Bazel build environment.  My experience troubleshooting this on embedded systems, specifically within automotive development projects, revealed that the problem usually lies not within BoringSSL itself, but in how Bazel interacts with the Pi's ARM architecture and the available cross-compilation tools.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's build process, managed by Bazel, requires a precise definition of the target architecture and its associated toolchain. The Raspberry Pi 3 utilizes an ARMv7 architecture, significantly different from the x86_64 architecture commonly used in desktop development.  Bazel needs explicit instructions on how to compile C++ code (like BoringSSL) for this ARMv7 target. Failure occurs when Bazel lacks the necessary cross-compilation tools or is incorrectly configured to utilize the wrong ones. This results in errors during the compilation of BoringSSL's components, preventing the successful build of TensorFlow.  Further complicating matters is the potential for inconsistencies between the system's native toolchain and the one Bazel attempts to use.  If Bazel accidentally leverages the native ARMv7 compiler for parts of the build intended for a different target (a hypothetical scenario where some part of TensorFlow is targeted at ARM64), compilation failures will inevitably occur.


The error messages themselves can be misleading, often pointing to specific compilation errors within BoringSSL rather than the underlying toolchain issue.  This is because the actual compilation failure is a *symptom* of the improperly configured build environment.  Identifying the root cause requires careful examination of Bazel's build logs and understanding the toolchain configuration.  This involves scrutinizing the `BUILD` files, the Bazel workspace configuration, and verifying the availability and correct configuration of cross-compilers.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Toolchain Definition (Fragment of a `WORKSPACE` file):**

```bazel
load("@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:toolchain.bzl", "cpp_toolchain_config")

cpp_toolchain_config(
    name = "armv7-toolchain",
    compiler = "/usr/bin/gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi",  # Incorrect path, potentially
    linker = "/usr/bin/ld-linux-gnueabi",       # Incorrect path, potentially
    ar = "/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi-ar",
    # ...other toolchain settings...
)

# ...other WORKSPACE configurations...
```

**Commentary:** This example showcases a potential error. The paths to the compiler, linker, and archiver (`ar`) are hardcoded.  This is fragile and assumes a specific system layout. On different systems (or even different Raspberry Pi OS versions), these paths might vary.  Furthermore, this assumes the availability of the `gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi` toolchain. If it's not installed or configured correctly, the build will fail.  A more robust approach involves using a toolchain definition that is less dependent on absolute paths and utilizes a more flexible mechanism for identifying the required tools.


**Example 2: Correct Toolchain Definition using a dedicated toolchain repository (Fragment of a `WORKSPACE` file):**

```bazel
load("@local_toolchain//:toolchain.bzl", "armv7_toolchain")

armv7_toolchain(name = "armv7_toolchain_config")

# ... rest of workspace file ...
```

**Commentary:** This improved approach uses a separate repository (`@local_toolchain`) specifically for managing the Raspberry Pi toolchain. This repository should contain a `toolchain.bzl` file that properly configures the compiler, linker, and other necessary tools.  This promotes modularity, better maintainability and reduces the risk of path-related errors. The exact implementation within `toolchain.bzl` would depend on the used toolchain, possibly leveraging platform-specific variables within Bazel's environment.


**Example 3:  Target Specification in a `BUILD` file:**

```bazel
cc_binary(
    name = "my_boringssl_test",
    srcs = ["main.cc"],
    deps = [":boringssl_lib"],
    copts = ["-march=armv7-a"], # Important architecture specification
    linkopts = ["-static"],      # Consider static linking for embedded systems
    toolchains = ["@local_toolchain//:armv7_toolchain_config"],  # Using the defined toolchain
)

cc_library(
    name = "boringssl_lib",
    srcs = glob(["boringssl/**/*.cc"]), # Adjust paths as necessary
    hdrs = glob(["boringssl/**/*.h"]),
    # ... other dependencies and settings ...
    linkopts = ["-lm"], # Link against math libraries
)
```

**Commentary:** This `BUILD` file defines a binary (`my_boringssl_test`) that depends on a BoringSSL library.  Crucially, it explicitly sets `copts` to `-march=armv7-a`, ensuring the compiler generates code for the ARMv7 architecture.  Additionally, `toolchains` explicitly points to the toolchain defined earlier. Using `linkopts` with `-static` is advised for embedded systems to avoid runtime dependency issues.  It is also important to provide compiler options to correctly link to relevant libraries (as shown in `linkopts` with `-lm`). Improperly specified dependencies can also lead to failure.  Remember to replace placeholder paths (`boringssl/**/*.cc`, `boringssl/**/*.h`) with your actual BoringSSL source and header directories.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Bazel documentation, specifically the sections on C++ rules and toolchain configuration, is essential.  Consult the TensorFlow build documentation; it usually contains platform-specific instructions for building on embedded systems like the Raspberry Pi. Refer to the documentation for your chosen cross-compilation toolchain for ARMv7.  A good understanding of ARM architecture and Linux system administration is also vital for debugging these types of issues. Mastering Bazel's build log analysis will be paramount.


In summary, successful compilation of BoringSSL within TensorFlow on a Raspberry Pi 3 using Bazel hinges upon the accurate and complete configuration of the build environment, especially regarding the toolchain.  Careful attention to the `WORKSPACE` file for specifying the correct toolchain, the `BUILD` file for providing appropriate compilation flags and architecture specifications, and a thorough understanding of Bazel's mechanisms for managing dependencies are critical to resolving this issue. Neglecting any of these aspects often leads to seemingly inexplicable compilation errors.
