Tensors, particularly those utilized in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, are typically stored in system RAM (Random Access Memory) initially. Transferring a tensor to a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) necessitates allocating distinct memory on the GPU itself, which then mirrors the tensor’s structure. This dual-memory allocation – one in system RAM and another in GPU memory – stems from fundamental differences in the architecture and access mechanisms of these two memory spaces.

System RAM is the general-purpose memory readily accessible to the CPU (Central Processing Unit). It is optimized for storing and accessing a wide variety of data types and serving the operating system and running applications. GPUs, on the other hand, possess their own dedicated high-speed memory, optimized for parallel computation. This memory is typically accessed through a PCI Express bus, introducing latency into data transfers between system RAM and GPU memory. Furthermore, the GPU's memory architecture is optimized for massive parallel processing, unlike the more serial nature of CPU memory access.

When a tensor transfer is initiated, the framework must orchestrate the following actions: first, allocating sufficient memory within the GPU’s address space to accommodate the tensor’s dimensions and data type. This memory is separate from, but mirrors the data, in system RAM. Next, the framework initiates a data copy operation across the PCI Express bus. This operation converts the tensor data from its original system RAM location to its newly allocated GPU memory location. Critically, the system RAM version of the tensor typically persists, unless explicitly deallocated. The rationale behind this approach is rooted in maintaining flexibility: the CPU might need to reference the tensor data at a later point without transferring it back from the GPU, and also supports scenarios where data parallelism is employed across both GPU and CPU resources.

Let us consider an illustrative case using a hypothetical deep learning framework, "DeepMindX". In DeepMindX, a tensor is defined using the `Tensor` class, which stores its data array and the device (CPU or GPU) where it resides.

**Example 1: Initial Tensor Creation on CPU**

```python
import numpy as np
from deepmindx import Tensor

# Create a 2x2 float32 array
cpu_array = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=np.float32)

# Create a DeepMindX Tensor, initially on CPU
cpu_tensor = Tensor(cpu_array, device="cpu")

print(f"Tensor Device: {cpu_tensor.device}")
print(f"Tensor Data (CPU):\n {cpu_tensor.data}")
print(f"System RAM usage after creation: some") # Note: actual memory usage tracking is abstracted
```

In this snippet, we create a NumPy array, then construct a `Tensor` object utilizing the numpy array, specifying the initial device as "cpu".  At this stage, the tensor data resides exclusively in system RAM, associated with the underlying NumPy array's memory. No GPU memory is involved. The `print` statements showcase the device property is set and it references the underlying data. At this stage, only system RAM is allocated.

**Example 2: Transferring the Tensor to GPU**

```python
import numpy as np
from deepmindx import Tensor

# Create a 2x2 float32 array
cpu_array = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=np.float32)

# Create a DeepMindX Tensor, initially on CPU
cpu_tensor = Tensor(cpu_array, device="cpu")


# Transfer the tensor to the GPU
gpu_tensor = cpu_tensor.to_device("gpu")

print(f"Original Tensor Device: {cpu_tensor.device}")
print(f"GPU Tensor Device: {gpu_tensor.device}")
print(f"Tensor Data (CPU):\n {cpu_tensor.data}") #The original tensor is untouched
print(f"Tensor Data (GPU):\n {gpu_tensor.data}")
print(f"System RAM usage after transfer: some") # Note: actual memory usage tracking is abstracted
print(f"GPU memory usage after transfer: some")  # Note: actual memory usage tracking is abstracted
```

Here, the `to_device("gpu")` function creates a new `Tensor` object on the GPU. Critically, the `cpu_tensor` remains on the CPU in the system memory. The data is copied to the GPU, as shown in the output of `gpu_tensor.data`. Both the `cpu_tensor` and `gpu_tensor` will exist simultaneously in different memory spaces, representing different data allocations but the same information. Therefore, the GPU memory and System RAM usage will both increase after this operation. This increase demonstrates the dual memory allocation.

**Example 3: Modifying the GPU Tensor**

```python
import numpy as np
from deepmindx import Tensor

# Create a 2x2 float32 array
cpu_array = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=np.float32)

# Create a DeepMindX Tensor, initially on CPU
cpu_tensor = Tensor(cpu_array, device="cpu")

# Transfer the tensor to the GPU
gpu_tensor = cpu_tensor.to_device("gpu")


# Modify data on GPU tensor
gpu_tensor.data[0, 0] = 10.0

print(f"Original Tensor Data (CPU):\n {cpu_tensor.data}")
print(f"Modified Tensor Data (GPU):\n {gpu_tensor.data}")
print(f"System RAM usage after modification: some")# Note: actual memory usage tracking is abstracted
print(f"GPU memory usage after modification: some") # Note: actual memory usage tracking is abstracted
```
In this example, modifying the GPU tensor’s data does not affect the original CPU tensor. After transfer, the GPU tensor is independent of the CPU copy. This independent allocation is necessary to enable concurrent operations and avoids unintentional side effects from modifying one location on the other. Both the system RAM and GPU memory allocations remain, even after modifications.

In summary, the need for additional RAM allocation on the GPU stems from several factors: the architectural differences between CPU and GPU memory, the performance requirements for parallel processing on the GPU, and the need to maintain flexibility for various computational scenarios. Each device possesses a unique memory space and transfer of data requires duplication and allocation in the respective space.

For further study on this topic, I would suggest reviewing materials on the following: "CUDA Programming Guide" which details memory management on NVIDIA GPUs, specific documentation for your deep learning framework of choice, such as "PyTorch documentation" or the "TensorFlow API Guide". Lastly, reading resources on computer architecture, focusing on memory hierarchy, will provide a deeper understanding of the underling principles of memory allocation. This foundational knowledge assists in building effective and performant deep learning systems. These resources help provide a more structured and practical understanding.
