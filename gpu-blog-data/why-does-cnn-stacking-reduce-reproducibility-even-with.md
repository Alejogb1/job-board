The core issue hindering reproducibility in CNN stacking, even with fixed seeds and CPU constraints, stems from the inherent non-determinism introduced by floating-point arithmetic and the subtle variations in memory management across different hardware configurations, despite identical CPUs.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects revealed this limitation consistently, necessitating careful consideration of several contributing factors beyond simple seed fixing.

**1. Explanation:**

Reproducibility in machine learning, particularly deep learning, is significantly challenged by the reliance on floating-point calculations.  Floating-point numbers are inherently approximate representations of real numbers, subject to rounding errors and variations in the order of operations across different hardware architectures.  While a fixed random seed ensures the same sequence of random numbers is generated for weight initialization and data augmentation, this doesnâ€™t guarantee identical calculations. Minor differences in the order of summation, for instance, or subtle differences in how the hardware handles memory access (even within the same CPU family) can lead to different rounding errors accumulating over multiple layers of a CNN.  This cumulative effect, exacerbated by stacking multiple CNNs, leads to noticeable discrepancies in model weights and ultimately, in predictions.

Furthermore,  the memory management system plays a significant role.  While CPU type is fixed, variations exist in cache allocation, memory paging, and the scheduling of memory access.  These subtle variations affect the order in which computations are carried out, leading to different accumulation of rounding errors, even when utilizing the same random seed and identical code.  This is especially prominent in deeper CNN architectures, where a large number of matrix multiplications and activation functions increase the potential for divergence.  These seemingly insignificant differences can propagate through the stacked CNNs, resulting in diverging model behavior.  Deterministic libraries can mitigate some of this, but they do not completely eliminate all potential variability from the memory management system.

Lastly, optimized linear algebra libraries, widely used in deep learning frameworks, often employ different levels of parallelism.  While the overall computation remains the same, the sequence of operations within parallel sections can vary based on the specific hardware and runtime environment, introducing additional non-deterministic elements. Even if a single thread is utilized, internal implementation details can vary, producing minor differences.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the impact of floating-point precision and ordering on reproducibility.  These are simplified examples and do not encompass the entirety of a complex CNN stack, but they highlight the underlying principle.

**Example 1:  Illustrating Floating-Point Accumulation:**

```python
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(42)  # Fixed seed

a = np.random.rand(1000000)
b = np.random.rand(1000000)

# Calculation 1: Summation in a specific order
sum1 = np.sum(a + b)

# Calculation 2: Summation in a different order (shuffling)
shuffled_indices = np.random.permutation(len(a))
sum2 = np.sum(a[shuffled_indices] + b[shuffled_indices])

print(f"Sum 1: {sum1}")
print(f"Sum 2: {sum2}")
print(f"Difference: {abs(sum1 - sum2)}")
```

This example demonstrates how even a simple summation can yield different results depending on the order of operations, particularly with a large number of floating-point numbers. While the seed is fixed, the shuffled summation introduces a deviation due to floating-point imprecision.  The difference, though often small, accumulates dramatically when replicated across multiple layers and stacked CNNs.


**Example 2:  Impact of Data Augmentation Order:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# ... Define a simple CNN ...

# Data augmentation with fixed seed
tf.random.set_seed(42)
data_generator = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator(rotation_range=20, shear_range=0.2, seed=42)

# Model Training (using data_generator)
model = build_cnn() # Assume build_cnn creates your CNN model.
model.fit(data_generator.flow(...), ...)

# ... Repeat with a different order of augmentation (e.g., different order of data read) ...
```

In this example, even with a fixed seed in the `ImageDataGenerator`, the actual order in which augmentations are applied might vary slightly between runs, leading to different mini-batch compositions and, consequently, different weight updates. This is particularly relevant for larger datasets where memory management and data loading become major factors.


**Example 3:  Illustrating the effect of different matrix multiplication libraries:**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import blas

# Use different BLAS implementations (if available)

# Option 1:  System BLAS (default NumPy behavior)
result1 = np.matmul(A, B) # A and B are large matrices

# Option 2: A specific BLAS implementation (e.g., OpenBLAS, MKL)
# Requires setting environment variables or using explicit BLAS calls from SciPy
result2 = blas.dgemm(alpha=1.0, a=A, b=B) #  dgemm for double precision general matrix multiplication

# ... Compare result1 and result2 for differences. ...
```

This example, though simplified, highlights how the underlying linear algebra library used for matrix operations can introduce variations. Different libraries optimize for different hardware and may use different algorithms for matrix multiplication, leading to subtle differences in the results, even if theoretically equivalent.  Stacking CNNs magnifies these minute variations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing," "Floating-Point Arithmetic and Error Analysis,"  "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al. (for a broader context of deep learning reproducibility).  Study of the source code of commonly used linear algebra libraries (like BLAS and LAPACK) is beneficial for understanding the intricacies of floating-point operations and their potential for non-determinism.  Additionally, exploring academic papers focused on deterministic deep learning and the impact of memory management on numerical reproducibility would be beneficial.
