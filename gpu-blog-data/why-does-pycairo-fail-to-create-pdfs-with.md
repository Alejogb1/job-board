Pycairo's PDF generation struggles with a high number of fills primarily due to the underlying limitations of the cairo library itself and how it manages the PDF rendering process.  My experience working on a large-scale vector graphics rendering engine for scientific visualization highlighted this issue acutely.  Cairo optimizes for immediate-mode rendering, where commands are executed sequentially.  When the number of fill operations drastically increases, this sequential execution becomes a performance bottleneck, leading to either extreme slowdowns, memory exhaustion, or outright crashes before a complete PDF is generated.  The problem isn't inherently within Pycairo's Python wrapper; it stems from the core cairo functionality.

The crux of the issue lies in how cairo handles the PDF's internal structure.  Each fill operation, even seemingly simple ones, translates to multiple operations within the PDF's low-level representation.  This includes defining the color space, setting the fill parameters, drawing the path, and filling it.  With a large number of fills, this multitude of operations rapidly expands the size of the internal representation that cairo maintains in memory.  Furthermore, the memory management within cairo isn't optimized for a massively parallel execution of independent fill operations; instead, it follows a sequential approach. This contrasts significantly with optimized rendering pipelines found in dedicated vector graphics editors that employ techniques like batching or caching to improve efficiency.

The consequence is that for PDFs requiring thousands or tens of thousands of individual fill operations, the memory required to hold the intermediate representation explodes, often exceeding available system resources.  The resulting error manifests as a crash or a failure to generate the PDF, with no particularly informative error message from Pycairo itself, other than a generic failure.  Furthermore, even if memory isn't an immediate constraint, the sheer processing time required for sequential execution can render the PDF generation impractically slow.  This observation is consistent with my experiences generating high-density maps and complex technical diagrams.

Let's illustrate this with examples.  Consider these three scenarios, highlighting different approaches and their limitations when facing a high number of fills:

**Example 1:  Naive Approach - Direct Fills**

```python
import cairo

def generate_pdf_naive(filename, num_fills):
    surface = cairo.PDFSurface(filename, 500, 500)
    ctx = cairo.Context(surface)

    for i in range(num_fills):
        ctx.rectangle(i % 500, i // 500 * 10, 5, 5) # Distribute rectangles
        ctx.set_source_rgb(i / num_fills, 0, 1 - i / num_fills) # Gradient fill
        ctx.fill()

    surface.finish()

generate_pdf_naive("naive_fills.pdf", 100000)  # Likely to fail
```

This code directly executes each fill individually.  With a large `num_fills`, this approach rapidly consumes memory due to the sequential nature of the operations. The gradient fill further complicates matters because each fill operation involves setting a new color, adding overhead.


**Example 2:  Grouping Fills with Paths**

```python
import cairo

def generate_pdf_grouped(filename, num_fills):
    surface = cairo.PDFSurface(filename, 500, 500)
    ctx = cairo.Context(surface)

    ctx.set_line_width(0) # ensures filled rectangles are solid

    for i in range(0, num_fills, 100): # Group fills into batches
        for j in range(100):
            if i + j < num_fills:
                x = (i + j) % 500
                y = (i + j) // 500 * 10
                ctx.rectangle(x, y, 5, 5)

        ctx.set_source_rgb(i / num_fills, 0, 1 - i / num_fills)
        ctx.fill()

    surface.finish()

generate_pdf_grouped("grouped_fills.pdf", 100000) # More likely to succeed, but still slow
```

This example attempts to mitigate the problem by grouping fills.  Instead of filling each rectangle individually, it groups them into batches of 100 and applies a single fill operation per batch.  This reduces the number of individual fill commands, improving performance, but the sequential nature persists. The performance benefit is only marginal for exceptionally large numbers of fills.


**Example 3:  External Rasterization (Alternative Strategy)**

```python
# Requires a suitable rasterization library like Pillow or OpenCV

from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
import cairo

def generate_pdf_rasterized(filename, num_fills):
    img = Image.new('RGB', (500, 500), "white")
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)

    for i in range(num_fills):
        x = i % 500
        y = i // 500 * 10
        color = (int(i / num_fills * 255), 0, int((1 - i / num_fills) * 255))
        draw.rectangle([x, y, x + 5, y + 5], fill=color)

    img.save("temp.png") # Save as temporary PNG
    surface = cairo.PDFSurface(filename, 500, 500)
    ctx = cairo.Context(surface)
    pattern = cairo.ImageSurface.create_from_png("temp.png")
    ctx.set_source_surface(pattern)
    ctx.paint()
    surface.finish()

generate_pdf_rasterized("rasterized_fills.pdf", 100000) # Potentially much faster
```

This approach completely circumvents cairo's fill limitations by first rasterizing the graphics into a PNG image using a library like Pillow. This rasterized image is then incorporated into the PDF using Pycairo.  This method leverages the efficiency of raster graphics rendering for filling operations and dramatically improves performance.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of cairo's internal workings, consult the official cairo documentation.  Further research into vector graphics rendering techniques, particularly those related to batching and optimization, will be beneficial.  Exploring alternative PDF generation libraries in Python, if the constraint of using Pycairo is relaxed, is another avenue to consider. Finally, examining the source code of high-performance vector graphics editors can provide invaluable insights into efficient rendering pipelines.  Consider investigating the performance characteristics of different PDF libraries to find the best fit for your needs when dealing with extremely high numbers of fills.
