A discrepancy in output between a freshly initialized PyTorch model and the same model loaded from a saved state dictionary arises primarily due to the non-deterministic nature of initialization. Specifically, while PyTorch models are constructed with a defined architecture, the weights and biases within the model's layers are, by default, randomly initialized. This random initialization process introduces inherent variability, causing two models with identical architectures, if not explicitly seeded with the same random number generator state before initialization, to start with different numerical values. Subsequently, even when trained with identical data and training parameters, these models will diverge in their weight updates and therefore produce differing outputs when applied to the same input. When we save the state dictionary using functions like `torch.save`, we are preserving the specific values of the weights and biases that the model has learned during training. Conversely, simply instantiating the model class anew will re-initialize those weights randomly, leading to a different starting point and consequently different output, even after identical training.

To illustrate, imagine building a convolutional neural network intended for image classification. I recall a project where I built a simple classifier for handwritten digits. Initially, I trained the model, saved the state, and then reloaded it to perform inference on test data. I naively expected the reloaded model to perfectly replicate the trained one's performance. However, I discovered that if I were to instantiate a *new* model object of the same class and attempted to use that, it would provide incorrect predictions. This initially suggested a problem with the save/load mechanism. On further investigation, it became clear that the issue lay in how the initial state of the model was handled before training. Saving a model preserves the specific, trained state; creating a new model does not.

Let us consider a practical demonstration. The following Python code snippets use PyTorch to showcase these differences:

**Code Example 1: Demonstrating the Initialization Discrepancy**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import random

# Define a simple linear model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Create two model instances without setting the seed
model1 = SimpleModel()
model2 = SimpleModel()

# Generate random input
random_input = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Obtain outputs from the models
output1 = model1(random_input)
output2 = model2(random_input)

print(f"Output of model1: {output1}")
print(f"Output of model2: {output2}")

# check if the states are the same
print(f"Are Model States the Same: {model1.state_dict() == model2.state_dict()}")


# Create two model instances with a set seed
random.seed(42)
torch.manual_seed(42)
model3 = SimpleModel()
random.seed(42)
torch.manual_seed(42)
model4 = SimpleModel()
output3 = model3(random_input)
output4 = model4(random_input)

print(f"Output of model3: {output3}")
print(f"Output of model4: {output4}")
# Check if the states are the same
print(f"Are Model States the Same: {model3.state_dict() == model4.state_dict()}")
```

*Commentary on Example 1:* This snippet illustrates the fundamental issue.  `model1` and `model2` are instantiated without setting any random number generator seeds.  They, therefore, are initialized with different sets of random weights. This difference is reflected in their respective outputs. The state dictionaries are not the same because each modelâ€™s parameters were initialized independently. The use of seeds, as seen with `model3` and `model4` results in identical starting parameter values, leading to identical outputs and the state dictionaries to be the same. In a typical training scenario, not seeding, we end up in different locations in the optimization landscape, hence the importance of loading trained weights.

**Code Example 2: Saving and Loading State Dictionaries**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import os

# Define the same model as above
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Create a model instance
model_train = SimpleModel()

# Some dummy training to change state.
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model_train.parameters(), lr=0.01)
random_input = torch.randn(1,10)
for i in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model_train(random_input)
    loss = (output - 1).pow(2).mean()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
# Generate a dummy input.
random_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
output_train_pre = model_train(random_input)


# Save the model's state dictionary
save_path = "model_state.pth"
torch.save(model_train.state_dict(), save_path)

# Create a new model instance
model_load = SimpleModel()

# Load the saved state dictionary
model_load.load_state_dict(torch.load(save_path))

output_load = model_load(random_input)
# Verify the saved and reloaded model
print(f"Output of training model: {output_train_pre}")
print(f"Output of loaded model: {output_load}")
print(f"Are model states the same: {output_train_pre == output_load}")

# Clean Up saved file
os.remove(save_path)
```

*Commentary on Example 2:* Here, the crucial operation of saving and loading state is demonstrated. `model_train` is first trained on a dummy dataset with a simple loss. We then save the resulting state dictionary. A new instance, `model_load`, is created and its weights are initialized randomly, this would give a different output. Then, we load the saved state dictionary into `model_load`. After loading, both models, when applied to the same input, will produce identical outputs, assuming no dropout or stochastic operations are present within the model's forward pass. The comparison of the two outputs validates that loading a trained state is equivalent to retrieving the exact parameters the model had at the time of save.

**Code Example 3:  The impact of dropout and stochasticity**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import os

# Define the same model as above
class DropoutModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dropout_rate=0.5):
        super(DropoutModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout_rate)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.dropout(x)
        return self.linear(x)

# Create a model instance
dropout_model = DropoutModel()
random_input = torch.randn(1,10)

# Generate first two outputs from same input
output1 = dropout_model(random_input)
output2 = dropout_model(random_input)
print(f"Output of the model with Dropout is different despite same input {output1 == output2}")

# Save and load
save_path = "dropout_state.pth"
torch.save(dropout_model.state_dict(), save_path)
dropout_load_model = DropoutModel()
dropout_load_model.load_state_dict(torch.load(save_path))

output3 = dropout_load_model(random_input)
output4 = dropout_load_model(random_input)

print(f"Output of the loaded model with Dropout is different despite same input {output3 == output4}")

# Clean Up saved file
os.remove(save_path)

```

*Commentary on Example 3:* This example adds an important layer of nuance. Even when a model's state dictionary is identical, a stochastic operation like dropout (a regularization technique that randomly disables neurons during training) will result in different outputs on each forward pass if the model is in training mode. When dropout is active, each forward pass samples different masks, leading to variations in results. Saving and loading ensures consistent weights, but does not address this randomness. To enforce consistent results between training and inference in the presence of dropout, you should ensure the model is set to evaluation mode via `model.eval()` prior to inference. The example showcases how even though the model is loaded with identical parameters, outputs are still different due to the stochastic nature of dropout.

For further exploration, I recommend consulting PyTorch's official documentation on `nn.Module`, `torch.save`, `torch.load`, and `torch.manual_seed`. The documentation provides comprehensive explanations and usage examples, covering nuances not fully addressed here. Furthermore, research papers on deep learning model reproducibility provide valuable insights into the challenges associated with ensuring consistent results in neural network training and inference. Examining resources focused on best practices in handling random seeds during experiment setup can also greatly improve understanding of the described behavior. Additionally, studying the source code of the stochastic functions that may be used in your model would also help understand and debug inconsistencies. By combining these resources with practice, one can develop a more robust understanding of the underlying mechanisms causing these types of discrepancies.
