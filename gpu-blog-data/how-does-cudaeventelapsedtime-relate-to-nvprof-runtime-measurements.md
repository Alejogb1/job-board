CUDA event timing, specifically using `cudaEventElapsedTime`, provides a fine-grained performance measurement within a single CUDA kernel execution, offering a perspective complementary to the broader profiling capabilities of `nvprof`.  My experience optimizing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations highlighted this crucial distinction.  While `nvprof` provides aggregate statistics across multiple kernel launches and data transfers, `cudaEventElapsedTime` isolates the execution time of a specific kernel invocation, revealing bottlenecks invisible at a coarser granularity.  This precision is vital when focusing on kernel-level optimization.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`nvprof` employs hardware counters and sampling techniques to furnish a holistic view of GPU utilization.  It captures data encompassing kernel execution, memory transfers (both host-to-device and device-to-device), and driver overhead.  The resultant profiling report aggregates these measurements across multiple runs, presenting metrics like kernel execution time, occupancy, memory bandwidth utilization, and instruction throughput.  This macroscopic perspective allows for identifying overall performance bottlenecks, such as insufficient memory bandwidth or underutilization of SMs.

Conversely, `cudaEventElapsedTime` operates within the context of a single CUDA kernel.  It relies on software timers implemented within the CUDA runtime, recording the elapsed time between two events marked by `cudaEventRecord`.  The resolution of these timers is generally higher than that of `nvprof`'s sampling-based approach, offering more precise timing information at the cost of reduced scope.  It doesn't directly measure memory transfers or other GPU activities outside the demarcated kernel execution.  Its strength lies in pinpointing performance issues within a specific kernel.


The relationship between the two is one of scope and precision.  `nvprof` provides a broad, albeit less precise, overview of the entire application's GPU execution, while `cudaEventElapsedTime` offers fine-grained, precise measurements confined to individual kernel executions.  Ideally, they should be used in conjunction.  `nvprof` initially identifies potential bottlenecks, and then `cudaEventElapsedTime` provides detailed timing within the problematic kernels, guiding the refinement of optimization strategies.  For instance, `nvprof` might reveal a significant portion of runtime spent within a specific kernel.  Subsequently, `cudaEventElapsedTime` could be employed to identify sections within that kernel responsible for the slow execution.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: Basic Kernel Timing with `cudaEventElapsedTime`**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    data[i] *= 2;
  }
}

int main() {
  int N = 1024 * 1024;
  int *h_data, *d_data;
  cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_data, N * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, N * sizeof(int));

  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) h_data[i] = i;
  cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, N * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  cudaEvent_t start, stop;
  cudaEventCreate(&start);
  cudaEventCreate(&stop);

  cudaEventRecord(start, 0);
  myKernel<<<(N + 255) / 256, 256>>>(d_data, N);
  cudaEventRecord(stop, 0);
  cudaEventSynchronize(stop);

  float elapsedTime;
  cudaEventElapsedTime(&elapsedTime, start, stop);

  cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, N * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
  cudaFree(d_data);
  cudaFreeHost(h_data);
  cudaEventDestroy(start);
  cudaEventDestroy(stop);

  std::cout << "Kernel execution time: " << elapsedTime << " ms" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental usage of `cudaEventElapsedTime`.  Two events, `start` and `stop`, are created and recorded before and after the kernel launch, respectively.  `cudaEventSynchronize` ensures that the timing is accurate by waiting for the kernel to complete.  The elapsed time is then retrieved and displayed.  Note the necessity of error checking, omitted here for brevity, which is crucial in production code.


**Example 2: Timing Sections Within a Kernel**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    cudaEvent_t start, stop;
    cudaEventCreate(&start);
    cudaEventCreate(&stop);

    cudaEventRecord(start, 0);
    //Perform computation section 1
    int temp = data[i] * 2;
    cudaEventRecord(stop, 0);
    cudaEventSynchronize(stop);

    float elapsedTime1;
    cudaEventElapsedTime(&elapsedTime1, start, stop);
    cudaEventDestroy(start);
    cudaEventDestroy(stop);

    cudaEventCreate(&start);
    cudaEventCreate(&stop);
    cudaEventRecord(start, 0);
    //Perform computation section 2
    data[i] = temp + 5;
    cudaEventRecord(stop, 0);
    cudaEventSynchronize(stop);

    float elapsedTime2;
    cudaEventElapsedTime(&elapsedTime2, start, stop);
    cudaEventDestroy(start);
    cudaEventDestroy(stop);

  }
}
//rest of the code similar to Example 1
```

This demonstrates timing different sections within a single kernel.  However, the overhead introduced by repeated event creation, recording, and synchronization might become significant for very small sections.  Care must be taken to balance the granularity of measurement with the additional overhead.


**Example 3:  Integrating `nvprof` and `cudaEventElapsedTime`**

This example isnâ€™t directly coded; it represents a workflow.  First, `nvprof` is used to profile the entire application, identifying kernels with high execution times.  Then, `cudaEventElapsedTime` is used to fine-tune the performance analysis within those kernels, possibly revealing internal bottlenecks related to algorithm design or memory access patterns.  This iterative approach combines the breadth of `nvprof` with the precision of `cudaEventElapsedTime` for more effective optimization.  The output of `nvprof` directs the focused application of `cudaEventElapsedTime`.
