The common culprit behind an older PyTorch version failing in a new conda environment often stems from subtle mismatches in underlying CUDA toolkit and cuDNN library compatibility, or sometimes just the way the environment resolves dependencies. I've spent countless hours debugging this exact scenario across various projects, especially when trying to reproduce results from older research papers. The core issue isn’t that the PyTorch version itself is inherently flawed, but rather, that the environment’s construction doesn’t provide the required dependencies that version was built against.

Conda environments are designed to be self-contained. When you create a new one and install packages, conda’s solver attempts to find the most compatible versions of all specified and implied dependencies. This includes not only Python packages like numpy and pandas, but also critical system-level libraries. Specifically, PyTorch relies heavily on the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit and cuDNN library for GPU acceleration. An older PyTorch version might have been compiled against a specific CUDA version (e.g., CUDA 10.2) and cuDNN version (e.g., cuDNN 7.6) that aren’t the defaults in a new conda environment. A new environment typically defaults to the latest CUDA and cuDNN versions available, or those specified in the conda environment creation or by conda package manager constraints. If these versions are mismatched, even if the underlying NVIDIA drivers are current, PyTorch will likely fail to properly load the CUDA components resulting in errors ranging from missing symbols and runtime segfaults to complete inability to use a GPU.

The core of this challenge is that PyTorch is distributed as precompiled binaries. These binaries contain optimized code that links to specific versions of CUDA and cuDNN. When the conda environment lacks these exact versions, these links become invalid, leading to the failure. Another, lesser, issue can be a conflict arising from other libraries within the conda environment. While less frequent, some libraries might conflict with the older PyTorch version, though the CUDA/cuDNN incompatibility is the more prevalent problem. The older PyTorch might be expecting specific versions of dependencies like `libstdc++` that are no longer offered or included in modern builds of an operating system. I've seen this manifest as mysterious segmentation faults or other low level failures.

**Code Example 1: Examining CUDA and PyTorch Versions**

To diagnose the problem, one of the first steps is to explicitly check the versions of CUDA and PyTorch being used and their availability. This can be done using a few lines of Python code within the problematic conda environment.

```python
import torch

print("PyTorch Version:", torch.__version__)
print("CUDA Available:", torch.cuda.is_available())

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print("CUDA Version:", torch.version.cuda)
    print("CUDA Device Name:", torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
else:
    print("CUDA is not available.")

```

This snippet prints out the PyTorch version, indicates whether CUDA is available, and, if it is, prints the CUDA version that PyTorch is linked against, and the GPU's device name. The output is critical in determining whether CUDA is available to PyTorch as the user intended and the linked CUDA version. If `torch.cuda.is_available()` is `False` or the CUDA version printed differs from the version expected by the older PyTorch, we have a problem. If CUDA is available, but the device name is missing or doesn't match the expected hardware, that's a red flag.

**Code Example 2: Specifying Dependencies During Environment Creation**

The most effective solution is often to create a new environment with the specific CUDA version required by the older PyTorch. This is generally done during environment creation with conda. Let's imagine we need a specific version of PyTorch that needs CUDA version 10.2. The following command would create the environment and install a correct pytorch version while specifying CUDA 10.2.

```bash
conda create -n old_torch_env python=3.8 -c pytorch pytorch=1.7.0 torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2
```

This command creates an environment named `old_torch_env` and installs Python 3.8, PyTorch 1.7.0, TorchVision, and the CUDA toolkit version 10.2. By explicitly specifying `cudatoolkit=10.2`, conda ensures that all dependencies, including PyTorch, are built against or compatible with CUDA 10.2. The precise package names and versions need to be checked against the PyTorch download page to ensure that the version specified is compatible with the CUDA version being used and the GPU drivers installed on the host machine.

**Code Example 3: Checking the cuDNN Version**

While conda handles CUDA toolkit dependencies, explicit cuDNN specification can be necessary for some versions of pytorch. You won’t often install cuDNN directly with conda, but it's important to verify its presence and compatibility using external tools, or by inspecting the output from the pytorch library.

```python
import subprocess

try:
  result = subprocess.run(['cudnn_version'], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
  print("cuDNN Version:", result.stdout.strip())
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("cuDNN executable not found. Check your cuDNN setup.")
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error checking cuDNN version: {e}")

import torch
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    try:
        import torch.backends.cudnn as cudnn
        print(f"cuDNN status: {cudnn.is_acceptable(torch.cuda.current_device())}")
    except ImportError:
        print("Cannot import torch.backends.cudnn")
else:
    print("CUDA is not available.")


```

This code snippet tries to execute a system level command "cudnn_version" to get the cuDNN version. It also uses the pytorch API to query the status of the cuDNN implementation being used with the CUDA device selected. The code checks for `FileNotFoundError` in case the system doesn't have `cudnn_version` command available or if the user hasn't configured their environment to make the command accessible. Additionally, it imports the cuDNN sub module of the torch library and checks if the library believes the current environment's cuDNN implementation is acceptable, printing `True` or `False`. If the reported cuDNN version is not compatible with your old PyTorch, or if the acceptability check fails, further environment configurations or even cuDNN upgrades may be required.

Diagnosing an old version of PyTorch not working correctly in a new conda environment relies on thorough examination of CUDA, cuDNN, and PyTorch versions. By carefully controlling environment creation, ensuring matching library versions, and using diagnostic tools, you can often resolve most issues. Relying on the correct conda channel and properly specifying dependencies during environment creation are often crucial. I've found that sometimes, rebuilding the environment from scratch with specific version constraints is the quickest path to resolution. It’s a meticulous process, but careful environment configuration is essential for consistent and reproducible results in any deep learning project, especially when dealing with older versions of frameworks like PyTorch.

For learning more about managing CUDA dependencies with conda, I would recommend looking at the official conda documentation which details how to manage dependencies across channels and platforms. Similarly, the NVIDIA developer website provides comprehensive information about the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN library, often including compatibility matrices between CUDA versions and GPU hardware. Finally, looking into general deep learning best practices about how to create reproducible environments using configuration management tools like conda, docker or similar is often a great starting point.
