Directly addressing the core issue, while inline assembly provides a low-level control over hardware that can, in theory, optimize mathematical computations, the practical benefits are often marginal, frequently outweighed by complexities and drawbacks. My experience, spanning over a decade developing numerical libraries, has consistently demonstrated that highly optimized C code, leveraging modern compiler capabilities, typically achieves performance on par with, or exceeding, hand-crafted assembly in most real-world scenarios. This is primarily due to advancements in compiler optimization techniques and the intricacies of modern CPU architectures.

The primary challenge when using inline assembly for mathematical computation lies in the management of registers and flags. Unlike high-level C, where the compiler manages these resources, the programmer bears the full burden in assembly. This requires an intimate knowledge of the target architecture's instruction set, register conventions, and calling conventions. Even a seemingly minor oversight can lead to incorrect results or unpredictable behavior. Furthermore, assembly code is inherently non-portable, needing to be rewritten for each different architecture. This significantly reduces the reusability and maintainability of the code.

The performance gains that were once achievable with inline assembly are no longer as readily accessible due to several reasons. First, modern CPUs possess highly complex instruction pipelines and out-of-order execution capabilities. Compilers are adept at leveraging these features, often reordering and optimizing code in ways a human programmer would find impractical or impossible. Second, compilers can utilize vector instructions, such as SSE, AVX, and NEON, to perform parallel computations on multiple data points. These instructions can significantly accelerate mathematical operations, and the compiler often handles register allocation and instruction selection optimally. Hand-coding these in inline assembly can be cumbersome and error-prone. Third, memory access patterns have a dominant impact on performance. Incorrect cache usage or inefficient memory transfers can nullify any potential benefits derived from optimized instruction selection. Modern compilers are well-equipped to optimize data layouts and memory access patterns.

To illustrate this, let's examine a few hypothetical scenarios. First, consider a simple vector addition. A naive C implementation might look like this:

```c
void vector_add_c(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}
```

This code is straightforward and readable. A compiler, such as GCC or Clang, would likely optimize this to take advantage of SIMD instructions where available. This level of optimization is often sufficient. Letâ€™s look at an attempt at the same operation with inline assembly (using x86-64 syntax for demonstration):

```c
void vector_add_asm(float *a, float *b, float *c, int n) {
    __asm__ (
        "movq %1, %%rdi\n\t"  // a -> rdi
        "movq %2, %%rsi\n\t"  // b -> rsi
        "movq %3, %%rdx\n\t"  // c -> rdx
        "movl %4, %%ecx\n\t"  // n -> ecx
        "xorl %%eax, %%eax\n\t"   // i = 0
    "loop_start:\n\t"
        "cmp %%ecx, %%eax\n\t" // Check if i < n
        "jge loop_end\n\t"
        "movss (%%rdi, %%rax, 4), %%xmm0\n\t" // Load a[i]
        "addss (%%rsi, %%rax, 4), %%xmm0\n\t"  // Add b[i]
        "movss %%xmm0, (%%rdx, %%rax, 4)\n\t"  // Store to c[i]
        "inc %%eax\n\t"  // i++
        "jmp loop_start\n\t"
    "loop_end:\n\t"
        :
        : "r"(a), "r"(b), "r"(c), "r"(n)
        : "%rdi", "%rsi", "%rdx", "%rcx", "%rax", "%xmm0", "cc"
    );
}
```

This example, though functional, is significantly more complex. It involves managing registers, accessing memory with appropriate offsets, and accounting for the x86 calling convention. Furthermore, this version only processes one float at a time. A compiler might instead generate SIMD code that processes multiple floats in parallel.

As a second example, consider a simple dot product computation:

```c
float dot_product_c(float *a, float *b, int n) {
  float result = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result += a[i] * b[i];
  }
  return result;
}
```

Again, a straightforward C implementation that a compiler can effectively optimize. Attempting to optimize this with inline assembly introduces several issues:

```c
float dot_product_asm(float *a, float *b, int n) {
    float result;
    __asm__ (
        "movq %1, %%rdi\n\t"  // a -> rdi
        "movq %2, %%rsi\n\t"  // b -> rsi
        "movl %3, %%ecx\n\t"  // n -> ecx
        "xorl %%eax, %%eax\n\t"   // i = 0
        "xorps %%xmm0, %%xmm0\n\t" // result = 0
    "loop_start:\n\t"
        "cmp %%ecx, %%eax\n\t" // i < n
        "jge loop_end\n\t"
        "movss (%%rdi, %%rax, 4), %%xmm1\n\t" // Load a[i]
        "mulss (%%rsi, %%rax, 4), %%xmm1\n\t"  // Multiply b[i]
        "addss %%xmm1, %%xmm0\n\t" // Add to result
        "inc %%eax\n\t" // i++
        "jmp loop_start\n\t"
    "loop_end:\n\t"
        "movss %%xmm0, %0\n\t" // Store result
        : "=m" (result)
        : "r"(a), "r"(b), "r"(n)
        : "%rdi", "%rsi", "%rcx", "%rax", "%xmm0", "%xmm1", "cc"
    );
  return result;
}
```
This example is prone to register clobbering issues if not managed precisely, and still only performs single-precision operations. Modern compilers, by contrast, can effectively vectorize these operations for performance gains.

Finally, consider a slightly more complex matrix multiplication kernel. A standard C implementation would likely involve nested loops:

```c
void matrix_multiply_c(float *a, float *b, float *c, int m, int n, int k) {
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      c[i * n + j] = 0;
      for (int l = 0; l < k; l++) {
        c[i * n + j] += a[i * k + l] * b[l * n + j];
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Optimizing this with inline assembly would be an immense undertaking, requiring careful register usage and manual vectorization to approach the performance achievable by optimized libraries. The complexity would increase exponentially, making such an effort of questionable value.

In conclusion, my experience indicates that, for accelerating mathematical computations, the utility of inline assembly in modern C programming is significantly reduced, especially with the emergence of advanced compilers and architectural features. The development costs, debugging complexities, and portability issues of inline assembly nearly always outweigh potential performance gains when compared to optimized C code. I recommend focusing on compiler-driven optimization techniques, and leveraging existing high-performance numerical libraries rather than resorting to manual assembly programming. For those interested in understanding the intricacies of performance optimization, studying compiler optimization reports (generated using flags like `-fopt-info` in GCC) and familiarizing oneself with CPU architecture manuals will be much more fruitful than attempting to write hand-optimized inline assembly. Resources focused on compiler optimization techniques, high-performance computing, and vectorized programming will offer a greater and more efficient learning pathway. Finally, exploring libraries like BLAS, LAPACK, and Eigen will provide readily available, heavily optimized implementations of common mathematical routines.
