The core challenge in adding different numbers to a Verilog register within Vivado lies not in the addition itself, but in the efficient and synthesizable implementation of the addition process, especially when dealing with varying input values and potential timing constraints.  My experience working on high-speed data acquisition systems frequently involved optimizing register updates based on asynchronous inputs, necessitating a thorough understanding of Verilog's capabilities and Vivado's synthesis process.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Adding different numbers to a Verilog register requires a structured approach.  Simply assigning a new value directly overwrites the previous contents.  To achieve cumulative addition, we must utilize either an always block with a sensitivity list or a procedural assignment within a combinatorial process. The choice depends on the nature of the input signals: synchronous (clocked) or asynchronous.

For synchronous addition, where the addition happens at the rising or falling edge of a clock signal, an always block sensitive to the clock is mandatory. This ensures predictable behavior and avoids race conditions. The `case` statement is a powerful tool to handle multiple input values, providing a clean and easily understandable method for directing the addition based on a control signal.

Asynchronous addition, on the other hand, where the input signals are not synchronized to a clock,  requires a more careful approach.  We need to ensure that the addition is performed only after the inputs have stabilized, using appropriate synchronization techniques to avoid metastability issues.  While directly assigning the sum might seem simple, the synthesis tool might not optimize this effectively, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or timing violations.

Finally, the register's data type and width are critical considerations.  Insufficient bit width can lead to overflow, resulting in inaccurate results.  The data type choice impacts resource utilization within the FPGA.  For example, using a signed integer might be necessary if negative numbers are involved.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Synchronous Addition with a Case Statement:**

```verilog
module synchronous_adder (
  input clk,
  input rst,
  input [1:0] select,
  input [7:0] data_in_a,
  input [7:0] data_in_b,
  input [7:0] data_in_c,
  output reg [7:0] register_out
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst) begin
      register_out <= 8'b00000000;
    end else begin
      case (select)
        2'b00: register_out <= register_out + data_in_a;
        2'b01: register_out <= register_out + data_in_b;
        2'b10: register_out <= register_out + data_in_c;
        default: register_out <= register_out; //No change
      endcase
    end
  end

endmodule
```

This example demonstrates synchronous addition.  The `select` signal determines which input (`data_in_a`, `data_in_b`, or `data_in_c`) is added to `register_out` at each clock cycle.  The `case` statement ensures clear selection, and the reset signal (`rst`) initializes the register to zero.  This approach is highly synthesizable and predictable.


**Example 2: Asynchronous Addition with Synchronization:**

```verilog
module asynchronous_adder (
  input clk,
  input rst,
  input [7:0] data_in,
  output reg [7:0] register_out
);

  reg [7:0] sync_data_in;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst) begin
      register_out <= 8'b00000000;
      sync_data_in <= 8'b00000000;
    end else begin
      sync_data_in <= data_in; //Simple synchronizer -  multiple FFs might be necessary for high-speed designs.
      register_out <= register_out + sync_data_in;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

This example showcases asynchronous addition. The `data_in` signal is not synchronized to the clock. To mitigate metastability, a simple synchronizer (a single flip-flop) is used.  In high-speed designs, multiple flip-flops are needed in a synchronization chain to reduce the probability of metastability.  The addition happens synchronously after the data is synchronized.  This approach prevents unpredictable behavior but requires careful consideration of the synchronizer's design for reliable operation.


**Example 3:  Addition using a Parameterized Register:**

```verilog
module parameterized_adder #(parameter DATA_WIDTH = 8) (
  input clk,
  input rst,
  input [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] data_in,
  output reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] register_out
);

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst) begin
      register_out <= {{(DATA_WIDTH){1'b0}}};
    end else begin
      register_out <= register_out + data_in;
    end
  end

endmodule
```

This example highlights the use of parameters for flexibility.  The `DATA_WIDTH` parameter controls the register's size, making the module reusable with different data widths without modification.  The concise `always` block performs a simple synchronous addition.  This approach is ideal for designs requiring different data widths without repetitive code.  The use of `{{(DATA_WIDTH){1'b0}}}` provides a clean way to initialize the register to zero irrespective of `DATA_WIDTH`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Verilog and its application in FPGA design, I recommend consulting the official Verilog language reference manual and the Vivado Design Suite User Guide.  A good textbook on digital design principles is also beneficial.  Specific focus should be placed on topics like synchronous and asynchronous design, metastability, and synthesis optimization techniques.  Exploring advanced Verilog constructs like parameterized modules and generate statements will further enhance your design capabilities.  Finally, understanding timing analysis within the Vivado environment is crucial for designing high-performance systems.
