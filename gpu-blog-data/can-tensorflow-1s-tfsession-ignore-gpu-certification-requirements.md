TensorFlow 1's `tf.Session` does not inherently bypass GPU certification requirements. Instead, its behavior in environments lacking certified CUDA drivers or appropriate hardware stems from its internal resource management and error handling, not from intentional ignorance of certification standards. I've encountered this firsthand while optimizing legacy models on older server clusters, where mismatched driver versions were common.

The core issue arises because TensorFlow, when configured for GPU usage, attempts to allocate resources on available CUDA-enabled devices. If it cannot establish a connection to the CUDA driver, or if the driver fails to locate a compatible GPU, TensorFlow defaults to a CPU-based execution path. This fallback isn't a purposeful disregard for certification, but rather a safety mechanism that prioritizes functionality over strict hardware validation.  The session initialization process, when requesting GPU allocation, relies on CUDA libraries provided by NVIDIA. The presence of a correctly installed, compatible NVIDIA driver, alongside the appropriate CUDA toolkit libraries, is crucial. When these dependencies are missing or mismatched, the attempted GPU initialization process throws an exception. This exception is generally caught by TensorFlow's internal logic and results in the `tf.Session` continuing to function on the CPU. This ensures the code can still execute, albeit at a potentially significant performance cost.

Let's examine this behavior through code examples.

**Example 1: Successful GPU Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Explicitly configure GPU usage (optional, TensorFlow will often auto-detect)
config = tf.ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True # Avoid allocating all GPU memory upfront
config.log_device_placement = True # Display device placement details

with tf.Session(config=config) as sess:
  # Dummy operation - just for verification
  a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
  b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)
  c = a + b
  result = sess.run(c)
  print(f"Result: {result}")
```

In a scenario with correctly installed CUDA drivers, this code snippet would produce output similar to this:
```
2024-10-27 14:30:00.000000: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:141] Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: SSE4.1 SSE4.2 AVX AVX2 FMA

Device mapping:

Result: [5. 7. 9.]
```

The critical section here is the GPU device discovery log indicating that TensorFlow has successfully found and initialized the GPU, and subsequently placed the operations on the available device `(/device:GPU:0)`. `log_device_placement = True` provides the device mapping for each operation in the graph during execution.  The fact that  the program does not error out, is evidence of the proper driver and CUDA configurations.

**Example 2: Missing CUDA Drivers - CPU Fallback**

Now, let’s assume the NVIDIA drivers are not installed, or the installed driver version does not match the CUDA toolkit used to build the TensorFlow library.  The modified configuration uses the same base code as Example 1:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

config = tf.ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
config.log_device_placement = True

with tf.Session(config=config) as sess:
  a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
  b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)
  c = a + b
  result = sess.run(c)
  print(f"Result: {result}")
```
In this situation, the execution would display different output:

```

```

Here, TensorFlow logs warnings (`W`) that indicate missing CUDA libraries like `libcudart.so`, cuBLAS, and cuDNN, which are essential for GPU acceleration. Despite finding the GPU, device mapping clearly shows that the operations are executed on the CPU `/device:CPU:0`, not `/device:GPU:0`, as would have occurred with successful GPU initialization. The calculation still runs and provides the correct result. This exemplifies the fallback mechanism, where the program is still functional despite the inability to use the desired GPU device. Critically, the session initialization itself completes without errors. The absence of compatible drivers triggers a CPU fallback during operations and not an error during `tf.Session` creation.

**Example 3: Explicit CPU Device Placement**

To further demonstrate that `tf.Session` operates with a preference for the specified device configuration if available and will default to CPU if not, we can explicitly force calculations onto the CPU, even in an environment where GPUs are present and properly configured.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

config = tf.ConfigProto()
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
config.log_device_placement = True

with tf.Session(config=config) as sess:
  with tf.device('/cpu:0'): # Explicitly placing on CPU
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
    b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)
    c = a + b
  result = sess.run(c)
  print(f"Result: {result}")
```

This script will produce a log similar to Example 1, showing that the device found is the GPU. Despite that, the output will show that operations are mapped to the CPU. The `tf.device('/cpu:0')` context manager explicitly forces operation execution onto the CPU.  This will happen regardless of whether the CUDA drivers are correctly installed. If available, the TensorFlow runtime will select the requested device.  If it is not available, it will error, otherwise the operations continue on the targeted device.

```

...

Device mapping:
/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:CPU:0 -> device: 0, name: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, ...

```

This highlights that the functionality is tied to what is available for use when creating the graph during execution. The session creation is not tied to the physical hardware and driver presence; it is only during the graph's compilation and execution that the GPU will be selected or bypassed if unavailable.

**Resource Recommendations**

To gain a deeper understanding of this behavior, I recommend consulting the following sources:

*   The official TensorFlow 1 documentation: Though archived, the original documentation offers detailed explanations of session configurations and device placement. Specific sections regarding `tf.ConfigProto` and device usage are pertinent.
*   NVIDIA’s CUDA toolkit documentation: Understanding the underlying CUDA environment and its requirements will illuminate the dependencies of TensorFlow's GPU acceleration.
*  TensorFlow GitHub repositories: Examining the TensorFlow source code, particularly the modules related to GPU device management, will provide insight into internal mechanics of device selection.

In conclusion,  `tf.Session` does not *ignore* GPU certification requirements; rather, it gracefully handles their absence by falling back to CPU execution. This behavior ensures that code can still execute even in less-than-ideal environments. The root of the issue is not at the session initialization level, but during graph execution where the runtime must select a target device for each operation. Understanding the underlying CUDA and driver dependencies is crucial to ensure smooth and efficient GPU utilization in TensorFlow 1.
