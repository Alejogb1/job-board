The `NotImplementedError` or `RuntimeError` encountered during the use of Keras' `fit_generator` (now deprecated, replaced by `fit` with a `generator`) frequently stems from inconsistencies between the generator's output and the model's expected input.  My experience troubleshooting this over numerous projects, particularly those involving complex data pipelines and custom data augmentation, points consistently to this root cause.  The error rarely originates from a fundamental flaw within Keras itself but rather a mismatch in data handling within the user-defined generator.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `fit` method (and its predecessor, `fit_generator`) requires a generator that yields batches of data in a specific format.  This format comprises two elements: features (X) and labels (y).  The generator must consistently return these two elements as NumPy arrays or TensorFlow tensors in each iteration.  Any deviation from this, including variations in shape, data type, or the absence of either X or y, leads to the aforementioned errors.  Additionally, the generator's output shape must align precisely with the model's input shape as defined during model compilation.  Failure to meet these requirements results in runtime exceptions, as Keras is unable to process the data supplied.  Memory issues, often masked as `RuntimeError`, can also occur if the generator yields excessively large batches that overwhelm available RAM.

Furthermore, the `steps_per_epoch` parameter, specifying the number of batches per epoch, must accurately reflect the number of batches your generator will produce. An incorrect value will either truncate the training prematurely or lead to an infinite loop, eventually resulting in a `RuntimeError` due to resource exhaustion.

Finally, a less common but equally important aspect is exception handling within the generator itself.  If the generator encounters an error during data processing (e.g., reading a corrupted file), it should gracefully handle this exception to prevent abrupt termination and subsequent errors.  Ignoring exceptions within the generator can lead to unpredictable behavior, including `RuntimeError`.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Implementation**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

def data_generator(data, labels, batch_size):
    indices = np.arange(len(data))
    np.random.shuffle(indices)
    while True:
        for i in range(0, len(data), batch_size):
            batch_indices = indices[i:i + batch_size]
            X_batch = data[batch_indices]
            y_batch = labels[batch_indices]
            yield X_batch, y_batch


# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = np.random.rand(1000, 32, 32, 3)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000)

# Model definition (replace with your actual model)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Training using the generator
model.fit(data_generator(data, labels, 32), steps_per_epoch=len(data) // 32, epochs=10)

```

This example demonstrates a correctly implemented generator.  Crucially, it yields tuples containing `X_batch` and `y_batch` consistently, ensuring data consistency and shape agreement.  The `steps_per_epoch` is calculated correctly, preventing premature termination.

**Example 2: Incorrect Shape Handling**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

def faulty_generator(data, labels, batch_size):
    # ... (data loading omitted for brevity) ...
    # Incorrect shape: missing a dimension
    yield data[:batch_size], labels[:batch_size].reshape(-1)

# ... (model definition omitted) ...

model.fit(faulty_generator(data, labels, 32), steps_per_epoch=len(data) // 32, epochs=10)
```

This flawed generator produces labels with an incorrect shape. Reshaping labels to (-1) attempts to force it into a single dimension which might not align with the model's expected output, likely resulting in a `RuntimeError` or `ValueError` during the fitting process.


**Example 3: Exception Handling Omission**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

def exception_prone_generator(data_paths, labels, batch_size):
    for i in range(0, len(data_paths), batch_size):
        batch_paths = data_paths[i:i + batch_size]
        X_batch = []
        for path in batch_paths:
            try:
                # Simulate potential IO error
                img = np.load(path)  # Replace with your image loading logic
                X_batch.append(img)
            except FileNotFoundError:
                #Missing exception handling
                pass #This silently ignores the error, potentially causing inconsistencies

        yield np.array(X_batch), labels[i:i + batch_size]


# ... (model definition omitted) ...

model.fit(exception_prone_generator(data_paths, labels, 32), steps_per_epoch=len(data_paths) // 32, epochs=10)

```

This example lacks proper exception handling within the generator. If a `FileNotFoundError` occurs, the generator will proceed with incomplete batches, leading to shape mismatches or other runtime errors.  Robust error handling with `try-except` blocks and appropriate logging is essential.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation is an indispensable resource for understanding the intricacies of the `fit` method and working with generators effectively.  Furthermore,  consult detailed tutorials and examples focusing specifically on custom generators for image processing and other data types relevant to your application.  Finally, a thorough understanding of NumPy and TensorFlow data structures and operations is paramount to successful data pipeline development.  Debugging tools within your IDE (such as breakpoints and variable inspection) are also crucial in pinpointing inconsistencies in data shape and type.  Careful attention to these details will prevent the vast majority of `NotImplementedError` and `RuntimeError` issues encountered when training Keras models with generators.
