Negative values in word embeddings generated when using TensorFlow and LDA, despite LDA’s probabilistic nature, arise due to the *mismatch in objectives* between the two models. LDA, at its core, models documents as mixtures of topics, and each topic as a distribution over words, resulting in non-negative probability distributions. Word embeddings, on the other hand, are trained to capture semantic relationships between words through a vector space, often using neural networks and methods like Word2Vec or GloVe, which can, and do, produce negative values in their representations. When we attempt to *repurpose* word embeddings within an LDA context— specifically when using word embedding *initialization*—we are forcing a system built for semantic relationships to fulfill a probabilistic modeling role for which it wasn’t designed.

In my experience building several topic modeling pipelines, I’ve encountered this issue firsthand. Initially, I assumed that using pre-trained word embeddings for LDA’s topic-word distributions would provide better coherence and performance, as it would leverage existing semantic knowledge. However, what I observed was an inconsistent and often erratic behavior, often culminating in negative values within the topic-word distributions that LDA was supposed to be generating as probabilities. The fundamental problem is that word embeddings, when directly plugged into the topic-word distribution of LDA, introduce *unconstrained* values where we would expect probabilities, which must always be non-negative and sum to 1.

LDA relies on Dirichlet priors and multinomial likelihoods to produce its topic-word and document-topic distributions. While these distributions are inherently probabilistic, initialization using word embeddings disregards these constraints. Let me elaborate: when the topic-word distribution matrix is initialized with word embeddings, the values within that matrix will correspond to the elements of word embedding vectors, which can be both positive and negative depending on the training data and algorithm used. These values have not undergone any normalization or transformation to adhere to probability distribution properties. This leads to a situation where the optimization procedure of LDA is attempting to adjust a *non-probability matrix* in accordance with a probability model. Though LDA eventually converges and produces interpretable topic-word distributions with non-negative values, the initial state significantly impacts the process. We are essentially giving LDA an unconstrained starting point, often a very poor fit. This can lead to longer convergence times, convergence to sub-optimal solutions, and also instability during the training process.

To illustrate this point, consider three scenarios demonstrating typical word embedding initializations when used with LDA.

**Example 1: Direct Initialization Without Transformation**

This snippet initializes the topic-word matrix in an LDA model using pre-trained word embeddings directly, demonstrating the problem.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
import numpy as np
tfd = tfp.distributions

# Assume we have a vocabulary size of 1000 and embedding size of 100.
vocab_size = 1000
embedding_size = 100
num_topics = 20

# Placeholder for pre-trained word embeddings
word_embeddings = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(vocab_size, embedding_size)))

# Initialize the topic-word matrix (beta) with embeddings.
# This directly maps each word embedding to topic weight, which isn’t probabilistically sound.
beta_init = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(num_topics, vocab_size)))
for topic_idx in range(num_topics):
    # Assign each word in the vocab an embedding vector as weight
    beta_init[topic_idx].assign(tf.random.normal(shape=(vocab_size,)))
    # We do not account for topics, so this is not good for use in LDA
    for i in range (vocab_size):
        beta_init[topic_idx, i].assign(tf.reduce_sum(word_embeddings[i]))
# During LDA training, these values will initially be negative or positive unconstrained real numbers.

print(beta_init)
```

In this case, the `beta_init` matrix, representing the topic-word distribution, is directly initialized using the word embeddings. These embeddings are not designed to be interpretable as topic probabilities and, thus, are a poor fit. The values will almost certainly be unconstrained in terms of being non-negative.

**Example 2: Softmax Transformation Attempt**

This snippet demonstrates an attempt to normalize the word embeddings using softmax to make them probability-like, but still introduces issues.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
import numpy as np
tfd = tfp.distributions

# Same parameters as before
vocab_size = 1000
embedding_size = 100
num_topics = 20

# Assume pre-trained embeddings
word_embeddings = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(vocab_size, embedding_size)))

# Attempt to normalize embeddings by applying softmax
beta_init = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(num_topics, vocab_size)))
for topic_idx in range(num_topics):
    for i in range(vocab_size):
        beta_init[topic_idx,i].assign(tf.reduce_sum(tf.nn.softmax(word_embeddings[i])))

# During LDA training, while values will initially be constrained in a sense due to Softmax, they still do not reflect Topic-Word Probability Distributions properly.

print(beta_init)

```

Here, we attempt to normalize each word embedding with softmax *before* assigning it to the topic-word distribution, essentially making it a probability-like vector before LDA. While this makes the values non-negative and sum to one *across the vocabulary for each embedding*, it doesn't make each element act as the *probability of a word being in a topic*, nor does it incorporate how likely a word is to be in a specific topic. In addition to this, it reduces the dimensionality of the problem, so word information is lost as well. Also, note that even after the softmax operation and dimensionality reduction by `tf.reduce_sum`, there are no topic-specific vectors. Each element from the softmaxed version is assigned to the same index in every single topic.

**Example 3: Incorporating Learnable Parameters**

Here, we use a trainable projection to transform the embeddings, a slightly better approach but still not completely addressing the problem.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
import numpy as np
tfd = tfp.distributions

# Same parameters as before
vocab_size = 1000
embedding_size = 100
num_topics = 20

# Pre-trained word embeddings
word_embeddings = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(vocab_size, embedding_size)))

# Create a trainable matrix to project the word embeddings to the topic space.
projection_matrix = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(embedding_size, num_topics)), trainable=True)

# Perform the projection and apply softmax along the topic dimension
beta_init = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(num_topics, vocab_size)))
for i in range(vocab_size):
    beta_init[:, i].assign(tf.nn.softmax(tf.matmul(word_embeddings[i:i+1], projection_matrix)[0]))

# LDA training will use these projected and softmaxed values as initial topic distributions.

print(beta_init)
```

In this final example, we introduce a learnable projection matrix `projection_matrix`. This matrix allows each word embedding to be projected into the topic space before applying the softmax function. Now, softmax is applied across topics *for each word*, so the result could be interpreted as a kind of probability of word i being in topic j.  While this addresses the lack of constraints in the previous examples, it does not explicitly capture the underlying process that is modeled in LDA which assumes topic-word and doc-topic multinomial distributions using Dirichlet Priors. The projection and softmax are an attempt to address this gap, but the lack of explicit modeling of the underlying process that is assumed by LDA often limits the ability of this system to be successful in creating good topic models.

Based on my experience, attempting to use word embeddings to directly initialize the topic-word distribution in LDA introduces a significant mismatch. The key is to recognize that word embeddings are not probabilities and were not designed for that purpose. Instead of relying on embedding initialization, one could consider exploring approaches that *incorporate* embeddings as side-information in topic models, or even combining them with probabilistic topic models via neural topic models, which offers more flexibility in model specification.

For those working with LDA and word embeddings, I recommend exploring resources on probabilistic graphical models (specifically topics on Dirichlet priors and multinomial likelihoods), as well as literature comparing conventional LDA to neural topic modeling frameworks. Understanding the fundamental assumptions and mathematical structures of each method provides the most crucial insight in handling the mismatches I've described here. A solid grounding in information retrieval and natural language processing best practices regarding feature engineering is also highly beneficial when constructing topic models. Textbooks on probabilistic modeling can offer a solid foundation for these areas.
