Data transfer operations, particularly those involving GPU memory, often represent a significant bottleneck in the performance of Thrust-based applications.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing codes for large-scale simulations highlighted this repeatedly.  The key to efficient execution lies in overlapping data transfer with computation, thereby masking the latency associated with memory access. This isn't simply about concurrent execution; it's about carefully structuring the code to leverage asynchronous data transfer capabilities and optimize data locality.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Thrust, a parallel algorithms library built on CUDA, facilitates parallel operations on data residing in GPU memory. However, transferring data between host (CPU) and device (GPU) memory can be slow compared to the processing speed of the GPU.  Naive implementations often involve sequential steps: 1) data transfer from host to device, 2) computation on the device, and 3) data transfer from device to host.  This approach suffers from significant idle time while waiting for data transfers to complete.

Overlapping data transfer with computation involves initiating a data transfer operation asynchronously, allowing the CPU to proceed with other tasks while the transfer happens in the background.  This requires the use of asynchronous data transfer functions provided by the CUDA runtime API, and careful orchestration of the Thrust algorithms.  Once the asynchronous transfer is initiated, the CPU can start a new independent computation or continue with other tasks.  Only when the GPU computation dependent on that data is complete is the application required to explicitly wait for the transfer's completion.  Correct synchronization is crucial to avoid data races and incorrect results.  Effectively utilizing this technique requires a deep understanding of CUDA streams and events.

Furthermore, optimizing data locality significantly impacts performance.  Thrust algorithms benefit from contiguous data in memory.  If data is scattered, accessing it becomes inefficient, potentially negating the benefits of overlapped execution.  Pre-processing the data on the host to ensure optimal memory layout before transferring it to the device can considerably improve performance.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Naive Sequential Approach (Inefficient):**

```cpp
#include <thrust/host_vector.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/transform.h>

// ... function to perform computation ...

int main() {
    thrust::host_vector<float> h_data(N); // Initialize host data
    // ... populate h_data ...

    thrust::device_vector<float> d_data = h_data; // Synchronous data transfer

    thrust::device_vector<float> d_result(N);
    thrust::transform(d_data.begin(), d_data.end(), d_result.begin(), my_computation); // Computation

    thrust::host_vector<float> h_result = d_result; // Synchronous data transfer
    // ... process h_result ...
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a sequential approach.  The data transfers are blocking, resulting in substantial idle time.


**Example 2: Asynchronous Data Transfer with Streams (Efficient):**

```cpp
#include <thrust/host_vector.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/transform.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// ... function to perform computation ...

int main() {
    thrust::host_vector<float> h_data(N);
    // ... populate h_data ...

    thrust::device_vector<float> d_data(N);
    cudaStream_t stream;
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

    cudaMemcpyAsync(d_data.data().get(), h_data.data().get(), N * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream); //Asynchronous transfer

    thrust::device_vector<float> d_result(N);
    thrust::transform(d_data.begin(), d_data.end(), d_result.begin(), my_computation, stream); //Computation on stream

    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream); //Wait for completion

    thrust::host_vector<float> h_result = d_result; //Synchronous transfer after computation
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream);
    // ... process h_result ...
    return 0;
}
```

This example uses CUDA streams to perform asynchronous data transfer.  The `cudaMemcpyAsync` function initiates the transfer in the background, allowing the computation to start concurrently.  `cudaStreamSynchronize` ensures that the computation completes before retrieving the results.


**Example 3: Overlapping Multiple Transfers and Computations (Advanced):**

```cpp
#include <thrust/host_vector.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/transform.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// ... function to perform computation ...

int main() {
    // ... initialization ...

    cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);

    cudaMemcpyAsync(d_data1.data().get(), h_data1.data().get(), N * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream1);
    thrust::transform(d_data1.begin(), d_data1.end(), d_result1.begin(), my_computation, stream1);

    cudaMemcpyAsync(d_data2.data().get(), h_data2.data().get(), N * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream2);
    thrust::transform(d_data2.begin(), d_data2.end(), d_result2.begin(), my_computation, stream2);

    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1);
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream2);

    // ... process results ...

    cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);

    return 0;
}

```
This advanced example demonstrates overlapping multiple data transfers and computations using multiple streams.  Each stream allows for independent asynchronous operations.
