Resuming training from an intermediate graph state, particularly in complex deep learning models, requires careful consideration of model checkpointing and the mechanics of gradient descent.  My experience with large-scale language model training has shown that directly loading weights and biases alone is insufficient; one must also manage the optimizer's internal state.  Failure to do so often leads to unexpected behavior, including instability and suboptimal performance gains.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue in resuming training lies in the optimizer's internal state.  Optimizers like Adam, RMSprop, and SGD maintain internal variables, such as momentum and past gradients, that are crucial for efficient optimization.  These internal variables accumulate over training iterations, reflecting the trajectory of the optimization process.  Simply loading the model's weights and biases from an intermediate checkpoint discards this valuable information, essentially restarting the optimization from a point that's not truly representative of the model's prior learning.  This can lead to oscillations, slower convergence, or even divergence from the desired loss landscape.

Effective resumption requires saving and loading not only the model's parameters (weights and biases) but also the optimizer's internal state.  This state usually includes the momentum vectors, the moving averages of squared gradients (for Adam and RMSprop), and potentially other internal variables specific to the chosen optimizer.  The exact method depends on the deep learning framework being used.  Furthermore, the learning rate schedule should also be considered.  Resuming from an intermediate point might necessitate adjustments to avoid learning rate instability.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the process using PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, and a hypothetical custom framework.  These illustrate the fundamental principles irrespective of the specific details of different library APIs.

**Example 1: PyTorch**

```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

# ... model definition ...

# Load the model and optimizer state
checkpoint = torch.load('checkpoint.pth')
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer_state_dict'])

# Set the model and optimizer to training mode
model.train()

# Resume training
# ... training loop ...

# Save the checkpoint periodically
torch.save({
    'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),
    'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer.state_dict(),
    'epoch': epoch,
    # ... other relevant variables ...
}, 'checkpoint.pth')
```

**Commentary:** This PyTorch example demonstrates the crucial step of loading both the model's `state_dict` and the optimizer's `state_dict`.  The saved checkpoint also includes the epoch number and any other necessary variables to accurately restore the training progress.  The `train()` function call ensures the model is in the correct training mode before resuming.

**Example 2: TensorFlow/Keras**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... model definition ...

# Load the model and optimizer state using a custom callback
class ResumeTrainingCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_train_begin(self, logs=None):
        try:
            checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=self.model, optimizer=self.optimizer)
            checkpoint.restore(tf.train.latest_checkpoint('./checkpoints'))
        except:
            print("No checkpoint found. Starting training from scratch.")

# Create an optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Create a checkpoint manager
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model, optimizer=optimizer)
manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint, './checkpoints', max_to_keep=3)

# Resume training by passing callback and manager
model.fit(..., callbacks=[ResumeTrainingCallback(optimizer=optimizer)], ...)

# ... training loop ...
```

**Commentary:** This TensorFlow/Keras example utilizes a custom callback to handle checkpoint loading during training initiation.  The `tf.train.Checkpoint` and `tf.train.CheckpointManager` manage checkpoint saving and loading, providing a robust and efficient mechanism. The use of `try-except` prevents errors if no checkpoint is found.

**Example 3: Hypothetical Custom Framework (Illustrative)**

```python
class Optimizer:
    def __init__(self, model, learning_rate):
        self.model = model
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.momentum = {}  # Placeholder for momentum variables
        # ... other internal state variables ...


    def step(self, gradients):
        # ... Update model parameters and internal state ...

    def save_state(self, filename):
        # ... Save model parameters and optimizer's internal state ...

    def load_state(self, filename):
        # ... Load model parameters and optimizer's internal state ...


# ... Model definition ...
model = Model(...)
optimizer = Optimizer(model, learning_rate=0.001)

# Load the state from the previous checkpoint
optimizer.load_state('checkpoint.bin')

# ... Training loop ...
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # ... Training steps ...
    optimizer.step(gradients)
    optimizer.save_state('checkpoint.bin')
```


**Commentary:** This hypothetical example showcases how a custom framework could handle the checkpointing and restoration of both the model and its optimizer's state. The key is to maintain explicit tracking of optimizer-specific variables, and ensure their consistent saving and loading along with the model parameters.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of optimization algorithms and checkpointing techniques, I strongly advise studying the relevant documentation of your chosen deep learning framework.  Furthermore, thorough examination of published research papers on large-scale model training, specifically those addressing training stability and efficiency, offers valuable insights into best practices.  Finally, reviewing advanced tutorials on model persistence and state management within your specific deep learning ecosystem is highly beneficial.  These resources will furnish you with the necessary theoretical background and practical guidance to confidently handle advanced training scenarios.
