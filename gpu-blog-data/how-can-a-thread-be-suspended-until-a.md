Thread synchronization is crucial for robust application design, especially in multithreaded environments.  My experience working on high-frequency trading systems highlighted the critical need for precise control over thread execution, particularly when dealing with interdependent tasks.  The challenge posed – suspending a thread until a prerequisite task completes – is fundamental to this control.  This can be effectively managed using several synchronization primitives, each offering different performance characteristics and levels of complexity.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core problem lies in preventing a thread from proceeding until a specific condition is met.  This condition typically signifies the successful completion of a prerequisite task executed by another thread, or potentially by the same thread at a previous stage.  Ignoring this can lead to race conditions, data corruption, and unpredictable application behavior.  The solution involves using synchronization mechanisms to coordinate thread execution, enabling a thread to block until the prerequisite task's completion is signaled.

Several techniques can achieve this.  The simplest, suitable for scenarios with limited contention, involves using a simple `while` loop and a shared flag. More complex scenarios, involving high contention, demand more robust mechanisms like condition variables or semaphores.  The choice hinges on the specifics of the application architecture and anticipated workload.

Using a shared flag requires careful consideration of memory visibility. Without appropriate memory barriers, changes to the flag might not be immediately visible to all threads, leading to the "spurious wakeup" problem.  Condition variables provide a more sophisticated solution, avoiding this issue.  Semaphores, while also capable, often introduce added overhead which might not be justified in less complex scenarios.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Shared Flag with Busy-Waiting (Simple, Less Efficient):**

```java
public class SharedFlagExample {

    private static volatile boolean prerequisiteComplete = false; // Volatile ensures visibility

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread prerequisiteTask = new Thread(() -> {
            // Simulate time-consuming task
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
            prerequisiteComplete = true; // Signal completion
        });

        Thread dependentTask = new Thread(() -> {
            while (!prerequisiteComplete) {
                // Busy-waiting: Inefficient, consumes CPU cycles
                Thread.onSpinWait(); // Added for clarity, JVM may optimize this away
            }
            System.out.println("Prerequisite task completed. Continuing...");
        });

        prerequisiteTask.start();
        dependentTask.start();
        prerequisiteTask.join(); // Wait for the prerequisite task to finish before exiting main
        dependentTask.join();
    }
}
```

This example utilizes a `volatile` boolean flag to signal completion.  The dependent task repeatedly checks the flag, exhibiting *busy-waiting*.  This approach is simple but highly inefficient for long-running prerequisite tasks as it consumes CPU resources unnecessarily.  The `volatile` keyword ensures that all threads see the most up-to-date value of `prerequisiteComplete`.  `Thread.onSpinWait()` hints to the JVM that it is in a spinlock, potentially improving performance on some architectures.  However, this remains fundamentally inefficient.

**Example 2: Condition Variable (Efficient, Robust):**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class ConditionVariableExample {

    private static Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private static Condition condition = lock.newCondition();
    private static boolean prerequisiteComplete = false;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread prerequisiteTask = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
            lock.lock();
            try {
                prerequisiteComplete = true;
                condition.signal(); // Signal the dependent task
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        });

        Thread dependentTask = new Thread(() -> {
            lock.lock();
            try {
                while (!prerequisiteComplete) {
                    condition.await(); // Efficiently wait until signaled
                }
                System.out.println("Prerequisite task completed. Continuing...");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        });

        prerequisiteTask.start();
        dependentTask.start();
        prerequisiteTask.join();
        dependentTask.join();
    }
}
```

This improved example uses a `Condition` object along with a `ReentrantLock`.  The `await()` method atomically releases the lock and blocks the thread until another thread calls `signal()`. This avoids busy-waiting and is significantly more efficient.  The `lock` ensures mutual exclusion when accessing the shared `prerequisiteComplete` variable.


**Example 3: CountDownLatch (Suitable for One-Time Synchronization):**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

public class CountDownLatchExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1); // Initialize with 1 count

        Thread prerequisiteTask = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
            latch.countDown(); // Decrement the count
        });

        Thread dependentTask = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                latch.await(); // Wait until count reaches 0
                System.out.println("Prerequisite task completed. Continuing...");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });

        prerequisiteTask.start();
        dependentTask.start();
        prerequisiteTask.join();
        dependentTask.join();
    }
}
```

`CountDownLatch` is particularly useful when a thread needs to wait for a single event.  It's initialized with a count, and the `countDown()` method decrements it.  `await()` blocks until the count reaches zero.  This provides a clean and efficient solution for this specific synchronization problem.  This approach is simpler to use than condition variables for one-time synchronization events but less flexible for more complex scenarios.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Java Concurrency in Practice" by Brian Goetz et al. offers an in-depth exploration of Java concurrency mechanisms.  Understanding the nuances of memory models is vital; consult the official Java documentation on memory consistency effects for a comprehensive explanation.  Finally, studying the design patterns related to concurrency is beneficial for creating well-structured and maintainable multithreaded applications.  Focusing on efficient synchronization primitives based on the complexity of the task is critical for building performant applications.  Carefully consider the context of each approach and choose the most suitable one to ensure efficient thread management.
