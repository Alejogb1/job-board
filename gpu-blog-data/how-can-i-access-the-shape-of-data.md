Determining the shape of data yielded by a Keras data generator requires a nuanced understanding of the generator's internal mechanics and the appropriate method for accessing its output.  My experience debugging complex deep learning pipelines has highlighted the frequent misunderstanding surrounding this seemingly simple task.  The core issue stems from the fact that a Keras data generator doesn't directly expose its data shape as a readily available attribute; instead, the shape is inherent to the data yielded during each iteration.

**1. Explanation:**

Keras data generators, such as `ImageDataGenerator` or custom generators built using Python's generator functions, are designed for efficient on-the-fly data augmentation and processing. They don't load the entire dataset into memory simultaneously.  Consequently, accessing the shape requires retrieving a sample batch of data and inspecting its dimensions.  Attempting to determine the shape before initiating the generator's iteration will fail because the data is generated dynamically during runtime.

This approach necessitates careful consideration of the generator's `__getitem__` method, which is fundamental to how Keras models interact with the data. The `__getitem__` method typically returns a tuple, where the first element is a NumPy array representing the input features (X), and the second element is a NumPy array representing the labels (y).  The shape of the input features is crucial for configuring the input layer of your Keras model.

The complete shape isn't necessarily constant. For example, using `ImageDataGenerator` with `flow_from_directory` yields batches of images whose shape is determined by the image size and the batch size specified during instantiation. In this case, the total number of samples is implied by the size of the directory and isn't explicitly available from the generator itself.  Custom generators require even more careful attention, as the shape is entirely dependent on the data loading and preprocessing logic implemented within the generator function.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Using `ImageDataGenerator`:**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
import numpy as np

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'path/to/your/training/directory',
    target_size=(150, 150),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='categorical'
)

# Access the shape of a single batch
x_batch, y_batch = next(train_generator)
print("Shape of input features (x_batch):", x_batch.shape)  # Output: (32, 150, 150, 3) - Assuming 3 color channels (RGB)
print("Shape of labels (y_batch):", y_batch.shape) # Output: (32, number_of_classes)

# Note:  This gives the shape of *one batch*; the total number of samples requires calculating from directory size.
```

This example illustrates how to obtain the shape of a single batch using `ImageDataGenerator`.  The `flow_from_directory` method conveniently handles data loading and augmentation. Remember that the first batch's shape is representative of subsequent batches, provided the image sizes and batch size remain constant.


**Example 2: Custom Generator:**

```python
import numpy as np

def my_generator(data, labels, batch_size):
    num_samples = len(data)
    while True:
        for i in range(0, num_samples, batch_size):
            batch_data = data[i:i + batch_size]
            batch_labels = labels[i:i + batch_size]
            yield batch_data, batch_labels

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  # Binary classification example

generator = my_generator(data, labels, batch_size=10)

# Access the shape
x_batch, y_batch = next(generator)
print("Shape of input features (x_batch):", x_batch.shape) # Output: (10,10)
print("Shape of labels (y_batch):", y_batch.shape) # Output: (10,)

```

This demonstrates obtaining the shape from a custom generator. The shape is determined by the structure of the input data within the generator's logic, highlighting the importance of consistent data formatting throughout the generator.  The total number of samples here is readily accessible through `len(data)`.


**Example 3:  Handling Variable-Length Sequences:**

```python
import numpy as np

def variable_length_generator(data, labels, batch_size):
    while True:
        batch_data = []
        batch_labels = []
        for _ in range(batch_size):
            # Simulate variable-length sequences
            seq_len = np.random.randint(5, 15)  # Random sequence length between 5 and 14
            sample_data = np.random.rand(seq_len, 10)  # Example feature vector shape
            sample_label = np.random.randint(0,2)
            batch_data.append(sample_data)
            batch_labels.append(sample_label)
        yield np.array(batch_data), np.array(batch_labels)

data = []  #  Dummy Data
labels = [] # Dummy Labels
generator = variable_length_generator(data,labels, batch_size = 32)

x_batch, y_batch = next(generator)
print("Shape of input features (x_batch):", x_batch.shape) # Output: (32, variable_length, 10) - Note the variable length dimension
print("Shape of labels (y_batch):", y_batch.shape) # Output: (32,)
```

This illustrates accessing shapes for variable-length sequences, a common scenario in natural language processing and time-series analysis.  Note that the shape will now include a variable dimension, demanding careful model configuration using techniques like padding or masking.  The total number of samples isn't directly available and would require tracking during data generation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Keras data generators, consult the official Keras documentation.  Furthermore, studying tutorials and examples on handling various data formats within Keras will solidify your comprehension of the underlying concepts.  Finally, exploring advanced techniques for data preprocessing and augmentation within Keras will improve the efficiency and robustness of your data pipelines.  These resources will provide detailed explanations and practical guidance for effectively managing data within Keras workflows.
