The interaction between multithreading and Java's `System.out.println()` (or, more accurately, the underlying `PrintStream` object) isn't straightforward; it's governed by the inherent nature of shared resources and the JVM's memory model.  My experience debugging concurrent logging systems in high-throughput financial trading applications illuminated this complexity.  Simply put, concurrent calls to `println` from multiple threads aren't guaranteed to produce output in the order the threads execute the calls. This is due to buffering and the lack of inherent synchronization within the `PrintStream` class.

**1.  Explanation:**

`System.out` is a static instance of `PrintStream`.  `PrintStream` uses an internal buffer to improve efficiency. This buffer accumulates output before flushing it to the console or underlying stream (e.g., a file). This buffering behavior is crucial in understanding the non-deterministic output observed when multiple threads concurrently use `println`.

When multiple threads call `println` simultaneously, each thread writes its output to the buffer independently.  The order in which these outputs appear in the buffer isn't guaranteed to be the order of the threads' calls.  The buffer's contents are only flushed to the standard output (or the designated stream) under specific conditions:

* **Automatic Flushing:**  Certain characters, such as newline characters (`\n`), may trigger an automatic flush. However, relying on this is fragile, as it depends on the specific content being printed.
* **Manual Flushing:** Explicitly calling `System.out.flush()` guarantees that the buffer's contents are immediately written to the output stream.
* **Closing the Stream:**  Closing the stream (though rarely done directly with `System.out`) will also flush any remaining buffered data.

The absence of inherent synchronization mechanisms within `PrintStream` means that race conditions can easily occur. One thread might be mid-write to the buffer while another attempts to write, leading to interleaved or corrupted output.  This is a classic shared resource problem. The JVM memory model further complicates this; the order of memory operations from different threads isn't always predictable without proper synchronization.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate the potential for unexpected output due to concurrent calls to `println`.


**Example 1:  Illustrating Interleaving**

```java
public class ConcurrentPrint1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: " + i);
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: " + i);
            }
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

The output of this program will likely be interleaved, demonstrating that the order of `println` calls from different threads isn't guaranteed.


**Example 2:  Introducing Manual Flushing**

```java
public class ConcurrentPrint2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.print("Thread 1: " + i);
                System.out.flush(); // Explicit flush after each print
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.print("Thread 2: " + i);
                System.out.flush(); // Explicit flush after each print
            }
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

By adding `System.out.flush()`, we force the output to be written immediately, reducing the likelihood of interleaving but still potentially resulting in a non-sequential output depending on thread scheduling.

**Example 3: Using a Synchronized Block**

```java
public class ConcurrentPrint3 {
    private static final Object lock = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                synchronized (lock) { // Synchronized block
                    System.out.println("Thread 1: " + i);
                }
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                synchronized (lock) { // Synchronized block
                    System.out.println("Thread 2: " + i);
                }
            }
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

This example uses a `synchronized` block to protect access to `System.out`.  Only one thread can enter the synchronized block at a time, ensuring sequential output.  This is the recommended approach for thread-safe logging in multithreaded environments.  However, it comes at the cost of performance due to the inherent blocking nature of synchronization.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the Java Concurrency in Practice book, the official Java documentation on the `PrintStream` class, and any comprehensive text on concurrent programming.   Understanding the Java Memory Model is also vital for grasping the intricacies of concurrent operations.  The concepts of race conditions, mutual exclusion, and synchronization primitives are essential knowledge in this context.
