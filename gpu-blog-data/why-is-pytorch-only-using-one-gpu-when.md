The root cause of PyTorch utilizing only a single GPU within a multi-GPU SLURM environment often stems from a mismatch between how PyTorch's data parallelism is configured and how SLURM allocates resources.  In my experience troubleshooting high-performance computing workflows, this issue frequently arises from a lack of explicit specification within the PyTorch code itself, rather than a problem with SLURM's resource allocation.  SLURM successfully provides the necessary hardware; the PyTorch application simply fails to leverage it.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

SLURM, a common workload manager, handles resource allocation by assigning nodes and cores (which often encompass GPUs) to a submitted job based on directives in the `sbatch` script.  However, this only allocates the resources; it doesn't automatically distribute the workload across them. PyTorch, in its default configuration, runs on the first available GPU if not explicitly instructed otherwise.  Therefore, even if your SLURM job is granted access to multiple GPUs, the PyTorch program might not utilize them because it lacks the necessary instructions for data parallelism.


To effectively use multiple GPUs in PyTorch, you must explicitly define the data parallel strategy.  This involves using PyTorch's `nn.DataParallel` or `nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` modules.  The choice depends on the complexity of your training workflow and communication requirements.  `nn.DataParallel` is simpler for a single-machine, multi-GPU setup; `nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` is better suited for multi-node, multi-GPU configurations, especially those involving more sophisticated communication patterns beyond simple data replication.  Failure to utilize one of these modules, or incorrectly configuring them, will result in only the default device being used.


Furthermore,  ensuring proper environment variables are set is critical.  The `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable dictates which GPUs PyTorch can see.  If not set correctly within your SLURM script, the wrong GPUs may be presented to PyTorch, leading to it utilizing a subset of available resources, or even a failure to launch.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1:  Incorrect Configuration (Single GPU Usage):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Model definition (example)
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Model instantiation
model = SimpleModel()

# Optimizer definition
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop (simplified)
for epoch in range(10):
    # ... training logic ...
    optimizer.step()

```

This example lacks any explicit instructions for multi-GPU usage.  PyTorch will default to using only a single GPU (usually the first one detected).


**Example 2:  Correct Configuration using `nn.DataParallel`:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Model definition (example)
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
  print("Let's use", torch.cuda.device_count(), "GPUs!")
  model = nn.DataParallel(SimpleModel().cuda())
else:
  model = SimpleModel().cuda()

# Optimizer definition
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop (simplified)
for epoch in range(10):
    # ... training logic ...
    optimizer.step()
```

This improved version checks the number of available GPUs. If more than one is present, it wraps the model in `nn.DataParallel`, enabling data parallelism across available GPUs.  Crucially, `.cuda()` is used to move the model to the GPU.  This approach is suitable for a single node with multiple GPUs.


**Example 3:  Correct Configuration using `nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.distributed as dist
import os

# ... other imports ...

def setup(rank, world_size):
    os.environ['MASTER_ADDR'] = 'localhost'
    os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '12355'
    dist.init_process_group("nccl", rank=rank, world_size=world_size)

def cleanup():
    dist.destroy_process_group()

# Model definition (example)
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    # ... (same as before) ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rank = int(os.environ['SLURM_PROCID'])
    world_size = int(os.environ['SLURM_NTASKS'])
    setup(rank, world_size)

    model = SimpleModel().cuda()
    model = nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(model)

    # Optimizer definition (same as before)
    # ... training loop ...
    cleanup()
```

This example utilizes `nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`, designed for multi-node or more complex multi-GPU scenarios.  It leverages the `SLURM_PROCID` and `SLURM_NTASKS` environment variables, typically available within a SLURM job, to configure the distributed training process correctly. This requires the `nccl` backend for efficient GPU communication.  The `setup` and `cleanup` functions handle the initialization and termination of the distributed process group.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation on data parallelism.  Reviewing the documentation on `nn.DataParallel` and `nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` is crucial for understanding their respective functionalities and limitations.  Understanding the intricacies of SLURM's job submission scripts and resource allocation mechanisms is also essential.  Finally, studying examples of properly configured SLURM scripts and PyTorch multi-GPU training scripts in repositories of publicly available deep learning projects can provide valuable insights.  The PyTorch tutorials and advanced usage guides often cover such topics in detail.  Thoroughly checking the logs produced by both SLURM and your PyTorch application is always helpful in diagnosing any issues.  These logs frequently offer critical information about resource allocation and program execution.
