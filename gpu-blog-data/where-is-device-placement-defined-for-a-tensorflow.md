The location of device placement specifications within a TensorFlow SavedModel's `pbtxt` representation isn't directly evident in a single, readily identifiable field.  My experience debugging distributed TensorFlow models has shown that the information is distributed across several protobufs within the SavedModel's internal structure, and its presence depends heavily on how the model was originally saved.  Directly examining the `pbtxt` for device assignments is therefore unreliable and often misleading.  Instead, a more robust approach involves understanding the underlying TensorFlow saving mechanisms and the information they preserve.

The core issue is that TensorFlow's saving mechanisms don't inherently store device placement as a readily accessible, centralized metadata item.  Instead, the process involves serializing the model's computational graph, and, depending on the saving method and `tf.compat.v1.Session` configuration used during the saving process, it may include implicit or explicit device placement information within the graph definition itself.  Explicit placement is rare in modern TensorFlow, unless specific constraints were set during model creation.

**1. Understanding TensorFlow's Saving Mechanisms and their Impact on Device Placement**

TensorFlow's saving mechanisms (using `tf.saved_model.save`) primarily focus on preserving the model's structure and weights, not the runtime environment details like device assignments.  In older TensorFlow versions (pre-2.x), using `tf.train.Saver` provided more control over what aspects of the session were saved, but even then device placement wasn't guaranteed to be included comprehensively. The resulting `SavedModel` primarily contains a graph representation (potentially with some hints about device allocation embedded within the node definitions) and the variable values.

When a model is saved with `tf.saved_model.save`, the resulting `pbtxt` files will contain a graph definition. The graph's nodes might contain device assignments if they were explicitly defined during the graph's construction.  However, the absence of such explicit assignments does not mean the model won't exhibit device placement behavior at runtime.  The TensorFlow runtime will often utilize heuristics and available hardware resources to dynamically assign operations to devices.

**2. Code Examples Demonstrating Different Scenarios**

The following examples illustrate various ways device placement could (or could not) be reflected in the SavedModel and the resulting `pbtxt`.

**Example 1: Implicit Device Placement (No Explicit Assignments)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
def my_model():
  x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0], name="input")
  y = tf.square(x, name="square")
  return y

# Build the model
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  output = my_model()
  sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

  # Save the model (no explicit device placement)
  tf.saved_model.simple_save(sess, "my_model_implicit", inputs={"input": tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[2])}, outputs={"output": output})

```
In this example, no explicit device assignments are made during the model's construction. The `pbtxt` files will likely not contain explicit device assignments within the nodes of the computational graph.  The runtime will determine device placement during execution.

**Example 2: Explicit Device Placement using `with tf.device`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_model():
  with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
      x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0], name="input_gpu")
      y = tf.square(x, name="square_gpu")
  return y

# Build the model
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    output = my_model()
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

    #Save the model with explicit device placement
    tf.saved_model.simple_save(sess, "my_model_explicit", inputs={"input": tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[2])}, outputs={"output": output})

```

Here, the `tf.device` context manager explicitly assigns operations to the GPU. The resulting `pbtxt` *might* reflect these assignments within the node definitions, but this isn't guaranteed across all TensorFlow versions.


**Example 3:  Using `tf.config.set_visible_devices` (No Explicit Assignment in Graph)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.config.set_visible_devices([], 'GPU') #Restrict to CPU

def my_model():
    x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0], name="input")
    y = tf.square(x, name="square")
    return y

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    output = my_model()
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

    #Save the model
    tf.saved_model.simple_save(sess, "my_model_cpu_only", inputs={"input": tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[2])}, outputs={"output": output})

```

This example demonstrates setting visible devices before model creation. This doesn't directly embed device placement in the graph; instead, it influences the runtime environment.  The `pbtxt` likely won't show explicit device placement, but the runtime behavior will be constrained by this configuration.


**3.  Resource Recommendations**

To thoroughly understand SavedModel internals and TensorFlow's graph definition, I would recommend studying the official TensorFlow documentation on saving and restoring models.  Furthermore, examining the source code of the `tf.saved_model` module itself provides invaluable insights.  Finally, exploring the TensorFlow protobuf definitions related to graphs and SavedModels (available in the TensorFlow source code repository) will provide a deep understanding of the underlying data structures.  These resources, combined with practical experience and careful experimentation with different saving methods, are vital for mastering this aspect of TensorFlow.  Paying close attention to the version of TensorFlow you are using is also critically important.


In conclusion,  device placement information in a TensorFlow SavedModel's `pbtxt` is not consistently or reliably stored in a single location.  Its presence depends significantly on how the model was constructed and saved.  Directly inspecting the `pbtxt` for device assignments can be misleading. Analyzing the model's execution behavior and understanding the model's construction process are far more reliable methods for determining the actual runtime device placement.
