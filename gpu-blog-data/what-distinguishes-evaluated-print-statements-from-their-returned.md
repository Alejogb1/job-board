The core distinction between an evaluated print statement and its returned value lies in the fundamental purpose of each: printing serves I/O operations, displaying information to a user or logging it to a file, while the returned value pertains to the computational result of an expression within the statement itself.  My experience optimizing high-throughput data processing pipelines heavily emphasized this distinction, as inefficient handling of print statements could significantly impact overall performance.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

Print statements, in most programming languages, are primarily designed for side effects.  Their primary function is to output data to a designated stream (typically the console, but potentially a file or network socket).  The evaluation of the expression within a print statement occurs, but the primary outcome isn't the result of that evaluation; it's the act of displaying that result.  The return value of a print statement, in languages like Python and C, is often implicitly `None` or a similar null value. This indicates the absence of a meaningful computational result beyond the performed I/O operation.

Conversely, a returned value represents the result of a computation.  Functions, expressions, and even individual statements (depending on the language) can produce a returned value.  This value carries computational significance and is typically intended to be used in further operations or passed to other parts of the program.  Consider a function calculating the factorial of a number: the primary purpose is the computed factorial, the returned value.  Any printing done within that function is a secondary effect, potentially useful for debugging or user feedback, but irrelevant to the core function's task.

The confusion arises because we often *see* the output of the print statement, and this output visually represents the result of an expression. However, this visual representation is a consequence of the I/O operation, not the intrinsic value the statement itself produces.  The key is to distinguish between the *action* (printing) and the *result* (returned value).  This distinction becomes paramount in situations where the printed output serves for human understanding (e.g., debugging) while a separate, returned value is needed for subsequent computations.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Python**

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        print("Reached base case: n = 0")  # Print statement, side effect
        return 1
    else:
        result = n * factorial(n-1)
        print(f"Factorial of {n} is: {result}") # Print statement, side effect
        return result

fact_5 = factorial(5)
print(f"The factorial of 5 (returned value): {fact_5}") # Accessing returned value
```

Here, the `print` statements provide informative output during the recursive calculation.  However, the actual result, the factorial, is obtained through the returned value of the `factorial` function, not from the print statements themselves.  The final `print` statement demonstrates the use of this returned value.


**Example 2: C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int square(int x) {
    int result = x * x;
    std::cout << "The square of " << x << " is: " << result << std::endl; // Output using cout (side effect)
    return result; //Returning the calculated value
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    int squared_num = square(num);
    std::cout << "The returned squared value is: " << squared_num << std::endl; // Using the returned value
    return 0;
}
```

Similar to the Python example, the `std::cout` statement displays the result, but the core value is what the `square` function *returns*. The `main` function demonstrates accessing and using this returned value, distinguishing it from the console output.


**Example 3: Java**

```java
public class PrintVsReturn {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        int sum = a + b;
        System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum); // Print statement, side effect
        return sum; // Returning the calculated sum
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = add(5, 3);
        System.out.println("The returned sum is: " + result); // Using the returned value
    }
}
```

This Java example mirrors the previous examples. The `add` method prints the sum as a side effect, but its crucial output is the `int` value returned, which is subsequently utilized in the `main` method.  The console output is distinct from the computational result.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of I/O operations, returned values, and function design, I recommend consulting a comprehensive textbook on your chosen programming language.  Study the sections on functions, return statements, and standard input/output libraries.  Focus on understanding the concepts of side effects and pure functions.  Additionally, exploring documentation specific to your language's standard library functions (e.g., `print` in Python, `std::cout` in C++) will be beneficial.  Finally, reviewing materials on program design and structured programming would solidify your understanding of how these concepts contribute to writing efficient and maintainable code.  This combined approach will provide a solid foundation.
