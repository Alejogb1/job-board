Optimization in R often involves minimizing or maximizing an objective function. When that function's value isn't directly calculated from parameters, but derived implicitly through a simulation or other procedure, we face a more intricate challenge. This indirect dependence demands specific strategies, differing significantly from scenarios where a closed-form objective function exists. I’ve encountered this frequently when modeling complex ecological systems where population dynamics respond to environmental parameters in a way not captured by a simple formula.

The core issue arises because standard optimization routines like `optim` assume the objective function, which we provide, directly returns a numeric result given an input vector of parameters. When dealing with implicit dependencies, our objective function instead calls another process, be it a differential equation solver, an agent-based model, or even a black-box function, the output of which then becomes the basis for our optimization. Consequently, we don’t have a gradient available to use, and gradient-based optimization methods become unsuitable. We must often turn to derivative-free optimization strategies.

Here, I'll detail techniques for this optimization, drawing from my experience.

Firstly, it's crucial to recognize the computational burden that comes with these types of optimization problems. Each evaluation of the objective function entails running the simulation or procedural computation, which can be expensive. We must carefully manage the number of times the simulation needs to execute. Secondly, the choice of optimizer is paramount. Methods like `optim` with `method = "Nelder-Mead"` or `method = "SANN"` are potential candidates, and the `optimx` package offers a wider selection of derivative-free algorithms. Additionally, specialized packages designed for complex simulation optimization, like `DEoptim`, which implements differential evolution, can be suitable.

Let's look at some code examples to clarify these concepts.

**Example 1: Simple Simulation, Nelder-Mead Optimization**

Consider a case where our objective function simulates the yield of a crop based on two input parameters, *water* and *fertilizer*. The simulation itself is a simple function that integrates these parameters, returning a numeric yield.

```R
# Simple simulation function
simulate_yield <- function(water, fertilizer) {
  # A simplified simulation function (replace with your complex simulation)
  yield <- 10 * water + 5 * fertilizer - 0.2 * water^2 - 0.1 * fertilizer^2 - 0.05 * water * fertilizer
  return(yield)
}

# Objective function that inverts the yield to minimize (e.g. minimize cost to reach target yield)
objective_function <- function(params, target_yield = 100) {
  water <- params[1]
  fertilizer <- params[2]
  yield_val <- simulate_yield(water, fertilizer)
  # Return the squared difference from the target (minimizing the squared distance)
  return((yield_val - target_yield)^2)
}


# Perform optimization using Nelder-Mead
initial_guess <- c(water = 5, fertilizer = 5)
optimization_result <- optim(par = initial_guess, fn = objective_function, method = "Nelder-Mead")

# Print results
print("Optimization Result (Nelder-Mead):")
print(optimization_result)
print("Optimal Water:", optimization_result$par[1])
print("Optimal Fertilizer:", optimization_result$par[2])
```

In this example, `simulate_yield` represents the underlying process that is not analytically tractable, or at least we are optimizing in the context of its execution rather than an explicit function.  The `objective_function` then runs that simulation, obtaining a yield value, and returns a value that relates that to the target yield; we aim to minimize this value which is the squared difference. We employ the `optim` function with the "Nelder-Mead" method, a derivative-free algorithm, to find the optimal water and fertilizer levels. Note the parameter *par* which takes an initial vector of starting points. The printout displays optimization details and the found parameters.  The complexity of `simulate_yield` can be readily expanded to include complex dynamic systems.

**Example 2:  Using DEoptim Package**

Differential evolution is often effective for high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex objective functions. Let’s expand on the yield example, introducing a slightly more complex simulator using a simple time step.

```R
library(DEoptim)

# More complex simulation with time steps
simulate_yield_time <- function(water, fertilizer, time_steps = 5) {
  yield <- 0
  current_water <- water
  current_fertilizer <- fertilizer

    for (i in 1:time_steps) {
        yield <- yield + 10 * current_water + 5 * current_fertilizer - 0.2 * current_water^2 - 0.1 * current_fertilizer^2 - 0.05 * current_water * current_fertilizer
        current_water <- current_water * 0.95
        current_fertilizer <- current_fertilizer * 0.95
    }

  return(yield)
}

objective_function_time <- function(params, target_yield = 100) {
  water <- params[1]
  fertilizer <- params[2]
  yield_val <- simulate_yield_time(water, fertilizer)
  return((yield_val - target_yield)^2)
}

# Define parameter bounds for DEoptim
lower_bounds <- c(0,0) # Bounds for water and fertilizer
upper_bounds <- c(20, 20)
# DEoptim setup

deoptim_result <- DEoptim(fn = objective_function_time,
                       lower = lower_bounds,
                       upper = upper_bounds,
                       control = DEoptim.control(itermax = 200))

# Print results
print("Optimization Result (DEoptim):")
print(deoptim_result)
print("Optimal Water:", deoptim_result$optim$bestmem[1])
print("Optimal Fertilizer:", deoptim_result$optim$bestmem[2])

```

Here we add a very basic time element to the simulator. The `DEoptim` function operates on a specified parameter space defined by `lower` and `upper`. The `control` argument can be used to specify settings for the differential evolution process.  Again, `objective_function_time` passes the parameter vector to the simulation and returns a value based on how close the simulation outcome was to the target. The best parameters are available as `deoptim_result$optim$bestmem`.

**Example 3: Using a third-party solver - an example with the 'nloptr' package.**
Sometimes, while implementing a complex model, you might want to leverage algorithms developed and maintained elsewhere. `nloptr` provides a framework for many different types of algorithms.

```R
library(nloptr)

# Function identical to example 1, not rewritten for clarity
simulate_yield <- function(water, fertilizer) {
  yield <- 10 * water + 5 * fertilizer - 0.2 * water^2 - 0.1 * fertilizer^2 - 0.05 * water * fertilizer
  return(yield)
}

objective_function <- function(params, target_yield = 100) {
  water <- params[1]
  fertilizer <- params[2]
  yield_val <- simulate_yield(water, fertilizer)
  return((yield_val - target_yield)^2)
}


# Initial guess same as above
initial_guess <- c(water = 5, fertilizer = 5)

# Define algorithm-specific settings

opts <- list( "algorithm" = "NLOPT_LN_BOBYQA", "xtol_rel" = 1e-7, "maxeval" = 200)


# Perform the optimization using nloptr
nlopt_result <- nloptr( x0= initial_guess,
                         eval_f = objective_function,
                         lb = c(0,0), #lower bound of parameters
                         ub = c(20,20), #upper bound of parameters
                         opts = opts)

# Print Results

print("Optimization Result (nloptr):")
print(nlopt_result)
print("Optimal Water:", nlopt_result$solution[1])
print("Optimal Fertilizer:", nlopt_result$solution[2])
```
The `nloptr` package calls external optimizers based on the libnlopt C library. We set up the `opts` list with an algorithm option `NLOPT_LN_BOBYQA`, and set some tolerance parameters. The output contains the final optimized values. Note that the output is different from the standard `optim`, it outputs result in `solution`, rather than `par`. Also note that we can define upper and lower bounds here, which may be helpful when the nature of the underlying process is better understood.  This is especially useful when we are trying to leverage algorithms external to R, which may have different strengths and weaknesses for different types of problems.

Choosing the right algorithm depends heavily on the characteristics of the objective function's behavior, such as its degree of convexity and dimensionality of the parameter space. It’s often a process of experimentation. There is no general “best” approach.

When facing such indirect dependencies, I suggest starting with Nelder-Mead due to its relative robustness and ease of use. Should performance prove inadequate, exploring other algorithms in the `optimx` or `DEoptim` packages would be appropriate. The `nloptr` package offers an alternative should particular algorithms from that library be suitable. Always remember that each objective function evaluation involves running the simulation; optimizing performance can be critical for computational efficiency. Carefully choosing starting parameters and exploring the bounds of plausible values in the simulation, also, are key steps to getting good results.

For further exploration, I recommend looking at optimization resources in the CRAN Task View on Optimization and Mathematical Programming, the documentation of the `optim`, `optimx`, and `DEoptim` packages, as well as resources pertaining to derivative-free methods in numerical optimization theory.  These will provide a more in-depth understanding of the concepts discussed and give further insight into the process.
