The root cause of errors stemming from the Keras `init` and `dim_ordering` keyword arguments often lies in version incompatibility and a misunderstanding of their evolution within the TensorFlow/Keras ecosystem.  My experience troubleshooting these issues across numerous projects, ranging from simple image classifiers to complex recurrent neural networks, points to this core problem.  `dim_ordering`, in particular, has been entirely deprecated, replaced by more robust and explicit handling of tensor shapes.  `init`, while still functional, requires careful consideration of the initializer's compatibility with the layer type and Keras version.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `init` argument, used in various Keras layer constructors (e.g., `Dense`, `Conv2D`), specifies the weight initialization method.  This initialization significantly influences the training process, affecting convergence speed and the risk of vanishing or exploding gradients.  Common initializers include `'uniform'`, `'normal'`, `'glorot_uniform'` (Xavier uniform), and `'glorot_normal'` (Xavier normal).  The choice depends on the activation function used in the layer.  For instance,  `'glorot_uniform'` is often preferred for layers with sigmoid or tanh activations, while He initializers are better suited for ReLU activations.  Incorrect initialization can lead to poor model performance or training instability.

The `dim_ordering` argument, once crucial for specifying the data format (channels-first or channels-last), is now obsolete.  This argument, which determined whether the channel dimension in convolutional layers came before or after spatial dimensions (e.g., `(channels, height, width)` vs. `(height, width, channels)`), caused numerous compatibility issues between different Keras versions and backends.  Modern Keras handles data formatting implicitly through the `input_shape` argument of the layer or by specifying the data format globally through TensorFlow settings.  Attempting to use `dim_ordering` in current Keras versions will invariably raise an error.

Errors associated with `init` typically manifest as unexpected training behavior, such as slow convergence, divergence, or consistently poor performance.  Errors associated with `dim_ordering` result in explicit `AttributeError` or `ValueError` exceptions, indicating the argument's deprecation.  The error messages will usually direct you towards using the `input_shape` parameter instead.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,), kernel_initializer='he_normal'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This example demonstrates the correct usage of `kernel_initializer` (the modern replacement for `init`). We're using `'he_normal'` (He normal initialization) which is appropriate for the ReLU activation in the first dense layer.  The `input_shape` explicitly defines the input data format.  Note that the `init` keyword is absent, it is replaced by the more descriptive `kernel_initializer`.  This is a crucial point to understand -  the parameter name has evolved for clarity.

**Example 2: Incorrect `dim_ordering` Usage (Illustrative of an error)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Conv2D

# This will raise an error in modern Keras versions
try:
    model = keras.Sequential([
        Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1), dim_ordering='th') #Error here
    ])
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")
```

This code snippet intentionally uses the deprecated `dim_ordering` argument, leading to an `AttributeError`.  The `try-except` block anticipates and catches this error, illustrating the typical error message structure.  The correct approach, as shown in the next example, is to define the `input_shape` correctly.  `dim_ordering`'s role is implicitly handled based on the `input_shape`'s order.


**Example 3: Correct Data Formatting without `dim_ordering`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Conv2D

model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1))
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This example achieves the same functionality as the previous convolutional layer without relying on `dim_ordering`. The `input_shape` parameter clearly defines the input tensor dimensions as (height, width, channels), implicitly setting the data format. This is the recommended and supported method in current Keras implementations.  This demonstrates the preferred, more explicit and robust method.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation.  The Keras documentation itself, focusing on layers and initializers.  A good introductory textbook on deep learning, covering weight initialization strategies.  A deep learning specialization or course focusing on practical implementation details.  Finally, review any TensorFlow/Keras version-specific release notes for further clarification on deprecations.



In conclusion, resolving errors related to `init` and `dim_ordering` requires understanding the evolution of Keras and TensorFlow.  Replacing `init` with the appropriate initializer (e.g., `kernel_initializer`, `bias_initializer`) and avoiding `dim_ordering` altogether by using the `input_shape` argument correctly are crucial steps in writing functional and compatible Keras code.  Careful attention to the interplay between initializers, activation functions, and data formatting will lead to robust and efficient neural network models.
