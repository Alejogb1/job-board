The `send_query` method of the Ruby `PG::Connection` class offers a low-level interface to PostgreSQL, bypassing the higher-level convenience methods provided by the gem.  This direct access is crucial for scenarios requiring precise control over query execution, particularly when dealing with complex queries, prepared statements needing parameterization beyond the `exec_params` method, or situations demanding asynchronous operation.  My experience integrating this into a high-throughput data pipeline underscored its importance for optimizing performance in critical sections.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

`send_query` sends a raw SQL query string directly to the PostgreSQL server.  Unlike methods like `exec` or `query`, it doesn't automatically parse the result set. Instead, it returns a `PG::Result` object.  This object contains raw data representing the query's outcome, but needs further processing to extract meaningful information.  The absence of automated result parsing makes it faster for large datasets but requires handling the `PG::Result` object meticulously.  Crucially, error handling must be explicitly managed;  exceptions are not automatically caught as they are in higher-level methods.  Understanding the structure of the `PG::Result` object is paramount.  It offers methods like `nfields`, `ntuples`, `field_name`, `getvalue`, and `to_a` which are essential for accessing column information and row data.  Proper use of these methods dictates whether you receive the query results as an array of arrays, a hash, or a custom data structure tailored to your needs.  Also note that `send_query` is distinct from `send_query_prepared`, which is used for executing prepared statements already declared on the server.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: Basic Query and Result Handling:**

```ruby
require 'pg'

begin
  conn = PG.connect(dbname: 'mydatabase', user: 'myuser', password: 'mypassword')
  res = conn.send_query("SELECT * FROM mytable;")

  if res.ntuples > 0
    res.fields.each_with_index do |field, i|
      puts "Column #{i+1}: #{field}"
    end
    puts "Rows Affected: #{res.ntuples}"
    res.tuples.each do |row|
      puts row.join(",") #Simple row output, adjust as needed.
    end
  else
    puts "No rows found."
  end

  res.clear  # Releases resources held by the PG::Result object

rescue PG::Error => e
  puts "Database error: #{e.message}"
ensure
  conn.close if conn
end
```

*This example demonstrates a simple `SELECT` query.  Error handling is explicitly included using a `begin...rescue...ensure` block.  The `res.clear` call is important to release resources held by the result object, especially during high-volume processing.  Notice the explicit handling of the `PG::Result` object's properties.*


**Example 2:  Handling Large Result Sets Efficiently:**

```ruby
require 'pg'

begin
  conn = PG.connect(dbname: 'mydatabase', user: 'myuser', password: 'mypassword')
  res = conn.send_query("SELECT id, value FROM large_table;")

  #Iterate through tuples efficiently, processing them one by one to avoid memory issues.
  res.each do |row|
      id = row[0]
      value = row[1]
      #Process individual rows (e.g., insert into another table, perform calculation etc).
      puts "Processing row: ID - #{id}, Value - #{value}"
  end

rescue PG::Error => e
  puts "Database error: #{e.message}"
ensure
  conn.close if conn
end
```

*This example shows a more efficient method for large result sets, avoiding loading the entire result set into memory at once.  This approach is critical for optimizing memory usage when working with very large tables.  The `each` method iterates through the `PG::Result` row-by-row.*


**Example 3: Prepared Statement with `send_query_prepared`:**

```ruby
require 'pg'

begin
  conn = PG.connect(dbname: 'mydatabase', user: 'myuser', password: 'mypassword')
  conn.prepare('my_prepared_statement', 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1')

  username_to_find = 'johndoe'
  res = conn.send_query_prepared('my_prepared_statement', [username_to_find])

  if res.ntuples > 0
      res.each do |row|
          #Process each row
          puts row.inspect
      end
  else
      puts "No user found."
  end

rescue PG::Error => e
  puts "Database error: #{e.message}"
ensure
  conn.close if conn
end

```

*This example demonstrates the use of `send_query_prepared`.  Note that a prepared statement `my_prepared_statement` must be declared before calling `send_query_prepared`.  This approach is valuable for repeated queries with varying parameters, improving performance by reducing query parsing overhead on the server.  The parameter `username_to_find` is passed as an array.*


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PostgreSQL documentation.  The Ruby pg gem's documentation.  A comprehensive guide on SQL and database design principles.  A text focusing on efficient database interaction techniques in Ruby.  A resource on exception handling and error management in Ruby.



My experience stems from building and maintaining a real-time analytics platform where efficient database interaction was paramount.  The scenarios described above reflect challenges I encountered and solved using `send_query` and `send_query_prepared`.  The judicious application of these methods, coupled with robust error handling and memory management, proved essential in achieving the required performance and stability.  Understanding the nuances of the `PG::Result` object and choosing the appropriate method (`send_query` or `send_query_prepared`) based on the specific query characteristics is key to successful implementation.
