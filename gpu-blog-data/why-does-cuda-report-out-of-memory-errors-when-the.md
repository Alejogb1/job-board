The discrepancy between perceived available GPU memory and CUDA’s out-of-memory errors often stems from a misunderstanding of how CUDA memory management interacts with both the GPU’s physical limitations and the CUDA runtime environment. Specifically, what I've observed over years of GPU programming is that seemingly sufficient memory, calculated purely based on a naive size of data structures, neglects several crucial factors. The issue isn't merely the bytes you intend to use, but also the overhead involved in managing memory on the device, CUDA's internal allocation behavior, and, particularly in a multi-GPU context, the memory fragmentation that can arise.

One prominent reason for this perceived discrepancy is CUDA's memory allocation strategy. CUDA doesn't simply grab a single contiguous block of memory equivalent to your requested size. Instead, it manages memory in chunks for efficiency, maintaining internal metadata, such as memory allocation tables, and also often employs memory caching mechanisms. This internal overhead can consume a notable portion of available GPU memory, reducing the amount available to the user. Moreover, small repeated allocation and deallocation cycles contribute to fragmentation, potentially leading to a situation where, although the total free memory is sufficient, no single contiguous block is large enough for your request.

Additionally, the concept of "available" memory is not static. A portion of the reported GPU memory is not directly usable by CUDA programs, as it's utilized by the GPU driver and other system processes. Furthermore, context switching and multi-GPU environments each pose unique challenges. In a multi-GPU environment, even if the total combined VRAM of all GPUs seems sufficient, a request to allocate memory on a *specific* device could fail due to that particular device having insufficient contiguous memory, despite overall plenty of available space. The interplay of device-specific resources with application memory needs is often overlooked in a single-device, naive calculation.

Finally, it is critical to consider the context in which the memory is being allocated. If one is creating multiple contexts concurrently across different threads, or if the host application itself is consuming device memory before CUDA is invoked, then one might encounter out of memory errors despite what would otherwise appear to be sufficient device memory. The state of the device from within the host process can often be a culprit when debugging memory allocation issues.

To illustrate this, let’s consider three code examples.

**Example 1: Simple Allocation and Fragmentation**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

void checkCudaError(cudaError_t error, const char* msg) {
  if (error != cudaSuccess) {
    std::cerr << "CUDA Error: " << msg << " - " << cudaGetErrorString(error) << std::endl;
    exit(1);
  }
}

int main() {
    cudaError_t error;
    const size_t small_size = 1024 * 1024 * 10; // 10 MB
    const size_t total_size = 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 2;  // 2GB - Assume this should be under the limit.
    float *d_ptr1, *d_ptr2, *d_ptr3;

    // Allocate a sequence of small chunks
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        error = cudaMalloc(&d_ptr1, small_size);
        checkCudaError(error, "Error allocating small chunk");
        error = cudaFree(d_ptr1);
        checkCudaError(error, "Error freeing small chunk");
    }

    // Try to allocate a large chunk at the end
    error = cudaMalloc(&d_ptr2, total_size);
    if (error != cudaSuccess) {
      checkCudaError(error, "Error allocating large final chunk.");
      std::cout << "Failed to allocate large memory block, indicating fragmentation." << std::endl;
    }
    else {
      std::cout << "Successfully allocated the large final chunk." << std::endl;
      cudaFree(d_ptr2);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
In this first example, we repeatedly allocate and deallocate small blocks of memory.  This demonstrates how the repeated allocation and deallocation will lead to memory fragmentation. Even though the total sum of allocated memory is far less than what the GPU reports is available, if the final allocation requires a contiguous block larger than available fragments, the request will fail. The error message might suggest an out-of-memory condition, not because the total memory is insufficient, but because no contiguous block of the required size exists. This shows that the CUDA runtime might be unable to find a single large region due to previous allocations even though the total amount of used memory is relatively low. The actual amount of "available" contiguous memory will vary depending on the pattern of prior allocation/deallocation.

**Example 2: Multi-GPU Device Specific Limitations**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

void checkCudaError(cudaError_t error, const char* msg) {
  if (error != cudaSuccess) {
    std::cerr << "CUDA Error: " << msg << " - " << cudaGetErrorString(error) << std::endl;
    exit(1);
  }
}

int main() {
    int num_devices;
    cudaError_t error;
    error = cudaGetDeviceCount(&num_devices);
    checkCudaError(error, "cudaGetDeviceCount failed");

    if (num_devices < 2) {
        std::cout << "This test requires at least 2 GPUs." << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }

    const size_t large_size = 1024 * 1024 * 1024; // 1 GB - Assume this is within single GPU limit
    float* d_ptr1, *d_ptr2;

    // Try allocation on device 0
    error = cudaSetDevice(0);
    checkCudaError(error, "Error setting device 0");
    error = cudaMalloc(&d_ptr1, large_size);
    checkCudaError(error, "Error allocating on device 0");

    // Try allocation on device 1
    error = cudaSetDevice(1);
    checkCudaError(error, "Error setting device 1");
    error = cudaMalloc(&d_ptr2, large_size);
    if(error != cudaSuccess)
        std::cout << "Device 1 failed to allocate memory. Check that device 1 has sufficient memory independently." << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << "Allocation successful on both devices" << std::endl;

    cudaFree(d_ptr1);
    cudaFree(d_ptr2);

    return 0;
}
```

This second example demonstrates how device-specific memory limits can be an issue in a multi-GPU system. Even if the total combined memory across all GPUs seems sufficient, a call to allocate on a specific GPU might fail if that GPU has already allocated a substantial amount of memory or has limitations due to other processes. The total memory available will not be the sum of memory across all devices, but rather, the available memory for each specific GPU. It illustrates the fact that a naive approach to adding all the memory and assuming they are all one resource will not work. The error message would not state "total system memory insufficient", but would point at device-specific issues.

**Example 3: Memory Usage by Driver and Runtime Context**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <vector>

void checkCudaError(cudaError_t error, const char* msg) {
  if (error != cudaSuccess) {
    std::cerr << "CUDA Error: " << msg << " - " << cudaGetErrorString(error) << std::endl;
    exit(1);
  }
}

int main() {
    cudaError_t error;
    const size_t large_size = 1024 * 1024 * 500; // 500 MB - Assume this should be OK
    std::vector<float> host_data(large_size/sizeof(float), 1.0f); // Use some host memory
    float *d_ptr1;

    // Pre-allocate host memory before CUDA operations
    std::cout << "Host memory allocated, now attempting CUDA allocation." << std::endl;
    error = cudaMalloc(&d_ptr1, large_size);
     if(error != cudaSuccess){
        checkCudaError(error, "Error allocating device memory.");
         std::cout << "The failure to allocate device memory might be attributed to driver or application memory usage.\n";
     }
    else{
         std::cout << "Device memory allocation successful despite host allocation prior." << std::endl;
        cudaFree(d_ptr1);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this final example, I demonstrate how host side applications and the driver influence the available memory. Before the call to `cudaMalloc`, a large vector is allocated on the host. This could influence the state of the device, and impact memory availability, depending on the driver, host system, and other processes. This example is meant to showcase that seemingly unrelated allocation on the host can have unintended consequences for CUDA applications due to the memory management of the driver and CUDA runtime. While not causing an error in this specific case, it highlights how prior activity of the host application and underlying system can affect GPU memory availability.

For further information, I suggest consulting resources like the official CUDA toolkit documentation, which details memory management APIs and best practices, including device memory fragmentation. Additionally, publications focused on high-performance computing using GPUs will provide more extensive insights into memory optimization and efficient resource usage. Finally, advanced CUDA programming courses often go into detail about the nuances of allocation and the impact of memory access patterns. These are valuable resources to fully grasp the intricacies of CUDA memory management. Careful planning of memory allocation, considering the overall system, and avoiding fragmented memory through strategic allocation patterns is paramount for reliable GPU application development.
