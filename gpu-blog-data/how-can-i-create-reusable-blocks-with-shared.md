The core challenge in creating reusable blocks with varying weights within a Keras model lies in effectively managing weight sharing and independent parameter updates.  Directly cloning layers will result in shared weights, negating the intended variation.  My experience building large-scale image recognition models highlighted this issue; I initially attempted cloning layers, but backpropagation consistently resulted in unexpected behavior, stemming from unintended weight synchronization. The solution requires leveraging Keras' functional API and carefully managing layer instantiation.


**1.  Clear Explanation**

The functional API in Keras allows for defining models as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).  This grants fine-grained control over layer instantiation and connection, crucial for our task.  We avoid cloning layers; instead, we instantiate each block separately.  To achieve distinct weights, we create independent instances of each layer within each block.  Weight sharing, when desired within a single block, is inherently managed by the layer's internal mechanisms (e.g., convolutional kernels sharing weights across spatial locations).  However, between blocks, weights remain independent.


To vary the weight *capacity* of the blocks (the "weight" in the question's title), we manipulate the number of filters in convolutional layers, the number of units in dense layers, or the size of recurrent layers. This changes the number of trainable parameters associated with each block, directly impacting its capacity to learn complex features.  This capacity alteration affects the model's overall expressiveness and computational cost.  Overly large blocks can lead to overfitting; overly small blocks might lead to underfitting.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Simple Convolutional Block with Variable Filter Count**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def convolutional_block(input_tensor, filters, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'):
  """
  Creates a convolutional block with specified number of filters.
  """
  x = keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, activation=activation, padding='same')(input_tensor)
  x = keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
  x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
  return x

# Instantiate blocks with different filter counts
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))  # Example input shape

block1 = convolutional_block(input_tensor, filters=32)
block2 = convolutional_block(input_tensor, filters=64)
block3 = convolutional_block(input_tensor, filters=128)

# Concatenate the outputs of the blocks (or use other strategies)
merged = keras.layers.concatenate([block1, block2, block3])

# Add a final classification layer
output = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(merged)  # Example 10-class classification

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output)
model.summary()

```

This example showcases how the `convolutional_block` function is reusable with different filter counts, generating blocks with varying weights and capacities.  The `filters` parameter directly controls the number of learned filters, and hence, the weight count.  The `concatenate` layer demonstrates a possible way to combine the outputs of these independently weighted blocks.  Other merging strategies like averaging or element-wise multiplication could also be implemented depending on the problem.


**Example 2: Recurrent Block with Variable Unit Count for Time Series**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def recurrent_block(input_tensor, units, return_sequences=True):
  """
  Creates a recurrent block (LSTM) with specified number of units.
  """
  x = keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=return_sequences)(input_tensor)
  x = keras.layers.Dropout(0.2)(x)  # Optional dropout for regularization
  return x

# Input shape for time series data (time steps, features)
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(100, 5))

block_a = recurrent_block(input_tensor, units=32)
block_b = recurrent_block(input_tensor, units=64)

#Sequential application of blocks.  Alternative: concatenate outputs.
merged = recurrent_block(block_a, units=16, return_sequences=False)
merged = keras.layers.concatenate([merged, recurrent_block(block_b, units=16, return_sequences=False)])


# Final dense layer
output = keras.layers.Dense(1)(merged)  # Regression example

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output)
model.summary()
```

This example demonstrates a reusable recurrent block (using LSTM, but could be adapted to GRU or other RNN variants) with variable unit counts. The `units` parameter directly affects the number of internal units and hence the model's capacity and weight count.  The example showcases both sequential and parallel usage of the block, merging the outputs at the end with a dense layer.  The `return_sequences` flag allows for flexible block chaining.


**Example 3:  Dense Block with Varying Layer Depth**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def dense_block(input_tensor, units_list):
    """
    Creates a dense block with a variable number of layers.
    """
    x = input_tensor
    for units in units_list:
        x = keras.layers.Dense(units, activation='relu')(x)
        x = keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    return x

# Input shape for a simple dataset
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(10,))

# Create blocks with varying depths
block1 = dense_block(input_tensor, units_list=[32]) #single-layer block
block2 = dense_block(input_tensor, units_list=[64, 32]) #two-layer block
block3 = dense_block(input_tensor, units_list=[128, 64, 32]) #three-layer block

#Combine blocks using average
averaged = keras.layers.Average()([block1,block2, block3])
output = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(averaged) # Binary classification example

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output)
model.summary()

```

Here, the `dense_block`'s capacity is controlled by the `units_list`, defining the number and size of dense layers within it.  This provides a means to create blocks with different depths and hence varying parameter counts. Note how the outputs of blocks are averaged, offering an alternative to concatenation.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

The Keras documentation provides comprehensive details on the functional API.   Familiarize yourself with the concepts of layer instantiation, model definition using `keras.Model`, and different layer merging techniques (concatenation, averaging, element-wise operations).  Further study of model architecture design principles will be beneficial for determining appropriate block sizes and merging strategies for specific tasks. A good understanding of backpropagation and gradient descent will aid in troubleshooting unexpected behavior during training.  Consulting textbooks on deep learning will provide valuable background knowledge.
