Median filtering's efficacy against adversarial examples stems from its inherent robustness to outliers.  Adversarial examples, by design, introduce small, carefully crafted perturbations to legitimate inputs, causing misclassification by a machine learning model.  These perturbations often manifest as outliers in the feature space.  Because the median is less sensitive to these extreme values compared to the mean, median filtering can effectively smooth out these adversarial perturbations, improving the model's resilience.  My experience developing robust image classification systems for autonomous vehicles heavily involved exploring this technique.

**1. Explanation of Median Filtering and its Application to Adversarial Example Mitigation:**

Median filtering is a non-linear digital signal processing technique that replaces each data point with the median of its neighboring data points within a defined window.  Unlike mean filtering, which is sensitive to outliers, the median is resistant to them.  In the context of adversarial examples, the "data points" are the pixel intensities in an image or features in a higher-dimensional feature space.  The adversarial perturbations, being localized and relatively small in magnitude, are treated as outliers by the median filter.  Consequently, the median filter effectively replaces these perturbed values with the more representative median value from the surrounding pixels or features, thus "cleaning" the input before it reaches the machine learning model.

The size of the filtering window is a crucial hyperparameter. A small window size may not effectively remove larger perturbations, while a large window size might blur important features, potentially reducing the model's accuracy on benign inputs.  Optimal window size selection often requires experimentation and validation on a dataset representative of the expected adversarial attacks.  Furthermore, the choice of applying median filtering in the pixel space versus a higher-dimensional feature space depends on the nature of the adversarial attack and the specific model architecture.  Applying it in the feature space after a feature extraction layer could be beneficial for some models.

It's important to understand that median filtering is not a panacea for all adversarial attacks.  Highly sophisticated attacks, such as those designed to evade specific filtering techniques, might still be effective.  However, it provides a relatively simple and computationally inexpensive defense mechanism that can significantly improve robustness against simpler, gradient-based attacks.  Combining median filtering with other defensive strategies is often a more effective approach.


**2. Code Examples:**

Here are three examples demonstrating median filtering in different contexts using Python and common libraries.  These examples are simplified for illustrative purposes and may require adjustments depending on the specific application and dataset.

**Example 1:  Median Filtering on a Grayscale Image using Scikit-image:**

```python
from skimage.io import imread, imsave
from skimage.filters import median

# Load the image
image = imread("input_image.png", as_gray=True)

# Apply median filtering with a 3x3 window
filtered_image = median(image, selem=np.ones((3, 3)))

# Save the filtered image
imsave("filtered_image.png", filtered_image)
```

This code utilizes `skimage`, a powerful image processing library. The `median` function applies a median filter with a specified structuring element (here, a 3x3 square). The `as_gray=True` argument ensures the image is processed as grayscale, simplifying the example.  Adapting this for color images would require processing each color channel separately.

**Example 2:  Median Filtering on a 1D Feature Vector using NumPy:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample 1D feature vector
feature_vector = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100, 6, 7, 8, 9])

# Apply median filtering with a window size of 3
window_size = 3
filtered_vector = np.convolve(feature_vector, np.ones(window_size), 'valid') / window_size

#Note: This is a moving average not a true median filter for 1D.  A proper median filter for 1D would require a different implementation.  This example simplifies for brevity.  A true 1D median filter would involve sorting each window.

#The following shows a true 1D median filter using scipy:

from scipy.signal import medfilt

filtered_vector = medfilt(feature_vector, kernel_size=3)

print(filtered_vector)
```

This example demonstrates median filtering on a 1D feature vector, which is a common scenario in time series analysis or other applications where features are represented as sequences. The use of `numpy.convolve` provides a simplified moving average; however a true median filter in 1D is shown utilizing `scipy.signal.medfilt`. The selection of a proper 1D median filter depends on the application and the libraries available.

**Example 3:  Median Filtering within a TensorFlow/Keras Model:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'model' is a pre-trained Keras model
# ... (model definition and training) ...

# Create a custom layer for median filtering
class MedianFilterLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, window_size, **kwargs):
        super(MedianFilterLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.window_size = window_size

    def call(self, x):
        # Implementation of median filtering using TensorFlow operations (requires careful design for efficient computation)
        #  ...  (implementation details omitted for brevity, but would involve reshaping and tf.contrib.image.median_filter) ...
        return filtered_x

# Add the median filter layer to the model
model.add(MedianFilterLayer(window_size=3))

# ... (rest of the model) ...
```

This example illustrates the integration of median filtering as a custom layer within a TensorFlow/Keras model.  This allows for applying the filtering directly to the intermediate feature representations within the model's architecture, providing a more integrated defense mechanism.  The implementation details of the `call` method are omitted for brevity, but would involve leveraging TensorFlow operations for efficient computation on tensors.  This approach is more complex but allows for tighter integration with the model's training process.
