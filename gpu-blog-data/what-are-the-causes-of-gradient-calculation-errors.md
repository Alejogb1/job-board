Gradient calculation errors in Keras, particularly when utilizing the TensorFlow backend, often stem from inconsistencies between the model's architecture, the loss function, and the data preprocessing pipeline.  My experience troubleshooting these issues over the past five years, working on large-scale image recognition and natural language processing projects, indicates that these errors frequently manifest as `NaN` (Not a Number) or `Inf` (Infinity) values during training, resulting in model instability or complete training failure.  This response will delineate the common causes and provide illustrative code examples.

**1. Numerical Instability Due to Loss Function and Activations:**

One primary cause is numerical instability arising from the interplay between the chosen loss function and activation functions within the model.  For instance, using a sigmoid activation in the output layer with binary cross-entropy loss can lead to vanishing gradients if the output values are consistently near 0 or 1.  This is because the derivative of the sigmoid function approaches zero at these extremes, effectively halting gradient descent.  Similarly, employing ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activations without careful consideration of potential zero gradients in deeper layers can prevent weight updates in parts of the network.  This problem becomes aggravated with architectures containing many layers.  The use of exponential functions within the loss function, especially when coupled with high learning rates, can also contribute to numerical overflow, leading to `Inf` values.

**2. Data Preprocessing and Scaling Issues:**

Incorrect data preprocessing is a frequently overlooked source of gradient calculation errors.  Features with significantly different scales can disrupt the gradient descent process.  Imagine a dataset where one feature ranges from 0 to 1, and another from 0 to 1000.  During backpropagation, the gradients associated with the larger-scale feature will dominate, potentially causing smaller-scale features to be ignored or leading to unstable weight updates.  Similarly, the presence of outliers in the dataset can significantly impact gradient calculations, introducing large gradients that disrupt the optimization process.  Failure to standardize or normalize the data appropriately, therefore, is a significant contributing factor.

**3. Architectural Issues and Custom Layers:**

Complex architectures or custom layers can introduce subtle errors in the automatic differentiation process performed by TensorFlow.  For example, poorly designed custom layers that fail to correctly compute gradients or that contain undefined operations can result in incorrect or undefined gradient values.  Similarly, issues within recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as vanishing or exploding gradients stemming from long sequences, often manifest as `NaN` or `Inf` values.  Incorrect implementation of backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithms in custom RNN layers can also contribute to these errors.  Furthermore, architectural choices such as incorrect connectivity between layers or improper dimensionality handling can lead to shape mismatches during gradient calculations, ultimately producing errors.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Vanishing Gradients with Sigmoid and Binary Cross-Entropy:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# This example demonstrates the potential for vanishing gradients.  
# If the data leads to consistently near 0 or 1 outputs from the sigmoid, 
# gradients will vanish and training will stall.
# Solution: Consider using a different activation (e.g., softmax with categorical cross-entropy)
#           or using batch normalization to stabilize activations.

# Data generation (replace with your actual data)
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

**Example 2: Data Scaling Issues:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# ... (model definition as in Example 1) ...

# Data generation with different scales
x_train = np.concatenate((np.random.rand(500, 5), 1000*np.random.rand(500,5)), axis=1)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 500)

# Scaling using StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
x_train = scaler.fit_transform(x_train)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# This example highlights the importance of data scaling.  Without scaling, the
# gradients from the larger-scale features will dominate, potentially causing issues.
# Solution: Always scale your features using techniques such as standardization 
#           or normalization before training.
```

**Example 3:  Custom Layer Error:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(10,10), initializer='random_normal')

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Incorrect gradient calculation:  Missing multiplication by inputs
        return tf.reduce_sum(self.w)  

model = keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# This example demonstrates a custom layer with an error. The call method doesn't properly
# incorporate inputs which can result in incorrect gradients and potential errors.
# Solution: Correctly implement the forward pass and define a corresponding backward pass (gradient computation) within the layer's call method.


model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Data generation (replace with your actual data)
x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)


model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```


**Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on custom layers and automatic differentiation, are invaluable.  Furthermore, a thorough understanding of numerical analysis and optimization techniques is crucial.  Books focusing on deep learning mathematics and the underlying algorithms of backpropagation will provide deeper insights.  Finally, reviewing the Keras and TensorFlow API references will aid in understanding the functionalities and potential pitfalls of specific functions and layers.
