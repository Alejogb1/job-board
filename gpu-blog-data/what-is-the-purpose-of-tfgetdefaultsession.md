The core functionality of `tf.get_default_session()` hinges on TensorFlow's session management.  Prior to TensorFlow 2.x, explicit session management was crucial;  `tf.get_default_session()` provided a convenient mechanism to access and interact with the currently active session, avoiding repeated instantiation.  My experience building large-scale NLP models in TensorFlow 1.x heavily relied on this function for efficient resource allocation and streamlined operations.  Understanding its purpose requires examining TensorFlow's execution model and the role of sessions within that model.

**1.  TensorFlow's Execution Model and the Need for Sessions:**

TensorFlow's computation is defined through a computational graph.  This graph represents the operations and the data flow between them.  However, the graph's definition is merely a blueprint; it doesn't perform any actual computation.  To execute the operations defined in the graph, a `Session` object is necessary.  A session allocates resources, manages the graph's execution, and provides access to the computed results.  It acts as a bridge between the symbolic representation of the computation and its concrete execution on a device (CPU or GPU).

Multiple sessions can coexist independently, each managing its own graph and resources. This capability is essential when dealing with multiple models or parallel computations.  However, managing multiple sessions explicitly can become cumbersome, particularly in large-scale projects where many operations might need access to the session.  This is where `tf.get_default_session()` plays a vital role.


**2.  The Role of `tf.get_default_session()`:**

`tf.get_default_session()` retrieves the currently active default session.  A default session is a globally accessible session that's automatically used if no session is explicitly passed to an operation or a Tensor's `eval()` method.  Setting a default session simplifies code by avoiding the explicit passing of session objects everywhere.  This is particularly useful in scenarios with many tensor operations or when interacting with parts of the codebase where the session object is not readily available or desirable to pass as an argument.

It's important to understand that `tf.get_default_session()` *returns* the existing default session; it does not create one.  If no default session exists, it returns `None`.  This behavior is crucial for error handling and avoiding unexpected behavior.


**3. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Utilizing the Default Session for Evaluation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Build a simple graph
a = tf.constant(10)
b = tf.constant(20)
c = tf.add(a, b)

# Set the default session (essential for tf1.x)
sess = tf.Session()
tf.compat.v1.keras.backend.set_session(sess)

# Evaluate 'c' using the default session; no explicit session needed.
result = c.eval()
print(f"Result: {result}") # Output: Result: 30

# Close the session when finished
sess.close()
```

This example showcases the convenience: evaluating `c` requires only `c.eval()`, relying implicitly on the default session set using `tf.compat.v1.keras.backend.set_session(sess)`.  This approach improves code readability.

**Example 2: Handling the Absence of a Default Session:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(15)
c = tf.multiply(a, b)

try:
    result = c.eval()
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except tf.errors.OpError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # Output: Error: ... (indicates no default session)


sess = tf.Session()
tf.compat.v1.keras.backend.set_session(sess)
result = c.eval()
print(f"Result after setting default session: {result}") # Output: Result: 75

sess.close()

```

This highlights robust error handling.  Attempting `c.eval()` without a default session results in an error; the `try...except` block gracefully handles this situation.  Subsequently establishing a default session allows for successful evaluation.

**Example 3:  Illustrating Multiple Sessions (Illustrative, for contrast):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Session 1
sess1 = tf.Session()
a1 = tf.constant(10, name='a1')
b1 = tf.constant(20, name='b1')
c1 = tf.add(a1,b1, name='c1')
result1 = sess1.run(c1)
print(f"Session 1 Result: {result1}") # Output: Session 1 Result: 30
sess1.close()


# Session 2 - independent session
sess2 = tf.Session()
a2 = tf.constant(30, name='a2')
b2 = tf.constant(40, name='b2')
c2 = tf.add(a2,b2, name='c2')
result2 = sess2.run(c2)
print(f"Session 2 Result: {result2}") #Output: Session 2 Result: 70
sess2.close()

```

This emphasizes the independent nature of multiple sessions.  `tf.get_default_session()` would only return one session at a time, preventing accidental cross-contamination between separate computational contexts.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's internals, I recommend thoroughly reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections covering computational graphs, session management, and the low-level API.  Further, consult advanced tutorials and books focusing on TensorFlow's architecture and its practical applications in building and deploying machine learning models.  These resources will provide a complete perspective on the intricacies of TensorFlow's execution model and the rationale behind the design choices related to session management.  The differences between TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2.x regarding session management should also be carefully studied, as TensorFlow 2.x largely automates these processes.
