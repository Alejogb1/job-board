The root cause of TensorFlow's failure to run within a 64-bit Python installation often stems from mismatched wheel files or inconsistencies in the underlying system dependencies, not necessarily a direct incompatibility between TensorFlow and 64-bit architecture.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, spanning embedded systems to large-scale cloud deployments, I've identified several recurring culprits.  The issue rarely lies in Python's 64-bit nature itself; instead, it points to discrepancies in the build environment or the installation process.

**1. Explanation:**

TensorFlow wheels are platform-specific.  A wheel built for a specific operating system, Python version, and architecture (e.g., Windows x64, Linux x86_64, macOS x86_64) will only function correctly within that exact environment. Attempting to install a wheel compiled for a different architecture (say, a 32-bit wheel on a 64-bit system) will invariably fail.  Further, even with the correct architecture, mismatches in underlying library versions (like NumPy, CUDA, or cuDNN) can result in runtime errors.  The Python interpreter itself being 64-bit is a necessary but not sufficient condition for successful TensorFlow operation.  The entire ecosystem – TensorFlow, its dependencies, and the system libraries – must be harmoniously configured.

Another common cause is a corrupted installation.  Incomplete downloads, interrupted installations, or conflicts with pre-existing libraries can render TensorFlow unusable despite seemingly correct installation commands.  Verification of successful installation and integrity checks are essential.  Finally, insufficient system resources (RAM, disk space, or processing power) can prevent TensorFlow from initializing correctly, even if all dependencies are seemingly in place.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Verifying Python and Pip Installation**

```python
import sys
import subprocess

print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
print(f"Python bitness: {sys.maxsize > 2**32}")  # True if 64-bit

try:
    subprocess.check_call(['pip', '--version'])
    print("pip is installed and working.")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("pip is not installed. Please install pip.")
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"pip encountered an error: {e}")

```

This code snippet serves as a preliminary diagnostic step. It confirms the Python version, checks if it's 64-bit, and verifies the installation and functionality of `pip`, the Python package installer. This is crucial because many TensorFlow installation issues originate from problems with `pip` itself or its configuration.  The `subprocess` module allows us to execute shell commands, providing a robust way to interact with the system's package manager.  Error handling is essential to provide informative feedback to the user.

**Example 2:  Checking TensorFlow Installation and Dependencies**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

try:
    print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
    print(f"NumPy version: {np.__version__}")
    # Perform a simple TensorFlow operation to test functionality.
    x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
    print(f"TensorFlow operation result: \n{tf.matmul(x, x)}")

except ImportError:
    print("TensorFlow is not installed or could not be imported. Ensure that TensorFlow is correctly installed and added to Python's PATH.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred during TensorFlow operation: {e}")

```

This code attempts to import TensorFlow and NumPy, printing their versions. A simple matrix multiplication operation is performed to verify TensorFlow's basic functionality.  Successful execution confirms that TensorFlow is installed correctly and can perform its core functions.  Import errors indicate installation or path issues, while runtime errors might reveal conflicts with dependencies or other problems.  This example leverages exception handling to provide specific error messages, aiding in the diagnostic process.

**Example 3:  Using a Virtual Environment for Isolation**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv  # Create a virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install tensorflow
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

This example demonstrates the creation and use of a virtual environment.  Virtual environments isolate project dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects.  This isolates the TensorFlow installation, reducing the chance of interference from other packages. The `--upgrade pip` ensures that we are using the latest version of the package manager, which often resolves compatibility issues.  Finally, we verify the successful installation by importing TensorFlow again. This approach is particularly useful for complex projects or when dealing with numerous libraries that might have conflicting dependencies.  Using `python -c` avoids the need for a separate Python file for this quick test.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the installation guides for your operating system and Python version.  The documentation for NumPy, CUDA, and cuDNN (if using a GPU-enabled TensorFlow installation).  A reputable Python package management tutorial and a guide to using virtual environments.  Consult the error messages meticulously; they often contain valuable clues about the underlying problem. Finally, engage the TensorFlow community forums; seasoned users often have encountered and resolved similar issues.  Thorough examination of the system logs can unveil subtle errors or warnings that escape immediate notice.
