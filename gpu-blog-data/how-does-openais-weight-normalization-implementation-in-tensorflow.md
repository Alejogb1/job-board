TensorFlow 1.4's weight normalization implementation, specifically the version championed by OpenAI, employed a clever pattern of variable naming and retrieval within its layer constructors to maintain a distinction between the trainable weight (`v`) and its normalized version (`g`), along with the corresponding normalization factor. This separation was crucial for allowing backpropagation to target only `v`, rather than the full normalized weight. From my experience building several large-scale models circa 2017-2018, getting this right was paramount for stable training, especially for recurrent networks and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

The fundamental principle is to introduce two distinct variables for each weight that requires normalization: a raw, unnormalized parameter (`v`), which is the actual trainable variable, and a scalar parameter (`g`), which acts as a scaling factor. The weight used in the computation, let's call it `w`, is then derived from `v` and `g` using the expression `w = g * v / ||v||`, where `||v||` represents the Euclidean norm of `v`. This explicit calculation within the TensorFlow graph is where the retrieval strategy becomes important. The core challenge lies in consistently accessing the correct `v` and `g` variables during each forward pass without accidentally accessing the derived `w` or unintentionally creating new variables with the same names.

The strategy relies on TensorFlow's variable scopes and carefully crafted `tf.get_variable` calls. Within the layer's constructor, typically a custom class inheriting from `tf.layers.Layer` or a similar structure, the variables `v` and `g` are created inside a specific variable scope, which acts like a namespace for variables. When the layer is reused, or when backpropagation needs to access `v` to adjust it, the same scope must be entered and `tf.get_variable` called with the same name to retrieve the existing variable rather than creating a new one.

To avoid confusion, `w`, the normalized weight, isn't created as a variable but is computed within the layer's `call` method. This ensures itâ€™s a calculated result of `v` and `g`, derived on every forward pass. This distinction is vital for proper gradient flow. Backpropagation only targets `v` and `g`, the trainable variables, allowing updates to directly influence the raw, unnormalized weight and its scaling factor.

Here are three code examples illustrating different facets of this variable retrieval in a simplified form:

**Example 1: Basic Weight Normalization in a Fully Connected Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class WeightNormDense(tf.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, activation=None, use_bias=True, **kwargs):
        super(WeightNormDense, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.activation = activation
        self.use_bias = use_bias

    def build(self, input_shape):
        input_dim = input_shape[-1].value # using .value for TF 1.x
        with tf.variable_scope("weight_norm", reuse=tf.AUTO_REUSE): # reusing variables in the scope.
            self.v = tf.get_variable("v", [input_dim, self.units], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer(stddev=0.01))
            self.g = tf.get_variable("g", [], initializer=tf.constant_initializer(1.0))
            if self.use_bias:
              self.bias = tf.get_variable("bias", [self.units], initializer=tf.zeros_initializer())
        self.built = True

    def call(self, inputs):
        v_norm = tf.norm(self.v, axis=0, keepdims=True) # normalizing the 'v' matrix per output dimension.
        w = self.g * self.v / v_norm # calculating the normalized weights.
        output = tf.matmul(inputs, w)
        if self.use_bias:
            output = tf.nn.bias_add(output, self.bias)
        if self.activation:
            output = self.activation(output)
        return output


input_tensor = tf.random_normal([10, 5])
layer = WeightNormDense(units=3, activation=tf.nn.relu) # using ReLU activation for the example.
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor) # retrieving the normalized weight through the call method.

trainable_variables = tf.trainable_variables() # all trainable variables in this scope.

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    output_val, variables = sess.run([output_tensor, trainable_variables])
    print("Output Tensor Shape:", output_val.shape)
    print("Trainable Variables:", variables)

```
In this example, `tf.variable_scope("weight_norm", reuse=tf.AUTO_REUSE)` ensures that variables with the names 'v' and 'g' are created on the first call and reused on subsequent calls. `reuse=tf.AUTO_REUSE` makes it compatible with variable creation in different scopes. The normalized weight `w` is dynamically calculated during the `call` method rather than being stored as a variable. `tf.trainable_variables()` confirms that the trainable vars `v`, `g` and `bias` are correctly registered.

**Example 2:  Weight Normalization in a Convolutional Layer**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

class WeightNormConv2D(tf.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, filters, kernel_size, strides=(1, 1), padding='SAME', activation=None, use_bias=True, **kwargs):
        super(WeightNormConv2D, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.filters = filters
        self.kernel_size = kernel_size
        self.strides = strides
        self.padding = padding
        self.activation = activation
        self.use_bias = use_bias

    def build(self, input_shape):
        input_filters = input_shape[-1].value # using .value for TF 1.x
        kernel_shape = [*self.kernel_size, input_filters, self.filters] # kernel with input and output channels.
        with tf.variable_scope("weight_norm_conv", reuse=tf.AUTO_REUSE):
            self.v = tf.get_variable("v", kernel_shape, initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer(stddev=0.01))
            self.g = tf.get_variable("g", [], initializer=tf.constant_initializer(1.0))
            if self.use_bias:
               self.bias = tf.get_variable("bias", [self.filters], initializer=tf.zeros_initializer())
        self.built = True

    def call(self, inputs):
        v_norm = tf.norm(tf.reshape(self.v, [-1, self.filters]), axis=0, keepdims=True) # normalizing the kernel, preserving output dimensions.
        w = self.g * self.v / v_norm  # calculating the normalized kernels.
        output = tf.nn.conv2d(inputs, w, strides=[1, *self.strides, 1], padding=self.padding)
        if self.use_bias:
            output = tf.nn.bias_add(output, self.bias)
        if self.activation:
            output = self.activation(output)
        return output

input_tensor = tf.random_normal([1, 32, 32, 3]) # example 32x32 RGB image as input
layer = WeightNormConv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation=tf.nn.relu) # using relu for example.
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)

trainable_variables = tf.trainable_variables()

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    output_val, variables = sess.run([output_tensor, trainable_variables])
    print("Output Tensor Shape:", output_val.shape)
    print("Trainable Variables:", variables)

```

Here, weight normalization is applied to a convolutional kernel. The key difference is that we normalize the convolutional kernel based on each output channel (`filters`), which involves reshaping and computing the norm correctly. The rest of the pattern remains consistent, reinforcing the importance of scope and variable retrieval using `tf.get_variable`.

**Example 3:  Using Weight Normalization in an RNN Layer**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class WeightNormRNNCell(tf.nn.rnn_cell.RNNCell):
    def __init__(self, num_units, activation=None, reuse=None):
        super(WeightNormRNNCell, self).__init__(_reuse=reuse)
        self._num_units = num_units
        self.activation = activation or tf.nn.tanh

    @property
    def state_size(self):
        return self._num_units

    @property
    def output_size(self):
        return self._num_units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        input_dim = input_shape[-1].value # using .value for TF 1.x

        with tf.variable_scope("weight_norm_rnn", reuse=tf.AUTO_REUSE): # variable scope for the cells
          self.w_v = tf.get_variable("w_v", [input_dim + self._num_units, self._num_units], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer(stddev=0.01))
          self.w_g = tf.get_variable("w_g", [], initializer=tf.constant_initializer(1.0))
          self.b = tf.get_variable("bias", [self._num_units], initializer=tf.zeros_initializer())
        self.built = True


    def call(self, inputs, state):
        with tf.variable_scope("weight_norm_rnn", reuse=tf.AUTO_REUSE):
            concat = tf.concat([inputs, state], axis=1) # combining the inputs and previous state.
            w_v_norm = tf.norm(self.w_v, axis=0, keepdims=True) # normalizing the 'w_v' matrix.
            w = self.w_g * self.w_v / w_v_norm # normalized weight calculation.
            output = tf.matmul(concat, w) + self.b
            output = self.activation(output)
        return output, output



input_tensor = tf.random_normal([1, 10, 5]) # example sequence
cell = WeightNormRNNCell(num_units=3, activation=tf.nn.relu) # using relu activation for the example.
outputs, last_state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell, input_tensor, dtype=tf.float32)

trainable_variables = tf.trainable_variables()

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    output_val, variables = sess.run([outputs, trainable_variables])
    print("Output Tensor Shape:", output_val.shape)
    print("Trainable Variables:", variables)

```
This example incorporates weight normalization into an RNN cell. Within the cell's `call` method, the previous hidden state and input are concatenated, the normalized weight `w` is computed and the new state is calculated. Once again, the variables `w_v`, `w_g` and `b` are retrieved within the "weight_norm_rnn" scope. Notice that the same scope is used in both the `build` and the `call` methods.

In summary, consistent variable scope naming and utilization of `tf.get_variable` are paramount for maintaining the proper differentiation between the trainable `v` and `g` and the normalized weight `w` in weight normalization. By computing the normalized weight within the `call` function instead of storing it as a variable, TensorFlowâ€™s gradient backpropagation will correctly update only the trainable `v` and `g` parameters.

For further study, I recommend reviewing the TensorFlow documentation related to variable scopes, the `tf.get_variable` function and custom layer creation.  Examining the implementation of recurrent layers within the `tf.nn` or `tf.keras` API, especially concerning how they manage weight tensors and cell operations, would provide additional context. Finally, examining example implementations of weight normalization found in public repositories (e.g. those pertaining to GANs or recurrent models) would prove invaluable.
