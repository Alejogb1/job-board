The efficient utilization of multiple GPUs within PyTorch's Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) functionalities presents a nuanced challenge, particularly when moving beyond data parallelism. While `torch.fft` itself isn't inherently designed for direct multi-GPU execution in the way that, say, data-parallel training is, strategies exist to leverage multiple devices, often involving data partitioning and manual management. I've encountered this limitation during the development of a real-time radio astronomy signal processing pipeline where near-instantaneous FFT computations on multi-dimensional arrays were paramount.

The primary constraint stems from how `torch.fft` implements its underlying algorithms. These are generally optimized for single-device performance, leveraging cuFFT or similar libraries. These libraries are, by their design, inherently tied to a single GPU context. Therefore, direct invocation of `torch.fft` across multiple GPUs via naive approaches will not result in parallel processing on distinct datasets or distinct portions of the same dataset. Attempting to use a straightforward `model.to(device)` approach, as one would with a neural network, will simply transfer the entire dataset and operation to a single designated GPU. This effectively bottlenecks the process, negating the benefits of a multi-GPU setup.

To circumvent this, the solution rests on manually partitioning the input data across multiple GPUs and subsequently recombining the results. This entails a number of specific steps: 1) data must be divided, 2) each partition needs to be moved to its designated device, 3) the FFT must be executed on each device, and 4) the resulting output partitions must be gathered and potentially reordered.

Here's how one might approach this scenario programmatically, using a hypothetical 2D complex input:

```python
import torch
import torch.fft as fft
from typing import List

def parallel_fft2d(input_tensor: torch.Tensor, devices: List[torch.device]) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Performs a 2D FFT on an input tensor, distributing the computation across multiple devices.

    Args:
        input_tensor: A 2D tensor representing complex data.
        devices: A list of torch.device objects, specifying target GPUs.

    Returns:
        A tensor representing the result of the 2D FFT across all devices.
    """
    num_devices = len(devices)
    batch_size = input_tensor.shape[0]
    partition_size = batch_size // num_devices

    if batch_size % num_devices != 0:
      raise ValueError("Batch size must be divisible by the number of devices.")

    output_parts = []

    for i, device in enumerate(devices):
        start_index = i * partition_size
        end_index = start_index + partition_size
        partition = input_tensor[start_index:end_index].to(device)
        fft_part = fft.fft2(partition)
        output_parts.append(fft_part.cpu()) # Bring results back to CPU for assembly

    output_tensor = torch.cat(output_parts, dim=0)
    return output_tensor

# Example Usage:
input_data = torch.randn(16, 256, 256, dtype=torch.complex64) # Complex input
devices = [torch.device("cuda:0"), torch.device("cuda:1")]
output = parallel_fft2d(input_data, devices)

print(f"Input Shape: {input_data.shape}, Output Shape: {output.shape}")
```

In this first example, `parallel_fft2d` handles the data partitioning along the batch dimension (dimension 0), assuming the FFT is to be applied independently across each sample in the batch. Each device processes an equal portion of the batch, and subsequently, the results are gathered and concatenated back on the CPU. The use of `.cpu()` after each FFT operation is critical for proper aggregation, as the `cat` operation generally works best with CPU tensors. A common pitfall here is attempting to concatenate tensors remaining on the GPUs without careful memory management, potentially leading to out-of-memory errors and unpredictable behavior.

The above example works well if the data is independent across the partitioning dimension. However, for certain applications, we need to partition along the dimensions upon which the FFT is performed. Imagine, for instance, we want to perform a 1D FFT but are constrained by memory limitations on a single GPU. We might want to split the computation along the frequency domain, distributing different frequency bins to separate devices. The next example demonstrates a simplified version of this concept, splitting the transform along the final dimension, and then re-assembling on the CPU.

```python
def parallel_fft1d_frequency_partitioning(input_tensor: torch.Tensor, devices: List[torch.device]) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Performs a 1D FFT on an input tensor, partitioning the frequency domain across multiple devices.

    Args:
        input_tensor: A 1D tensor representing complex data.
        devices: A list of torch.device objects, specifying target GPUs.

    Returns:
       A tensor representing the result of the 1D FFT across all devices.
    """
    num_devices = len(devices)
    fft_length = input_tensor.shape[-1]
    partition_size = fft_length // num_devices

    if fft_length % num_devices != 0:
      raise ValueError("FFT length must be divisible by the number of devices.")

    output_parts = []

    for i, device in enumerate(devices):
      start_index = i * partition_size
      end_index = start_index + partition_size
      partition = input_tensor.to(device)
      fft_result = fft.fft(partition)
      output_parts.append(fft_result[..., start_index:end_index].cpu())

    output_tensor = torch.cat(output_parts, dim=-1)
    return output_tensor

# Example Usage:
input_data_freq = torch.randn(256, 2048, dtype=torch.complex64) # Complex input
devices = [torch.device("cuda:0"), torch.device("cuda:1")]
output_freq = parallel_fft1d_frequency_partitioning(input_data_freq, devices)

print(f"Input Shape: {input_data_freq.shape}, Output Shape: {output_freq.shape}")
```

Here, instead of partitioning the batch, we perform the FFT on the entire input on each GPU, but then partition the *result* across each device to only keep the relevant part for that device. Finally, these are concatenated along the last dimension. This approach is more memory efficient if the entire input cannot be held on a single GPU but does involve redundant computation. Note that it's important to account for the implicit ordering of frequencies resulting from `torch.fft`, and potentially apply permutation operations if a specific frequency ordering is required.

Finally, a more complex case might require a combination of batch partitioning and partitioning across the frequency domain. This is common when dealing with multi-dimensional FFTs of large tensors, where both batch and memory limitations must be taken into account. A full, completely generic implementation of this is highly dependent on specific applications; nonetheless the basic principle of sub-dividing computations and carefully managing the data transfers remains central. Here's an outline of how that might be done for a 2D transform, which combines aspects from previous examples, with a focus on how to distribute along both spatial and frequency dimensions in a simple case:

```python
def parallel_fft2d_combined(input_tensor: torch.Tensor, devices: List[torch.device]) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Performs a 2D FFT on an input tensor, partitioning along both batch and frequency dimensions.

    Args:
        input_tensor: A 3D tensor of complex data.
        devices: A list of torch.device objects, specifying target GPUs.

    Returns:
       A tensor representing the result of the 2D FFT across all devices.
    """

    num_devices = len(devices)
    batch_size = input_tensor.shape[0]
    fft_length_x = input_tensor.shape[-2]
    fft_length_y = input_tensor.shape[-1]

    if batch_size % num_devices != 0:
      raise ValueError("Batch size must be divisible by the number of devices.")

    if fft_length_x % 2 != 0: # simplifying by dividing along only one dim
      raise ValueError("FFT length x must be divisible by 2 for simplicity")


    partition_size_batch = batch_size // num_devices
    partition_size_freq = fft_length_x // 2 # Partition the X frequency output

    output_parts = []

    for i, device in enumerate(devices):

        start_index_batch = i * partition_size_batch
        end_index_batch = start_index_batch + partition_size_batch

        partition = input_tensor[start_index_batch:end_index_batch].to(device)
        fft_result = fft.fft2(partition)

        output_parts.append(fft_result[..., :partition_size_freq, :].cpu()) # Partition frequency on x, return results to cpu
        output_parts.append(fft_result[..., partition_size_freq:, :].cpu()) # partition frequency on x, return to cpu

    # Reassemble across batch and then frequency
    full_output_x = torch.cat(output_parts[::2], dim = 0) # even indices correspond to split on first half of freq range
    full_output_y = torch.cat(output_parts[1::2], dim = 0) # odd indices, second half
    output_tensor = torch.cat((full_output_x, full_output_y), dim = -2)

    return output_tensor

# Example usage
input_data_combined = torch.randn(16, 512, 512, dtype=torch.complex64)
devices = [torch.device("cuda:0"), torch.device("cuda:1")]
output_combined = parallel_fft2d_combined(input_data_combined, devices)
print(f"Input Shape: {input_data_combined.shape}, Output Shape: {output_combined.shape}")

```

This demonstrates a combination strategy, where the input is divided across GPUs by batch, and then the output of the FFT on each GPU is split along the spatial (X) dimension, such that they can then be recombined. Note the care required to maintain the correct frequency ordering when recombining.

For additional study, several resources can help develop a better understanding. Explore literature on distributed computing for general strategies applicable to parallel processing, and specifically, investigate advanced cuFFT and similar libraries as part of CUDA documentation. Resources on parallel numerical algorithms can provide context on the underlying mathematics, and reading PyTorch's official documentation for data parallelism and tensor operations is essential. Finally, articles and online courses covering high performance computing offer critical perspectives for scaling applications to multiple GPUs.
