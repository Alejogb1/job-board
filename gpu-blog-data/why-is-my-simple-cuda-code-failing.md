The most common reason for CUDA code failure, particularly in seemingly simple kernels, stems from improper memory management or synchronization.  In my years working on high-performance computing projects, ranging from fluid dynamics simulations to image processing pipelines, I've observed that neglecting these fundamental aspects consistently leads to unexpected behavior, including segmentation faults, incorrect results, and performance bottlenecks far removed from the initial error.  Let's delve into the potential causes and illustrate them with code examples.

**1.  Incorrect Memory Allocation and Copying:**

CUDA kernels operate on data residing in device memory.  Failing to properly allocate sufficient memory on the device or transferring data correctly between host (CPU) and device (GPU) memory is a primary source of errors.  Insufficient allocation can lead to out-of-bounds accesses and segmentation faults.  Incorrect data transfer can result in the kernel operating on stale or corrupted data, leading to incorrect computations.  Furthermore, neglecting to free device memory after use introduces memory leaks, gradually degrading performance and ultimately causing program termination.

**Code Example 1: Incorrect Memory Allocation and Copying**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void addKernel(const int *a, const int *b, int *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  int *a_h, *b_h, *c_h;
  int *a_d, *b_d, *c_d;

  // Host memory allocation - correct
  a_h = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  b_h = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  c_h = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

  // Initialize host arrays (omitted for brevity)

  // Device memory allocation - INCORRECT: Only allocates space for n/2 integers
  cudaMalloc((void**)&a_d, n/2 * sizeof(int));  
  cudaMalloc((void**)&b_d, n * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&c_d, n * sizeof(int));

  // Data transfer - only copies half of a_h to a_d
  cudaMemcpy(a_d, a_h, n/2 * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(b_d, b_h, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // Kernel launch (will likely cause out-of-bounds access)
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  addKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(a_d, b_d, c_d, n);

  //Error Handling omitted for brevity, but crucial in real-world applications


  cudaMemcpy(c_h, c_d, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);


  // Free host memory
  free(a_h);
  free(b_h);
  free(c_h);

  // Free device memory -  Missing cudaFree(a_d); cudaFree(b_d); cudaFree(c_d); leading to memory leaks


  return 0;
}
```
This example demonstrates a critical error: insufficient memory allocation for `a_d` and a failure to copy the entire array.  The kernel will attempt to access memory it doesn't own, resulting in unpredictable behavior, likely a segmentation fault.  The absence of error checking and memory deallocation further exacerbates the problem.


**2.  Lack of Proper Synchronization:**

In scenarios involving multiple threads or blocks, ensuring proper synchronization is vital.  If threads access and modify shared data without synchronization, race conditions can arise, leading to incorrect results.  CUDA provides mechanisms like atomic operations and barriers to manage this.  Neglecting synchronization often manifests as inconsistent or unpredictable output.


**Code Example 2: Race Condition due to Lack of Synchronization**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void incrementSharedVariable(int *shared, int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    // Race condition here: multiple threads incrementing shared[0] concurrently
    shared[0]++;
  }
}


int main() {
  int *shared_d;
  int n = 1024;
  cudaMalloc((void**)&shared_d, sizeof(int));
  //Initialize shared_d to 0 (omitted for brevity)
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  incrementSharedVariable<<<blocksPerGrid,threadsPerBlock>>>(shared_d, n);

  //Retrieve results (omitted for brevity)

  cudaFree(shared_d);
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, multiple threads concurrently increment `shared[0]`.  Without synchronization, the final value will be less than `n * n`, reflecting the race condition. Using atomic operations or adding appropriate barriers would resolve this.

**3.  Incorrect Kernel Configuration:**

The kernel launch parameters (grid and block dimensions) must be carefully chosen to effectively utilize the GPU's resources and avoid issues.  Insufficient or excessive threads can negatively impact performance and potentially cause errors.   Furthermore, incorrect use of shared memory, if utilized, could cause bank conflicts and severely impede performance.


**Code Example 3: Incorrect Kernel Configuration & Shared Memory Bank Conflicts**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int n) {
  __shared__ float shared_a[256];
  __shared__ float shared_b[256];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    shared_a[threadIdx.x] = a[i];
    shared_b[threadIdx.x] = b[i];
    __syncthreads(); // Synchronize before accessing shared memory
    c[i] = shared_a[threadIdx.x] + shared_b[threadIdx.x];
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation and data transfer omitted) ...
  // Incorrect configuration:  Using a block size that is not a power of two
  int threadsPerBlock = 255; // Incorrect - causes bank conflicts in shared memory
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(a_d, b_d, c_d, n);
  // ... (Data transfer and memory deallocation omitted) ...
  return 0;
}

```
This code uses shared memory. The block size of 255 will lead to bank conflicts due to insufficient alignment.  Choosing block sizes that are powers of two often minimizes these conflicts.
