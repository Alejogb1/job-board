TensorFlow's flexibility in handling tensor operations allows for straightforward matrix multiplication of three or more matrices, leveraging broadcasting rules and optimized routines.  My experience optimizing deep learning models frequently necessitates efficient multi-matrix multiplication, often within custom layers.  Crucially, the order of multiplication significantly impacts performance and memory usage, necessitating careful consideration of the dimensions involved.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow, unlike some libraries, doesn't possess a single function explicitly designed for multiplying three matrices simultaneously.  Instead, it relies on the `@` operator (matrix multiplication operator) or `tf.matmul()` function, both effectively performing matrix multiplication.  The key is to perform the multiplications sequentially, respecting the rules of matrix multiplication (inner dimensions must match).  Given three matrices A, B, and C with dimensions (m x n), (n x p), and (p x q) respectively, the multiplication must proceed as (A @ B) @ C or A @ (B @ C). While mathematically equivalent, these operations may differ computationally.  The former approach might be preferable if A is significantly larger than C, minimizing intermediate result memory footprint.  Conversely, if C is considerably larger, the latter is advisable.  Furthermore,  the choice influences the computational graph construction within TensorFlow, potentially affecting optimization strategies employed by the backend.  Consideration must also be given to potential memory exhaustion caused by excessively large intermediate results.  In some cases,  breaking the multiplication down into smaller sub-operations or utilizing techniques such as tiling might be necessary for handling very large matrices exceeding available GPU memory.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Sequential Multiplication using `@` operator:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define matrices
A = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
B = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
C = tf.constant([[9.0, 10.0], [11.0, 12.0]])

# Perform multiplication sequentially
result = (A @ B) @ C

# Print the result
print(result.numpy())
```

This demonstrates the most straightforward approach.  The parentheses explicitly define the order of operations, ensuring that (A @ B) is computed first, resulting in a matrix which is then multiplied by C.  This approach is generally preferred for its clarity, although it doesn't inherently optimize for memory usage. The `.numpy()` method converts the TensorFlow tensor to a NumPy array for convenient display.


**Example 2:  Sequential Multiplication using `tf.matmul()`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define matrices (same as Example 1)
A = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
B = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
C = tf.constant([[9.0, 10.0], [11.0, 12.0]])

# Perform multiplication using tf.matmul()
intermediate_result = tf.matmul(A, B)
result = tf.matmul(intermediate_result, C)

# Print the result
print(result.numpy())
```

This example achieves the same outcome as Example 1 but utilizes the `tf.matmul()` function explicitly.  This function offers finer control, particularly useful when dealing with more complex scenarios, such as batch matrix multiplication or when specific options within `tf.matmul()` might be beneficial (e.g., specifying the data type for optimized performance).


**Example 3:  Handling Large Matrices with Tiling:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate large matrices
size = 1000
A = tf.random.normal((size, size))
B = tf.random.normal((size, size))
C = tf.random.normal((size, size))

# Tile sizes (adjust based on available memory)
tile_size = 250

# Function to perform tiled multiplication
def tiled_matmul(X, Y, tile_size):
  result = []
  for i in range(0, X.shape[0], tile_size):
    row = []
    for j in range(0, Y.shape[1], tile_size):
      row.append(tf.matmul(X[i:i+tile_size, :], Y[:, j:j+tile_size]))
    result.append(tf.concat(row, axis=1))
  return tf.concat(result, axis=0)

# Perform tiled multiplication
intermediate = tiled_matmul(A, B, tile_size)
result = tiled_matmul(intermediate, C, tile_size)

#Print shape to verify (avoid printing large matrix)
print(result.shape)
```

This illustrates a technique to handle potentially memory-intensive large matrices. The `tiled_matmul` function divides matrices into smaller tiles, computes the multiplications on these smaller tiles, and concatenates the results.  This approach significantly reduces memory consumption at the cost of increased computational overhead. The tile size is a hyperparameter to adjust based on available GPU memory.  Determining the optimal tile size often requires experimentation.  The example refrains from printing the entire resulting matrix, only the shape, due to its size.  This is crucial when dealing with extremely large matrices.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides extensive information on tensor manipulation and matrix operations.  Deep learning textbooks covering linear algebra and TensorFlow's computational graph would also prove invaluable.  Furthermore, studying optimized implementations of linear algebra routines within numerical computation libraries can provide deeper understanding of efficiency considerations.  A strong grasp of linear algebra principles is essential for understanding matrix multiplication's limitations and optimizing its implementation.  Familiarity with profiling tools will aid in identifying performance bottlenecks within TensorFlow code.
