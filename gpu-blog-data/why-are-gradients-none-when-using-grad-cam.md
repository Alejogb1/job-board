The frequent occurrence of `None` gradients when using Grad-CAM, particularly with pre-trained models in frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, typically stems from the computational graph disconnection that occurs during the forward pass, specifically during operations that are not part of the backpropagation path necessary for gradient calculation. I’ve encountered this myself multiple times during my work on image classification model explainability, and resolving it often requires careful attention to the model architecture and the Grad-CAM implementation.

Let's break down the root causes. Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) relies on the gradients of a specific convolutional layer’s output with respect to the final classification score. These gradients are essential for understanding which regions of the input image contribute most significantly to a particular prediction. Crucially, these gradients are computed using automatic differentiation, which means the operation must be within the computational graph built during the forward pass and tracked by the framework. If certain operations detach from this graph, either intentionally or unintentionally, the gradients can’t flow back and will become `None`.

The most common culprit is when a portion of the model is explicitly deactivated or modified before the desired gradient calculation. Consider a typical pre-trained model loaded for inference: it’s common to freeze layers (prevent their weights from being updated) or to perform operations like `model.eval()` in PyTorch or the equivalent in other frameworks. These actions, while beneficial for preventing weight modifications during inference, often have the side-effect of severing parts of the computational graph. Layers that are frozen usually cease to track gradients. This includes those that, though necessary for a prediction, are not subject to training. The same is valid if custom layers, or manipulations of the feature maps, do not register gradients. The framework does not retain the information necessary to propagate the gradients backward, leading to `None` values when Grad-CAM attempts to calculate them.

Another frequent scenario involves tensor manipulations that detach intermediate tensors from the computational graph. For instance, using indexing, slicing, or the `.detach()` method directly on the feature maps, without being careful, will break the gradient path, resulting in the gradients being `None`. These operations inform the framework that the involved tensor should be considered a constant for backpropagation, not a part of the differentiable graph. This can be easily overlooked when extracting intermediate feature maps for Grad-CAM.

Let's examine these cases with code examples.

**Example 1: Frozen Layers and `model.eval()`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

# Load a pre-trained ResNet18 model
model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Freeze all layers of the model for demonstration purposes
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Move the model to the device
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = model.to(device)
model.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode

# Assume we have some input data `input_tensor`
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224).to(device)

# Forward pass to get the output and intermediate feature map
target_layer = model.layer4[-1].conv2 # Target layer for Grad-CAM

with torch.no_grad(): # Avoid further track of operations not necessary for visualization
    output = model(input_tensor)
    
    # Feature Map Extraction
    activation = None
    def hook(model, input, output):
      nonlocal activation
      activation = output

    handle = target_layer.register_forward_hook(hook)
    _ = model(input_tensor) # Recompute to execute forward hook
    handle.remove()

# Calculate gradient
output_class = torch.argmax(output, dim=1)
gradients = torch.autograd.grad(output[0, output_class], activation, retain_graph=True)

if gradients is not None and gradients[0] is not None:
    print("Gradients Calculated")
    
else:
    print("Gradients are None!")

```

In this first example, we load a pre-trained ResNet18 and freeze all its parameters. Furthermore, we switch the model to evaluation mode using `model.eval()`. Because no parameters of the model require gradients, and we're using `torch.no_grad()`, gradients calculated with respect to the activation maps are guaranteed to be `None`. In a realistic scenario, you would want to avoid freezing the entire model. You would instead ensure that at least the layer you're working with for Grad-CAM has `requires_grad` set to True during the forward and backward passes. This is important even though the weights might not be updated.

**Example 2: Detaching Feature Maps**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

# Load a pre-trained ResNet18 model
model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
model.eval()

# Move the model to the device
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = model.to(device)

# Assume we have some input data `input_tensor`
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224).to(device)

# Forward pass to get the output and intermediate feature map
target_layer = model.layer4[-1].conv2 # Target layer for Grad-CAM

# Feature Map Extraction
activation = None
def hook(model, input, output):
    nonlocal activation
    activation = output.detach() # Detaching the feature maps

handle = target_layer.register_forward_hook(hook)
_ = model(input_tensor)
handle.remove()
    
# Calculate gradient
output = model(input_tensor)
output_class = torch.argmax(output, dim=1)
gradients = torch.autograd.grad(output[0, output_class], activation, retain_graph=True)

if gradients is not None and gradients[0] is not None:
    print("Gradients Calculated")
    
else:
    print("Gradients are None!")
```

Here, we specifically use `output.detach()` in the forward hook, explicitly detaching the extracted feature map from the computational graph. Consequently, the gradient computed concerning the detached tensor will be `None`. This scenario often arises from inadvertently applying such operations during debugging or intermediate data processing. It is essential to maintain the connection by avoiding the `detach()` method, and also indexing/slicing, when possible.

**Example 3: Incorrectly Specified `requires_grad`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models

# Load a pre-trained ResNet18 model
model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
model.eval()

# Move the model to the device
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = model.to(device)

# Assume we have some input data `input_tensor`
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224).to(device)

# Forward pass to get the output and intermediate feature map
target_layer = model.layer4[-1].conv2 # Target layer for Grad-CAM

# Feature Map Extraction
activation = None
def hook(model, input, output):
    nonlocal activation
    activation = output
    
handle = target_layer.register_forward_hook(hook)
_ = model(input_tensor)
handle.remove()
    
# Set activation.requires_grad to False
activation.requires_grad = False

# Calculate gradient
output = model(input_tensor)
output_class = torch.argmax(output, dim=1)
gradients = torch.autograd.grad(output[0, output_class], activation, retain_graph=True)

if gradients is not None and gradients[0] is not None:
    print("Gradients Calculated")
    
else:
    print("Gradients are None!")
```

In this final example, despite extracting the feature map without a `detach()`, we explicitly set `activation.requires_grad = False` after the hook is called. This is equivalent to having a detached tensor, meaning that no gradient can be computed regarding this activation tensor, which leads to `None` gradient.

To avoid these `None` gradient situations, ensure that:

1.  You do not freeze layers that are necessary for gradient calculation within your Grad-CAM process.
2.  You do not `detach` tensors from the computational graph unless strictly necessary, and you must be aware of the consequences of doing that.
3.  That the tensor from which we're calculating the gradients does indeed `require_grad`.
4. When extracting intermediate layers, do not use methods that could result in detached tensors.

I've found it helpful to work with a small test case initially, validating each step. This makes it significantly easier to pinpoint where a gradient disconnect occurs during a more complex Grad-CAM implementation. Reviewing the model architecture and the operations performed on the relevant tensors, in debug mode, is usually the fastest way to trace down these issues.

For further learning on automatic differentiation and computational graphs, I recommend consulting the official documentation of your preferred deep learning framework. Additionally, there are many online educational resources that delve into backpropagation and gradient calculation mechanics, although I would recommend sticking to the official documentation when learning about specific functions. The resources by authors with deep research expertise in machine learning can also greatly assist in developing a better understanding of the underlying concepts. Studying these should strengthen understanding and debugging strategies for gradient-based techniques such as Grad-CAM.
