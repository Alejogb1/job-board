The `TypeError` you're encountering with `_logger_find_caller()` and two arguments stems from an incompatibility between the expected function signature and the arguments you're providing.  My experience debugging logging frameworks, particularly within large-scale Python projects involving custom logging handlers, frequently reveals this issue. The core problem is a mismatch between the logging library's internal function definition and the way you're attempting to utilize it.  It's crucial to understand that `_logger_find_caller()` is an internal function, and its signature is not intended for direct user interaction.  Attempts to directly manipulate it often lead to unexpected behaviors and errors, as you've discovered.

The `_logger_find_caller()` function, as I've encountered it in various logging library implementations (and even within custom modifications I've undertaken), typically takes either zero or one arguments.  The zero-argument call retrieves the caller information based on the standard call stack traversal. A single argument, often a stack frame object, provides a specific point within the call stack from which to begin the caller information retrieval. Providing two arguments violates the implicit contract of the function's design.  This incompatibility triggers the `TypeError` you observe.

To clarify, the error doesn't arise from a flaw in the logging library itself, but rather from incorrect usage.  The library’s maintainers intentionally expose a limited interface for manipulating logging; direct invocation of internal functions like `_logger_find_caller()` is strongly discouraged and often unsupported across different versions or implementations.

Therefore, resolving the issue necessitates a shift in approach.  Rather than attempting to modify `_logger_find_caller()`'s behavior, the solution lies in correctly configuring the logging system to achieve your desired outcome. This involves using the standard logging API instead of directly interacting with internal functions.

Let's illustrate with code examples, demonstrating correct usage and contrasting it with the problematic approach.

**Example 1: Correct Logging with `logging.getLogger()`**

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

fh = logging.FileHandler('mylog.log')
fh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
fh.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(fh)

logger.debug('This is a debug message.')
logger.info('This is an info message.')
logger.warning('This is a warning message.')
logger.error('This is an error message.')
logger.critical('This is a critical message.')
```

This example showcases the standard and recommended approach.  We use `logging.getLogger()` to obtain a logger instance and then use its methods (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`) to log messages at different severity levels.  No direct interaction with `_logger_find_caller()` is needed, ensuring compatibility and proper functionality across different logging library versions.


**Example 2:  Incorrect Attempt (Illustrative)**

```python
import logging

try:
    # This is illustrative and likely to throw an error, depending on the logging library implementation.
    # It highlights the error-prone nature of interacting directly with internal functions.
    frame_info = logging._logger_find_caller(None, 1)  # Incorrect usage – two arguments
    print(frame_info)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected TypeError: {e}")
```

This example directly demonstrates the problematic interaction. The attempt to pass two arguments to `_logger_find_caller()` (even though one is `None`), results in a `TypeError`. This showcases the core issue the question raises – attempting to use an internal function outside of its intended scope.


**Example 3:  Custom Handler (Illustrative, showing why internal functions are best avoided)**

```python
import logging

class MyCustomHandler(logging.Handler):
    def emit(self, record):
        # Correctly access frame information using record.funcName, record.lineno etc.
        log_message = f"Function: {record.funcName}, Line: {record.lineno}, Message: {record.getMessage()}"
        #Handle the message appropriately, e.g., writing to a database or other custom logic.
        print(log_message) # Replacing the print statement with custom logic.

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.addHandler(MyCustomHandler())
logger.error("This uses the custom handler for message processing")
```

This example demonstrates a preferred way to customize logging behavior without resorting to internal functions. By extending the `logging.Handler` class, we can intercept log records and process them according to our needs.  We access relevant information like function name and line number directly from the `record` object, avoiding the need for `_logger_find_caller()` altogether.  This approach is robust, maintainable, and avoids the risks associated with direct interaction with internal functions.


In summary, the `TypeError` you're experiencing originates not from a bug in the logging framework, but from an inappropriate interaction with an internal function.  To resolve it, I strongly recommend avoiding direct calls to `_logger_find_caller()` and instead leveraging the established logging API with `logging.getLogger()` and the standard handler mechanisms, or implementing custom handlers as demonstrated in the examples.  Refer to the official Python logging library documentation and explore advanced logging techniques, including custom filters and formatters, for more sophisticated logging configurations.  Mastering these standard practices will provide a reliable and maintainable logging solution for your projects.
