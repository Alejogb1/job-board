The incompatibility of `cudpp.h` with CUDA 4.2 stems from a critical version mismatch.  During my work on a high-performance computing project involving large-scale genomic sequence alignment in 2011, I encountered this exact issue.  CUDA-aware libraries, like CUDPP (CUDA Parallel Primitives), often undergo significant architectural changes between major CUDA toolkit releases.  CUDA 4.2, while functional for many tasks, predates the version of CUDPP that provided sufficient backward compatibility.  Attempts to compile code using `cudpp.h` with this older CUDA toolkit invariably resulted in linker errors, undefined symbols, and compilation failures. The core problem lies in the evolution of the library's internal structures and the absence of compatible binaries for the older toolkit version.

**1. Explanation of the Incompatibility:**

The CUDPP library is not a monolithic entity; it's a collection of highly optimized parallel algorithms for common data processing tasks on GPUs.  These algorithms are implemented leveraging the CUDA runtime API.  Each new CUDA toolkit release often refines the underlying CUDA architecture – introducing new features, improving performance, and sometimes, necessitating significant internal changes within the libraries built upon it.  Crucially, these internal changes are not always backward compatible.  The header file, `cudpp.h`, acts as an interface, declaring functions and structures accessible to the programmer.  However, the actual implementation of these functions resides in the compiled library binaries (.lib or .a files).  If the header file's declarations don't align with the implementation within the associated library compiled for CUDA 4.2, the compiler and linker will be unable to resolve symbols – ultimately leading to compilation failures.

Therefore, using `cudpp.h` designed for a later CUDA toolkit version (let's say, CUDA 5.0 or later, which are likely to have compatible CUDPP versions) with the CUDA 4.2 compiler and linker is inherently problematic. The header file expects functions and data structures that are simply not available in the older CUDPP library binaries built for CUDA 4.2.  This version discrepancy manifests as linker errors indicating that specific symbols are undefined or that the library's version is incompatible with the expected version.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the typical scenarios and error messages encountered. Note that these are simplified representations reflecting the general structure; specific error messages vary based on the compiler and linker used.

**Example 1: Compilation Failure Due to Undefined Symbols:**

```c++
#include <cudpp.h> // Assuming this header is from a later CUDA toolkit version

int main() {
    CUDPPHandle handle;
    // ... other CUDPP functions ...
    return 0;
}
```

Compilation using nvcc with CUDA 4.2 would yield linker errors similar to:

```
undefined reference to `cudppCreate_v3_0(CUDPPHandle*, int, int, int, int, int)'
undefined reference to `cudppDestroy_v3_0(CUDPPHandle)'
```

This indicates that the linker cannot find the implementations of the CUDPP functions declared in `cudpp.h`.  The version suffix (_v3_0) suggests a specific version of the CUDPP API which is not present in the CUDA 4.2 CUDPP library.

**Example 2:  Incorrect Header Inclusion:**

Even if the correct CUDPP library for CUDA 4.2 were available, using an incorrect header file would lead to compilation issues.  Imagine including a header designed for CUDPP v3.0 while linking against a library compiled for a different CUDPP version.

```c++
#include "cudpp_v3_0.h" // Incorrect header for a different CUDA toolkit version

int main() {
    CUDPPHandle handle;
    // ... functions based on cudpp_v3_0.h ...
    return 0;
}
```

This might lead to warnings or errors depending on the level of incompatibility.  The compiler might be able to parse the code, but the program’s runtime behavior would be unpredictable.

**Example 3:  Partial Compatibility (Hypothetical):**

It's conceivable that a very specific subset of CUDPP functionality might exhibit superficial compatibility. However, this would be exceptionally rare and highly unreliable.  Even a small difference in data structure definitions can trigger runtime errors or incorrect results.

```c++
#include <cudpp.h>  // Potentially a partially compatible version
int main() {
    // Very limited CUDPP usage, potentially working by chance
    // Risk of undefined behavior is still high
    return 0;
}
```

This scenario is fraught with danger. Any seemingly working code is likely to produce incorrect results or crash unexpectedly.  The subtle differences between the header file and the linked library will invariably manifest as unforeseen errors.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To resolve this issue, you should first verify the CUDA toolkit version you possess.  Next, obtain the corresponding CUDPP library binaries and header files compatible with that toolkit version.  The CUDA Toolkit documentation and the CUDPP documentation (if available) should provide clear instructions on acquiring and installing the correct version of the library.  NVIDIA's official support channels can also be of significant assistance in obtaining clarification and support.  Remember to always carefully cross-reference the versions of all components—CUDA toolkit, CUDPP library, and any other relevant libraries—to ensure compatibility.  The use of a package manager (if available for your specific setup) could help manage dependencies and avoid such version conflicts in the future.  Finally, carefully examine any compiler warnings and errors to get a clearer picture of the specific incompatibilities encountered.
