The inherent structure of tensors, particularly within deep learning frameworks, often requires a nuanced approach to sorting beyond simple in-place algorithms. Unlike Python lists, tensors are typically multi-dimensional arrays optimized for numerical computation. Thus, direct sorting commonly involves creating a sorted copy rather than modifying the original tensor directly. Furthermore, sorting operations must often respect the tensor's dimensionality.

When I encountered a requirement for sorted tensors while developing a custom loss function within PyTorch, I initially attempted to directly apply Python's `sorted()` function, which resulted in type errors. The key distinction is that tensors are not iterable sequences in the same way Python lists are. The primary method for sorting tensors involves using framework-specific functions that are optimized for tensor operations and can handle their specific data types and memory layouts.

The most commonly used approach for sorting tensors in ascending order is to utilize the `torch.sort()` function in PyTorch or similar equivalents in other frameworks like TensorFlow. This function not only sorts the tensor but also returns the indices of the sorted elements relative to the original tensor. This dual output is crucial when maintaining alignment across multiple tensors, such as during batch processing or when applying the same sort order across different data structures.

The `torch.sort()` function, by default, sorts the tensor along the last dimension. However, by specifying the `dim` argument, sorting can occur across different axes. In my experience, I frequently needed to sort tensors along the first dimension when processing time-series data. The function also offers an `ascending` argument; while the default is ascending, this can be explicitly defined for clarity.

```python
import torch

# Example 1: Sorting a 1D tensor
tensor_1d = torch.tensor([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6])
sorted_tensor_1d, sorted_indices_1d = torch.sort(tensor_1d)
print("Original Tensor:", tensor_1d)
print("Sorted Tensor:", sorted_tensor_1d)
print("Sorted Indices:", sorted_indices_1d)

# Commentary: This demonstrates the basic usage of torch.sort() for a single-dimension tensor.
# The function returns both the sorted tensor and the indices mapping the original position to the sorted position.
# Note that the duplicate '1' in the original tensor maintains its relative ordering.

```

In the above example, `tensor_1d` is a one-dimensional tensor. `torch.sort(tensor_1d)` returns a tuple. The first element of this tuple, `sorted_tensor_1d`, represents the sorted values. The second element, `sorted_indices_1d`, contains the indices of the original tensor where the sorted values were found. For instance, the first value in the sorted tensor is '1', and its corresponding index is 1 in the original tensor. When duplicate values are present (like the two ‘1’s), the function maintains the relative ordering of these values from the original tensor.

```python
# Example 2: Sorting a 2D tensor along a specific dimension
tensor_2d = torch.tensor([[9, 4, 7], [1, 8, 3], [6, 2, 5]])
sorted_tensor_2d_dim0, sorted_indices_2d_dim0 = torch.sort(tensor_2d, dim=0)
print("Original Tensor:\n", tensor_2d)
print("Sorted Tensor along dim=0:\n", sorted_tensor_2d_dim0)
print("Sorted Indices along dim=0:\n", sorted_indices_2d_dim0)

sorted_tensor_2d_dim1, sorted_indices_2d_dim1 = torch.sort(tensor_2d, dim=1)
print("Sorted Tensor along dim=1:\n", sorted_tensor_2d_dim1)
print("Sorted Indices along dim=1:\n", sorted_indices_2d_dim1)


# Commentary: This example demonstrates sorting a 2D tensor along two dimensions.
# Using dim=0 sorts each column of the tensor independently, while dim=1 sorts each row independently.
# The output indices reflect where the sorted values originated in the original tensor.

```

In Example 2, `tensor_2d` is a two-dimensional tensor. When sorting along `dim=0`, which represents the vertical axis, each column of the tensor is sorted individually. The `sorted_indices_2d_dim0` reveals how the columns were rearranged. For example, in the first column, '1' is now first, followed by '6' and then '9'. Sorting along `dim=1` applies the same logic across rows, sorting elements horizontally.

```python
# Example 3: Sorting with descending order
tensor_desc = torch.tensor([5, 2, 8, 1, 9])
sorted_desc_tensor, sorted_desc_indices = torch.sort(tensor_desc, descending=True)
print("Original Tensor:", tensor_desc)
print("Sorted (descending) Tensor:", sorted_desc_tensor)
print("Sorted (descending) Indices:", sorted_desc_indices)

# Commentary: This shows the usage of the 'descending=True' parameter.
# The output tensor is sorted from largest to smallest and the sorted indices now reflect that.

```

Example 3 demonstrates how to sort a tensor in descending order by utilizing the `descending` parameter set to `True`. The output indicates a re-arrangement of values in the `tensor_desc` from highest to lowest and the corresponding `sorted_desc_indices` match this.

The implications of sorted indices are significant. Often, after sorting, one might need to operate on other tensors using the same sort order. This is achieved by indexing the other tensors using these indices. This is common when dealing with paired data, where the sorting in one data dimension must also be applied to its corresponding dimensions in related tensors.

When considering performance, the `torch.sort()` function is highly optimized, utilizing efficient sorting algorithms implemented in C++. Therefore, manually constructing sorting logic using Python loops would be inefficient. Furthermore, sorting on GPUs, when tensors are stored there, provides significant acceleration. However, memory implications should always be considered, as copying data is involved.

For deeper exploration of tensor operations and specific sorting use cases, I would recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation. Research papers on machine learning and related fields, specifically those dealing with complex loss functions and data pre-processing techniques, often detail more advanced examples of tensor manipulation. Textbooks on numerical computing also provide a good grounding in understanding the theoretical background of such operations and their efficient implementation. Furthermore, studying existing source code from reputable deep-learning projects helps in understanding real-world applications of these techniques. Lastly, online forums and communities provide practical insights derived from troubleshooting and solving complex scenarios related to tensor operations.
