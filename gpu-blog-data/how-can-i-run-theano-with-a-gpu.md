The successful execution of Theano with GPU acceleration on Windows 7 necessitates careful consideration of driver versions, CUDA toolkit compatibility, and the precise configuration of environment variables.  My experience troubleshooting this on numerous legacy projects highlighted the critical role of meticulously managing these dependencies.  Failure to align these components often results in CPU-only execution, even with a compatible GPU present.

**1.  Explanation:**

Theano, while now largely superseded by TensorFlow and PyTorch, relied on external libraries like CUDA for GPU computation.  Windows 7 support, while officially deprecated by many supporting libraries, can still be achieved with diligent effort and precise version control.  The core challenge stems from the interplay between Theano's internal CUDA backend, the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit, and the relevant NVIDIA drivers.  Incorrect versions of any of these can lead to compatibility issues and prevent GPU utilization.

Firstly, ensure your NVIDIA graphics card is CUDA-capable.  Check NVIDIA's website for compatibility information; not all cards are supported.  Next, download and install the correct CUDA Toolkit version.  This version must be compatible with your specific graphics card and driver versions.  Note that the CUDA Toolkit itself only provides the necessary libraries; Theano needs configuration to utilize them.

Crucially, the NVIDIA drivers must be compatible with both the CUDA Toolkit and Theano. Outdated or overly new drivers can disrupt the entire process.  I've personally encountered scenarios where a driver update unexpectedly broke Theano's GPU functionality, requiring a rollback to a previously working driver.

Finally, the system's environment variables must accurately reflect the installation locations of CUDA and cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library, often required by Theano for optimized performance).  Incorrect paths will prevent Theano from locating the necessary libraries, forcing it to default to CPU-only computation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Checking Theano's Configuration:**

```python
import theano
print(theano.config.device)
print(theano.config.floatX)
print(theano.config.blas.ldflags)
```

This snippet retrieves crucial information about Theano's current configuration.  `theano.config.device` indicates the device being used (e.g., 'gpu', 'cpu').  `theano.config.floatX` specifies the data type used for computations (typically 'float32').  `theano.config.blas.ldflags` provides insights into the BLAS library being used, which is often relevant for linear algebra operations.  If `theano.config.device` displays 'cpu' despite having a compatible GPU and correct CUDA setup, it points to an issue within Theano's configuration or environment variables.

**Example 2:  Explicit GPU Usage:**

```python
import theano.tensor as T
from theano import function

x = T.dmatrix('x')
y = T.dmatrix('y')
z = x + y

f = function([x, y], z, allow_input_downcast=True)

a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
b = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]

print(f(a, b))
```

This example demonstrates a simple matrix addition using Theano.  `allow_input_downcast=True` is crucial;  it allows Theano to potentially convert input data types to those best suited for GPU processing.  Without explicit GPU configuration within Theano's settings (covered below), even this seemingly straightforward example might default to CPU execution.  In such scenarios, examining the Theano logs for errors related to CUDA initialization is essential.  This example assumes that Theano has already been configured to use the GPU.

**Example 3:  Environment Variable Verification:**

This example doesn't involve direct Theano code but is critical for successful GPU utilization. Before running any Theano code, it's vital to verify the correctness of the CUDA path environmental variables:


```bash
echo %PATH%  #This will show the system PATH variable which should contain paths to CUDA's bin and lib directories.
echo %CUDA_HOME% # This checks that the CUDA_HOME variable is correctly set to the location of the CUDA installation
```

This command-line approach checks whether the environment variables necessary for Theano to find the CUDA libraries are correctly set. If these variables are missing or point to incorrect locations, Theano won't be able to find the GPU libraries and will fall back to the CPU. In my personal experience, this overlooked step has often been the root cause of problems.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official NVIDIA CUDA documentation for detailed information on CUDA Toolkit installation and compatibility with different hardware and software versions.  Thoroughly examine the Theano documentation, focusing on sections related to GPU configuration and troubleshooting.  Refer to relevant Stack Overflow threads and forums dedicated to Theano and CUDA to find solutions to specific issues that may arise.  Review the comprehensive documentation provided by the cuDNN library if you intend to utilize its capabilities within Theano. Understanding the interplay between CUDA, cuDNN and Theano is paramount for success.  Note that relying solely on outdated community resources can sometimes lead to conflicting or obsolete information.  Always favor the official documentation whenever possible.  Prioritizing the official resources ensures you are working with the most up-to-date and accurate instructions.  Remember that thorough error logging and detailed examination of Theano's output during execution are crucial for effective debugging.
