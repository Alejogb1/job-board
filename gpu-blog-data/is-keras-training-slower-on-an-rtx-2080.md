Keras's training speed is highly dependent on several factors beyond the mere presence of a GPU, including the specific Keras backend (TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK), batch size, network architecture, data preprocessing, and available system RAM.  My experience working on large-scale image classification and natural language processing projects has consistently shown that while an RTX 2080 Ti *should* significantly outperform both a CPU and a GTX 1070, observing slower training times on the RTX 2080 Ti is not inherently anomalous. It points towards bottlenecks elsewhere in the system.

**1. Explanation:**

The RTX 2080 Ti boasts superior computational capabilities compared to a GTX 1070 and vastly surpasses any CPU in terms of parallel processing power for deep learning tasks.  However, slower performance on the RTX 2080 Ti can arise from several issues:

* **Data Transfer Bottlenecks:**  The speed at which data is transferred from the CPU's RAM to the GPU's VRAM is crucial.  If the CPU is a bottleneck,  data transfer becomes the limiting factor.  This is particularly evident when dealing with large datasets or high-resolution images.  Insufficient RAM on the system as a whole can exacerbate this issue, forcing excessive swapping to disk.

* **Insufficient VRAM:**  The RTX 2080 Ti, while having considerable VRAM, might still be insufficient for very large models or datasets.  If the model and its associated data exceed the available VRAM, Keras will resort to slower techniques such as utilizing CPU RAM or employing slower memory management strategies, negating the benefits of the GPU.

* **Driver Issues and CUDA Configuration:** Outdated or improperly configured drivers are a common source of performance degradation.  Ensuring that CUDA is correctly installed and configured for the RTX 2080 Ti and that the latest drivers are installed is crucial.  Similarly, improper TensorFlow or Keras configuration might lead to suboptimal GPU utilization.

* **Network Architecture and Batch Size:**  A poorly optimized network architecture (e.g., excessive layers or inefficient operations) or an inappropriately chosen batch size can limit the gains from a powerful GPU.  Smaller batch sizes can lead to improved generalization but slower training, especially on powerful hardware.

* **Background Processes:**  High CPU or GPU utilization from other background processes can compete for resources and lead to performance degradation. This is particularly relevant when dealing with power-hungry applications alongside Keras training.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate how to configure and monitor Keras training to identify bottlenecks.  These examples assume familiarity with TensorFlow/Keras.

**Example 1: Basic Model Training with Monitoring:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

# ... (Model definition using Keras Sequential or Functional API) ...

# Enable TensorBoard for detailed monitoring
tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir="./logs", histogram_freq=1)

start_time = time.time()
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback], validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Training time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
```

This example incorporates TensorBoard, a crucial tool for monitoring training metrics, GPU usage, and other critical information which allows for detailed analysis of potential bottlenecks.  The training time is measured to provide a benchmark.


**Example 2:  Using tf.config to Control GPU Usage:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  try:
    # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
    for gpu in gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
    logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
  except RuntimeError as e:
    # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
    print(e)

# ... (rest of the model definition and training code) ...
```

This example demonstrates how to explicitly manage GPU memory growth, preventing excessive memory allocation, and addressing potential memory-related slowdowns.


**Example 3:  Adjusting Batch Size:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# ... (Model definition) ...

batch_sizes = [8, 16, 32, 64, 128]  #Experiment with different batch sizes
for batch_size in batch_sizes:
    start_time = time.time()
    history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=batch_size, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Training time with batch size {batch_size}: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
```

This code iterates through different batch sizes, allowing for empirical observation of the effect of batch size on training time. Finding the optimal batch size that balances training speed and generalization is essential for efficient GPU usage.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* Thoroughly consult the official documentation for Keras, TensorFlow, and CUDA.  Pay close attention to sections regarding GPU configuration and performance optimization.
* Utilize profiling tools provided by both TensorFlow and NVIDIA to identify performance bottlenecks precisely.
* Explore advanced techniques like mixed-precision training (using FP16) to potentially improve training speed without significantly compromising accuracy.  Be mindful of potential instability issues.
* Consider using model parallelism or data parallelism if dealing with exceptionally large models or datasets. This would involve more complex code restructuring and might require the use of libraries beyond basic Keras.

By systematically investigating the factors outlined above and utilizing the suggested tools and techniques, you can effectively diagnose and resolve performance bottlenecks, ensuring that your RTX 2080 Ti delivers the expected speedup during Keras training.  Remember that achieving optimal performance often involves a process of iterative refinement and experimentation.
