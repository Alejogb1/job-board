The most common reason for PyTorch failing to utilize a GPU on a Google Cloud VM, even with CUDA 10 seemingly installed, stems from a mismatch between the PyTorch installation, the CUDA version, and the driver version.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous projects, involving both custom training loops and pre-trained model deployments, highlights the critical dependency chain that needs meticulous verification.  While CUDA 10 might be present, the supporting libraries within PyTorch may not be compiled for that specific version, rendering the GPU inaccessible.

**1.  Explanation of the Dependency Chain:**

PyTorch's GPU functionality relies on a tightly coupled interplay between several components: the NVIDIA driver, the CUDA toolkit, cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library), and the PyTorch installation itself.  Each component must be compatible with the others.  A discrepancy anywhere in this chain leads to CPU-only execution.  For instance, a PyTorch build compiled against CUDA 10.1 will not function correctly with a CUDA 10.0 installation, even if both are theoretically "CUDA 10".  Further complicating matters is the driver version – the driver needs to support the CUDA toolkit version; otherwise, the CUDA toolkit cannot access the GPU.

Installation often proceeds in this order: NVIDIA driver (via the Google Cloud VM's image configuration or manual installation), CUDA toolkit, cuDNN (sometimes implicitly bundled with PyTorch), and finally, PyTorch.  A problem at any stage breaks the chain. The most prevalent error I've encountered is an improperly configured or mismatched PyTorch installation failing to correctly link to the CUDA libraries on the system.  Verifying each component's version and compatibility is crucial.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate techniques to diagnose and address the problem.  These examples assume familiarity with basic Python and terminal commands within a Google Cloud VM environment.


**Example 1: Verifying Installation and Compatibility:**

```python
import torch

print(torch.__version__)
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
print(torch.version.cuda)
print(torch.backends.cudnn.version())

import subprocess
result = subprocess.run(['nvcc', '--version'], capture_output=True, text=True)
print(result.stdout)
```

This code snippet first checks the PyTorch version and then probes its CUDA support. `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns `True` only if PyTorch detects and can use a compatible CUDA installation. `torch.version.cuda` shows the CUDA version PyTorch was compiled against, while `torch.backends.cudnn.version()` indicates the cuDNN version.  The final section uses `subprocess` to retrieve the `nvcc` (NVIDIA CUDA compiler) version, indicating the CUDA toolkit version.  Inconsistencies amongst these outputs immediately highlight a mismatch.  For instance, if `torch.cuda.is_available()` is `False` despite `torch.version.cuda` showing a CUDA version, a deeper investigation into driver/CUDA compatibility is required.  In one particularly challenging case, a seemingly correct installation failed due to a stale cache; clearing the cache resolved the issue.


**Example 2: Checking CUDA Availability and Device Information:**

```python
import torch

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device('cuda')
    print(f"CUDA is available. Using device: {device}")
    print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))  # Get name of the GPU
    print(torch.cuda.device_count())      # Number of available GPUs
else:
    print("CUDA is not available.")
    print("Falling back to CPU.")
    device = torch.device('cpu')
```

This code directly assesses CUDA availability at runtime.  If `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns `True`, the script proceeds to identify the GPU and the number of available GPUs. The output provides concrete evidence of whether the GPU is accessible to PyTorch.  Conversely, if it reports unavailability, this section alone does not pinpoint the source of the issue but confirms it exists. This requires further diagnostic steps involving the preceding script and manual checks.  In several past instances, this section revealed a conflict between requested GPU resources and those allocated by the Google Cloud VM configuration.


**Example 3:  Force CUDA Usage (with caution):**

```python
import torch

#Force usage of CUDA if available
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = MyModel().to(device) # move model to selected device
input_tensor = input_tensor.to(device) # move input tensor to selected device

# ... Your model training/inference loop ...

```

This example shows how to explicitly place your model and tensors onto the GPU using `.to(device)`.  However, this is conditional. It should *never* be used as a standalone solution. It only confirms whether the problem lies with improper usage of PyTorch’s GPU functionalities or a fundamental incompatibility that makes the GPU inaccessible. Attempting to force GPU usage when a compatibility issue exists will lead to runtime errors. This approach was essential in diagnosing one project where a specific layer in a pre-trained model lacked CUDA support, requiring a targeted model modification.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation, the CUDA toolkit documentation, and the NVIDIA driver documentation are invaluable.  Thoroughly reviewing the installation instructions for each of these components is the most crucial step.  Consult the Google Cloud documentation specific to VM instances and GPU configurations; this often contains critical details regarding driver installation and compatibility with various CUDA versions.  Finally, examining the PyTorch forums and Stack Overflow for similar issues and solutions can provide insightful troubleshooting guidance.  Careful analysis of error messages, particularly those related to library linking, is also vital.  Paying close attention to each piece of information helps isolate where the compatibility is failing.
