A frequent cause of CUDA 11.5 bandwidth test failures within Visual Studio 2019 arises from an incompatibility between the CUDA Toolkit's dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) and the runtime environment configured by Visual Studio. Specifically, the issue often stems from a mismatch in the CUDA runtime version expected by the `bandwidthTest` sample and the one actually loaded at execution. This mismatch, often subtle, results in unexpected program termination or erroneous results, commonly manifested as bandwidth tests returning unusually low or nonsensical values.

The CUDA Toolkit, after installation, places numerous DLLs within system and application-specific locations. When an application built with CUDA is executed, Windows follows a defined DLL search order to locate required libraries. The search process involves examining the application’s directory, system directories, and potentially other locations designated by environment variables. Visual Studio’s default project settings, which might implicitly or explicitly affect this search path, can unintentionally load an older, or an incompatible, CUDA runtime library rather than the one required by the 11.5 Toolkit. This occurs even when the project itself appears to be configured with the correct CUDA Toolkit version through build settings. The problem is further complicated by the fact that multiple CUDA installations, or remnants thereof, often exist on a developer's system, potentially introducing conflicting versions of crucial runtime libraries. This discrepancy between the linked version during the build process and the loaded runtime version at execution is the crux of the bandwidth test failure.

The `bandwidthTest` sample, provided within the CUDA Toolkit, is particularly susceptible to these issues as it directly relies on runtime API calls. If the expected runtime libraries cannot be found, or a version incompatible with the compiled code is loaded, various API calls will produce incorrect results, leading to bandwidth calculation failures. This incompatibility is often not explicitly reported as a linking or loading error; the application will run, but the underlying CUDA functions will either fail silently or return corrupted data, causing the bandwidth test to produce skewed values. The absence of explicit error messages often makes it difficult to debug.

Here are three code examples illustrating scenarios and techniques to address the runtime library mismatch, demonstrating the problem and a method for fixing it:

**Example 1: Illustrating the problem using a minimal CUDA kernel and runtime API check**

This first example illustrates a simplified case where a CUDA function call and version check is made using the API, outside of the context of the bandwidth test itself. This example compiles correctly, but might run with a mismatched DLL leading to unexpected output.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void dummyKernel() { }

int main() {
  int deviceCount;
  cudaError_t err = cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
  if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    std::cerr << "CUDA error: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  if (deviceCount == 0) {
    std::cout << "No CUDA-enabled devices found." << std::endl;
    return 0;
  }

    int driverVersion, runtimeVersion;
    cudaDriverGetVersion(&driverVersion);
    cudaRuntimeGetVersion(&runtimeVersion);

    std::cout << "CUDA Driver Version: " << driverVersion << std::endl;
    std::cout << "CUDA Runtime Version: " << runtimeVersion << std::endl;


  dummyKernel<<<1, 1>>>();
  err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();

  if(err != cudaSuccess){
    std::cerr << "CUDA Kernel error: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

    return 0;
}
```

*   **Commentary:** This code attempts to retrieve and print the CUDA driver and runtime version and executes an empty kernel. The crucial point is that the compiled program could be referencing CUDA 11.5 libraries, but the `cudaRuntimeGetVersion` might return a different version if an older CUDA runtime DLL is loaded at execution. A mismatch in reported versions, or errors during the device enumeration, would indicate that the runtime is not loading as expected, leading to other issues like the bandwidth test failure. Even if the kernel executes successfully, inconsistent version information can still indicate an underlying issue.

**Example 2: Modifying the search path during debugging in Visual Studio**

This second example shows how to explicitly set the directory for DLL searches via Visual Studio project settings. This resolves the problem by ensuring the correct DLLs are loaded.

Within the Visual Studio project settings:
1.  Navigate to **Debugging -> Environment**.
2.  Add the following: `PATH=%CUDA_PATH%/bin;%PATH%`

```
// Code remains the same as example 1, illustrating the same test.
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void dummyKernel() { }

int main() {
  int deviceCount;
  cudaError_t err = cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
  if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    std::cerr << "CUDA error: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  if (deviceCount == 0) {
    std::cout << "No CUDA-enabled devices found." << std::endl;
    return 0;
  }

    int driverVersion, runtimeVersion;
    cudaDriverGetVersion(&driverVersion);
    cudaRuntimeGetVersion(&runtimeVersion);

    std::cout << "CUDA Driver Version: " << driverVersion << std::endl;
    std::cout << "CUDA Runtime Version: " << runtimeVersion << std::endl;

  dummyKernel<<<1, 1>>>();
  err = cudaDeviceSynchronize();

  if(err != cudaSuccess){
      std::cerr << "CUDA Kernel error: " << cudaGetErrorString(err) << std::endl;
      return 1;
  }
    return 0;
}
```

*   **Commentary:** By prepending `%CUDA_PATH%/bin` to the existing `PATH` environment variable, we instruct Windows to prioritize searching for DLLs in the CUDA Toolkit's bin directory before resorting to the default system locations. The `CUDA_PATH` environment variable should be defined as the installation directory of the 11.5 toolkit (e.g. `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.5`). This ensures that the correct `cudart64_110.dll` (and other associated DLLs) are loaded. This approach helps when debugging in the IDE, but would need to be adjusted for a standalone executable. The version information printed should now match the expected toolkit version.

**Example 3: Explicitly loading the runtime DLL using LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress**

This third example demonstrates programmatically loading the CUDA runtime DLL. While more complex, it allows for very specific control over the loaded library and is useful for diagnosing loader issues and for standalone programs.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <windows.h>

typedef cudaError_t (*cudaGetDeviceCount_t)(int* count);
typedef cudaError_t (*cudaDriverGetVersion_t)(int* version);
typedef cudaError_t (*cudaRuntimeGetVersion_t)(int* version);

int main() {
    HMODULE cudaDll = LoadLibrary("cudart64_110.dll");
    if (cudaDll == NULL) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to load cudart64_110.dll. Error: " << GetLastError() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    cudaGetDeviceCount_t cudaGetDeviceCountFunc = (cudaGetDeviceCount_t)GetProcAddress(cudaDll, "cudaGetDeviceCount");
    cudaDriverGetVersion_t cudaDriverGetVersionFunc = (cudaDriverGetVersion_t)GetProcAddress(cudaDll, "cudaDriverGetVersion");
    cudaRuntimeGetVersion_t cudaRuntimeGetVersionFunc = (cudaRuntimeGetVersion_t)GetProcAddress(cudaDll, "cudaRuntimeGetVersion");

    if (!cudaGetDeviceCountFunc || !cudaDriverGetVersionFunc || !cudaRuntimeGetVersionFunc) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to get function addresses." << std::endl;
        FreeLibrary(cudaDll);
        return 1;
    }


  int deviceCount;
  cudaError_t err = cudaGetDeviceCountFunc(&deviceCount);
  if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    std::cerr << "CUDA error: " << err << std::endl;
    FreeLibrary(cudaDll);
    return 1;
  }

  if (deviceCount == 0) {
      std::cout << "No CUDA-enabled devices found." << std::endl;
      FreeLibrary(cudaDll);
      return 0;
  }


    int driverVersion, runtimeVersion;
    cudaDriverGetVersionFunc(&driverVersion);
    cudaRuntimeGetVersionFunc(&runtimeVersion);


    std::cout << "CUDA Driver Version: " << driverVersion << std::endl;
    std::cout << "CUDA Runtime Version: " << runtimeVersion << std::endl;


    FreeLibrary(cudaDll);
    return 0;
}

```

*   **Commentary:** This code uses Windows API calls `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress` to explicitly load the required `cudart64_110.dll` file and retrieve pointers to the necessary CUDA API functions. By explicitly loading the specific DLL, we gain a more granular control over the runtime environment. This method is especially helpful in standalone executables where there is no IDE environment to manage the DLL search path. The `FreeLibrary` ensures the DLL is unloaded once no longer required. A failure during `LoadLibrary` indicates the DLL cannot be found in the system's standard search locations.

To further explore this topic, consider consulting NVIDIA's official CUDA documentation, which provides extensive details on runtime libraries and installation procedures. Examining community forums, specifically targeting Visual Studio and CUDA development, can also offer practical troubleshooting tips and alternative solutions. Reviewing articles or blog posts focusing on managing DLL dependencies in Windows applications may provide helpful context as well. Finally, examining the system’s environment variables (specifically `PATH` and `CUDA_PATH`) is crucial to identify any potential conflicts or misconfigurations.
