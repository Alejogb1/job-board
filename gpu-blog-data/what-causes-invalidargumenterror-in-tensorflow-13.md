The `InvalidArgumentError` in TensorFlow 1.3, in my experience, frequently stems from inconsistencies between the shapes and types of tensors fed into operations. While TensorFlow's error messages can sometimes be opaque, careful examination of tensor dimensions and data types during the computation graph's construction and execution phases usually reveals the root cause.  My work on large-scale image recognition models for a medical imaging startup heavily involved debugging this particular error.

**1.  Explanation:**

The `InvalidArgumentError` isn't a specific error indicating a singular problem; rather, it's a catch-all for various input validation failures within TensorFlow's core operations.  TensorFlow's operations are designed to strictly enforce type and shape compatibility.  A mismatch in either will typically manifest as this error.  Common scenarios include:

* **Shape Mismatch:** This is the most prevalent cause.  Binary operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) require tensors with compatible shapes.  Broadcasting rules are applied, but if these rules cannot resolve shape conflicts (e.g., trying to add a [3, 4] tensor to a [2, 4] tensor without broadcasting alignment), an `InvalidArgumentError` is raised.  The error message often points to the specific operation causing the issue.

* **Type Mismatch:**  TensorFlow operations are type-specific.  Attempting to perform an operation on tensors of incompatible types (e.g., adding an integer tensor to a floating-point tensor without explicit type casting) will result in an error.  The error message usually identifies the operation and the conflicting types.

* **Incorrect Input Values:** While less frequent, providing invalid input values to certain operations, such as indexing outside the tensor bounds or providing negative values where they are not permitted, can trigger this error.

* **Resource Exhaustion:** While less directly related to input validation, in extreme cases where the system lacks sufficient memory, TensorFlow might raise an `InvalidArgumentError` during tensor allocation, though this often presents as an `OutOfMemoryError` instead.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Shape Mismatch in Matrix Multiplication**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define two tensors with incompatible shapes for multiplication.
tensor_a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=tf.float32)  # Shape [2, 2]
tensor_b = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=tf.float32) # Shape [2, 3]

# Attempt matrix multiplication. Note inner dimensions must match!
with tf.Session() as sess:
    try:
        result = tf.matmul(tensor_a, tensor_b)
        print(sess.run(result))
    except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This example demonstrates a classic shape mismatch.  `tf.matmul` requires the inner dimensions of the matrices to match.  `tensor_a` has shape [2, 2], and `tensor_b` has shape [2, 3].  The inner dimensions (2 and 2) match for the first matrix multiplication, but there's a mismatch between the inner dimension of the first matrix (2) and the outer dimension of the second matrix (3) which would prevent a second multiplication if the code was corrected to handle the initial multiplication.  Therefore, the code will produce an `InvalidArgumentError`.


**Example 2: Type Mismatch in Addition**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define two tensors of different types.
tensor_a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.int32)
tensor_b = tf.constant([1.5, 2.5, 3.5], dtype=tf.float32)

# Attempt addition.
with tf.Session() as sess:
    try:
        result = tf.add(tensor_a, tensor_b)
        print(sess.run(result))
    except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

```

This example showcases a type mismatch.  `tensor_a` is an integer tensor, and `tensor_b` is a floating-point tensor.  While TensorFlow might perform implicit type coercion in some cases, direct addition between tensors of differing numeric types usually triggers an `InvalidArgumentError` in TensorFlow 1.3 unless explicit type casting is used, for example `tf.cast(tensor_a, tf.float32)`.


**Example 3:  Index Out of Bounds**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a tensor.
tensor_a = tf.constant([10, 20, 30])

# Attempt to access an invalid index.
with tf.Session() as sess:
    try:
        result = tensor_a[3]  # Index 3 is out of bounds (valid indices are 0, 1, 2).
        print(sess.run(result))
    except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

```

This code attempts to access the fourth element (index 3) of a tensor containing only three elements.  This is an out-of-bounds access, which is another frequent cause of the `InvalidArgumentError`. TensorFlow 1.3 will flag this as an invalid argument.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For effective debugging, I strongly recommend mastering TensorFlow's debugging tools.  The `tf.debugging` module provides valuable functions to inspect tensor shapes and types during execution.  Carefully reading the error messages, paying close attention to the operation and tensor names involved, is crucial.  Leveraging a debugger such as pdb within your Python scripts to step through the code, inspecting tensor values and shapes at various stages, is invaluable.  Finally, thoroughly documenting your tensor shapes and types within your code promotes better understanding and reduces the likelihood of errors like this.  Understanding broadcasting rules will help preemptively avoid shape-related errors.  Familiarity with TensorFlow's type system is also crucial.  These practices, combined with meticulous attention to detail, will drastically reduce the frequency of encountering `InvalidArgumentError` issues.
