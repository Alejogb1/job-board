SubEthaSMTP's `MimeMessage` class, specifically when used with certain email compositions involving specific character encoding schemes, has a known propensity for throwing exceptions related to encoding or parsing during the message building process. In my experience, these exceptions most frequently manifest during the `build()` method call, occurring due to an incompatibility between the declared content-type encoding and the actual byte representation of the message body, or improperly handled header fields.

The core issue stems from the inherent complexity of handling various character encodings across email headers and body parts. The `MimeMessage` class, while designed to simplify email creation, relies heavily on accurate metadata to correctly process and encode email content. When this metadata—typically defined in the `ContentType` header—mismatches the underlying data, the framework's parser encounters data it cannot process according to the stated encoding rules, resulting in exceptions. This is often not an immediate error, but surfaces later as the framework attempts to build the final MIME structure.

For example, if a `ContentType` specifies "text/plain; charset=UTF-8", the framework expects the message body to be a sequence of bytes conforming to the UTF-8 standard. If the actual bytes represent a different encoding, like ISO-8859-1, the parser will encounter characters that are invalid according to UTF-8 rules, triggering an exception. Similarly, headers containing encoded text, especially in languages using non-ASCII characters, must adhere to RFC 2047 encoding rules. Improperly encoded header values will often cause the `MimeMessage` to fail during construction. These header-related exceptions often present as encoding-related issues rather than a direct header parsing error. Furthermore, issues can arise with character encodings in the recipient fields (To, CC, BCC), and particularly when dealing with domain names containing internationalized domain names (IDNs). These must be properly converted to their Punycode representation.

To illustrate, consider three common scenarios and how they contribute to exceptions with `MimeMessage`.

**Example 1: Mismatch between declared encoding and actual encoding in the body**

```java
import com.subetha.email.Message;
import com.subetha.email.MimeMessage;
import com.subetha.email.internet.ContentType;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

public class EncodingMismatchExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            String bodyContent = "This is a test message with some special characters: éàçü"; // Characters outside basic ASCII
            byte[] bodyBytes = bodyContent.getBytes(StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_1); // Incorrect encoding
            ContentType contentType = new ContentType("text/plain", "UTF-8");

            Message mimeMessage = new MimeMessage();
            mimeMessage.setContent(bodyBytes);
            mimeMessage.setContentType(contentType);
            mimeMessage.setSubject("Test Subject");
            mimeMessage.setFrom("sender@example.com");
            mimeMessage.addTo("recipient@example.com");

             //The following line will trigger the Exception
            byte[] result = mimeMessage.build();


             System.out.println("Mime Message built successfully");

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, the message body contains accented characters. The `bodyBytes` are created using `ISO_8859_1` encoding, but the `ContentType` is set to `UTF-8`. When `build()` is called, the library attempts to parse the ISO-8859-1 bytes as UTF-8, resulting in an encoding exception because they are not valid UTF-8 sequences. The error message usually references an invalid byte sequence or similarly worded description. Changing the encoding in the byte array creation to `StandardCharsets.UTF_8` would resolve the issue.

**Example 2: Incorrectly Encoded Header Values:**

```java
import com.subetha.email.Message;
import com.subetha.email.MimeMessage;
import com.subetha.email.internet.ContentType;
import com.subetha.email.internet.InternetAddress;
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import javax.mail.internet.AddressException;
import javax.mail.internet.InternetAddress;
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64;
import org.apache.commons.codec.net.QuotedPrintableCodec;

public class IncorrectHeaderEncoding {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            String fromName = "Some Name with éàçü"; // Header Name containing non-ascii
            String fromAddress = "sender@example.com";


           String encodedFromName = "=?UTF-8?B?" + new String(Base64.encodeBase64(fromName.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)), StandardCharsets.US_ASCII )+ "?=";
            InternetAddress from = new InternetAddress(encodedFromName, fromAddress);

             Message mimeMessage = new MimeMessage();
           mimeMessage.setFrom(from.toString());
           mimeMessage.addTo("recipient@example.com");
           mimeMessage.setSubject("Test Subject");
           mimeMessage.setContent("Body content");

           // The following line will trigger the Exception
            byte[] result = mimeMessage.build();

            System.out.println("Mime Message built successfully");

        } catch (Exception e) {
           System.err.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

Here, the "from" name contains non-ASCII characters. While `InternetAddress` might handle the encoding automatically when created with name and email parameters, in this case we use a string. If the from field is not constructed correctly, and contains unencoded non-ASCII characters, the `build()` method will fail. This failure occurs because the MIME header structure requires encoded text for non-ASCII characters. The code demonstrates how such an encoded value would be constructed using Base64, but if this encoding is absent and the from field is set as a plain string containing non-ascii the build will fail. Note that the from address does not need to be encoded, as only the name portion of the address requires it. The error thrown is usually a malformed header error or similar. The solution here would involve the correct implementation of address encoding.

**Example 3: Improperly Encoded Recipient Address**

```java
import com.subetha.email.Message;
import com.subetha.email.MimeMessage;
import com.subetha.email.internet.ContentType;
import com.subetha.email.internet.InternetAddress;
import java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import javax.mail.internet.AddressException;
import javax.mail.internet.InternetAddress;

import java.net.IDN;
import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.net.URL;
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64;
import org.apache.commons.codec.net.QuotedPrintableCodec;

public class IDNEncoding {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            String recipientEmail = "test@bücher.example";  // email with IDN in the domain
             String domain = new URL("mailto:" + recipientEmail).getHost();
            String punycodedDomain = IDN.toASCII(domain);
            String encodedEmail = recipientEmail.replace(domain, punycodedDomain);


            Message mimeMessage = new MimeMessage();
           mimeMessage.addTo(encodedEmail);
           mimeMessage.setFrom("sender@example.com");
           mimeMessage.setSubject("Test Subject");
           mimeMessage.setContent("Body content");

           // The following line will trigger the Exception
           byte[] result = mimeMessage.build();


            System.out.println("Mime Message built successfully");

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this scenario, the recipient email address contains an internationalized domain name (IDN) “bücher.example”. The framework, according to SMTP standards, requires the domain to be represented in its Punycode form, an ASCII representation of Unicode characters. If the email address is used as is, without converting the domain to Punycode, the library will fail during building as it encounters non-ASCII characters in a domain that it does not understand how to process. The fix here is to use IDN.toASCII for the domain part, as is demonstrated by the code. If the recipient address was a plain string, this issue would be less obvious, but `InternetAddress` usually handles this as a utility. The error message is typically a variation on malformed address format.

When troubleshooting `MimeMessage` exceptions, the key is to examine the content type declarations, the actual encoding of the message body, and the presence of non-ASCII characters in header fields and addresses. Ensure the character set specified in the `ContentType` header accurately reflects the actual encoding used for the message body.  For non-ASCII characters in header names or values, the text should be encoded per RFC 2047 using either Base64 or Quoted-Printable encoding. And as for IDNs, remember to convert domain names using the standard IDN conversion before assembling the email.

For further information, I would recommend studying relevant RFCs (specifically 2045, 2047, 2046, 5322, 5321 and 3490), the official Javamail API documentation and any specific documentation provided with SubEthaSMTP. A thorough understanding of these standards will significantly aid in diagnosing and resolving such exceptions. Examining the source code of `MimeMessage`'s `build` method using a debugger can sometimes provide more precise insights into the source of the exception. Finally, it's beneficial to review example emails and RFCs to confirm correct message structures when the issue is suspected but not obvious.
