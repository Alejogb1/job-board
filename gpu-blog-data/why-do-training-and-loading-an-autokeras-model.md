The core reason for discrepancies between training and loading AutoKeras models stems from the non-deterministic nature of the hyperparameter search process, coupled with differences in how the model state is managed during these two phases. Specifically, the training phase involves an evolutionary search algorithm which inherently incorporates random initialization and stochastic optimization techniques. This means that each training run, even with identical configurations, can yield a slightly different final model due to these inherent variations. When loading a saved model, we are retrieving a specific snapshot of the architecture and weights achieved after a particular training iteration, not the entire evolutionary search path.

The training process in AutoKeras uses a searcher to explore the vast space of possible architectures and hyperparameters using, by default, an evolutionary algorithm based on Bayesian Optimization. This searcher attempts to optimize the model's performance on a given validation set. This involves evaluating many model variants, each initialized with random weights and trained for a set number of epochs. The exact sequence of model evaluations, the random seeds for initialization, and the data shuffling sequence are unique to a particular run. This results in slight variations in the optimal hyperparameters and weights found in each training execution.

The saved model file, typically in the form of a serialized Keras model, contains the final architecture and trained weights from *one* particular point in the search space – specifically, the model that had the best performance on the validation set discovered *during that specific training run*. When loading this saved model, the entire stochastic search process is bypassed. We are simply initializing the model with the saved weights and configuration. Hence, we’re operating within the finalized framework established during one specific run of the search, without the associated search variations.

The differences, therefore, aren’t due to any bug in AutoKeras or Keras, but are an intrinsic characteristic of the evolutionary optimization process. If you were to train the same model repeatedly with the exact same data, configuration, and code, using frameworks that avoid stochasticity, you would obtain almost identical models. It's the exploration of the hyperparameter search space that introduces the variations observed in AutoKeras.

Let’s look at three scenarios with accompanying code examples that demonstrate this difference:

**Example 1: Basic Image Classification**

```python
import autokeras as ak
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist

# Prepare data
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], 28, 28, 1).astype('float32') / 255
x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], 28, 28, 1).astype('float32') / 255

# Initialize and train model
clf = ak.ImageClassifier(max_trials=1) # Limit trials to make the effect more visible
clf.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)

# Save the model
model_path = "my_model"
clf.export_model().save(model_path)

# Load the model
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model(model_path)

# Predict with both models
predictions_train = clf.predict(x_test)
predictions_loaded = loaded_model.predict(x_test)

# Evaluate (demonstrates differences)
score_train = clf.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
score_loaded = loaded_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)

print(f"Training evaluation loss: {score_train[0]}, accuracy: {score_train[1]}")
print(f"Loaded model evaluation loss: {score_loaded[0]}, accuracy: {score_loaded[1]}")

# Verify predictions (demonstrates differences)
print(f"Are predictions identical?: {tf.reduce_all(predictions_train==predictions_loaded)}")


```

In this case, despite training and saving and loading, the accuracy and predictions of the loaded model will slightly deviate from the 'live' version within the `ak.ImageClassifier` object. This highlights that although the same architecture and weights are saved, the state is different between the live model and the serialized model. The live model has the state related to the evolutionary search; loading this state is not possible via the typical model-loading functionalities.

**Example 2: Text Classification**

```python
import autokeras as ak
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups

# Prepare data
newsgroups = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='all', remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'))
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(newsgroups.data, newsgroups.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train model
clf = ak.TextClassifier(max_trials=1, seed = 42)
clf.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)

# Save the model
model_path = "my_text_model"
clf.export_model().save(model_path)

# Load the model
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model(model_path)

# Predict with both models
predictions_train = clf.predict(x_test)
predictions_loaded = loaded_model.predict(x_test)

# Evaluate (demonstrates differences)
score_train = clf.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
score_loaded = loaded_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)

print(f"Training evaluation loss: {score_train[0]}, accuracy: {score_train[1]}")
print(f"Loaded model evaluation loss: {score_loaded[0]}, accuracy: {score_loaded[1]}")

# Verify predictions (demonstrates differences)
print(f"Are predictions identical?: {tf.reduce_all(predictions_train==predictions_loaded)}")
```

Similar to the image classification example, the slight differences in the performance metrics and the predictions can be observed. This also underscores that the loaded model represents one point in a search trajectory, not the whole trajectory of optimization. The inclusion of a seed may lessen variation in each 'live' training run, it does not impact the difference between saved/loaded version and its training counterpart.

**Example 3: Tabular Regression**

```python
import autokeras as ak
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing

# Prepare data
housing = fetch_california_housing()
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(housing.data, housing.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

x_train = pd.DataFrame(x_train)
x_test = pd.DataFrame(x_test)

# Initialize and train model
reg = ak.StructuredDataRegressor(max_trials=1, seed=42)
reg.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)

# Save the model
model_path = "my_reg_model"
reg.export_model().save(model_path)

# Load the model
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model(model_path)

# Predict with both models
predictions_train = reg.predict(x_test)
predictions_loaded = loaded_model.predict(x_test)

# Evaluate (demonstrates differences)
score_train = reg.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
score_loaded = loaded_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)

print(f"Training evaluation loss: {score_train[0]}, mae: {score_train[1]}")
print(f"Loaded model evaluation loss: {score_loaded[0]}, mae: {score_loaded[1]}")

# Verify predictions (demonstrates differences)
print(f"Are predictions identical?: {tf.reduce_all(predictions_train==predictions_loaded)}")
```
Again, discrepancies can be observed, reinforcing the point that the loaded model will behave as a static instance of a model, rather than a dynamic instance where the full history of the evolutionary search is preserved. The random seed again reduces variation between live training runs, but the difference between the live trained and saved-loaded version persists.

To mitigate the performance differences between training and loading in practical applications, several strategies can be employed. First, increase the number of trials in the AutoKeras search phase (the `max_trials` parameter), which will allow more search to occur, possibly yielding a model that has less variability. The downside of this increase is the higher training time. Second, perform model evaluation using a comprehensive test set that the model has not seen before during training. This gives an evaluation of the model's performance that is not contaminated by the specifics of the optimization history. Third, if consistency of results is crucial, a seed may be added to the process in the code, although the saved model will still be deterministic. Also, training an AutoKeras model with a high number of epochs can also improve model performance consistency.

For further study, consult the AutoKeras documentation concerning the search process. I recommend researching concepts of Bayesian Optimization within evolutionary algorithms. Also, investigate the functionalities of TensorFlow's model saving and loading mechanisms, with specific attention to differences between saved models and the ‘in memory’ trained model object. Explore the relevant sections of the Keras documentation concerning model serialization and deserialization as this is the core functionality leveraged by AutoKeras when exporting model artifacts. Lastly, further investigation of the `tf.random.set_seed` method can allow to reduce the effects of stochasticity, although it will not remove the effects on the exported model.
