GPU unavailability despite apparent capacity is a multifaceted problem I've encountered frequently in my years working with high-performance computing clusters and embedded systems.  The root cause often lies not in a simple lack of processing power, but rather in a complex interplay of driver issues, resource allocation conflicts, and software limitations.  My experience indicates that a thorough investigation must encompass operating system processes, driver configurations, and the application's resource management strategies.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The perception of GPU capacity is often misleading.  While monitoring tools might show available memory and processing units, this doesn't guarantee application access.  Several factors can prevent your application from utilizing the available GPU resources:

* **Driver Conflicts and Version Mismatches:** Outdated or improperly installed drivers are a common culprit.  A driver may not correctly expose all available GPU capabilities to the operating system, resulting in the OS falsely reporting available resources while the application remains unable to access them.  Incompatibilities between the driver version and the application's libraries (CUDA, ROCm, OpenCL, etc.) further exacerbate this issue.  I've personally debugged countless instances where a seemingly minor driver update resolved this exact problem.

* **Operating System Resource Allocation:** The operating system scheduler plays a critical role. It manages resource allocation across all processes, including GPU usage.  High system load, competing processes with higher priority, or incorrect process affinity settings can starve your application of GPU resources, even if sufficient capacity exists.  Overly aggressive memory paging or swap usage can also indirectly limit GPU performance by increasing latency.

* **Application-Level Resource Management:** Inefficient code can inadvertently prevent proper resource utilization.  This includes errors in memory allocation, improper synchronization primitives (leading to deadlocks), or insufficient knowledge of the underlying hardware architecture.  Failure to correctly configure the application's GPU context or bind to the appropriate GPU can lead to resource starvation, despite ample capacity. Incorrect handling of asynchronous operations can further complicate matters.

* **Hardware Limitations (Indirect):** Although you state capacity exists, certain indirect hardware limitations can still manifest.  For instance, insufficient PCIe bandwidth can bottleneck data transfer between the CPU and GPU, rendering the available processing power unusable.  Similarly, memory bandwidth limitations can restrict the rate at which data is transferred to and from GPU memory.  These limitations indirectly manifest as "unavailable" capacity.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential issues and solutions within different programming environments. Note that these are illustrative; the exact implementation will depend on your specific libraries and hardware.

**Example 1: CUDA (Checking CUDA Device Availability):**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        std::cerr << "No CUDA-capable devices found." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    int device;
    cudaGetDevice(&device);

    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device);

    std::cout << "Using device: " << prop.name << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Total Global Memory: " << prop.totalGlobalMem << " bytes" << std::endl;

    //Further CUDA code here

    return 0;
}
```

This code first checks for the presence of CUDA-capable devices. Then it retrieves properties of the selected device. This is crucial before launching any kernels.  Failure at either step indicates a deeper problem with CUDA driver installation or hardware configuration.


**Example 2: OpenCL (Context Creation and Device Selection):**

```c++
#include <CL/cl.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    try {
        std::vector<cl::Platform> platforms;
        cl::Platform::get(&platforms);

        if (platforms.empty()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("No OpenCL platforms found.");
        }

        cl::Platform platform = platforms[0]; //Select first platform
        std::vector<cl::Device> devices;
        platform.getDevices(CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU, &devices);

        if(devices.empty()){
            throw std::runtime_error("No OpenCL GPU devices found.");
        }

        cl::Device device = devices[0]; //Select first GPU device
        cl::Context context(device);

        //Further OpenCL code

    } catch (const cl::Error& error) {
        std::cerr << "OpenCL Error: " << error.what() << "(" << error.err() << ")" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This OpenCL example focuses on context creation and device selection.  Explicit error handling is critical.  Catching `cl::Error` exceptions and examining the error code provides invaluable debugging information. Failure to create a context indicates driver or hardware issues.


**Example 3:  Checking for Process Affinity (Linux):**

```bash
# Check if the process is bound to any GPU using taskset
taskset -p <process_id>

#Example to set affinity to a specific GPU (requires root privileges)
taskset -c <CPU_core_mask> <process_id>
```

On Linux systems, process affinity dictates which CPU cores (and indirectly, which GPUs through NUMA) a process can utilize. This bash script demonstrates checking and setting the affinity using `taskset`. Incorrect affinity settings can prevent the process from accessing the GPU, even if it's available.  Remember to replace `<process_id>` and `<CPU_core_mask>` with the appropriate values.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of GPU programming, I recommend consulting the official documentation for CUDA, OpenCL, and ROCm.  Exploring system monitoring tools like `nvidia-smi` (for NVIDIA GPUs) and system performance analyzers is also crucial for identifying bottlenecks.  Finally, delve into operating system documentation related to process management and resource allocation to gain a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the OS and GPU hardware. Thoroughly review your application's resource usage using profiling tools to optimize memory access and parallel processing.
