Obtaining precise Adam optimizer step sizes directly within a TensorFlow callback requires leveraging the optimizer's internal state, which isn't directly exposed through standard callback APIs.  My experience working on large-scale NLP models highlighted this limitation;  simply monitoring the loss function wasn't sufficient for fine-grained control over the optimization process. To achieve this, we need to resort to slightly unconventional methods, primarily by accessing the optimizer's slots.

**1.  Explanation:**

The Adam optimizer maintains internal variables, known as slots, that store momentum and variance estimates for each weight in the model.  These are crucial for its adaptive learning rate mechanism.  The step size, in the context of Adam, isn't a single scalar value but rather a different value for each weight, dependent on these accumulated momentum and variance estimates. Therefore, directly accessing and logging these individual step sizes requires a custom callback that intercepts the optimizer's update operation.

This approach differs fundamentally from simply logging the learning rate parameter. The learning rate is a hyperparameter, a fixed value (or a schedule) set before training, while the actual step size applied to each weight during an update is dynamically determined by Adam based on its internal state – the slots.

Specifically, we are interested in the `m` (first moment estimate) and `v` (second moment estimate) slots. The actual update for each weight involves these slots, alongside the learning rate and the hyperparameters β₁ and β₂. The effective step size is indirectly calculated within this update process.  By calculating the weight change after the update step, we can infer the effective step size applied to each parameter.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Step Size Estimation**

This example provides a simplified method to estimate the effective step sizes. It leverages `tf.GradientTape` to track the weight updates, providing a straightforward, albeit less precise, measure.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class AdamStepSizeCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, model, log_freq=100):
        super(AdamStepSizeCallback, self).__init__()
        self.model = model
        self.log_freq = log_freq

    def on_train_batch_begin(self, batch, logs=None):
        if batch % self.log_freq == 0:
            with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
                # Assuming model has a single input
                x = self.model.input[0]
                y = self.model(x)
                loss = self.model.compiled_loss(y, y)  # Dummy loss for tape recording

            grads = tape.gradient(loss, self.model.trainable_variables)
            original_weights = [tf.identity(w) for w in self.model.trainable_variables]
            self.model.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, self.model.trainable_variables))
            updated_weights = self.model.trainable_variables


            for i, (orig_w, upd_w) in enumerate(zip(original_weights, updated_weights)):
                step_size = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(orig_w - upd_w))
                print(f"Batch {batch}, Layer {i}, Avg Step Size: {step_size.numpy()}")

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[AdamStepSizeCallback(model)])
```

**Commentary:**  This method is computationally less intensive but only provides an average step size across all weights within a layer. It's an approximation due to the use of a dummy loss for the `GradientTape`.  The accuracy depends heavily on the loss function and model complexity.

**Example 2:  Accessing Optimizer Slots (More Precise)**

This example directly accesses the Adam optimizer's slots but requires more intricate handling of the optimizer's internal state and assumes access to the optimizer's internals, a potential source of breaking changes across TensorFlow versions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class AdamStepSizeCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_train_batch_begin(self, batch, logs=None):
      optimizer = self.model.optimizer
      if isinstance(optimizer, tf.keras.optimizers.Adam):
          for var in self.model.trainable_variables:
              m = optimizer.get_slot(var, 'm')
              v = optimizer.get_slot(var, 'v')
              #Further calculations using m, v, learning rate, beta1, beta2 would provide a more precise estimation
              #This part is model specific and requires a deep dive into Adam optimizer math
              #Example calculation (Illustrative, not mathematically rigorous):
              step_size_estimate = self.model.optimizer.learning_rate * m / (tf.sqrt(v) + 1e-8)
              print(f"Batch {batch}, Variable {var.name}, Estimated Step Size: {step_size_estimate.numpy()}")

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[AdamStepSizeCallback(model)])

```

**Commentary:** This approach is more sophisticated, accessing the 'm' and 'v' slots directly.  However,  it requires a deeper understanding of the Adam optimizer's mathematical formulation to accurately translate 'm' and 'v' into step sizes. The example calculation provided is simplified and serves only as an illustration.


**Example 3:  Using a Custom Optimizer (Most Control)**

For maximum control, a custom optimizer can be implemented to explicitly log the step size during weight updates.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomAdam(tf.keras.optimizers.Adam):
    def _create_slots(self, var_list):
        super()._create_slots(var_list)
        for var in var_list:
            self.add_slot(var, "step_sizes")

    def _resource_apply_dense(self, grad, var, apply_state=None):
        step_size = super()._resource_apply_dense(grad, var, apply_state)
        self.get_slot(var, "step_sizes").assign(step_size)
        return step_size


    def get_step_sizes(self):
        step_sizes = {}
        for var in self.weights:
            step_sizes[var.name] = self.get_slot(var, "step_sizes")
        return step_sizes

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])
optimizer = CustomAdam()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

class StepSizeLogger(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
      step_sizes = self.model.optimizer.get_step_sizes()
      for var_name, step_size in step_sizes.items():
          print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Variable {var_name}, Step Size: {step_size.numpy()}")


model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[StepSizeLogger()])

```

**Commentary:** This gives the most direct access.  By inheriting from `tf.keras.optimizers.Adam` and overriding the update methods, we can explicitly log the calculated step size for each weight. This approach ensures the most accurate representation, at the cost of increased code complexity. However, this method requires a deep understanding of the internal workings of the Adam optimizer and its `_resource_apply_dense` method. Any changes in these internal workings in future TensorFlow releases would require adjustments.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation on optimizers and custom training loops provides the essential background.  Familiarizing oneself with the source code of the Adam optimizer within TensorFlow is beneficial for a complete understanding.  Consult a linear algebra textbook for a refresher on gradient descent and the mathematical formulation of Adam.  Finally, working through tutorials on custom TensorFlow callbacks and optimizers will greatly enhance one's practical understanding.
