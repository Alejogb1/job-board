The interplay between TensorFlow, Keras, and CUDA Deep Neural Network library (CuDNN) is critical for accelerating deep learning workloads. It's essential to understand that CuDNN is not inherently enabled or disabled *by* Keras, but rather its usage is controlled by TensorFlow at a lower level. Essentially, Keras, being a high-level API, relies on the underlying TensorFlow implementation, which then interacts with CUDA libraries like CuDNN when available and appropriate. Therefore, the question needs reframing to address how to influence TensorFlow's interaction with CuDNN, rather than focusing on Keras directly. Specifically, I’ve encountered scenarios, typically during debugging or when needing reproducible CPU results for comparative analysis, where disabling CuDNN is crucial even when a compatible GPU and CUDA installation are present.

TensorFlow defaults to utilizing CuDNN when a compatible NVIDIA GPU is detected alongside the correct CUDA and CuDNN libraries. This acceleration, although highly beneficial for training speed, isn’t always desirable. Reasons for disabling it can range from attempting to isolate performance bottlenecks attributable to the CuDNN implementation itself, validating the functionality against the CPU implementation, or enforcing consistent behavior across different environments that might not all support GPU acceleration. TensorFlow offers mechanisms, primarily through environment variable configuration and device placement strategies, that enable disabling CuDNN and defaulting to the CPU implementation. I have leveraged these approaches extensively to ensure model integrity during development and production.

The most direct method I've used to disable CuDNN involves manipulating the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable before initializing TensorFlow. This variable controls which GPUs are visible to the TensorFlow runtime. By setting it to an empty string, we effectively instruct TensorFlow not to detect any GPUs, thus preventing the loading of CuDNN. This approach globally impacts all TensorFlow operations within the Python process. Here's a code snippet illustrating this method:

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf

# Disable GPU by setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to an empty string
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = ""

# Initialize TensorFlow and verify device usage
physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices()

print("Physical Devices Detected:")
for device in physical_devices:
    print(f"  {device}")

# Simple TensorFlow operation to demonstrate CPU usage
a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
c = tf.matmul(a, b)
print(f"Result of matrix multiplication:\n {c}")
```

In this example, by setting the environment variable to an empty string before the `import tensorflow` statement, I ensure that no GPUs, and thus no CuDNN, will be loaded. I then print the available physical devices, which will only show CPUs, and execute a simple matrix multiplication to demonstrate the operation on the CPU. This approach is simple and effective but affects all TensorFlow computations within the script. Consequently, it might be undesirable for mixed-device scenarios.

For more granular control, TensorFlow allows device placement specifications using the `tf.device()` context manager. This allows us to target specific operations to the CPU while potentially leaving others on the GPU, if desired, although that particular example is not our focus in disabling CuDNN. When I need to perform certain operations purely on the CPU without globally affecting the runtime's ability to use GPUs later in the same script or in other parts of an application, I use this. This provides the granularity needed to isolate the CPU execution of certain layers or computational blocks. This requires specifying the CPU as the target device:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initialize TensorFlow to allow for GPU devices when available, but override in certain sections

# A sample matrix creation on the CPU using tf.device context manager.
with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
    a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
    b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)

print(f"Matrix multiplication result executed on the CPU:\n {c}")

# Sample operation showing default GPU device, if one is available.
a_gpu = tf.constant([[10.0, 11.0],[12.0, 13.0]])
b_gpu = tf.constant([[14.0, 15.0], [16.0, 17.0]])
c_gpu = tf.matmul(a_gpu, b_gpu)
print(f"Matrix multiplication result possibly executed on the GPU (if available):\n {c_gpu}")

# Verify device placement of operation `c` explicitly.
print(f"Device placement of c: {c.device}")

```

Here, the matrix multiplication inside the `tf.device('/CPU:0')` context is explicitly executed on the CPU, despite potential GPU resources being available. The subsequent matrix operations are, by default, placed on the GPU if available. I've used this approach for debugging specific layers by ensuring their execution on CPU, while maintaining the GPU utilization of the rest of the model. This approach allows both CuDNN disabling for specific operations, as well as general device selection. Note that the explicit device of tensor 'c' is printed at the end for verification.

A final method, often used in conjunction with the previous approaches, is explicitly configuring TensorFlow's memory allocation behavior to limit or disable GPU usage. Using the `tf.config.set_visible_devices` to make specific GPUs or CPU devices visible and `tf.config.set_memory_growth` enables more refined control. In many environments where GPU memory is limited, it's beneficial to configure memory allocation. However, this setting does *not* disable CuDNN entirely, rather it restricts memory utilization of the GPU. So while helpful, it is not a direct disabling of CuDNN as is our main goal in this context. I am including a snippet to demonstrate the use of `set_visible_devices` to target only CPU.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Use tf.config to specify only the CPU should be available
physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices()
cpu_devices = [device for device in physical_devices if device.device_type == "CPU"]
tf.config.set_visible_devices(cpu_devices, 'CPU')


# Confirm that only the CPU is available and selected
available_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices()
print("Available Devices after configuration: ")
for device in available_devices:
  print(f" {device}")


# Sample matrix operation to confirm execution is CPU bound.
a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
c = tf.matmul(a, b)
print(f"Result of matrix multiplication: \n {c}")
print(f"Device placement of c: {c.device}")

```

In this example, I explicitly filter the physical devices to contain only CPU type devices, and then make them the only devices TensorFlow considers as available. This further ensures the computations do not use any GPU backends and prevents CuDNN usage. As can be seen, all the tensors are now placed only on the CPU.

For further exploration of these concepts, the TensorFlow documentation provides detailed information on the topics of device placement and execution. Specifically, the sections on "GPU usage" and "tf.config" provide technical depth on how to manage device resources. Additionally, tutorials focused on TensorFlow performance analysis often contain valuable insights on debugging using CPU executions. Lastly, NVIDIA's cuDNN documentation, while not directly focused on disabling its functionality, contains details about its internal workings that may help in understanding its interaction with TensorFlow. These resources, while not directly addressing disabling CuDNN at a high-level within Keras, offer the low level and comprehensive understanding I have come to utilize for such use cases.
