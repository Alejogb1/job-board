Concurrent execution of CPU and GPU functions using threads necessitates a deep understanding of hardware architecture and inter-process communication.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications for seismic data processing highlighted the critical role of asynchronous execution and efficient data transfer between CPU and GPU.  The key lies in leveraging the strengths of each processing unit while mitigating the overheads associated with data movement and synchronization.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Achieving true concurrency, where CPU and GPU computations overlap in time, requires careful design and implementation.  A na√Øve approach of simply launching GPU kernels from CPU threads will often result in significant performance bottlenecks.  The CPU will spend a substantial portion of its time waiting for the GPU to complete its tasks, negating the benefits of parallel processing.

Effective concurrent execution relies on several strategies:

* **Asynchronous Execution:** GPU computations should be launched asynchronously.  Instead of blocking the CPU thread while the GPU performs its work, the CPU thread should continue executing other tasks.  The CPU can then periodically check the status of the GPU computations or utilize asynchronous callbacks to handle completion events. This minimizes CPU idle time.

* **Data Transfer Optimization:** Transferring data between CPU and GPU memory is a major performance bottleneck.  Minimizing data transfers is crucial.  Techniques such as zero-copy mechanisms (where data remains in a shared memory space accessible to both CPU and GPU) and asynchronous data transfers (overlapping data transfers with computation) can significantly improve performance.

* **Task Decomposition:**  The computational task should be intelligently divided into CPU-bound and GPU-bound portions. CPU-bound tasks, such as pre-processing or post-processing steps that benefit from the CPU's cache and low latency memory access, should remain on the CPU.  GPU-bound tasks, such as massive parallel computations like matrix multiplications or image processing, are best suited for GPU execution.

* **Thread Management:**  Appropriate thread management is essential.  For CPU threads, thread pools can be used to manage resources efficiently.  For GPU threads, appropriate kernel configurations (block and thread dimensions) should be chosen to maximize GPU utilization.  Over-subscription of the GPU or inefficient kernel launch parameters can lead to performance degradation.  Careful consideration of thread synchronization mechanisms (e.g., barriers, atomic operations) is also crucial where inter-thread communication is necessary.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate concurrent CPU and GPU execution using CUDA (Nvidia's parallel computing platform).  I will focus on the conceptual aspects rather than providing complete, production-ready code.  Assume necessary includes and initialization have been performed.

**Example 1: Asynchronous Kernel Launch:**

```c++
// CPU thread
cudaStream_t stream;
cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

// Allocate GPU memory
float *d_input, *d_output;
cudaMalloc(&d_input, size);
cudaMalloc(&d_output, size);

// Asynchronous data transfer
cudaMemcpyAsync(d_input, h_input, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);

// Asynchronous kernel launch
kernel<<<blocks, threads, 0, stream>>>(d_input, d_output, size);

// CPU continues processing...

// Check GPU kernel completion
cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);

// Asynchronous data transfer
cudaMemcpyAsync(h_output, d_output, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream);

// Process h_output...

cudaStreamDestroy(stream);
cudaFree(d_input);
cudaFree(d_output);
```

This example demonstrates asynchronous data transfer and kernel launch using CUDA streams.  The CPU thread continues executing while the GPU performs the computation and data transfers. `cudaStreamSynchronize` is used to ensure completion before accessing the results.


**Example 2:  CPU-GPU Task Decomposition:**

```c++
// CPU thread 1: Pre-processing
// ... CPU-bound preprocessing steps on h_data ...
// Transfer pre-processed data to GPU
cudaMemcpy(d_data, h_data, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


// CPU thread 2: Post-processing
// ...waits for GPU computation completion...
cudaMemcpy(h_result, d_result, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
// ... CPU-bound post-processing steps on h_result ...


// GPU thread: Kernel launch
kernel<<<blocks, threads>>>(d_data, d_result, size);
```

This illustrates task decomposition. Pre-processing happens on the CPU, followed by GPU computation, and finally, post-processing on the CPU.  Synchronization is implicitly handled through `cudaMemcpy` in this simplified case.  More sophisticated synchronization mechanisms would be necessary for complex interactions.


**Example 3:  Using CUDA Events for Synchronization:**

```c++
// CPU thread
cudaEvent_t start, stop;
cudaEventCreate(&start);
cudaEventCreate(&stop);

cudaEventRecord(start, stream); // Record start event

// Asynchronous kernel launch and data transfer (as in Example 1)

cudaEventRecord(stop, stream); // Record stop event
cudaEventSynchronize(stop); // Wait for stop event

float milliseconds = 0;
cudaEventElapsedTime(&milliseconds, start, stop);

// Process timing information...

cudaEventDestroy(start);
cudaEventDestroy(stop);
```

This example demonstrates using CUDA events for finer-grained timing and synchronization.  Events allow for precise measurement of kernel execution time and provide a mechanism to synchronize CPU and GPU operations without blocking.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, consult the official CUDA documentation, specialized textbooks on parallel computing and GPU programming, and advanced programming guides for your chosen GPU programming framework (CUDA, OpenCL, SYCL, etc.).  Familiarization with performance analysis tools is also recommended.  Consider exploring publications related to parallel algorithms and their implementations on heterogeneous architectures.  Studying case studies of high-performance computing applications would provide practical insights.
