Efficiently storing integers persistently in Java requires careful consideration of factors such as data size, access patterns, and the overall performance requirements of the application. I've encountered this challenge numerous times in large-scale data processing systems where even a slight optimization in integer storage can yield substantial performance gains. The default Java `int` primitive, while convenient, may not always be the most optimal solution for persistent storage, particularly when dealing with large datasets or specific hardware constraints. There exist several strategies, each with its own trade-offs.

The first, and often most straightforward, approach is using primitive arrays combined with Java's built-in I/O functionalities. Writing and reading a sequence of integer values using `DataOutputStream` and `DataInputStream`, respectively, allows for direct storage of binary representations. The efficiency here stems from avoiding the overhead of object instantiation and garbage collection associated with using `Integer` objects. When sequential access is dominant, this provides the most lightweight storage option. This approach assumes a fixed size for each integer (4 bytes for a Java `int`). While simple, this method lacks structured access and requires explicit management of data boundaries. I've used this for high-throughput data logging tasks where the primary objective was to rapidly write numerical data to disk with minimal latency. Here's a code example demonstrating this basic method:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class IntegerArrayStorage {

    public void writeIntegersToFile(int[] data, String filePath) throws IOException {
        try (DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(filePath))) {
            for (int value : data) {
                dos.writeInt(value);
            }
        }
    }

    public int[] readIntegersFromFile(String filePath) throws IOException {
         try (DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream(filePath))) {
            int[] readData = new int[0];
            while (dis.available() > 0) {
                int value = dis.readInt();
                readData = Arrays.copyOf(readData, readData.length + 1);
                readData[readData.length - 1] = value;

            }
              return readData;

        }
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntegerArrayStorage storage = new IntegerArrayStorage();
        int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        String file = "integers.dat";

        try{
            storage.writeIntegersToFile(numbers,file);
            int[] readNumbers = storage.readIntegersFromFile(file);
            System.out.println("Written integers: "+ Arrays.toString(numbers));
            System.out.println("Read integers: "+Arrays.toString(readNumbers));


        } catch (IOException e) {
           System.out.println("Error during file IO: " + e.getMessage());

        }

    }
}
```

In this example, `writeIntegersToFile` iterates over an integer array and writes each integer's 4-byte representation to a file using a `DataOutputStream`. Conversely, `readIntegersFromFile` reads integer data from the file sequentially.  The `main` method demonstrates the usage by writing and reading example numbers to/from a file.

However, real-world applications often require more sophisticated storage solutions. When needing to quickly search or randomly access specific integers within a persisted dataset, databases become necessary. A relational database (like PostgreSQL or MySQL) provides index structures that optimize lookups. In Java, one would use JDBC to interact with these databases.  While adding the complexity of SQL, this allows for structured storage and provides powerful query capabilities. Databases also manage data integrity and offer transactional support, critical for robust applications. The performance trade-off is the overhead of database interactions.  Iâ€™ve deployed this approach when needing both rapid access to numerical data and a system for maintaining data integrity across multiple application instances.  Here's an illustrative JDBC example:

```java
import java.sql.*;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class IntegerDatabaseStorage {

   private final String url;
    private final String user;
    private final String password;

    public IntegerDatabaseStorage(String url, String user, String password) {
        this.url = url;
        this.user = user;
        this.password = password;
    }

    public void createTable() throws SQLException {
        String sql = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS integers (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, value INTEGER)";
        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
             Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
            statement.executeUpdate(sql);
        }
    }


    public void insertInteger(int value) throws SQLException {
         String sql = "INSERT INTO integers (value) VALUES (?)";
        try(Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
           PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)){

           preparedStatement.setInt(1,value);
           preparedStatement.executeUpdate();


        }
    }

      public List<Integer> getAllIntegers() throws SQLException{

            String sql = "SELECT value FROM integers";
            List<Integer> integers = new ArrayList<>();
        try(Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url,user,password);
        Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
        ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(sql)) {

             while(resultSet.next()) {
                integers.add(resultSet.getInt("value"));
             }

        }

        return integers;
      }

       public static void main(String[] args) {

            String dbUrl = "jdbc:sqlite:intdb.db";
            String dbUser = ""; // for SQLite, no username
            String dbPassword = ""; // for SQLite, no password
            IntegerDatabaseStorage storage = new IntegerDatabaseStorage(dbUrl,dbUser,dbPassword);
            int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

           try {
               storage.createTable();
               for(int num : numbers) {
                  storage.insertInteger(num);
               }
              List<Integer> readNumbers = storage.getAllIntegers();
               System.out.println("Inserted Integers: "+java.util.Arrays.toString(numbers));
               System.out.println("Read integers from database: " + readNumbers);


           } catch (SQLException e) {
                System.out.println("Error during DB operation: " + e.getMessage());
           }
       }
}
```

This `IntegerDatabaseStorage` example uses JDBC to interact with an SQLite database.  The `createTable` method ensures a table named `integers` exists. The `insertInteger` method stores a given integer value in the database and `getAllIntegers` retrieves all saved integers. The `main` method demonstrates adding and retrieving integers. Note the exception handling for dealing with possible database errors, which is crucial in real-world applications.

Finally, for very large datasets or performance-critical applications, memory-mapped files can present a superior option. They allow direct access to file data as if it were in-memory, which eliminates the need for explicit read/write operations.  The operating system handles the mapping and caching, offering performance comparable to direct memory access.  However, this approach demands careful handling of file mappings and synchronization if concurrent access is needed. I have implemented memory-mapped files when I had to handle datasets that were larger than available system RAM but still needed low-latency random access. This approach requires more consideration for the underlying OS but is essential for high-performance storage of large numerical arrays. This next example demonstrates the usage of Memory Mapped File:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.RandomAccessFile;
import java.nio.MappedByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class MemoryMappedIntegerStorage {

    private final String filePath;

    public MemoryMappedIntegerStorage(String filePath) {
        this.filePath = filePath;
    }


    public void writeIntegersToFile(int[] data) throws IOException {

        try (RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(filePath, "rw");
             FileChannel channel = file.getChannel()) {

            MappedByteBuffer buffer = channel.map(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_WRITE, 0, (long) data.length * Integer.BYTES);

            for(int value: data) {
               buffer.putInt(value);
            }


        }
    }

     public List<Integer> readIntegersFromFile() throws IOException {
         List<Integer> integers = new ArrayList<>();

        try (RandomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile(filePath, "r");
             FileChannel channel = file.getChannel()) {


            MappedByteBuffer buffer = channel.map(FileChannel.MapMode.READ_ONLY, 0, channel.size());

            while(buffer.hasRemaining()){
                integers.add(buffer.getInt());

            }

        }

        return integers;
     }
     public static void main(String[] args) {
            String file = "mappedIntegers.dat";
            MemoryMappedIntegerStorage storage = new MemoryMappedIntegerStorage(file);
            int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
            try{
                storage.writeIntegersToFile(numbers);
                List<Integer> readNumbers = storage.readIntegersFromFile();
                 System.out.println("Written integers: "+ java.util.Arrays.toString(numbers));
                 System.out.println("Read integers using memory mapped file: "+ readNumbers);


            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("Error during memory mapped file IO: "+ e.getMessage());
            }
     }
}
```

The `MemoryMappedIntegerStorage` demonstrates how to use memory mapped files. The `writeIntegersToFile` method maps a region of a file into memory and then writes integer data to the mapped buffer. Conversely, the `readIntegersFromFile` method maps a file into memory and then reads the integer values back into a `List`. The `main` method showcases the read and write operations using memory-mapped files.

For further exploration of persistent integer storage in Java, I recommend examining the official Java documentation on I/O streams, JDBC, and NIO package (specifically memory-mapped files). Also, studying design patterns related to data access and storage architectures within a specific framework may provide valuable insight. Books on high-performance Java can provide deeper understanding of the performance implications of each method. Finally, reading professional database documentation provides a more comprehensive view on storage and performance optimizations for SQL databases. Each method presented has its use cases and trade-offs, so careful consideration of the application requirements is crucial for choosing the optimal solution.
