`std::enable_if`'s failure to compile often stems from a misunderstanding of its specialization mechanics and the context in which it's employed.  My experience troubleshooting template metaprogramming, specifically within large-scale C++ projects involving heterogeneous data structures, has revealed that the most common pitfalls arise from incorrect template argument deduction and the interplay between `enable_if` and other template features like SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error).

**1. Clear Explanation**

`std::enable_if` is a template metaprogramming tool used to conditionally enable or disable function or class template overloads based on specific compile-time conditions.  Its core functionality relies on specializing a template based on a boolean expression.  When the expression evaluates to `true`, the specialization is provided; otherwise, it's not, effectively removing that overload from consideration during overload resolution. The crucial point, often missed, is that `enable_if` doesn't directly control compilation; it influences overload selection.  A failed compilation typically doesn't indicate a problem within `enable_if` itself but rather a flaw in how it interacts with the broader template context.

The fundamental structure uses a nested template parameter, usually named `bool_t`,  which defaults to an empty type (`void`) if the condition is false and is specialized to a specific type (`int`, for instance) if the condition is true.  Crucially, the presence or absence of this type influences whether the overload is a viable candidate for the compiler to choose.  If the type is absent (condition false), the overload is silently removed due to SFINAE.

Common causes for compilation failure include:

* **Incorrect Condition Logic:** The boolean expression within `enable_if` might be flawed, always evaluating to `false`, preventing any valid specialization.  This often involves incorrect use of type traits or overly restrictive conditions.
* **Template Argument Deduction Issues:** The compiler's ability to deduce template arguments may be hampered by complex template signatures, conflicting deductions, or the presence of ambiguous function overloads.
* **Incorrect Usage with `std::is_same` or Other Type Traits:** Misuse of type traits can lead to unintended behavior, especially when dealing with complex types or inheritance hierarchies. The condition should meticulously verify the relevant type properties.
* **Interaction with Default Template Arguments:**  Default template arguments can interact unpredictably with `enable_if` if not carefully managed, leading to ambiguous or erroneous specializations.
* **Compiler-Specific Behaviors:** Though rare, subtle differences in compiler implementations regarding template instantiation or SFINAE handling might cause seemingly inexplicable failures.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Incorrect Condition Logic**

```c++
template <typename T, typename std::enable_if<std::is_integral<T>::value && std::is_signed<T>::value, int>::type = 0>
void process(T value) {
  // Process only signed integers
}

int main() {
  process(5); // Compiles
  process(5u); // Fails to compile.  unsigned int is not a signed integer.
}
```

This example demonstrates a correct use of `enable_if`. The function `process` is only enabled if `T` is both integral and signed. The failure to compile when calling `process` with an unsigned integer is expected and demonstrates the intended behavior.  Note the use of `= 0` to provide a default value to avoid issues with default template parameters.

**Example 2: Template Argument Deduction Problems**

```c++
template <typename T, typename U, typename std::enable_if<std::is_same<T,U>::value,int>::type=0>
void compare(T a, U b){
    // only compiles if T and U are same type
}

template <typename T>
void compare(T a, T b) {
  //Generic Comparison (Fallback)
}

int main() {
  compare(5,5); //Compiles and calls the first version
  compare(5,5.0); //Ambiguous - will lead to a compiler error
}
```

Here, the ambiguity arises from the compiler's inability to uniquely determine which overload to use when `T` and `U` are different types. The fallback generic `compare` function is needed to resolve ambiguity when types differ.  Without a distinct fallback, this would lead to a compilation failure.  This highlights the crucial interaction between `enable_if` and overload resolution.

**Example 3:  Improper Usage with Inheritance**

```c++
class Base {};
class Derived : public Base {};

template <typename T, typename std::enable_if<std::is_same<T, Base>::value, int>::type = 0>
void handle(T obj) {
  // Handles only Base objects
}

int main() {
    Base b;
    Derived d;
    handle(b); //Compiles
    handle(d); //Fails to compile. Derived is not Base.
}
```

This example demonstrates the necessity for precise type checking. Using `std::is_same` with inheritance hierarchies requires careful consideration.  `Derived` is not the same type as `Base`, even though it inherits from it; thus, the `enable_if` condition correctly prevents compilation.  To handle derived types, different type traits (e.g., `std::is_base_of`) might be necessary depending on the desired behavior.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of template metaprogramming in C++, I recommend consulting the following:

* The C++ Standard Template Library documentation (specifically sections on type traits and template metaprogramming).
* Advanced C++ textbooks that cover template metaprogramming in detail.
* Articles and blog posts by experts specializing in C++ template techniques.  Pay close attention to examples illustrating SFINAE and overload resolution.


Through rigorous testing and careful analysis of compiler error messages, alongside a solid understanding of template metaprogramming principles, one can effectively diagnose and resolve issues involving `std::enable_if`.  The key is to recognize that `enable_if`'s role is to influence overload resolution, not to directly control compilation; failure often reveals flaws in the broader template context rather than within `enable_if` itself.  The examples provided illustrate common pitfalls and highlight strategies for developing robust and reliable template code.
