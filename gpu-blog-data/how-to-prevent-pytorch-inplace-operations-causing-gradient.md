In my experience debugging PyTorch models, a recurring and often perplexing issue stems from the unintended consequences of inplace operations during backpropagation. Specifically, modifying tensors directly, rather than creating new ones, can lead to incorrect gradient computations, resulting in training instability or outright failures. This arises because PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine relies on retaining intermediate values of tensors for the backward pass, and inplace modifications can obliterate those required values.

The core mechanism at play is PyTorch's computation graph. During the forward pass, each operation on a tensor creates a node in this graph, tracking how the tensor was derived. This allows the backward pass to compute gradients by backpropagating through the graph, applying the chain rule. However, inplace operations circumvent this tracking by altering the tensor directly, without creating a new node in the graph. If a tensor that was modified inplace is required to calculate gradients upstream, PyTorch will attempt to use the modified value, leading to inconsistent calculations. Consequently, the computed gradients become incorrect and ultimately compromise the learning process.

I’ve found that the most common culprit behind this issue is the use of the `+=` operator or methods with an `_` suffix, such as `add_()`, `mul_()`, and `clamp_()`. These methods modify the tensor on which they’re invoked directly rather than returning a new tensor. Similarly, in-place indexing assignments like `tensor[mask] = value` can also induce this problem if a tensor is needed later in the computation graph.

To avoid this, a basic principle is to always use non-inplace tensor operations or explicitly create a copy of the tensor before modification when the original might still be used. For arithmetic operations, use operators like `+` or `*`, which create new tensors, or functions like `torch.add()` and `torch.mul()`. For indexing assignments, using masked operations `tensor.masked_fill_(mask, value)` is generally safer than directly assigning values through indexing `tensor[mask] = value`. If a tensor needs to be updated, assign the modified tensor to the original variable name; this creates a new tensor that the computation graph can reliably track, but retains the original variable name.

Let’s illustrate these concepts with concrete examples:

**Example 1: Incorrect Inplace Addition**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)
z = x + y
x += 1 # Incorrect: modifies x inplace

loss = torch.sum(z)
loss.backward()

print("Gradient of x:", x.grad) #Incorrect gradient
print("Gradient of y:", y.grad)
```

In this example, `x += 1` alters the tensor `x` inplace *after* `z` was calculated using the initial values of `x` and `y`. Consequently, when we execute `loss.backward()`, PyTorch incorrectly computes the gradient, potentially causing an error in gradient descent. The gradient of `x` should be `[1.0, 1.0]`, but it will likely be garbage. It's important to note, the gradient of `x` here is `None` because it's no longer a part of the calculation graph as the inplace addition was performed after the operation with `z`.

**Example 2: Correct Non-Inplace Addition**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)
z = x + y
x = x + 1 # Correct: reassigning x to a new tensor

loss = torch.sum(z)
loss.backward()

print("Gradient of x:", x.grad) # No gradient on the modified tensor
print("Gradient of y:", y.grad) # Gradient of [1,1]
```

Here, `x = x + 1` replaces the original tensor assigned to `x` with a new tensor created by adding 1. The original tensor used in the calculation of `z` is retained, and the backward pass works correctly. The gradient is only calculated on `y` since `x` was reassigned. This illustrates the key difference: we aren't directly modifying the original value of `x`, which is still used by the computation graph, but creating a new tensor and assigning it to the variable `x`. This retains the correct chain of operations needed to backpropagate.

**Example 3: Handling Inplace Operations with Copies**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)
z = x + y
x_copy = x.clone()  # Create a copy for inplace operations
x_copy += 1   # Inplace operation on the copy

loss = torch.sum(z)
loss.backward()

print("Gradient of x:", x.grad) # Gradient of [1.0, 1.0]
print("Gradient of y:", y.grad) # Gradient of [1.0, 1.0]
```
In this example, we created a copy `x_copy` of `x` before performing the inplace operation on the copy and, therefore, we retain the gradient on the original variable `x`. The original `x` is untouched by the `x_copy += 1` so the backward pass has the correct values on which to back propagate. If the inplace addition needed to be reflected in a subsequent calculation, the copied value could be used in the subsequent calculation:

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)
z = x + y
x_copy = x.clone()  # Create a copy for inplace operations
x_copy += 1   # Inplace operation on the copy
w = x_copy + 2
loss = torch.sum(w)
loss.backward()

print("Gradient of x:", x.grad) # Gradient of None
print("Gradient of y:", y.grad) # Gradient of None
```
In the second example, since `w` does not rely on `x` directly the gradient with respect to `x` will be none and the gradient with respect to `y` will be none since `y` was never part of the calculation. In the first example, `z` used the original tensor associated with `x`, so when we calculate the loss based on `z` the original tensor associated with `x` was still within the calculation graph.

To summarize, I've found that consistently adhering to non-inplace operations, or explicitly making copies of tensors prior to using inplace operators, drastically reduces the chance of encountering gradient computation errors. These seemingly small adjustments are critical for creating stable and reliable PyTorch models. When I've seen errors during the backpropagation process, specifically an incorrect gradient or 'None' gradients, a root cause investigation typically leads me to these subtle places where inplace operators were used unintentionally.

For further learning, I would recommend studying the official PyTorch documentation on autograd and the computation graph. Several online tutorials and blogs provide valuable insights into the nuances of autograd and best practices for gradient calculations, but caution should be taken with specific implementations. Additionally, delving into the source code of PyTorch’s autograd functions can offer a more thorough understanding of how these computations work under the hood, even if the user does not intend to modify the implementation.
