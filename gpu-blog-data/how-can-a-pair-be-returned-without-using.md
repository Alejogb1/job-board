Returning a pair of values without employing a temporary variable hinges on understanding how function return values are handled at the compiler/interpreter level and leveraging language-specific features.  My experience optimizing high-performance C++ applications for financial modeling frequently necessitated such techniques to minimize memory allocations and improve execution speed.  The fundamental constraint is the inability to directly return multiple distinct values using a single return statement in many languages unless employing specific mechanisms.

The primary approach revolves around leveraging the language's ability to return structured data types.  This avoids the need for a temporary variable because the pair of values is encapsulated within a single return object.  The implementation differs across languages, but the core concept remains consistent.

**1. Explanation:**

The illusion of avoiding a temporary variable is achieved by encapsulating the values into a composite data structure before returning.  This structure, which could be a tuple, struct, class, or similar, is then passed back as a single unit.  From the calling function's perspective, it appears as if two values were returned, but under the hood, the compiler/interpreter handles the return of a single object containing both values.  The efficiency gain stems from avoiding the overhead of creating and subsequently destroying a temporary variable to hold the pair before returning it.

This differs significantly from using a dynamically allocated structure where explicit memory management comes into play.  Using a stack-allocated structure avoids the performance penalties of heap allocation and deallocation.

**2. Code Examples:**

**2.1. C++ using `std::pair`:**

```cpp
#include <utility>

std::pair<int, double> calculateValues(int input) {
  int result1 = input * 2;
  double result2 = input / 2.0;
  return std::pair<int, double>(result1, result2); //No temporary variable needed.
}

int main() {
  auto results = calculateValues(10);
  int val1 = results.first;
  double val2 = results.second;
  // ... further processing ...
  return 0;
}
```

Here, `std::pair` is a standard template library (STL) container designed precisely for this purpose. The compiler directly constructs the `std::pair` object on the stack, and this object is then returned.  No intermediate variable is required to hold `result1` and `result2` separately before creating the `std::pair`. This method benefits from the efficiency inherent in `std::pair`, being optimized for this specific use case.  Furthermore, using `auto` enhances readability and reduces verbosity.

**2.2. Python using Tuples:**

```python
def calculate_values(input_value):
  result1 = input_value * 2
  result2 = input_value / 2.0
  return (result1, result2)  # Tuple returned directly.

result_tuple = calculate_values(10)
val1, val2 = result_tuple #Tuple unpacking

print(val1, val2)
```

Python's tuples provide an elegant way to return multiple values.  The tuple is created in-line and returned without involving a temporary variable.  Note that Python's dynamic typing contributes to the apparent simplicity; however, internally, the tuple is still a single object being returned.  Tuple unpacking, as demonstrated above, provides a clean way to assign the individual components in the calling function.

**2.3.  Java using a custom class:**

```java
class ResultPair {
    public int value1;
    public double value2;

    public ResultPair(int v1, double v2) {
        value1 = v1;
        value2 = v2;
    }
}

class MainClass {
    public static ResultPair calculateValues(int input) {
        int result1 = input * 2;
        double result2 = input / 2.0;
        return new ResultPair(result1, result2); // No temporary variable needed
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ResultPair results = calculateValues(10);
        int val1 = results.value1;
        double val2 = results.value2;
        // ... further processing
    }
}
```

In Java, where tuples are not directly supported, we define a custom class `ResultPair` to encapsulate the two values. This approach mirrors the C++ example using `std::pair` but requires explicit class definition.  The `ResultPair` object is constructed and returned directly; no additional temporary storage is utilized. This highlights the importance of choosing appropriate data structures according to language paradigms and limitations.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of compiler optimization and data structures, I recommend studying compiler design texts, advanced programming textbooks focusing on the chosen language, and exploring the documentation for relevant standard libraries (e.g., STL in C++, Java Collections Framework).  Understanding memory management techniques, particularly stack vs. heap allocation, is crucial in optimizing code for performance.  Furthermore, reviewing best practices for software design and object-oriented principles will reinforce the effectiveness of using structured data types in place of numerous individual variables.  In-depth analysis of assembly language output can reveal the actual memory operations executed by the compiler.
