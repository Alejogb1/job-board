Yes, PyTorch wheels can be built without CUDA support. This is a common requirement for developers targeting CPU-only environments, or who do not require GPU acceleration for all their work. My experience spanning several projects has involved frequently constructing such CPU-only wheels, primarily for CI/CD pipelines and server deployments where specialized GPU hardware is either absent or underutilized for inference workloads. These builds are fundamentally different from those utilizing CUDA, focusing instead on optimized CPU libraries and avoiding the complexities and dependencies inherent to CUDA development.

The core of building PyTorch without CUDA centers around the `cmake` configuration process which detects and includes (or omits) CUDA-related libraries. During this phase, when CUDA paths or options are not explicitly specified or are disabled via build flags, the build system automatically configures PyTorch to link against CPU-based linear algebra backends such as Intel’s MKL or OpenBLAS. Consequently, the resulting wheel lacks CUDA bindings. This ensures that the installed PyTorch library solely relies on CPU computation for tensor operations and related functionality. This process extends beyond just omitting CUDA kernels; it involves the conditional compilation of source code ensuring no accidental CUDA code is introduced when constructing a CPU-only wheel. The primary motivation behind this is not simply removal but the construction of a lean, highly portable distribution that does not burden a system with unnecessary CUDA drivers and dependencies when they will never be employed. This separation of concerns is crucial for maintaining efficiency and avoiding conflicts within diverse environments.

To elaborate, consider a default PyTorch build which inherently attempts to detect and integrate CUDA. This includes linking against the CUDA toolkit, compiling kernel code for execution on NVIDIA GPUs, and embedding CUDA libraries within the wheel. Removing this necessitates that we inform the build system, usually through `cmake`, that CUDA is explicitly to be excluded. Failing to correctly specify this would lead to a build that will either fail in the absence of CUDA or introduce unnecessary CUDA dependencies even though GPU computation might never be used. The crucial step involves setting specific configuration flags or environment variables, preventing the build system from attempting to locate CUDA libraries and thereby disabling CUDA support throughout the library compilation.

Let's illustrate with a few examples that mirror real-world scenarios I've encountered:

**Example 1: Direct `cmake` configuration**

```bash
cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
    -DUSE_CUDA=OFF \
    -DUSE_MKLDNN=ON \
    -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$(which python) \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
```

Here, `-DUSE_CUDA=OFF` is paramount. It explicitly tells the CMake build system that CUDA support is to be excluded from the build. `-DUSE_MKLDNN=ON` leverages Intel’s MKL-DNN library for CPU-optimized deep learning primitives. The remaining flags specify the build type as release, enable shared libraries, point to the correct Python interpreter and set an install directory. This `cmake` command would be followed by `make install` and subsequently the wheel creation step using Python's packaging tools. This type of configuration is what I used on numerous occasions for our internal research systems before the use of automated builders. Failure to set `-DUSE_CUDA=OFF` here would result in a build attempting to use CUDA.

**Example 2: Using Environment Variables**

```bash
export USE_CUDA=0
export USE_MKLDNN=1
export BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=1
export CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
python setup.py bdist_wheel --install-dir dist
```

In this case, instead of direct `cmake` arguments, we set environment variables. Many build systems for complex projects like PyTorch will pick up these environment variable values and pass them to `cmake` or equivalent underlying mechanisms. Setting `USE_CUDA=0` effectively disables CUDA support, while `USE_MKLDNN=1` allows optimized CPU utilization. I've often seen this type of configuration used when interacting with existing build automation systems that might already be using environment variables. This pattern simplifies the build process and can avoid modifying the build scripts directly.

**Example 3: Using `setup.py` Directly**

```python
# Within the setup.py file or a similar build configuration script.
from setuptools import setup
from torch.utils.cpp_extension import CppExtension, BuildExtension

setup(
    name="torch",
    ext_modules=[
         CppExtension(
             name="torch._C",
             sources=["torch/_C.cpp"], # Replace with actual files.
              extra_compile_args=['-DUSE_CUDA=0','-DUSE_MKLDNN=1',]
         )
    ],
    cmdclass={'build_ext': BuildExtension},
)
```

This final example shows how CUDA could be disabled directly within a Python build script like `setup.py`. I have found this useful in simplifying customization. When the build extension is defined we can pass compile flags using `extra_compile_args` where CUDA can be disabled through the `-DUSE_CUDA=0` flag, again directing the underlying build process to exclude CUDA. Further flags, like enabling MKL, would be included in a similar manner. This approach allows for the definition of complex build logic directly within a build script. This was particularly useful when building with specific build tools or when needing to fine-tune the compiler options. While PyTorch itself does not provide this option directly it is feasible if a custom build script is written for specific needs.

The resulting wheel from all three of these examples is self-contained. The library does not attempt to access any CUDA libraries, and all tensor calculations and operations will occur on the CPU. It lacks the GPU-acceleration capacity provided by a CUDA-enabled build and is thus appropriate for deployment or development on CPU-only architectures. Moreover, the build process is generally significantly faster since kernel compilation for GPU is a resource-intensive task which is completely avoided.

Regarding resources for further study, several documentation sources are available. Documentation for the `cmake` utility itself is an essential reference. Specifically, information regarding variable definitions and conditional compilation can be extremely useful. Furthermore, understanding the structure of Python package creation using `setuptools`, and how build extensions are defined, will aid in creating customized builds tailored to specific environments. Finally, in-depth documentation on the inner workings of linear algebra libraries such as Intel MKL and OpenBLAS will assist with optimizing CPU performance for deep learning operations when CUDA is not an option. Reviewing these three documentation areas will provide a firm grasp on the processes, parameters, and nuances when creating PyTorch builds without CUDA.
