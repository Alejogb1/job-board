Formulating problems in CVX for MATLAB 2020b hinges on a precise understanding of its underlying cone programming architecture.  My experience optimizing large-scale power system control problems using CVX solidified this understanding:  the efficiency and numerical stability heavily depend on how accurately you represent your problem within CVX's framework.  Misrepresenting constraints or the objective function can lead to either incorrect solutions or, worse, silent failures that produce seemingly plausible but fundamentally flawed results.  The key lies in recognizing that CVX translates your problem into a standard form suitable for interior-point solvers.  Understanding this translation process is paramount.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

CVX operates by abstracting away the underlying solver.  You express your problem using familiar mathematical notation, and CVX handles the conversion to a solvable form. This means adhering to CVX's rules and recognizing the limitations is critical.  Crucially, CVX can only handle problems expressible as convex optimization problems. Non-convex problems, even those seemingly simple, will either fail to parse or yield inaccurate results.  The core components you'll work with are:

* **Variables:** These are declared using the `variable` command, specifying dimensions and (optionally) constraints such as non-negativity.
* **Objective Function:** This is specified using the `minimize` or `maximize` keywords, followed by an expression involving the variables.  The expression must be convex (for minimization) or concave (for maximization).
* **Constraints:**  These define relationships between variables and are specified using standard mathematical notation, employing operators and functions supported by CVX.  These constraints, too, must be convex.

The fundamental challenge lies in translating your problem's mathematical formulation into a representation that CVX understands as convex.  This often requires a careful reformulation of the original problem, possibly involving substitutions or transformations to achieve convexity.  Furthermore, the efficiency of the solution process depends heavily on the problem structure.  Exploiting sparsity within your problem definition can significantly improve solution times, especially for large-scale problems, a lesson I learned while working on distributed sensor network optimization.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Linear Programming**

```matlab
cvx_begin
    variable x(3)
    minimize( c'*x )
    subject to
        A*x <= b;
        x >= 0;
cvx_end
```

This example demonstrates a simple linear program.  `c` and `b` are vectors, and `A` is a matrix, all pre-defined.  The objective function is a linear function of `x`, and the constraints are linear inequalities.  The non-negativity constraint on `x` is explicitly stated.  The clarity and simplicity directly map to the underlying mathematical formulation.  This is a foundational example, representing a large class of solvable problems.

**Example 2: Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP)**

```matlab
cvx_begin
    variable x(2)
    minimize( norm(x,2) )
    subject to
        A*x == b;
cvx_end
```

This showcases a SOCP problem.  The objective function is the Euclidean norm of `x`, a convex function.  The constraint is a linear equality constraint.  CVX automatically recognizes the norm as defining a second-order cone, thus correctly translating the problem to its interior-point solver. This demonstrates handling non-linear but still convex objectives. Note that  `norm(x,2)` could be substituted with `sqrt(x'*x)` but the former improves readability and may provide computational advantages as CVX likely employs optimized internal representations.

**Example 3: Semidefinite Programming (SDP)**

```matlab
cvx_begin sdp
    variable X(3,3) symmetric
    minimize( trace(C*X) )
    subject to
        trace(A(:,:,1)*X) == b(1);
        trace(A(:,:,2)*X) == b(2);
        X >= 0; % Positive semidefinite constraint
cvx_end
```

This exemplifies a SDP, a more complex class of convex optimization problems.  `X` is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix variable.  The objective function is linear in `X`, and the constraints involve linear trace operators.  The `sdp` keyword instructs CVX to handle the positive semidefinite constraint on `X`.  This illustrates the ability to work with matrix variables and the importance of correctly specifying constraint types for efficient solution.  Improperly defining `X` without the `symmetric` keyword would lead to an error.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CVX User's Guide, provided with the CVX package, is an indispensable resource.  A strong grasp of linear algebra and convex optimization theory is crucial.  Textbooks on convex optimization, particularly those covering cone programming, offer substantial theoretical background.  Familiarizing yourself with the capabilities and limitations of different solvers integrated with CVX can be beneficial for advanced usage and performance tuning.  Finally,  working through numerous examples, starting with simpler problems and gradually increasing complexity, is essential for developing proficiency in CVX. This iterative approach, based on understanding both theoretical fundamentals and practical implementation, will solidify your understanding of the framework and its capabilities.  Carefully studying the error messages provided by CVX during problem formulation is also a significant source of learning.  My own journey with CVX heavily relied on this systematic approach.
