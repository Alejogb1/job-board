The crucial aspect to understand when working with LSTMs in Keras to obtain per-timestep results is the inherent sequential nature of the model and how this impacts output shaping.  Unlike simpler neural networks, LSTMs process sequences, producing an output at each step of the input sequence.  This output, however, is often misinterpreted due to the default output configuration.  In my experience, wrestling with this issue for several years while developing time-series anomaly detection systems, I've encountered this misunderstanding repeatedly.  The key lies in properly configuring the `return_sequences` parameter within the LSTM layer.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

An LSTM layer, when used in a Keras sequential model, processes an input sequence one step at a time. The internal state of the LSTM is updated at each step, influenced by both the current input and the previous state.  The `return_sequences` parameter dictates what the LSTM outputs. By default, `return_sequences=False`, the LSTM only returns the output vector corresponding to the final timestep of the input sequence.  To obtain outputs at each timestep, this parameter *must* be set to `True`. This results in an output tensor where the first dimension represents the batch size, the second represents the timesteps, and the third represents the output features.  Crucially, the model's final layer must also be compatible with this multi-dimensional output.  If you are attempting to predict a single value per timestep, a dense layer with a single neuron is appropriate.  For multi-variate prediction at each timestep, increase the neuron count in the dense layer accordingly.  Failing to account for this multi-dimensional output often leads to errors concerning tensor shapes during model compilation and prediction.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Single-variate prediction per timestep.**

This example demonstrates a simple model predicting a single value (e.g., temperature) at each timestep.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Define the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=64, activation='relu', return_sequences=True, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    Dense(units=1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Generate sample data (replace with your own)
timesteps = 10
features = 1
X = np.random.rand(100, timesteps, features)
y = np.random.rand(100, timesteps, 1)

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
print(predictions.shape) # Output: (100, 10, 1) - 100 samples, 10 timesteps, 1 feature
```

The `return_sequences=True` is key here.  The output shape reflects the predicted values for each timestep of each input sequence.  Note the use of `input_shape` defining the number of timesteps and features in the input data.  This is essential for correct model definition.  The final Dense layer has a single unit, reflecting the single-variate nature of the prediction.


**Example 2: Multi-variate prediction per timestep.**

This example extends the previous one to predict multiple values (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure) at each timestep.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Define the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=128, activation='tanh', return_sequences=True, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    Dense(units=3) # Predicting 3 variables
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='mse')

# Generate sample data (replace with your own)
timesteps = 20
features = 1
X = np.random.rand(50, timesteps, features)
y = np.random.rand(50, timesteps, 3) # 3 output variables

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=20)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
print(predictions.shape) # Output: (50, 20, 3) - 50 samples, 20 timesteps, 3 features
```

The critical difference here is the `units=3` in the final Dense layer, allowing for three output variables per timestep. The input data `y` reflects this multi-variate output structure.  Experimentation with different activation functions (`relu`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`) within the LSTM and Dense layers can be beneficial depending on the characteristics of your data and target variables.


**Example 3:  Handling variable-length sequences.**

Real-world datasets often have sequences of varying lengths.  Padding is a common technique to handle this.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Generate sample data with variable lengths (replace with your own)
sequences = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]
labels = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 0], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]] # Padded labels


max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_len, padding='post', value=0)
padded_labels = pad_sequences(labels, maxlen=max_len, padding='post', value=0)


# Reshape for LSTM input (samples, timesteps, features)
X = padded_sequences.reshape(len(padded_sequences), max_len, 1)
y = padded_labels.reshape(len(padded_labels), max_len, 1)

# Define the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(units=32, activation='relu', return_sequences=True, input_shape=(max_len, 1)),
    Dense(units=1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X)
print(predictions.shape) # Output: (3, 5, 1) - 3 samples, max_length 5 timesteps, 1 feature

```

This example leverages `pad_sequences` to ensure all sequences have the same length, a prerequisite for many Keras models.  Padding with a consistent value (here, 0) ensures that the model processes all sequences uniformly.  The final output shape reflects the padded sequence length. Remember to appropriately handle the padded values during evaluation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official Keras documentation on LSTMs and recurrent layers.  Furthermore, several textbooks on deep learning and time series analysis provide comprehensive coverage of recurrent neural networks.  Finally, numerous research papers delve into the specifics of LSTM architectures and applications.  Reviewing these resources will solidify your understanding of sequence modeling and LSTMs within the Keras framework.  Focus on sections that discuss sequence-to-sequence models and the role of the `return_sequences` parameter.  Pay close attention to the intricacies of input and output shaping to avoid common pitfalls.
