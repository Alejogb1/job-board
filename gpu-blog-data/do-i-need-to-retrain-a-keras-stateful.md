The core misconception underlying the question of retraining a Keras stateful LSTM for each prediction stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the "stateful" attribute within the LSTM layer.  My experience debugging production-level time series forecasting models has repeatedly highlighted this issue.  Contrary to the intuition that a stateful LSTM requires complete retraining after every prediction, it leverages its internal hidden state to process sequential data efficiently, making per-prediction retraining unnecessary and computationally wasteful.  The stateful attribute dictates how the hidden state is managed across batches, not individual predictions.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

A Keras stateful LSTM, unlike its stateless counterpart, maintains its internal hidden state across consecutive batches.  This state encapsulates information learned from prior time steps, enabling the model to understand temporal dependencies within the input sequence.  This is crucial for time series analysis and sequential data processing where the context of previous data points is critical for accurate prediction.  Setting `stateful=True` in the LSTM layer configuration is what enables this behavior.  Critically, this state persistence operates *across batches*, not individual data points.  Therefore, processing a single new data point does not necessitate retraining.  Instead, it involves feeding the new point into the model, and the existing internal state is updated accordingly to generate a prediction. Subsequent predictions within the same batch will continue to leverage the updated state.


The process involves several steps:

1. **Initialization:** The LSTM's hidden state is initialized (typically to zeros) before the first batch is processed.

2. **Batch Processing:**  The model processes a batch of sequential data.  The internal state is updated after each time step within the batch and preserved until the next batch.

3. **State Reset (Optional):** If you are dealing with independent sequences, you must reset the state between sequences to avoid information leakage. This is achieved by calling `model.reset_states()` before processing a new sequence.

4. **Prediction:** After feeding a batch (or single data point in the case of a batch size of one), the model outputs its prediction. The internal state is modified but the model's weights remain unchanged.


Retraining involves adjusting the model's weights via backpropagation based on training data and a loss function. This is a computationally intensive process.  For a stateful LSTM, retraining for every single prediction would be incredibly inefficient and entirely unnecessary.  The state management mechanism already incorporates the learned temporal dependencies.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Stateless LSTM (for comparison)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(timesteps, features)), # timesteps and features depend on data
    Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# For each prediction, the whole batch needs to be fed.
# No state is preserved between predictions; each prediction is independent.
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
```

This example showcases a stateless LSTM. Each prediction is independent and requires the model to process the entire input sequence.  There's no concept of a preserved state, making it significantly less efficient for sequential data.


**Example 2: Stateful LSTM with batch processing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(timesteps, features), stateful=True, batch_size=batch_size),
    Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Processing multiple sequences in batches:
for i in range(num_batches):
    model.fit(train_data[i*batch_size:(i+1)*batch_size], train_labels[i*batch_size:(i+1)*batch_size], epochs=1, shuffle=False)
    model.reset_states() # Reset state before processing next batch, if batches represent different sequences.

#Prediction using a batch size of 1.  No retraining needed.
predictions = model.predict(test_data, batch_size=1)

```

This example demonstrates a stateful LSTM processing data in batches. The `stateful=True` attribute allows the model to maintain its internal state. Importantly, the `batch_size` is specified within the LSTM layer.  The `reset_states()` function is used to clear the state between batches if each batch represents a unique sequence. For single predictions, you'd use a batch size of 1.

**Example 3: Stateful LSTM with single data point prediction**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
import numpy as np

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(1, features), stateful=True, batch_size=1), #Timesteps=1 for single data points
    Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

#Assume data is preprocessed and scaled appropriately.
new_data_point = np.array([[new_features]]) # Reshape to match input_shape

prediction = model.predict(new_data_point)

#Note that we don't retrain the model!
```

This example emphasizes predicting with single data points. The `input_shape` is adjusted to accommodate the single time step, and the `batch_size` is set to 1. This illustrates the core point: No retraining is performed for each new prediction.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The Keras documentation on recurrent layers, particularly the LSTM layer.  Pay close attention to the `stateful` parameter and its implications.
*   A comprehensive textbook on deep learning covering recurrent neural networks and LSTM architectures.  Understanding the underlying mathematics will solidify your comprehension.
*   Explore research papers on LSTM applications in time series forecasting.  Reviewing how practitioners utilize these models in real-world scenarios can provide valuable insights.  Consider focusing on papers which address multi-step ahead forecasting or sequence classification with LSTMs.


In summary, retraining a Keras stateful LSTM for each prediction is unnecessary and computationally expensive. The model efficiently manages its internal state to process sequential data, utilizing the learned information from preceding steps without requiring repeated weight adjustments.  The key is understanding the distinction between batch processing and the need to reset the state for independent sequences. Employing appropriate batch sizes and strategically using `model.reset_states()` are critical to achieving both efficiency and prediction accuracy.
