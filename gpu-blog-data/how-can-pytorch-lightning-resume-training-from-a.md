PyTorch Lightning’s checkpointing mechanism, designed for efficient fault tolerance and iterative model improvement, doesn't inherently handle the introduction of completely novel data without specific configuration. The core challenge resides in reconciling the saved training state with a potentially altered dataset structure, batch size implications, and the associated dataloader. Standard loading of a checkpoint assumes an identical dataset and training loop. Failing to address this results in unpredictable behavior, ranging from data mismatches to errors arising from mismatched data lengths. I’ve encountered this firsthand while working on a large-scale image segmentation project where data collection was an ongoing process, necessitating checkpoint-based resumption with frequently expanding training sets.

The principal obstacle stems from the `Trainer`’s internal state management. During training, the `Trainer` tracks the number of training steps, epochs completed, and a variety of other metadata alongside the model parameters. When resuming from a checkpoint, the `Trainer` attempts to continue training based on this state, referencing the dataloader defined at the start of training. If the new data leads to an increase or decrease in dataset size, without appropriate modification, the `Trainer` can begin looping improperly or throwing indexing errors. This is because the saved training state isn't automatically aware of the new size. A primary concern thus lies in how PyTorch Lightning tracks progress in terms of iterations, particularly given that dataloaders can produce batches of different sizes based on dataset length.

To handle the introduction of new data, one must consider modifying the dataloader or potentially using the `Trainer`'s `fit` method with the option to override the data. Simply loading the checkpoint alone will not suffice. Several strategies exist, with the best choice depending on the scale of the data change. I've found that the most robust approaches entail either updating the existing dataloader with the new data or creating a new dataloader and using `Trainer`'s `fit` to initialize an epoch start, specifically utilizing `ckpt_path` along with providing a `train_dataloader` and `val_dataloader` or a `train_dataloaders` and `val_dataloaders`. This method, when properly implemented, ensures the training loop restarts correctly, aligned with the new data volume and structure.

Let's examine some concrete examples. I’ve used a simplified image classification scenario for illustration. Assume initially that I have a `MyLightningModule` and a `MyDataset` that produces image and label tensors. Initial training is done with `Trainer.fit(model, train_dataloader, val_dataloader)`. Assume that we've checkpointed this training at some point `checkpoint.ckpt` and that we have new data available, leading to `new_dataset`. The base case, without any changes, is where the problems arise.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import pytorch_lightning as pl

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data, labels):
        self.data = data
        self.labels = labels

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx], self.labels[idx]

class MyLightningModule(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.model(x)

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        x, y = batch
        y_hat = self(x)
        loss = nn.functional.cross_entropy(y_hat, y)
        self.log('train_loss', loss)
        return loss

    def configure_optimizers(self):
        optimizer = optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
        return optimizer

if __name__ == '__main__':
    #Initial setup (simplified for brevity)
    data = torch.rand(100, 10)
    labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))
    dataset = MyDataset(data, labels)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=16)
    
    # Initial training
    model = MyLightningModule()
    trainer = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=2)
    trainer.fit(model, dataloader)
    trainer.save_checkpoint("checkpoint.ckpt")

    # Simulate new data
    new_data = torch.rand(150, 10) # increased dataset size.
    new_labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (150,))
    new_dataset = MyDataset(new_data, new_labels)
    new_dataloader = DataLoader(new_dataset, batch_size=16)

    # Incorrect way (attempt to load checkpoint and run fit)
    model_resumed = MyLightningModule()
    trainer_resumed = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=2) # max_epochs needs to be the *additional* epochs if you want to train for a total of 4 epochs here
    trainer_resumed.fit(model_resumed, train_dataloaders = new_dataloader, ckpt_path="checkpoint.ckpt")  # Potential issues
```

In this first example, I demonstrate the common mistake of attempting to load a checkpoint and then simply provide a new dataloader to `fit`. This might appear to continue training, but internally there can be inconsistencies, such as how the number of training steps per epoch is calculated, or potential misalignments with callbacks depending on what is saved within the checkpoint. This will likely result in an error as the `Trainer` still has the initial dataloader dimensions within its internal state.

To correctly resume training with a new dataloader that accounts for the increased dataset size, a strategy that explicitly uses a new dataloader within `Trainer.fit` needs to be applied. The below code block demonstrates how that is done.

```python
    # Correct Way (reinitialize dataloader)
    model_resumed_2 = MyLightningModule()
    trainer_resumed_2 = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=2)
    trainer_resumed_2.fit(model_resumed_2, train_dataloaders=new_dataloader, ckpt_path="checkpoint.ckpt")
```

In the second example, I reinitialize the dataloader using the new dataset within the trainer's fit method. The crucial aspect here is using `train_dataloaders = new_dataloader`.  This tells the `Trainer` that the dataset's characteristics have changed and uses the new data with respect to epoch length and batch size calculation. If multiple dataloaders are needed in the model, use `train_dataloaders` with a list of dataloaders.  If a validation dataloader is used, this has to be specified again as `val_dataloaders = new_val_dataloader`. This approach is preferred because the internal state of the trainer will be recalculated and correctly aligned with the new data configuration.

Finally, consider the scenario where the dataset is not replaced but extended. Assume that `new_data` is appended to the initial `data` tensor. Here, only the dataloader is updated:

```python
    #  Correct way (extended data)
    extended_data = torch.cat((data, new_data), dim=0)
    extended_labels = torch.cat((labels, new_labels), dim=0)
    extended_dataset = MyDataset(extended_data, extended_labels)
    extended_dataloader = DataLoader(extended_dataset, batch_size=16)

    model_resumed_3 = MyLightningModule()
    trainer_resumed_3 = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=2)
    trainer_resumed_3.fit(model_resumed_3, train_dataloaders = extended_dataloader, ckpt_path="checkpoint.ckpt")
```

In the third example, I demonstrate how to extend the dataset and update the dataloader, but this approach is equivalent to the previous one if you were to create a new dataset entirely. The key difference is that the original dataset’s information is preserved in this scenario. Regardless, the `Trainer` requires a new dataloader. In each of the correct scenarios, the training will resume where it left off, but using the characteristics of the new dataset, allowing for efficient training using the previously saved information.

In conclusion, when resuming training in PyTorch Lightning, the new dataset must be accounted for by either using a new dataloader (or list of dataloaders) within the `fit` call, and setting `ckpt_path` correctly.  Simply loading from the checkpoint using the same `Trainer` and providing new data loaders or modifying the old dataloader will not be enough. The `Trainer` must recalculate its internal state with the new data configuration.  For further insights, refer to PyTorch Lightning's documentation, tutorials on efficient training practices, and community resources focused on managing dataset updates during deep learning workflows. Specific attention should be given to sections describing dataloaders and the `Trainer`'s `fit` method. Additionally, investigating topics such as adaptive batch size strategies, custom callbacks for handling dataset transitions, and robust error handling during checkpoint loading can further streamline development in similar scenarios.
