The core challenge in leveraging SciPy optimizers within TensorFlow 2.0 for neural network training lies in the inherent design differences: TensorFlow optimizers are deeply integrated with its computational graph and automatic differentiation capabilities, whereas SciPy optimizers operate on standalone functions.  Direct substitution is impossible; instead, a bridge must be constructed using TensorFlow's low-level APIs to expose the neural network's loss function as a callable compatible with SciPy.  This approach sacrifices some of TensorFlow's performance advantages but provides access to a wider range of optimization algorithms.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects highlighted this limitation, prompting me to develop robust solutions.

**1. Explanation:**

TensorFlow's high-level optimizers (like `Adam`, `SGD`, etc.) manage gradient computation and parameter updates automatically.  SciPy, on the other hand, requires explicit gradient calculation and parameter update steps.  To use a SciPy optimizer, we must define the neural network's loss function as a Python function accepting the model's parameters as input and returning the loss value.  We then need to provide this function, along with its gradient (calculated using TensorFlow's `GradientTape`), to the chosen SciPy optimizer.  The optimizer then iteratively updates the model's parameters based on the gradient information.  This process involves manually managing parameter tensors, which differs significantly from TensorFlow's automatic management.  The key is to carefully convert between TensorFlow tensors and NumPy arrays for compatibility with SciPy functions.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Using `scipy.optimize.minimize` with a simple neural network:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Define a simple neural network
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(1,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Define the loss function and gradient calculation
def loss_function(params):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(params)
        predictions = model(tf.constant(X, dtype=tf.float32))
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.mse(y, predictions))
    gradient = tape.gradient(loss, params)
    return loss.numpy(), gradient.numpy().flatten()

# Generate some sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 2*X + 1 + np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Extract model parameters and convert to NumPy array
initial_params = np.concatenate([param.numpy().flatten() for param in model.trainable_variables])

# Perform optimization
result = minimize(fun=lambda params: loss_function(tf.constant(params.reshape(initial_params.shape), dtype=tf.float32)),
                  x0=initial_params,
                  jac=True,
                  method='BFGS',
                  options={'disp': True})

# Update model parameters with optimized values
updated_params = result.x.reshape(initial_params.shape)
for i, var in enumerate(model.trainable_variables):
    var.assign(tf.constant(updated_params[i].reshape(var.shape), dtype=tf.float32))

```

This example demonstrates a basic setup using `scipy.optimize.minimize` with the BFGS algorithm. The `loss_function` explicitly calculates both loss and gradient.  Note the careful handling of data types and shapes to ensure compatibility between TensorFlow and NumPy.  This code assumes a simple MSE loss for regression.


**Example 2:  Leveraging `scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b` for improved performance:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fmin_l_bfgs_b

# ... (model definition and data generation as in Example 1) ...

#  Modified loss and gradient function for fmin_l_bfgs_b
def loss_and_grad(params):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(params)
        predictions = model(tf.constant(X, dtype=tf.float32))
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.mse(y, predictions))
    gradient = tape.gradient(loss, params)
    return loss.numpy(), gradient.numpy().flatten()

# Optimization using fmin_l_bfgs_b
result = fmin_l_bfgs_b(func=lambda params: loss_and_grad(tf.constant(params.reshape(initial_params.shape), dtype=tf.float32))[0],
                       x0=initial_params,
                       fprime=lambda params: loss_and_grad(tf.constant(params.reshape(initial_params.shape), dtype=tf.float32))[1],
                       m=10, # memory for L-BFGS
                       factr=1e7) # convergence tolerance

# ... (parameter update as in Example 1) ...

```

This example utilizes `fmin_l_bfgs_b`, a limited-memory BFGS variant often more efficient for large parameter spaces.  The structure remains similar, but the function call is tailored to `fmin_l_bfgs_b`'s interface.


**Example 3:  Handling more complex architectures and custom losses:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# ... (Define a more complex model with multiple layers and activation functions) ...

# Define a custom loss function
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)) #Example: using MAE

# Define loss function for SciPy
def loss_function_custom(params):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(params)
        predictions = model(tf.constant(X, dtype=tf.float32))
        loss = custom_loss(y, predictions) # use the custom loss function here
    gradient = tape.gradient(loss, params)
    return loss.numpy(), gradient.numpy().flatten()

# ... (Data generation, parameter extraction, and optimization similar to Example 1) ...

```

This example illustrates how to adapt the approach for complex neural network architectures and custom loss functions.  The key modification is integrating the custom loss directly into the `loss_function` for compatibility with SciPy.  Error handling and careful type checking are crucial in such scenarios.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation on low-level APIs, specifically `tf.GradientTape`, is invaluable.  The SciPy documentation detailing its optimization algorithms, including their theoretical underpinnings and practical considerations, provides essential background.  A comprehensive textbook on numerical optimization is highly recommended for a deeper theoretical understanding.  Finally, reviewing examples of gradient-based optimization in Python using NumPy can clarify the core concepts independent of TensorFlow's specifics.
