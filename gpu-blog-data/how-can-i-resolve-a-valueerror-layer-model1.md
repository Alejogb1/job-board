The `ValueError: Layer 'model_1' expects 1 input(s), but it received 3 input tensors` arises from a fundamental mismatch between your model's input layer definition and the data you're feeding it during inference.  In my experience debugging facial mask recognition systems, this error almost always stems from improperly preprocessed input data – specifically, the handling of multiple face detections within a single image frame.  The model is designed for single-face input, yet you're providing it with multiple face embeddings concurrently.

My approach to resolving this hinges on three key stages:  1) independent face detection and embedding generation, 2) iterating over individual face embeddings, and 3) consolidating prediction results.  Failing to separate these steps leads to the aforementioned error.  Let's examine this with concrete examples.

**1. Independent Face Detection and Embedding Generation:**

The core problem is that your input pipeline is bundling multiple faces into a single tensor before feeding it to the model.  The model, defined to accept a single face embedding, is encountering three separate embeddings simultaneously.  This requires a distinct processing stage for each detected face.

I've frequently used the `mtcnn` and `face_recognition` libraries for this purpose.  MTCNN efficiently detects faces and their bounding boxes.  `face_recognition` subsequently generates face embeddings, which serve as the input for your mask recognition model.  The crucial point is to process each detected face *independently*.

**Code Example 1:  Independent Face Processing**

```python
import face_recognition
import mtcnn

# Load your pre-trained mask recognition model
model = load_model('mask_recognition_model.h5') #Replace with your model loading method

# Sample image
image = face_recognition.load_image_file("multi_face_image.jpg")

# Detect faces using MTCNN
detector = mtcnn.MTCNN()
faces = detector.detect_faces(image)

predictions = []
for face in faces:
    x, y, w, h = face['box']
    face_image = image[y:y+h, x:x+w]
    
    #Ensure appropriate image resizing for your model
    face_image = cv2.resize(face_image,(160,160)) #Example size, adjust accordingly

    # Generate embedding (requires a pre-trained embedding model)
    face_embedding = face_recognition.face_encodings(face_image)[0] # Assumes at least one face detected in the cropped region. Handle exceptions otherwise.

    # Reshape the embedding to match your model's input shape.  Essential!
    face_embedding = face_embedding.reshape(1, -1) # reshape for single input

    # Predict mask status for the individual face
    prediction = model.predict(face_embedding)
    predictions.append(prediction)


# Process predictions (e.g., majority voting if needed)
# ... further processing of the predictions list ...

```

This code first detects faces using MTCNN. Then, iterates through each detected face, crops it, generates its embedding using `face_recognition`, reshapes it to match the model's input expectation (this is paramount), and then passes *each* embedding individually to the model. The results are accumulated in the `predictions` list, enabling further analysis.  Remember to handle potential exceptions—`face_recognition.face_encodings` might return an empty list if no face is found in a cropped region.


**2. Iterative Prediction and Result Aggregation:**

Avoid trying to feed multiple faces simultaneously. The model is built for single-face analysis.  By processing each face independently, you bypass the core error.  The aggregation of the results then becomes a separate task.  You might employ a simple averaging or majority voting if multiple faces are involved.  This approach ensures consistency with the model's design.


**Code Example 2:  Handling Multiple Predictions**


```python
#Continuing from Code Example 1...
import numpy as np

#Assuming predictions is a list of numpy arrays
#Each array representing a single prediction (e.g., probability of mask)
#Simplified example, adapt to your prediction format.

#Method 1: Averaging predictions
average_prediction = np.mean(np.array(predictions), axis=0)


#Method 2: Majority Voting (for classification tasks)
# Convert probabilities to class labels
mask_probabilities = np.array([p[0] for p in predictions]) # Assuming first element of prediction is mask probability
mask_labels = np.where(mask_probabilities > 0.5, 1, 0)  #Example threshold, adjust as needed.

# Majority voting
final_prediction = np.bincount(mask_labels).argmax()

print(f"Average prediction: {average_prediction}")
print(f"Majority vote prediction: {final_prediction}")
```

This snippet demonstrates two aggregation strategies.  Averaging is suitable for regression tasks (e.g., predicting the confidence score for mask presence), while majority voting works better for classification (binary: mask/no mask). Choose the method that aligns with your model's output.


**3. Input Shape Validation:**

Before even reaching the prediction phase, rigorously validate the input shape.  The model's expected input shape is defined during its creation.  Always explicitly check that the `face_embedding` variable matches this shape *before* sending it to `model.predict`.  This prevents runtime errors and offers immediate feedback on data preprocessing inconsistencies.

**Code Example 3: Input Shape Verification**

```python
# Continuing from Code Example 1...

expected_input_shape = model.input_shape # Get the expected input shape from your model
if face_embedding.shape != expected_input_shape:
    raise ValueError(f"Input shape mismatch: Expected {expected_input_shape}, but got {face_embedding.shape}")

prediction = model.predict(face_embedding) #Proceed with prediction if shape matches.
```

This added check ensures that the input tensor’s dimensions perfectly align with the model’s requirements, preventing the initial error.  It's a crucial debugging step.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*  Documentation for your chosen face detection and recognition libraries (MTCNN, face_recognition, dlib, etc.). Pay close attention to input and output formats.
*  TensorFlow/Keras documentation on model building and input handling.  Understanding input layers and tensor shapes is crucial.
*  A comprehensive guide to image processing in Python, emphasizing resizing and data normalization techniques.


Addressing the `ValueError` requires meticulous attention to data preprocessing and input shape consistency.  The process involves separate face detection, individual embedding generation, per-face prediction, and finally, results aggregation.  By implementing these steps, you'll resolve the error and build a robust multi-face mask recognition system.  Thorough testing with diverse image examples is essential to ensure the system's reliability.  Remember to adapt the code examples to match your specific model's architecture and output format.
