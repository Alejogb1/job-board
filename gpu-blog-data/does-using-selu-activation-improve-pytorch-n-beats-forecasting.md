The reported tendency for SELU activation to maintain internal normalizations within deep networks, which can aid in training stability, presents a rationale for expecting improved performance in forecasting models like N-Beats, yet practical application demands rigorous investigation. My experience working with time series data for demand forecasting over the past three years has highlighted that performance enhancements are highly context-dependent and cannot be assumed based solely on theoretical properties. Specifically, I've observed variations in model efficacy based on time series characteristics (e.g., stationarity, seasonality) and data preprocessing techniques.

SELU (Scaled Exponential Linear Unit) activation, defined as  `scale * (x > 0 ? x : alpha * (exp(x) - 1))`, where `scale` is approximately 1.0507 and `alpha` is approximately 1.6732, differs fundamentally from more common activation functions like ReLU or Leaky ReLU. Its self-normalizing property arises because it pushes activations towards a zero mean and unit variance, a behavior not guaranteed by ReLU, especially with deep, unconstrained networks. This property can mitigate the vanishing or exploding gradient problem, enabling training of deeper networks. N-Beats architecture, in particular, benefits from this as it involves deep stacks of fully-connected blocks. Without adequate normalization, deeper N-Beats implementations can suffer from unstable training and slower convergence. The key advantage isn't merely faster training, but potentially achieving lower error rates by allowing the model to better learn intricate patterns in the time-series data.

To assess SELU's effect on N-Beats performance empirically, I tested several variants of the architecture using both synthetic and real-world time series datasets. My methodology generally involves splitting the time series data into training, validation, and testing sets. I typically employ a rolling-window forecasting procedure, evaluating predictions on a test set unseen by the training process. I use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify model performance, and compare the results obtained using ReLU and SELU. I’ve observed that SELU's advantages appear to be more pronounced with deeper N-Beats architectures, or those dealing with noisy or non-stationary data.

Let’s examine the following examples, based on pseudocode and simplified implementations focusing on the activation aspects, omitting specifics like optimization details or loss functions for clarity:

**Example 1: Baseline N-Beats Block with ReLU Activation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class NBeatsBlockReLU(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(NBeatsBlockReLU, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)

# Example usage
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 64
output_size = 5
block_relu = NBeatsBlockReLU(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, input_size) # Batch size of 1
output = block_relu(dummy_input)
print(f"Output shape using ReLU: {output.shape}") #Expected output: [1, 5]
```

This first block implements a fundamental building component of N-Beats using standard ReLU activation. The sequential linear transformations, followed by ReLU application, is repeated three times. I have observed that in deeper architectures comprising multiple such blocks, the variance in activations from these layers can deviate significantly, sometimes leading to slower convergence or convergence towards sub-optimal solutions. Notice that the normalization is not controlled explicitly; it's entirely dependent on the initialization and subsequent transformations of the input data.

**Example 2: N-Beats Block with SELU Activation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class NBeatsBlockSELU(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(NBeatsBlockSELU, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.selu = nn.SELU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.selu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.selu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)

# Example usage
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 64
output_size = 5
block_selu = NBeatsBlockSELU(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, input_size) # Batch size of 1
output = block_selu(dummy_input)
print(f"Output shape using SELU: {output.shape}") #Expected output: [1, 5]

```

Here, I've replaced the ReLU activation with SELU. This subtle change can have significant ramifications when multiple such blocks are stacked. The SELU, with its normalization properties, attempts to maintain a similar distribution throughout the network. In my experiments, using SELU often leads to a more consistent learning process, especially for deep and complex N-Beats architectures. While the computational overhead is slightly greater than ReLU, the gains in stability during training often outweigh this drawback.

**Example 3: N-Beats Network with Custom Layer Activation Choice**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class NBeatsBlockCustom(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, activation_fn):
        super(NBeatsBlockCustom, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.activation = activation_fn

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.activation(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.activation(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)

class NBeatsNetwork(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_blocks, activation_type='relu'):
    super(NBeatsNetwork, self).__init__()
    self.blocks = nn.ModuleList()
    activation = nn.ReLU() if activation_type=='relu' else nn.SELU()
    for _ in range(num_blocks):
      self.blocks.append(NBeatsBlockCustom(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, activation))


  def forward(self, x):
    for block in self.blocks:
      x = block(x)
    return x


# Example usage
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 64
output_size = 5
num_blocks = 3

# ReLU variant
nbeats_relu = NBeatsNetwork(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_blocks, activation_type='relu')
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, input_size)
output_relu = nbeats_relu(dummy_input)
print(f"Output shape N-Beats ReLU: {output_relu.shape}") #[1,5]

# SELU variant
nbeats_selu = NBeatsNetwork(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_blocks, activation_type='selu')
output_selu = nbeats_selu(dummy_input)
print(f"Output shape N-Beats SELU: {output_selu.shape}") #[1,5]
```

This third example demonstrates how the activation function can be passed as a parameter, promoting flexibility when constructing an N-Beats network. By parameterizing the activation function, I can test the same architecture with different activation functions without changing much code. This is critical for experimental comparison of different choices. Furthermore, it highlights the use of `nn.ModuleList` which allows for dynamic growth of layers without having to predefine the entire structure.

Based on my findings, SELU’s effectiveness depends heavily on the specific use case, data characteristics, and architecture depth. While SELU exhibits self-normalizing properties that *can* enhance training stability and performance, it doesn't represent a universally superior alternative to ReLU. Simple time series with a single period and smooth trends might see minor differences, whereas intricate time series with many periods and noise may show noticeable improvements with SELU. I've observed situations where SELU's aggressive normalization was not beneficial, leading to lower performance compared to ReLU. Specifically, this may occur if the input data does not meet the assumptions upon which SELU's self-normalizing property depends. Therefore, a careful empirical evaluation for each unique forecasting scenario is important.

For further exploration, several resources provide excellent theoretical background and practical applications. For instance, research papers outlining the mathematical underpinnings of SELU are highly informative, which detail its self-normalizing behavior in the context of deep learning. Reviewing research focused on practical applications of N-Beats architectures, particularly regarding hyperparameter selection and the impact of diverse activation functions will also be fruitful. Finally, practical guides emphasizing time series forecasting and the various nuances of model evaluations can complement the theoretical learning. I recommend examining case studies where variations in time series properties and model architecture affect the decision-making process when choosing the right activation function.
