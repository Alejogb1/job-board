TensorFlow's relationship with CUDA is not a strict dependency, but rather a performance optimization pathway.  My experience building high-performance machine learning models over the past decade has consistently shown that while TensorFlow functions perfectly well without CUDA, leveraging it unlocks significant speedups, particularly for computationally intensive operations within deep learning workflows.  The core TensorFlow runtime is designed to be hardware-agnostic, employing a strategy of optimized backends to support diverse hardware architectures.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's architecture relies on a graph-based computation model.  This graph represents the operations required to train or infer a model.  The execution of this graph can be directed towards various backends, including CPUs, GPUs (via CUDA or other frameworks like ROCm for AMD GPUs), and TPUs.  A CPU backend provides a readily available execution environment, requiring minimal setup. However, CPU computation is fundamentally limited by its single-threaded nature and comparatively slower clock speeds compared to modern GPUs.

CUDA, standing for Compute Unified Device Architecture, is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by NVIDIA.  It provides a framework for utilizing the massively parallel processing capabilities of NVIDIA GPUs.  When TensorFlow utilizes CUDA, it delegates the execution of computationally intensive operations – primarily matrix multiplications and convolutions prevalent in deep learning – to the GPU, resulting in substantial performance gains.  These operations, which dominate the training and inference cycles, become significantly faster due to CUDA's ability to parallelize them across hundreds or thousands of GPU cores.  This parallel processing drastically reduces execution time, enabling the training of larger and more complex models within feasible timeframes.

Without CUDA, TensorFlow falls back to the CPU backend. This results in significantly slower execution speeds, especially for deep learning models with many layers and large datasets.  The performance difference can be orders of magnitude; a model taking hours to train on a CPU might train in minutes on a compatible GPU with CUDA enabled.  This is not merely a matter of convenience; it fundamentally affects the feasibility of many research and deployment scenarios.  My experience with resource-constrained projects emphasized this acutely:  models that were impractical to train on CPUs became viable with the incorporation of CUDA-enabled GPUs.

However, the absence of CUDA doesn't render TensorFlow unusable.  It simply means the performance will be considerably slower.  This is perfectly acceptable for certain applications, such as smaller models, experimentation, or situations where GPU access is unavailable or impractical.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate different scenarios and the impact of CUDA on TensorFlow performance.  These snippets assume basic familiarity with TensorFlow and Python.


**Example 1:  CPU-only execution:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... define your model ...

with tf.device('/CPU:0'): # Explicitly specify CPU execution
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
        # ... your training or inference loop ...
```

This code snippet explicitly forces TensorFlow to use the CPU for all operations.  Observe the execution time.  This approach is useful for benchmarking or situations where GPU access is unavailable.  The `tf.device('/CPU:0')` context manager ensures that all subsequent operations within its scope are executed on the CPU.


**Example 2:  Automatic GPU detection:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... define your model ...

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    # ... your training or inference loop ...
```

This example omits explicit device specification.  If a compatible CUDA-enabled GPU is available and TensorFlow is correctly configured, it will automatically utilize the GPU. This is the most convenient approach and is generally the default behavior for TensorFlow.  The absence of explicit device assignment allows TensorFlow to make the optimal device selection.


**Example 3:  Explicit GPU selection with CUDA:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... define your model ...

with tf.device('/GPU:0'): # Select the first GPU
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
        # ... your training or inference loop ...
```

This code explicitly selects the first available GPU (index 0). If multiple GPUs are present, you can change the index accordingly.  This provides fine-grained control over device allocation, which can be crucial in managing resource contention within a multi-GPU environment.  This requires a correctly installed CUDA toolkit and appropriate NVIDIA drivers.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's architecture and performance optimization, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  The documentation provides comprehensive details on device placement, performance tuning, and advanced features.  Further, exploring resources on parallel computing and CUDA programming will significantly enhance your ability to optimize TensorFlow applications for GPU execution.  Finally, studying case studies on large-scale deep learning deployments will offer valuable insights into practical considerations and best practices.  Reviewing relevant research papers on GPU acceleration for deep learning will offer theoretical foundations to your practical knowledge.
