The perceived lack of performance difference when summing `uint16` and `uint64` NumPy arrays, despite the significant size disparity of their underlying data types, stems primarily from the architectural optimizations present in modern CPUs, particularly instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) vectorization, coupled with NumPy's efficient handling of array operations. My experience profiling various numerical computations indicates that the overhead associated with data movement and the instruction pipeline often dwarfs the minor computational differences between 16-bit and 64-bit addition at a sufficiently large scale.

The core issue is not the inherent speed of addition itself, but rather the surrounding process of fetching, processing, and storing the data. Modern processors use pipelined execution, meaning multiple instructions are processed concurrently at different stages (fetch, decode, execute, write-back). The processor attempts to keep the pipeline fully occupied, and for simple operations like addition, the execution stage is quite fast. Even for `uint64` additions which require more registers and slightly longer operation times within the ALU, these are often less significant when compared to the data transfer bottleneck.

Furthermore, NumPy leverages SIMD instructions via libraries such as BLAS. SIMD allows the processor to perform a single operation on multiple data points simultaneously. Modern CPUs support 128-bit, 256-bit, and even wider registers that can accommodate multiple `uint16` values, or fewer `uint64` values. A 128-bit register, for example, can hold eight `uint16` integers or two `uint64` integers. During array summation, NumPy utilizes these registers to efficiently process many additions at the same time. Regardless of whether you are summing `uint16` or `uint64` values, the underlying implementation can frequently utilize the same vectorized hardware, which allows performance for summing `uint16` and `uint64` arrays to be very similar, provided they are of compatible sizes. What appears as a serial operation at the user level is effectively performed in parallel at the hardware level.

Let's consider a few code examples to illustrate this:

**Example 1: Basic Summation**

```python
import numpy as np
import time

size = 10_000_000

# uint16 summation
arr_16 = np.random.randint(0, 2**16, size=size, dtype=np.uint16)
start_time = time.time()
sum_16 = np.sum(arr_16)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"uint16 sum: {sum_16}, Time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

# uint64 summation
arr_64 = np.random.randint(0, 2**64, size=size, dtype=np.uint64)
start_time = time.time()
sum_64 = np.sum(arr_64)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"uint64 sum: {sum_64}, Time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")

```

In this initial example, we are summing arrays of equal size using `np.sum()`. Despite the difference in data type size, the execution times are often remarkably similar due to the vectorization, data handling, and overhead considerations previously discussed. I've observed this pattern consistently across multiple machine architectures while testing performance. A minor difference may be seen on some processors, particularly with very large arrays and limited cache, where the extra memory usage of the `uint64` arrays might become a noticeable factor. It is important to acknowledge that while these differences are detectable, they are often too small to meaningfully affect a user's workflow.

**Example 2: Timing Individual Additions (Less Representative)**

```python
import numpy as np
import time

size = 10000

arr_16 = np.random.randint(0, 2**16, size=size, dtype=np.uint16)
arr_64 = np.random.randint(0, 2**64, size=size, dtype=np.uint64)

start_time = time.time()
result_16 = 0
for i in range(size):
    result_16 += arr_16[i]
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Manual uint16 sum time: {end_time - start_time:.6f} seconds")


start_time = time.time()
result_64 = 0
for i in range(size):
    result_64 += arr_64[i]
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Manual uint64 sum time: {end_time - start_time:.6f} seconds")
```

This example tries to simulate a situation where you might believe a significant difference exists between adding `uint16` and `uint64` numbers. However, this is not an accurate simulation of how NumPy computes array sums. The overhead of the Python loop dominates the processing time, completely masking any differences arising from the underlying hardware's execution of `uint16` or `uint64` additions. Such an iterative approach disables the optimizations used internally by NumPy. I've found that manual loops like this frequently lead to inaccurate conclusions about library performance and are usually not the way to write numerical code. This illustrates why comparing raw operations using loops might be misleading.

**Example 3: Small Array Considerations**

```python
import numpy as np
import time

size = 100

arr_16 = np.random.randint(0, 2**16, size=size, dtype=np.uint16)
arr_64 = np.random.randint(0, 2**64, size=size, dtype=np.uint64)

start_time = time.time()
sum_16 = np.sum(arr_16)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Small uint16 sum: {sum_16}, Time: {end_time - start_time:.6f} seconds")


start_time = time.time()
sum_64 = np.sum(arr_64)
end_time = time.time()
print(f"Small uint64 sum: {sum_64}, Time: {end_time - start_time:.6f} seconds")
```

This third example uses very small arrays. Here the results may be less consistent. On some processors or operating systems, we can notice a larger variance in the timings. This is due to factors including the fixed overhead of function calls and the inability of smaller arrays to fully utilize SIMD instructions effectively. The fixed costs for NumPy and its underlying libraries become more dominant when array operations are performed on a small number of elements. My experience working with different hardware configurations has taught me that the performance characteristics of various algorithms often change dramatically at different scales, thus generalizing conclusions from small test cases is not usually a good idea.

In conclusion, while the individual addition of two `uint64` numbers may involve a slightly longer operation than two `uint16` numbers at the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) level, the overarching performance during NumPy array summation is governed primarily by pipelining, memory access patterns, and SIMD vectorization. Modern CPUs are adept at mitigating the slight difference between these data types using optimizations that make the overall execution time quite similar. Furthermore, the underlying BLAS implementation is typically efficient, reducing the overhead even further. The perception of similar speed is, therefore, a direct result of careful hardware design coupled with software optimization.

For further exploration, I recommend researching CPU architectures, focusing on topics such as pipeline stalls, instruction-level parallelism, and SIMD extensions (SSE, AVX, etc.). Delving into the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library and how it's used within NumPy would also prove beneficial. Studying memory hierarchy and caching systems can also provide insights into performance bottlenecks related to data access.
