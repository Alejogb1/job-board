CUDA out-of-memory (OOM) errors during PyTorch model training, particularly within iterative loops, are often a consequence of accumulating GPU memory usage across iterations. The problem typically arises when tensors are not explicitly released or when PyTorch’s caching mechanisms retain data no longer needed, exceeding the available GPU memory. I've encountered this exact issue many times during my work on large language models and image processing pipelines, and resolving it has required careful management of GPU resources.

The underlying issue is that PyTorch, by default, optimizes for computational efficiency, not always for memory minimization. During training loops, temporary tensors used for computations, gradient calculations, or intermediate outputs are often retained to avoid redundant allocations. While this speeds up subsequent calculations involving the same tensors, it can rapidly deplete GPU memory when large models or datasets are involved, especially if the loop processes significant volumes of data across each iteration. This situation is exacerbated when batch sizes are large or when the model itself consumes a significant portion of available GPU RAM. Understanding how PyTorch manages memory and using tools to monitor allocation are critical for effective resolution.

To mitigate OOM errors, several strategies can be implemented within the training loop. The first and perhaps most fundamental approach is to explicitly delete tensors when they are no longer needed. Python’s garbage collection isn’t always instantaneous, particularly when dealing with CUDA tensors. By manually using `del` to dereference tensors, PyTorch is usually more aggressive in reclaiming associated GPU memory. This is particularly effective for intermediate tensors that aren't required for backward passes. In complex computations or loops within loops, it can be difficult to keep track of all tensors, but being deliberate about it pays off significantly in practice.

Secondly, one should be aware of PyTorch’s memory caching mechanism. By default, PyTorch caches frequently used operations to accelerate computations. While this is generally beneficial, during long training loops, the cache may start consuming a substantial portion of GPU memory. Clearing this cache periodically, especially between epochs, can prevent memory buildup. This can be done using `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`. However, excessive calling of this method can introduce a performance penalty. It should be used judiciously, perhaps only when the memory consumption has grown to a level that might cause OOM.

Thirdly, consider gradient accumulation. Rather than processing all data at once, which may be computationally infeasible or memory intensive, one can compute gradients on smaller batches and then accumulate them before performing an optimizer step. This effectively reduces the memory footprint of a single batch computation. The effective batch size is maintained while minimizing the memory requirements.

Fourth, evaluate whether all intermediate tensors are required to be stored on the GPU. If specific calculations or intermediates can be performed on the CPU, and then moved to the GPU as required, this can reduce memory pressure. Using `tensor.cpu()` will transfer a tensor to the CPU. However, this operation comes with overhead, so use this judiciously. Additionally, ensure your input data is loaded on the CPU first before moving to the GPU. Avoid transferring entire datasets directly to the GPU at the start of the process.

Finally, regularly monitor the GPU memory usage while running the training process. This can be achieved using `nvidia-smi` from the command line, or programmatically within python using the `torch.cuda.memory_allocated()` and `torch.cuda.memory_cached()` methods. This data provides key information on whether your memory management techniques are effective and where the biggest memory drains are occurring.

Here are three code examples to demonstrate these techniques:

**Example 1: Explicit Tensor Deletion and Cache Clearing**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a dummy model and optimizer
model = nn.Linear(10, 2)
model.cuda()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for epoch in range(3):  # Small number for demo purposes
    for i in range(100): # Small number for demo purposes
        inputs = torch.randn(32, 10).cuda()
        labels = torch.randn(32, 2).cuda()
        
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = nn.MSELoss()(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        # Explicit deletion
        del inputs
        del outputs
        del loss
        del labels
        
        if (i+1) % 25 == 0: # Clear cache periodically
            torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

*Commentary*: In this example, within the inner loop, after the loss has been computed and backpropagation completed, the intermediate tensors `inputs`, `outputs`, `loss` and `labels` are explicitly deleted using `del`. Additionally, the PyTorch cache is cleared every 25 iterations to prevent the accumulation of cached memory allocations. This proactive release reduces the memory footprint of each iteration.

**Example 2: Gradient Accumulation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a dummy model and optimizer
model = nn.Linear(10, 2).cuda()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
accumulation_steps = 4
effective_batch_size = 32 * accumulation_steps

for epoch in range(3): # Small number for demo purposes
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    for i in range(effective_batch_size): # Small number for demo purposes
      inputs = torch.randn(32,10).cuda()
      labels = torch.randn(32,2).cuda()
      outputs = model(inputs)
      loss = nn.MSELoss()(outputs, labels)
      loss = loss / accumulation_steps
      loss.backward()

      if (i+1) % accumulation_steps == 0:
          optimizer.step()
          optimizer.zero_grad()
          del inputs
          del outputs
          del loss
          del labels
```
*Commentary*: This example shows gradient accumulation. The gradients are accumulated over multiple mini-batches, and the optimizer step is performed every `accumulation_steps` iterations. This effectively uses a larger batch size (32*4=128 in the example) without the corresponding increase in GPU memory consumption per iteration, as each mini-batch uses only a 32 batch size. Note, we still need to explicitly delete the tensors here.

**Example 3: Moving Intermediate Tensors to the CPU**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a dummy model and optimizer
model = nn.Linear(10, 2).cuda()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for epoch in range(3): # Small number for demo purposes
    for i in range(100): # Small number for demo purposes
        inputs = torch.randn(32, 10)  # Initialize input on CPU
        labels = torch.randn(32, 2) # Initialize labels on CPU
        inputs_gpu = inputs.cuda()
        labels_gpu = labels.cuda()
        
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs_gpu = model(inputs_gpu)
        loss = nn.MSELoss()(outputs_gpu, labels_gpu)
        loss_cpu = loss.cpu()  # Move loss to CPU

        loss_cpu.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        del inputs_gpu
        del outputs_gpu
        del loss
        del labels_gpu
        del inputs
        del labels
        del loss_cpu
```
*Commentary*: In this example, instead of directly creating inputs on the GPU, we initially create them on the CPU. Tensors are transferred to the GPU before the model computation. The loss is then moved to CPU before the backward pass, which ensures that the backward operation does not need to be computed on the GPU, freeing up GPU resources. Again, it's imperative that we explicitly `del` tensors after they are not longer needed on the GPU. Finally, we explicitly release the tensors created on the CPU as well.

For further learning on this topic, I would recommend examining the PyTorch documentation on CUDA semantics and memory management. Several excellent tutorials exist on topics such as data loading best practices and GPU memory management. A deep dive into the PyTorch source code could also be beneficial to gain a deeper understanding of its internal workings. Additionally, several research papers and blog posts focusing on large-scale model training provide practical strategies and best practices for optimizing GPU resource usage. Understanding memory management in the CUDA ecosystem is also critical. Lastly, studying practical memory profilers and debuggers such as `torch.autograd.gradcheck` will allow you to be more confident in the accuracy of your gradient computation.
