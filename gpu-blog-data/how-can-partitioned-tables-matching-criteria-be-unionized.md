The core challenge in efficiently unionizing partitioned tables based on matching criteria lies in avoiding full table scans.  My experience optimizing large-scale data warehousing solutions has highlighted the crucial role of metadata and partition pruning in achieving acceptable performance.  Ignoring these aspects leads to inefficient queries, especially when dealing with tables containing millions or billions of rows.  The solution hinges on leveraging the database's ability to identify and process only the relevant partitions, thereby significantly reducing the data volume involved in the union operation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Unionizing partitioned tables requires a strategy that respects the partitioning scheme.  A naive `UNION ALL` across all partitions ignores the potential for significant performance gains.  The approach should utilize partition-aware predicates within the `WHERE` clause of each individual `SELECT` statement contributing to the `UNION ALL`.  These predicates should filter data based on the criteria defining the matching partitions.  This selective filtering prevents unnecessary data transfer and processing.

The methodology involves the following steps:

a. **Identify Matching Partitions:**  Determine which partitions across all tables satisfy the union criteria. This typically involves querying metadata tables that describe the partitioning scheme (e.g., partition key values, range boundaries).  The specific method depends on your database system; some offer system views directly providing this information, while others might require querying specific catalog tables.

b. **Construct Partitioned SELECT Statements:**  Generate `SELECT` statements for each relevant partition. These statements should incorporate `WHERE` clauses that restrict data selection to only the data residing within that specific partition and adhering to the overall union criteria.

c. **Perform `UNION ALL` Operation:** Combine all the generated `SELECT` statements using `UNION ALL`.  This efficient set operator merges the result sets from each partitioned query.  The database optimizer, aware of the predicates, will then execute the query using partition pruning, significantly reducing the amount of I/O and computation required.

d. **Handle Data Type Discrepancies:**  Ensure that all selected columns from different tables have compatible data types.  Implicit type conversions can negatively impact performance; explicit casts are often preferable for clarity and optimization.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Assume we have three partitioned tables, `sales_q1`, `sales_q2`, and `sales_q3`, each partitioned by `order_date` (year and quarter).  We wish to unionize sales data for orders exceeding $1000 in Q1 and Q2.

**Example 1:  Inefficient Approach (Full Table Scan):**

```sql
SELECT order_id, order_date, amount
FROM sales_q1
WHERE amount > 1000
UNION ALL
SELECT order_id, order_date, amount
FROM sales_q2
WHERE amount > 1000
UNION ALL
SELECT order_id, order_date, amount
FROM sales_q3
WHERE amount > 1000;
```

This approach performs a full table scan on all three tables regardless of the `WHERE` clause, negating the benefits of partitioning.

**Example 2:  Partitioned Approach (with assumed metadata):**

Let's assume a hypothetical function `get_partitions_matching_criteria(table_name, criteria)` returns a list of partition keys.  For simplification, we'll assume the partition key directly represents the quarter.


```sql
DECLARE @partitions_q1_q2 TABLE (partition_key INT);
INSERT INTO @partitions_q1_q2 EXEC get_partitions_matching_criteria('sales_', 'quarter IN (1,2) AND amount > 1000');


SELECT order_id, order_date, amount
FROM sales_q1
WHERE partition_key IN (SELECT partition_key FROM @partitions_q1_q2) AND amount > 1000
UNION ALL
SELECT order_id, order_date, amount
FROM sales_q2
WHERE partition_key IN (SELECT partition_key FROM @partitions_q1_q2) AND amount > 1000;

```

This example leverages the `get_partitions_matching_criteria` function to retrieve only the relevant partitions for Q1 and Q2, then filters data within those partitions using the `IN` clause, significantly reducing processed rows.  Note that Q3 is excluded entirely because its partitions don't match the criteria.  This significantly improves performance compared to Example 1.


**Example 3:  Dynamic SQL approach:**

For increased flexibility and scalability, dynamic SQL generation is beneficial:

```sql
DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX) = '';
DECLARE @partitions_q1_q2 TABLE (table_name VARCHAR(50), partition_key INT);
INSERT INTO @partitions_q1_q2 EXEC get_partitions_matching_criteria('sales_', 'quarter IN (1,2) AND amount > 1000');

DECLARE @cursor CURSOR;
SET @cursor = CURSOR FOR
SELECT table_name, partition_key FROM @partitions_q1_q2;

OPEN @cursor;
FETCH NEXT FROM @cursor INTO @tableName, @partitionKey;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    SET @sql += 'SELECT order_id, order_date, amount FROM ' + @tableName + ' WHERE partition_key = ' + CAST(@partitionKey AS VARCHAR(10)) + ' AND amount > 1000 UNION ALL ';
    FETCH NEXT FROM @cursor INTO @tableName, @partitionKey;
END;

CLOSE @cursor;
DEALLOCATE @cursor;

SET @sql = LEFT(@sql, LEN(@sql) - 10); --remove trailing 'UNION ALL'
EXEC sp_executesql @sql;
```

This approach dynamically constructs the `UNION ALL` query based on the identified partitions, offering a scalable solution for numerous partitions and tables. The use of a cursor is less efficient than set-based operations, but it illustrates how to generate the query dynamically, which can be crucial when dealing with a large and variable number of partitions.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult your specific database system's documentation on partition pruning, metadata views, and dynamic SQL capabilities.  Explore the optimization features of your query analyzer for identifying performance bottlenecks.  Familiarize yourself with techniques for efficient data type handling and conversion.  Consider advanced techniques such as materialized views for further performance enhancement in scenarios with frequent repetitive queries.  Examine the literature on database indexing strategies for partitioned tables.  Understanding the internal workings of your chosen database system is essential for effective performance tuning.
