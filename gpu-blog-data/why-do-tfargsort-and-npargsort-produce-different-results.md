The discrepancy between `tf.argsort` and `np.argsort` stems fundamentally from their handling of tie-breaking within the sorting algorithm.  While both functions aim to return the indices that would sort an input array, they employ different strategies when encountering equal values, leading to variations in the output index order.  This subtle difference becomes significant when dealing with large datasets or scenarios requiring deterministic sorting behavior.  My experience optimizing large-scale recommendation systems frequently highlighted this nuance; inconsistent sorting across TensorFlow and NumPy operations frequently led to unexpected results in downstream processing.

**1.  Explanation of the Discrepancy:**

`np.argsort`, NumPy's sorting function, uses a stable sorting algorithm.  Stability, in this context, means that the relative order of elements with equal values is preserved from the input array.  If two elements are identical, their indices in the output array will reflect their original order in the input.  This behavior is consistent across different NumPy versions and underlying hardware platforms.

Conversely, `tf.argsort` in TensorFlow, while aiming for a similar outcome, lacks a guaranteed stability clause.  The specific algorithm and its stability properties can vary across TensorFlow versions and even depend on the hardware and optimization strategies employed during execution.  This means the order of indices for equal values might change unpredictably across different runs, hardware configurations, or even TensorFlow versions. While TensorFlow strives for optimized performance,  sacrificing strict stability in `tf.argsort` is a conscious trade-off to potentially achieve faster execution speeds.  This is particularly relevant in the context of GPU acceleration where algorithms prioritizing speed over strict stability are preferred.

The underlying implementation details, often involving highly optimized low-level routines, are intentionally abstracted from the user.  Therefore, relying on the exact tie-breaking mechanism of `tf.argsort` is generally discouraged, unless explicit control over the sorting algorithm is absolutely necessary and tightly coupled with the implementation details of a specific TensorFlow version.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Illustrating the Stability Difference:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

arr = np.array([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5])

np_sorted_indices = np.argsort(arr)
tf_sorted_indices = tf.argsort(arr, axis=-1, stable=True).numpy() # added stable=True for this example


print("NumPy argsort:", np_sorted_indices)
print("TensorFlow argsort:", tf_sorted_indices)

```

In this example, we observe that while both NumPy and TensorFlow return the indices that sort the array, differences might emerge for equal values.  By setting `stable=True` in TensorFlow, we are ensuring, in this instance, stability. However, without this argument, the output can differ from the NumPy outcome. The key is that consistent behavior is not guaranteed for `tf.argsort` without specifying `stable=True`, which may or may not be supported based on the TensorFlow version or backend.


**Example 2: Highlighting Non-Deterministic Behavior (TensorFlow):**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

arr = np.array([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5])

tf_sorted_indices_1 = tf.argsort(arr, axis=-1).numpy()
tf_sorted_indices_2 = tf.argsort(arr, axis=-1).numpy()

print("TensorFlow argsort (Run 1):", tf_sorted_indices_1)
print("TensorFlow argsort (Run 2):", tf_sorted_indices_2)
```

Running this multiple times may, or may not, produce identical results. The absence of guaranteed stability means the indices corresponding to equal values (e.g., the multiple '1's or '5's) may appear in different orders in different executions.

**Example 3:  Addressing the Issue with Explicit Sorting:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

arr = np.array([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5])

# Enforce deterministic sorting using NumPy within TensorFlow
tf_arr = tf.convert_to_tensor(arr)
sorted_indices_tf = tf.constant(np.argsort(arr))

print("TensorFlow argsort (using NumPy):", sorted_indices_tf.numpy())
```

This example demonstrates a robust approach.  By leveraging NumPy's stable sorting first and then converting the result to a TensorFlow tensor, you ensure deterministic and stable sorting behavior, regardless of TensorFlow's internal choices.  This is a common practice to maintain predictable results when interfacing NumPy and TensorFlow operations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of sorting algorithms and their stability properties, I recommend consulting standard algorithms textbooks.  TensorFlow's official documentation provides detailed information on the `tf.argsort` function, including its limitations and potential variations across versions and hardware.  NumPy's documentation similarly provides comprehensive details on `np.argsort`'s behavior. Exploring the source code for the specific sorting algorithm employed by TensorFlow in a given version can also provide additional insights, though this requires a deeper understanding of the TensorFlow internals.  Finally, researching papers on GPU-accelerated sorting algorithms will further illuminate the design choices and tradeoffs involved in balancing speed and stability.
