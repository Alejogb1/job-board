The core challenge in implementing logistic regression variants in PyTorch lies not in the algorithm's inherent complexity, but rather in effectively leveraging PyTorch's autograd functionality to streamline the training process and handle various regularization techniques seamlessly.  My experience optimizing large-scale sentiment analysis models highlighted this precisely.  While the basic logistic regression formulation is straightforward, scaling it for efficiency and incorporating advanced regularization necessitates a deeper understanding of PyTorch's computational graph and its automatic differentiation capabilities.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Logistic regression, at its heart, models the probability of a binary outcome.  In its simplest form, it uses a sigmoid function to map a linear combination of input features to a probability between 0 and 1.  However, numerous variants exist.  These variants primarily differ in how they handle regularization, feature transformations, or the underlying optimization algorithm.  Common examples include L1-regularized logistic regression (using LASSO), L2-regularized logistic regression (using Ridge regression), and variants incorporating techniques like Elastic Net regularization, which combines L1 and L2 penalties.  These regularization techniques help prevent overfitting, a critical concern when dealing with high-dimensional data or limited training samples.

In PyTorch, implementing these variants involves defining the model architecture (a single linear layer followed by a sigmoid activation), defining a loss function (typically binary cross-entropy), choosing an optimizer (like SGD, Adam, or RMSprop), and then iteratively updating the model's weights based on the calculated gradients.  The key to efficient implementation lies in properly utilizing PyTorch's automatic differentiation capabilities, which automatically compute the gradients necessary for weight updates, freeing the developer from manual gradient calculation.  Furthermore, PyTorch's modularity allows easy integration of different regularization techniques.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Logistic Regression**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the model
class LogisticRegression(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super(LogisticRegression, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_dim, 1)  # Single output neuron for binary classification
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.sigmoid(self.linear(x))

# Hyperparameters
input_dim = 10
learning_rate = 0.01
epochs = 100

# Data (replace with your actual data)
X = torch.randn(100, input_dim)
y = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))  # Binary labels

# Initialize model, loss function, and optimizer
model = LogisticRegression(input_dim)
criterion = nn.BCELoss() # Binary Cross Entropy Loss
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(X)
    loss = criterion(outputs.squeeze(), y.float())

    # Backward pass and optimization
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

```

This example demonstrates a basic logistic regression model.  The `nn.Linear` layer performs the linear transformation, and `nn.Sigmoid` maps the output to probabilities. `nn.BCELoss` computes the binary cross-entropy loss, and `optim.SGD` performs stochastic gradient descent.  The `squeeze()` method is used to remove the extra dimension from the output before calculating the loss.  This is crucial as the loss function expects a tensor of the same shape as the target labels.

**Example 2: L2-Regularized Logistic Regression**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... (Model definition from Example 1 remains the same) ...

# Hyperparameters (adding weight decay for L2 regularization)
input_dim = 10
learning_rate = 0.01
epochs = 100
weight_decay = 0.01 # L2 regularization parameter

# ... (Data remains the same) ...

# Initialize model, loss function, and optimizer with weight decay
model = LogisticRegression(input_dim)
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate, weight_decay=weight_decay)

# ... (Training loop remains largely the same) ...
```

This example introduces L2 regularization by adding the `weight_decay` parameter to the optimizer.  This parameter adds a penalty proportional to the squared magnitude of the model's weights to the loss function, effectively shrinking the weights and preventing overfitting.  This is a very efficient method, handled directly by PyTorchâ€™s optimizer without manual calculation of the penalty term.

**Example 3:  Logistic Regression with Elastic Net Regularization**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... (Model definition from Example 1 remains the same) ...

# Hyperparameters
input_dim = 10
learning_rate = 0.01
epochs = 100
l1_decay = 0.001 # L1 regularization parameter
l2_decay = 0.01 # L2 regularization parameter

# ... (Data remains the same) ...


#Custom loss function incorporating Elastic Net
def elastic_net_loss(outputs, targets, l1_decay, l2_decay):
    bce_loss = nn.BCELoss()(outputs.squeeze(), targets.float())
    l1_reg = torch.sum(torch.abs(model.linear.weight))
    l2_reg = torch.sum(model.linear.weight**2)
    return bce_loss + l1_decay * l1_reg + l2_decay * l2_reg

# Initialize model, loss function, and optimizer
model = LogisticRegression(input_dim)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(X)
    loss = elastic_net_loss(outputs, y, l1_decay, l2_decay)

    # Backward pass and optimization
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

This example demonstrates Elastic Net regularization.  Since PyTorch's optimizers don't directly support Elastic Net, we define a custom loss function that explicitly incorporates both L1 and L2 penalty terms.  This approach provides finer control over the regularization process.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation is invaluable.  Furthermore, a solid understanding of linear algebra and multivariate calculus will be crucial for grasping the underlying mathematical principles.  A textbook focused on machine learning, particularly chapters dedicated to logistic regression and regularization techniques, would be highly beneficial. Finally, reviewing advanced optimization algorithms' papers (like those for Adam and RMSprop) can improve the training process further.
