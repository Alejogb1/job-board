TensorBoard's default scalar logging mechanisms aren't directly designed for visualizing accuracy as a single metric across multiple epochs.  Accuracy, frequently expressed as a percentage or ratio, requires careful structuring of your logging data to ensure effective representation within TensorBoard's visualization capabilities.  My experience debugging similar visualization issues across numerous deep learning projects highlights the necessity of explicitly tagging and structuring accuracy data to avoid misinterpretations.


1. **Clear Explanation:**

TensorBoard primarily interprets data logged as scalars, which are single numerical values.  While you might compute accuracy during model training, TensorBoard needs this value associated with specific training steps or epochs, allowing it to plot accuracy's evolution over time.  Failure to do so results in a graph lacking the necessary time-series context.  The key is to log the accuracy value along with a global step counter. This counter uniquely identifies each training iteration, providing the x-axis for the graph.  Directly logging accuracy as a scalar, without this association, leads to unpredictable behavior; TensorBoard might display a single point or simply fail to render anything at all.  Furthermore, the scalar summary's `tag` (name) should clearly distinguish it from other logged metrics like loss.  Using descriptive tags allows for efficient filtering and comparison within the TensorBoard interface. Consistent tagging practices are crucial for maintainability, especially in larger projects involving many experiments and metrics.  Poorly named or inconsistently tagged metrics significantly hinder the analysis and interpretation of training progress.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Using `tf.summary.scalar` (TensorFlow):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your model training loop ...

# Assuming 'accuracy' is your calculated accuracy value
# and 'global_step' is the current training step

with tf.summary.create_file_writer(logdir="./logs/train") as writer:
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for step, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_dataset):
            # ... training step ...
            accuracy = calculate_accuracy(model, images, labels)  # Your accuracy calculation function
            global_step = epoch * steps_per_epoch + step # Calculate global step
            with writer.as_default():
              tf.summary.scalar('training_accuracy', accuracy, step=global_step)
            # ... rest of training step ...

# To visualize: tensorboard --logdir ./logs/train
```

This example directly uses TensorFlow's `tf.summary.scalar` to log the accuracy.  The `step` argument is crucial; it provides the x-axis value for TensorBoard.  The `logdir` specifies the directory where TensorBoard will find the log files. The accuracy is calculated within the training loop. The use of `global_step` ensures that the accuracy is plotted correctly against training progression. The use of a clear tag, 'training_accuracy', differentiates this metric from others.  Replacing  `calculate_accuracy` with your specific accuracy computation is paramount.


**Example 2:  Using `SummaryWriter` (PyTorch):**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter

# ... your model training loop ...

writer = SummaryWriter('./logs/train')

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for step, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
        # ... training step ...
        accuracy = calculate_accuracy(model, images, labels) # Your accuracy calculation function
        global_step = epoch * len(train_loader) + step #Calculate global step
        writer.add_scalar('training_accuracy', accuracy, global_step)
        # ... rest of training step ...

writer.close()

# To visualize: tensorboard --logdir ./logs/train
```

This PyTorch example leverages `SummaryWriter` for similar functionality. The structure closely mirrors the TensorFlow example, highlighting the consistency in data structuring required for successful TensorBoard visualization regardless of the deep learning framework. `calculate_accuracy` needs to be replaced with your specific PyTorch accuracy function. The `global_step` calculation guarantees correct plotting along the training progression.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Datasets (Validation Accuracy):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your model training loop ...

with tf.summary.create_file_writer(logdir="./logs/train") as writer:
  for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for step, (images, labels) in enumerate(train_dataset):
      # ... training step ...
      train_accuracy = calculate_accuracy(model, images, labels)
      global_step = epoch * steps_per_epoch + step
      with writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('training_accuracy', train_accuracy, step=global_step)

    #Validation Accuracy
    val_accuracy = calculate_accuracy(model, val_dataset) # Assuming a separate function for validation
    with writer.as_default():
      tf.summary.scalar('validation_accuracy', val_accuracy, step=epoch)  # Epoch level for validation

# To visualize: tensorboard --logdir ./logs/train
```

This example demonstrates logging both training and validation accuracy.  Note that validation accuracy is typically calculated at the end of each epoch, so the `step` argument uses the epoch number.  This differentiation is crucial for clear interpretation in TensorBoard.  The distinct tags 'training_accuracy' and 'validation_accuracy' facilitate easy comparison within TensorBoard. The use of separate accuracy calculation functions for training and validation is recommended for clarity and maintainability.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorBoard documentation is invaluable.  A thorough understanding of scalar summaries and the `SummaryWriter` API (for both TensorFlow and PyTorch) is fundamental.  Numerous online tutorials and blog posts cover TensorBoard usage in conjunction with various deep learning frameworks.  Focusing on examples that demonstrate logging multiple metrics over time will prove beneficial.  Referencing published research papers using similar visualization techniques can provide further insights into best practices.  Finally, reviewing the source code of well-maintained open-source deep learning projects often offers valuable lessons in logging and visualization techniques.
