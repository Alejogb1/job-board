The presence of NaN values in Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, while the L1 loss remains valid, within a U-Net model in PyTorch, typically points toward numerical instability issues arising from the squaring operation inherent in the MSE calculation. I've personally encountered this several times while developing medical image segmentation models, and the discrepancy almost invariably traces back to the scale of predicted values compared to the ground truth.

Let's delve into the core mechanics of this behavior. The U-Net architecture, designed for image segmentation, employs a series of convolutional and pooling layers in a contracting path, followed by a symmetric expanding path. During the final stages of the expanding path, feature maps are progressively upsampled and combined, aiming to generate a segmentation mask or a similar representation. The output, before a potential sigmoid or softmax activation, often exhibits values that can be relatively large or, conversely, very close to zero. This is not in itself an issue; these values are logits, essentially representing the model’s confidence in assigning each pixel to a given class. The activation function scales these logits into probabilities if needed.

The MSE loss function, defined as the average of the squared differences between the predicted and ground truth values, amplifies any deviations. When predictions stray from the target values, especially during the early stages of training when models are less refined, the squaring operation can rapidly generate large error values. If the initial predictions are far from the expected ground truth, the squared values might be sufficiently large that, when accumulated in the loss calculation, they exceed the numerical capacity of the floating-point representation on the system (typically float32). These accumulated, excessively large values overflow, transitioning to infinity, and when averaged, can become NaN. In effect, we have a computation that exceeds the ability of the system to represent it meaningfully.

Conversely, the L1 loss, which calculates the average of the absolute differences, exhibits a more gradual increase in error as the predicted values deviate from the ground truth. There's no squaring, and therefore no inherent amplification of large deviations, preventing the potential for overflow leading to NaN values during loss calculation. The L1 norm also handles potential issues around zero better, as its gradient is constant, unlike the gradient of the squared error which approaches zero as the prediction approaches the true target.

Let’s examine this concept through code examples. Assume a simplified scenario involving 100 predicted values from the U-Net model and their corresponding ground truth.

**Code Example 1: Illustrating NaN with MSE**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Simulated predicted values, some high numbers
predicted = torch.randn(100) * 100 # Simulate initially large predicted values.
ground_truth = torch.zeros(100)  # Assume segmentation into zero or one for example

mse_loss_function = nn.MSELoss()
l1_loss_function = nn.L1Loss()

mse_loss_val = mse_loss_function(predicted, ground_truth)
l1_loss_val = l1_loss_function(predicted, ground_truth)


print("MSE loss:", mse_loss_val)
print("L1 loss:", l1_loss_val)
```

In this example, by generating predictions with significantly large magnitude (`torch.randn(100) * 100`), we demonstrate the situation where MSE will often yield a NaN value due to the squares and sum during the calculations exceeding float representation limits while the L1 loss would handle this scenario reasonably well with its absolute difference.

**Code Example 2: Stabilizing MSE with Output Scaling**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Simulated predicted values, some high numbers, but now scaled down
predicted = torch.randn(100) * 10 # Scaled to a lower range.
ground_truth = torch.zeros(100)

mse_loss_function = nn.MSELoss()
l1_loss_function = nn.L1Loss()


mse_loss_val = mse_loss_function(predicted, ground_truth)
l1_loss_val = l1_loss_function(predicted, ground_truth)


print("MSE loss:", mse_loss_val)
print("L1 loss:", l1_loss_val)

```

Here, by reducing the initial range of random predictions with `torch.randn(100) * 10` rather than *100, the resulting MSE loss should no longer result in NaN. This illustrates the sensitivity of MSE to value scales. We've effectively adjusted the scale of the model's output, preventing the squaring from generating very large intermediate numbers which might cause issues for float representation. The L1 loss will work regardless of the scaling changes made to the predicted values within the context of this example.

**Code Example 3: Clipping for Handling Predictions**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Simulated predicted values, including some outliers
predicted = torch.randn(100) * 100  # High random values are generated to simulate unstable prediction
ground_truth = torch.zeros(100)

predicted = torch.clamp(predicted, -100, 100) # Clipping prediction values between -100 and 100 to avoid very large deviation

mse_loss_function = nn.MSELoss()
l1_loss_function = nn.L1Loss()


mse_loss_val = mse_loss_function(predicted, ground_truth)
l1_loss_val = l1_loss_function(predicted, ground_truth)

print("MSE loss:", mse_loss_val)
print("L1 loss:", l1_loss_val)
```

This example employs a clipping mechanism using `torch.clamp`. The predicted values are constrained to lie between -100 and 100, ensuring that the squares do not generate values outside acceptable numerical limits. We are not reducing the size of the random noise used, but rather we are setting limits on its magnitude. This technique is often applied when an activation (such as a sigmoid) is not applied to the final prediction or the input of the loss function and large values are expected, especially in the beginning of the training. We can see that after the clamping, the MSE is no longer `NaN`.

In summary, the NaN values encountered with the MSE loss, while the L1 loss functions properly, are a consequence of the squaring operation in MSE and the resulting numerical instability when the magnitude of prediction error is high. The issue is exacerbated by the model’s tendency to output unbounded values before proper training. It's not a fundamental flaw in the MSE loss itself, but a sensitivity to magnitude.

For further study, I would strongly recommend exploring resources on numerical stability in deep learning training and specifically loss functions. Material on proper output scaling within model architectures and normalization techniques used for the activations inside the network, along with strategies for gradient clipping, are also beneficial.  Publications discussing best practices in image segmentation, particularly focusing on U-Net architecture fine tuning, can offer further insight into appropriate loss function selection based on the data scales. Lastly, review resources that delve into the mathematical behavior of the loss functions themselves. The understanding gained through this kind of background knowledge assists in making informed decisions in deep learning model design.
