The core issue with graph disconnection during TensorFlow custom loss implementation stems from unintended manipulations within the loss function that break the computational graph’s ability to trace gradients back to the input tensors. This commonly occurs when the loss function improperly handles or fails to use Tensor operations in the correct scope, particularly when that function accepts multiple inputs. I've encountered this several times, particularly when training models with complex, multimodal data pipelines. The error often manifests as a `tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` complaining about operations that are not within the computation graph, leading to a failure in backpropagation.

At its foundation, TensorFlow constructs a computational graph representing the operations to be executed. This graph establishes dependencies between tensors, allowing automatic differentiation to work by tracking how the output (loss) changes concerning the trainable variables of the model. A custom loss function that operates outside of the scope of this graph disrupts this process. Specifically, if non-TensorFlow operations or data manipulations that are not part of the graph's forward pass are used within the loss function, then the graph’s path back to the input tensors gets severed. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure the custom loss function strictly uses TensorFlow operations (or equivalent NumPy implementations decorated with `@tf.function` if it’s a Python function). It also must rely only on the input tensors and model weights, avoiding external variables or data loading within this context. Using the proper tensor manipulation and correctly managing scope are paramount when developing custom loss functions, particularly when those accept multiple inputs.

The first scenario often encountered is when the loss function involves explicit conversions between tensor and non-tensor data. Imagine a scenario where you are combining image data and textual features in a multimodal setting. Let's assume that textual data is encoded into fixed-length vectors that are processed along with image features. If the loss function inadvertently casts a tensor to a Python list or NumPy array to perform some computation and then subsequently fails to convert it back into a tensor before utilizing it in further operations, the graph will likely be disconnected.

Here's an example illustrating this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def non_graph_loss(y_true, y_pred, text_embedding):
    # Incorrectly convert y_pred to numpy array
    y_pred_np = y_pred.numpy()
    
    # Some dummy operation with the numpy array and text embeddings
    # (Assuming text_embedding is already correctly used as a Tensor)
    loss_val = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - tf.convert_to_tensor(y_pred_np)))
    
    return loss_val

# Dummy placeholders for the sake of this example
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y_pred = tf.constant([[1.1, 2.2], [3.3, 4.4]], dtype=tf.float32)
text_embedding = tf.constant([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Attempt to calculate loss: this would result in error
try:
    loss_val = non_graph_loss(y_true, y_pred, text_embedding)
    print(f"Loss {loss_val}")
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

```

In this incorrect example, `.numpy()` is called on the `y_pred` tensor. This action detaches it from the TensorFlow computational graph. Even though I attempt to convert the NumPy array back to a TensorFlow tensor, the original link in the computational graph is severed. This causes a disconnection and throws an error during gradient calculation. The loss calculation depends on tensor operations to retain gradient information needed for backpropagation.

The remedy lies in strictly adhering to TensorFlow operations. If NumPy-like operations are necessary, we can leverage TensorFlow's operations to achieve similar functionalities. Furthermore, if an external Python function needs to be used, wrapping it using `@tf.function` allows it to integrate correctly within the TensorFlow graph. Let’s look at a corrected version that properly handles multiple input tensors:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def graph_loss(y_true, y_pred, text_embedding):
  # Example operation using multiple input tensors directly
  weighted_pred = y_pred * text_embedding 
  loss_val = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - weighted_pred))
  return loss_val

# Dummy placeholders as before
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y_pred = tf.constant([[1.1, 2.2], [3.3, 4.4]], dtype=tf.float32)
text_embedding = tf.constant([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Now the loss calculation will work
loss_val = graph_loss(y_true, y_pred, text_embedding)
print(f"Loss: {loss_val}")

# Demonstrate gradient calculations
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss_calc = graph_loss(y_true, y_pred, text_embedding)
    
gradients = tape.gradient(loss_calc, [y_pred])
print(f"Gradients: {gradients}")
```

Here, the `graph_loss` function operates entirely within TensorFlow's graph by using `tf.multiply` for element-wise multiplication and `tf.reduce_mean`, and `tf.square`. Crucially, all tensors are handled as `tf.Tensor` objects. This ensures that the computational graph remains intact, gradients can be computed, and backpropagation can proceed without any issues. I deliberately added gradient calculation to demonstrate how this version would work properly.

Another cause for graph disconnection can be using non-TensorFlow operations or attempting to load data directly within the loss function. For instance, if the loss function requires external data, loading it inside the loss function would cause a problem. TensorFlow operations, which form the basis of the graph, require prior existence in the graph. I once attempted to load an additional external file in the loss function, and this threw a disconnection error because the file operations are not part of the TensorFlow graph.

To illustrate further, consider the incorrect example where data is loaded directly in the loss function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os

def external_data_loss(y_true, y_pred, external_data_path):
    # Incorrect: reading data file inside the graph definition.
    if not os.path.exists(external_data_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Data file not found: {external_data_path}")
    
    loaded_data = np.load(external_data_path) 
    loaded_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(loaded_data, dtype=tf.float32)
    loss_val = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred + loaded_tensor))
    return loss_val
    
# Setup dummy placeholder paths for the sake of demonstration.
external_data_path = "dummy_data.npy"
np.save(external_data_path, np.array([0.5, 0.5]))
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
y_pred = tf.constant([[1.1, 2.2], [3.3, 4.4]], dtype=tf.float32)


# This will result in an error due to graph disconnection
try:
  loss_val_ex = external_data_loss(y_true, y_pred, external_data_path)
  print(f"loss value : {loss_val_ex}")
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    os.remove(external_data_path)
```
This incorrect implementation attempts to load data from an external file during the loss calculation. This directly violates the principle of graph definition. The correct way to handle such data would be to incorporate it as part of the input pipeline so that it is already available as a tensor during model training and within the scope of the graph. The loss function should not be concerned with data loading. It should only perform calculations on tensors that are input to it.

Debugging a disconnected graph often involves carefully examining the custom loss function, step by step, to pinpoint where TensorFlow tensors are potentially losing their tensor attributes. This can be done with TensorBoard for tracing the graph or through judicious use of the TensorFlow debugger.

For more comprehensive understanding and guidance I recommend the following resources:
1. TensorFlow’s official documentation, specifically the sections concerning custom loss functions and graph building.
2. The TensorFlow guide on writing custom training loops.
3. Tutorials addressing debugging and understanding the underlying computation graphs.
These resources helped immensely in understanding the intricacies of TensorFlow and helped me resolve similar graph disconnection issues that I have faced in my work. They will give a strong foundation to correctly construct custom loss functions and build better models.
