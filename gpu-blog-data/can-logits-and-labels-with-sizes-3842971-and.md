The primary issue when attempting to directly utilize logits of shape `[384, 2971]` with labels of shape `[864, 2971]` within a loss function lies in the fundamental requirement for shape consistency during comparison. Logits, representing unnormalized prediction scores across a vocabulary, and their corresponding ground truth labels must have congruent dimensional structures across batch and sequence lengths for operations like cross-entropy loss to function correctly. The mismatch here arises because the batch dimension differs; the logits reflect predictions for 384 examples, while the labels describe 864.

Essentially, the loss computation relies on a one-to-one correspondence between predictions and their true targets within the batch. This ensures that each predicted probability vector (logits) is evaluated against a single, definitive target. Without this alignment, the mathematical basis for calculating the difference between prediction and truth collapses, leading to either meaningless results or runtime exceptions.

The core of the problem is that during training, the loss function expects a 1:1 correspondence between logits and labels along the batch dimension. In scenarios using a per-example loss, each logit vector corresponds to a single label. With mismatched batch sizes, this correspondence is violated. A function, such as `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` (in PyTorch), operates element-wise, implicitly assumes matching batch dimensions and attempts to match logits with mismatched labels leading to errors or skewed loss computation.

While sequence length (the 2971 dimension in this case) compatibility is necessary, it is not the root cause here. Both the logits and labels must represent the same number of individual sequences in the batch; only then can individual logits from the model be accurately compared against the labels from the dataset.

Here's a more specific illustration. Consider, for example, a simplified view of how cross entropy is calculated (without considering reduction). Each row from your logits corresponds to an instance, and each row from your labels represents the expected outcome of the corresponding instance. They're aligned. If the logits row dimension is smaller, we cannot compute cross entropy for the missing row. In the described scenario, you have more labels than logits, and thus some labels have no associated predictions, and loss cannot be calculated properly.

Let me provide code examples, assuming a PyTorch environment:

**Code Example 1: Illustrating the Error**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Mismatched shapes
logits = torch.randn(384, 2971)
labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (864, 2971)) #Assume class counts <= 10


try:
    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, labels)
    print("Loss:", loss)  # Will not be reached
except Exception as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

**Commentary:**

This code snippet shows the most immediate outcome of your setup – a runtime error. The `F.cross_entropy` function detects a mismatch in the batch dimension of `logits` and `labels`, explicitly raising an error. The root cause is not how `cross_entropy` is implemented; any implementation that assumes correspondence between rows between the input logits and labels would raise an error or return nonsense.

The specific error message will vary depending on the deep learning framework, but in PyTorch, it typically indicates dimension mismatches, such as “Expected input batchsize (384) to match target batchsize (864)”. This error is fundamental; loss computation relies on element-wise pairing between predicted scores and their respective truths.

**Code Example 2: Resolving with Batch Truncation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Mismatched shapes
logits = torch.randn(384, 2971)
labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (864, 2971)) # Assume class counts <= 10


# Truncate Labels to match logits
truncated_labels = labels[:logits.shape[0], :]

try:
    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, truncated_labels)
    print("Loss:", loss)
except Exception as e:
    print("Error:", e)

```

**Commentary:**

This code offers a basic example of one approach for resolving the batch mismatch.  It truncates the label tensor to match the batch dimension of the logits. This achieves compatibility, allowing `cross_entropy` to compute a loss. However, this is **not ideal**; a key detail of the 864 data points is discarded. In most cases, these values should be incorporated into the calculation, such as via backpropagation. This method would also only work if the original training routine could accept variable batch sizes, which is unlikely. This illustrates the fundamental issue with direct usage of the provided sizes.

**Code Example 3: Reshaping and Reinterpreting data**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Mismatched shapes
logits = torch.randn(384, 2971)
labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (864, 2971)) # Assume class counts <= 10

#Reshape and split the batch
labels_reshaped = labels.reshape(2,384,2971)
labels_subset = labels_reshaped[0] # taking the first "batch"

try:
    loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, labels_subset)
    print("Loss:", loss)
except Exception as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

**Commentary:**

This example highlights a way to leverage a subset of the data based on the shape mismatch. It reshapes the larger label batch to accommodate the smaller batch size. The key here is understanding the semantic meaning of the batch. Is the initial batch representing disjoint sequences?  If so, the approach here using reshaping could be a way to create a subset to use as labels for the given logits. However, there are many assumptions made; if a smaller subset is desired, then a random selection or deterministic indexing approach might be more robust.

This also indicates a common issue when dealing with data: ensuring proper batch sizes for both inputs and outputs.

The crux of the problem is data generation and batching. The logits are the result of the model's forward pass, dependent on a specific batch size. The labels also must be generated based on the current batch. If there is a size mismatch, then the underlying dataset loader and generator must be inspected.

**Resolution and Resource Recommendations**

The presented scenario is not a case of compatible tensors and needs specific alterations during data loading or processing. The logits and labels must correspond to the same examples in a batch, necessitating adjustments in the data loading pipeline. The root problem is likely the way the data is batched and loaded into the model.

Here are some resource areas to explore for proper handling:

1.  **Deep Learning Framework Documentation:**  Deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, contain detailed documentation on data loading techniques and error-handling strategies. Focus on sections related to data loaders (`torch.utils.data.DataLoader` in PyTorch) and how to create custom dataset classes. These often involve correct indexing and subsetting operations to ensure compatible batch size.

2. **Data Preparation Best Practices:** Resources that cover data preprocessing and handling are useful. This will cover efficient techniques for creating batches of a consistent size, which is critical for deep learning. Pay special attention to how to handle batches of variable length.

3. **Model Input and Output:** Research how to design models to handle variable input sizes, or how to properly handle batching to avoid such size mismatches. Techniques such as padding might be needed, and are often discussed in resources covering sequence modelling.

In conclusion, directly using logits and labels with mismatched batch dimensions is not feasible. The problem is not due to a specific function’s limitation but the fact that any implementation of a loss function requires correspondence between the batch dimensions of its inputs. The resolution lies in addressing the underlying data pipeline or modifying the data such that shape compatibility is achieved, not in adapting the functions that depend on the correct shapes.
