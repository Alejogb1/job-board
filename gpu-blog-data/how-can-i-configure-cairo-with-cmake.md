The fundamental challenge in configuring Cairo with CMake stems from its diverse set of dependencies and platform-specific library handling, rather than inherent complexity in the build system itself. I’ve encountered numerous issues across Linux, Windows, and macOS while integrating Cairo into various graphics-focused projects, and these experiences have crystallized a pragmatic approach using CMake’s modular capabilities.

The core strategy revolves around robustly identifying Cairo’s dependencies – typically, X11, OpenGL, and potentially others like freetype2 and libpng – and ensuring they are correctly located and linked. This isn’t a monolithic process; each target environment requires a slightly different approach. Furthermore, we should aim to encapsulate the Cairo setup within a CMake module for easy reuse across different projects.

**Explanation**

My typical workflow involves a multi-stage process. First, I define a custom CMake module, usually named `FindCairo.cmake`. This module is responsible for locating the Cairo library, header files, and its required dependencies. It's critical to avoid relying on global system paths; explicitly searching through standard install locations and specific package management directories enhances portability. Within this module, we'll use CMake's `find_package()` command, along with the `REQUIRED` keyword, to identify the needed libraries. If `find_package()` fails to locate Cairo, or any of its required dependencies, it immediately aborts the CMake configuration process, ensuring the user is alerted to the missing component.

Next, the `FindCairo.cmake` module will also define several variables which act as an API for other parts of the project. This API commonly includes: `CAIRO_INCLUDE_DIRS` – a list of directories containing the Cairo headers; `CAIRO_LIBRARIES` – a list of the Cairo libraries and all its needed dependencies; and `CAIRO_FOUND` – a boolean indicating whether the Cairo libraries were successfully found.

Finally, the main `CMakeLists.txt` file will invoke the `FindCairo.cmake` module, checks for success using `CAIRO_FOUND`, and then adds the Cairo library to the required link targets of the executables or libraries which depend on it. This structure keeps the library-finding logic separate from the target definition logic and promotes code organization and reduces maintenance effort. It also allows for straightforward integration into multiple project directories.

**Code Examples**

Let's illustrate with practical examples, starting with the custom CMake module:

```cmake
# FindCairo.cmake
find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)

pkg_check_modules(CAIRO REQUIRED IMPORTED_TARGET cairo)

if(CAIRO_FOUND)
    set(CAIRO_INCLUDE_DIRS ${CAIRO_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    set(CAIRO_LIBRARIES $<TARGET_PROPERTY:cairo,INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES>)

    # Add other dependencies if needed, example using freetype
    find_package(Freetype REQUIRED)
    if(Freetype_FOUND)
       list(APPEND CAIRO_LIBRARIES ${Freetype_LIBRARIES})
    endif()
    
    message(STATUS "Cairo found. Includes: ${CAIRO_INCLUDE_DIRS}, Libraries: ${CAIRO_LIBRARIES}")
else()
    message(FATAL_ERROR "Cairo library not found. Please ensure Cairo is installed.")
endif()
```

**Commentary:** This code snippet first uses PkgConfig to locate Cairo and also Freetype. PkgConfig is the recommended method for handling dependencies, as it can properly handle the necessary flags and location. It ensures that dependencies are properly located using the `REQUIRED` flag, avoiding manual configuration of include and library paths. We then construct the `CAIRO_INCLUDE_DIRS` and `CAIRO_LIBRARIES` variables to be available to the remainder of the project. This particular example also searches for Freetype, a very common Cairo dependency for font rendering. This demonstrates a way to also handle Cairo dependencies.

Now, consider how the main project’s `CMakeLists.txt` would use this module:

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(CairoExample)

set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}")

include(FindCairo)

add_executable(MyCairoApp main.cpp)

if(CAIRO_FOUND)
    target_include_directories(MyCairoApp PRIVATE ${CAIRO_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    target_link_libraries(MyCairoApp PRIVATE ${CAIRO_LIBRARIES})
else()
    message(FATAL_ERROR "Cairo configuration failed. Please check FindCairo.cmake")
endif()
```

**Commentary:** This example first sets the CMake module path to the source directory, allowing CMake to find `FindCairo.cmake`. Then it invokes this module, making use of the `CAIRO_FOUND` variable to check if Cairo was successfully configured. If successful, it sets the include directory and links the needed Cairo libraries to `MyCairoApp`, our executable. If unsuccessful, it exits with an error. This modular approach is extremely clean and is very simple to maintain, while also providing good error handling.

Finally, let’s examine a slightly more complex scenario, perhaps on macOS, where the system’s framework-based structure might require different handling:

```cmake
# FindCairo.cmake (macOS specific considerations)
find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)

pkg_check_modules(CAIRO REQUIRED IMPORTED_TARGET cairo)

if(CAIRO_FOUND)
    set(CAIRO_INCLUDE_DIRS ${CAIRO_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    set(CAIRO_LIBRARIES $<TARGET_PROPERTY:cairo,INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES>)

     #Add Quartz if needed
    find_library(QUARTZ_LIBRARY Quartz PATHS /System/Library/Frameworks)
    if(QUARTZ_LIBRARY)
       list(APPEND CAIRO_LIBRARIES "${QUARTZ_LIBRARY}")
    endif()

    # Add CoreGraphics if needed
    find_library(COREGRAPHICS_LIBRARY CoreGraphics PATHS /System/Library/Frameworks)
      if(COREGRAPHICS_LIBRARY)
        list(APPEND CAIRO_LIBRARIES "${COREGRAPHICS_LIBRARY}")
      endif()

    message(STATUS "Cairo found. Includes: ${CAIRO_INCLUDE_DIRS}, Libraries: ${CAIRO_LIBRARIES}")
else()
    message(FATAL_ERROR "Cairo library not found. Please ensure Cairo is installed.")
endif()

```

**Commentary:** This modified version of the module shows an additional step for macOS specific dependencies. In this scenario, where frameworks like Quartz and CoreGraphics are often needed when developing for macOS, we are first checking for their location in the operating system’s framework path. If the framework locations are found, they are then added to the `CAIRO_LIBRARIES`. This illustrates how to accommodate platform-specific dependency handling within the same general structure, demonstrating that the core module approach remains applicable across differing environments.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, the official CMake documentation provides invaluable information regarding module creation and dependency management. Specifically, familiarize yourself with `find_package()`, `pkg_check_modules()`, `find_library()`, and `target_include_directories()`. Additionally, exploring the documentation for the PkgConfig utility itself will be beneficial, as this approach is generally considered a robust method for library configuration in Linux. Additionally, the official documentation of Cairo itself contains important installation instructions, specifically for its dependencies. These three sources, used in tandem, should resolve almost any Cairo configuration with CMake.
