Appending two large arrays without exceeding available RAM necessitates a strategy that avoids loading both arrays entirely into memory simultaneously.  My experience working on large-scale genomic data processing highlighted this limitation repeatedly;  naive concatenation would invariably lead to `MemoryError` exceptions.  The core solution lies in employing iterative or streaming approaches, processing data in chunks that fit within the available memory.


**1.  Clear Explanation**

The problem stems from the implicit assumption that array concatenation involves creating a new array in memory, the size of which is the sum of the sizes of the input arrays.  When dealing with datasets exceeding available RAM, this direct approach is infeasible. The solution requires a different paradigm: processing the arrays segmentally.  Instead of loading the entire arrays, we iterate through them, writing the concatenated output to a persistent storage medium, such as a file, or to a memory-mapped file which offers a compromise between RAM and disk speed.

The choice between file-based and memory-mapped approaches depends on the specific constraints: file-based operations are generally slower but offer better scalability for extremely large datasets, while memory-mapped files provide a performance advantage when the combined size isn't drastically larger than available RAM, as they allow for faster random access.  However, they still require careful management to avoid overwriting data and potential memory exhaustion if used carelessly.

Several strategies can facilitate this segmented approach.  These strategies fundamentally differ in how they manage the output:

* **Sequential Write to File:** This approach writes each chunk of the concatenated arrays directly to a file.  It's straightforward and suitable for massive datasets where memory mapping might be impractical.

* **Memory-Mapped File:**  This allows treating a portion of a file as if it were in memory, enabling efficient random access within the mapped region.  This balances the speed of in-memory operations with the storage capacity of the disk.  However, careful management of the mapped region and its size is critical.

* **Chunking and On-Demand Processing:** If the arrays are accessed sequentially for later processing, there's no need to fully concatenate them.  Instead, one can define a function that iterates over the constituent arrays and processes each chunk individually. This avoids creating a large concatenated array entirely, greatly saving on memory.



**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Sequential Write to File (Python)**

```python
import os

def append_arrays_to_file(array1, array2, output_filename):
    """Appends two arrays to a file sequentially.  Handles potential exceptions robustly."""
    try:
        with open(output_filename, 'wb') as outfile:  #Binary write mode for efficient handling of various data types
            chunk_size = 1024  # Adjust based on available RAM
            for i in range(0, len(array1), chunk_size):
                outfile.write(array1[i:i+chunk_size].tobytes()) #Convert to bytes for efficient binary writing

            for i in range(0, len(array2), chunk_size):
                outfile.write(array2[i:i+chunk_size].tobytes())
    except (IOError, OSError) as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

#Example Usage (assuming NumPy arrays):
import numpy as np
array1 = np.arange(1000000)
array2 = np.arange(1000000,2000000)
append_arrays_to_file(array1, array2, "output.bin")

```

This code efficiently writes arrays in chunks to a binary file, avoiding memory overflow.  Error handling is included to manage potential file I/O issues.  The `chunk_size` parameter is crucial for controlling memory usage; this needs to be experimentally determined based on the system's RAM and array data types.


**Example 2: Memory-Mapped File (Python)**

```python
import os
import mmap
import numpy as np

def append_arrays_mmap(array1, array2, output_filename):
    """Appends arrays using memory mapping.  Requires careful memory management."""
    try:
        file_size = array1.nbytes + array2.nbytes
        with open(output_filename, 'wb+') as f:
            f.truncate(file_size) #Pre-allocate file size
            with mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), file_size, access=mmap.ACCESS_WRITE) as mm:
                mm[:array1.nbytes] = array1.tobytes()
                mm[array1.nbytes:] = array2.tobytes()
    except (IOError, OSError, ValueError) as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

#Example usage
array1 = np.arange(1000000)
array2 = np.arange(1000000,2000000)
append_arrays_mmap(array1, array2, "output_mmap.bin")

```

This example demonstrates the use of memory-mapped files for faster access.  Pre-allocating the file size improves efficiency.  Note that the `ValueError` exception is added to handle potential mismatches between array sizes and allocated memory. The `access=mmap.ACCESS_WRITE` ensures write access.



**Example 3: Chunking without Complete Concatenation (Python with Generator)**

```python
import numpy as np

def process_chunked_arrays(array1, array2, chunk_size, processing_function):
    """Processes arrays chunk-wise without full concatenation."""
    for i in range(0, len(array1), chunk_size):
        chunk1 = array1[i:i + chunk_size]
        chunk2 = array2[i:i + chunk_size]
        processing_function(chunk1, chunk2)


def example_processing(chunk1, chunk2):
    """Example processing function: simple element-wise addition."""
    print(f"Processing chunks: {np.sum(chunk1)}, {np.sum(chunk2)}")  # Replace with your actual processing logic.


# Example Usage
array1 = np.arange(1000000)
array2 = np.arange(1000000, 2000000)
chunk_size = 10000
process_chunked_arrays(array1, array2, chunk_size, example_processing)

```

This example showcases the most memory-efficient approach.  It directly processes chunks from both arrays without creating a combined array. The `processing_function` is a placeholder; it should be replaced with the actual computation needed.  This method is ideal when the final concatenated array isn't required explicitly.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding, I suggest consulting textbooks on data structures and algorithms, focusing on memory management and file I/O operations.  Additionally, materials on efficient data processing techniques and parallel processing are relevant.  Finally, the official documentation for your chosen programming language's libraries related to file I/O and memory mapping will be invaluable.  A strong grasp of operating system concepts regarding memory management will greatly benefit the application of these techniques.
