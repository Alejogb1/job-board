The `tf.contrib` module, deprecated in TensorFlow 2.0, housed several useful functions, including `tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected`.  Its direct replacement isn't a single function but rather a combination of approaches leveraging the `tf.keras.layers` API.  My experience migrating large-scale models from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x highlighted the need for a nuanced understanding of this transition.  Simply substituting with a seemingly equivalent function often resulted in subtle, yet critical, differences in behavior and performance.

The key to effectively replacing `tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected` lies in understanding its core functionality: creating a fully connected (dense) layer with flexible options for activation functions, weight initializers, and regularizers.  TensorFlow 2.0's `tf.keras.layers.Dense` layer provides this functionality and more within a more streamlined and Keras-integrated framework.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected` function offered a concise way to define a dense layer, specifying the number of units (neurons), activation function, and various regularization parameters.  However, TensorFlow 2.0 promotes the use of the Keras Sequential and Functional APIs, which encourage a more object-oriented approach to model building.  Therefore, instead of a single function call, constructing an equivalent layer in TensorFlow 2.0 involves instantiating a `tf.keras.layers.Dense` object. This object then becomes part of a larger Keras model, either sequentially or functionally defined.

The crucial parameters remain consistent: the number of units dictates the output dimension, the activation function determines the non-linear transformation applied to the layer's output, kernel_initializer and bias_initializer control weight and bias initialization, and kernel_regularizer and bias_regularizer allow for regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization.

Key differences include the handling of biases (explicitly handled in `tf.keras.layers.Dense`) and the more integrated nature of the layer within the Keras ecosystem, allowing for easier access to training metadata and hooks.  This improved integration simplifies model building, debugging, and deployment.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Dense Layer Replication**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1.x (deprecated)
# dense_layer = tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected(inputs, num_outputs=128, activation_fn=tf.nn.relu)

# TensorFlow 2.x equivalent
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=128, activation='relu')(inputs)

# inputs is expected to be a tf.Tensor representing the input to the layer.
```

This example demonstrates the most straightforward translation. The `units` parameter replaces `num_outputs`, and the string 'relu' specifies the ReLU activation function, replacing the explicit `tf.nn.relu` call.  The crucial difference is the use of the `()` operator after the `Dense` layer instantiation. This calls the layer's `__call__` method, effectively applying the layer to the input tensor.

**Example 2: Incorporating Weight Regularization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1.x (deprecated)
# dense_layer = tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected(inputs, num_outputs=64,
#                                                activation_fn=tf.nn.sigmoid,
#                                                weights_regularizer=tf.contrib.layers.l2_regularizer(0.01))

# TensorFlow 2.x equivalent
regularizer = tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.01)
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=64, activation='sigmoid', kernel_regularizer=regularizer)(inputs)
```

This example showcases how to handle weight regularization.  TensorFlow 2.0 uses the `tf.keras.regularizers` module, providing a cleaner interface for defining regularization terms.  The `l2` function creates an L2 regularizer with the specified strength (0.01).  This regularizer is then assigned to the `kernel_regularizer` attribute of the `Dense` layer.

**Example 3:  Building a Sequential Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),  # Assuming 28x28 input images
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # 10 output classes for example
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

#Further training and evaluation steps would follow here.
```

This example demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate the `Dense` layer within a Keras Sequential model.  This approach is preferred for simpler models due to its intuitive and concise syntax. The model is defined by stacking layers, and the `compile` method sets up the training process.  This illustrates the advantages of the Keras API's integration within TensorFlow 2.0.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 2.x documentation provides comprehensive details on the Keras API and the `tf.keras.layers.Dense` layer.  Consult the TensorFlow guide on building and training models using Keras for a deeper understanding of model creation, training, and evaluation.  Additionally, reviewing tutorials and examples focused specifically on migrating TensorFlow 1.x code to TensorFlow 2.x will prove beneficial.  Finally, exploring publications and research papers on deep learning architectures utilizing TensorFlow 2.0 will further enhance your understanding and proficiency.  These resources will offer a more in-depth and practical guide to building robust and efficient models using TensorFlow 2.0.
