The discrepancy often arises from subtle differences in how a custom metric is calculated versus the internal computations performed during `model.predict`. I've encountered this issue several times, particularly when dealing with metrics that aren't inherently differentiable or when employing batch-wise aggregations that differ from the true prediction output. The root cause often boils down to a mismatch in the operating context: your custom metric operates on the provided `y_true` and `y_pred` arguments during training (and sometimes validation), while `model.predict` bypasses these during inference and outputs the raw model activations, interpreted and potentially transformed by the model's final layers, or by methods applied during evaluation.

Typically, `model.predict` returns the model's output after passing through the last layer, which, depending on the model's design, might be a softmax, sigmoid, or a linear activation function. Metrics, conversely, are calculated by Keras by accumulating the results from each batch, using the model’s output that has been passed to its loss function or an explicit transformation. The subtle differences here are the key point.

First, consider that the output of `model.predict` might be probabilities (from softmax or sigmoid) or logits, while your metric could be expecting binary predictions obtained by thresholding. This discrepancy arises from a difference in the intended scope of the two operations. `model.predict` is designed to provide raw outputs for inference, whereas your metric’s evaluation involves interpreting those outputs in a way relevant to the task at hand.

Second, batch-wise aggregations can introduce inaccuracies if your metric is not formulated to correctly average or sum over batches. During training, Keras handles metrics on a batch level, and the results are averaged to get an epoch-level score. The `model.predict` method, however, operates on the entirety of the input given and returns a corresponding raw output batch. If your metric is not correctly designed to aggregate across multiple batches during evaluation, the results are not guaranteed to be aligned with what is produced during training. The crucial part here is how you're gathering the result for the entire dataset.

Third, custom metrics don’t automatically inherit the output transformations of the `model.predict` method, resulting in misalignment. For instance, if you are using a custom activation layer at the end of your model, these layer's output transformations are applied before `model.predict` gives the result, but these are not applied on `y_pred` passed to the custom metrics.

To better illustrate, let's examine some code examples.

**Example 1: Misaligned Thresholding**

This example highlights the issue of thresholding for metrics versus raw output from `model.predict`. Assume we are performing binary classification, and we define our custom metric as accuracy based on a simple threshold of 0.5.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def binary_accuracy_thresholded(y_true, y_pred):
    y_pred_binary = tf.cast(y_pred > 0.5, tf.float32)
    return tf.keras.metrics.binary_accuracy(y_true, y_pred_binary)

# Example usage during training
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(10,))
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=[binary_accuracy_thresholded])
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=2, verbose=0)

# Example during prediction
X_test = np.random.rand(10, 10)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predictions_binary = (predictions > 0.5).astype(int)
```

Here, `binary_accuracy_thresholded` is calculated within the training loop, where the `y_pred` input has already been processed by the loss function, while `model.predict` returns the raw sigmoid outputs, which are then explicitly thresholded after prediction. Although both operations seem similar, the metric is calculated and aggregated over batches during training which is subtly different than direct thresholding.

**Example 2: Incorrect Batch Aggregation**

In this example, we have a metric that sums the number of correct predictions but fails to correctly average across batches, leading to inconsistent results. Let's define a custom metric that tracks the sum of correct predictions, and is incorrectly treated as an average:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class SumCorrectPredictions(tf.keras.metrics.Metric):
    def __init__(self, name='sum_correct_predictions', **kwargs):
        super(SumCorrectPredictions, self).__init__(name=name, **kwargs)
        self.correct_count = self.add_weight(name='correct_count', initializer='zeros', dtype=tf.int32)

    def update_state(self, y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=None):
        y_pred_binary = tf.cast(y_pred > 0.5, tf.int32)
        y_true_int = tf.cast(y_true, tf.int32)
        correct = tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(tf.equal(y_pred_binary, y_true_int), tf.int32))
        self.correct_count.assign_add(correct)


    def result(self):
      return self.correct_count

    def reset_state(self):
      self.correct_count.assign(0)

# Example usage during training
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(10,))
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=[SumCorrectPredictions()])
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=2, verbose=0, batch_size=32)

# Example during prediction
X_test = np.random.rand(100, 10)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predictions_binary = (predictions > 0.5).astype(int)
test_accuracy = np.mean(predictions_binary == y_train)
```
Here `SumCorrectPredictions` gives us an accumulated sum of correct predictions across batches. The reported metric is a running sum that has not been correctly normalized across batches during training, whereas the value computed based on model.predict, `test_accuracy` is the correct average.

**Example 3:  Missing Output Transformation**

This demonstrates a case where a custom activation layer modifies the output that is used by the metric, while `model.predict` does not include this transform.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class CustomActivation(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, x):
       return tf.nn.relu(x) * 2.0


def mean_absolute_error_without_relu(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.keras.metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(10,)),
    CustomActivation()
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_absolute_error', metrics=[mean_absolute_error_without_relu])

X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=2, verbose=0)

# Example during prediction
X_test = np.random.rand(100, 10)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
Here, `mean_absolute_error_without_relu` does not receive the modified output from the `CustomActivation` layer. The metric is applied before the final transformation of the model’s output, but the transformation is included in the output returned by `model.predict`. The metric operates on a modified input, whereas `model.predict` returns the unmodified output.

To mitigate these discrepancies, I recommend adopting the following strategies:

1.  **Explicitly process the output:** Ensure that your metric operates on the same transformed output as `model.predict`. If you need to threshold the output in your metric, do so in the `update_state` method. Similarly, incorporate any transformations that your model applies.
2.  **Batch-wise processing:** Correctly handle batch averaging. Do not directly use a sum in the `result` method of a custom Keras metric, instead define a counter and divide the final count by the number of samples processed.
3.  **Verify metric implementation:** Compare the results of your custom metric with equivalent standard metrics implemented in Keras during the training process. This comparison helps to narrow down the potential source of error in your custom implementation.
4.  **Implement a secondary custom evaluation:** Define a separate evaluation function that operates on the entirety of the input data after `model.predict`. By operating on full dataset output, this can ensure consistency with the `model.predict` function.

For further understanding, I recommend exploring the official Keras documentation on metrics, particularly the `tf.keras.metrics.Metric` class for custom metrics. Examine examples of metric implementation and aggregation as it can help to create more robust metric evaluation. Additionally, reviewing the TensorFlow documentation regarding the `model.predict` method and how it operates can also add insight. Understanding how outputs are handled both during training and inference is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the generated metrics. Specifically review Keras's metric design patterns to understand how they handle batching and aggregation.
