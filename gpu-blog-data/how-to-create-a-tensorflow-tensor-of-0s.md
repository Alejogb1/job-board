The core challenge in generating a TensorFlow tensor populated with a fixed number of ones per row, while the remaining entries are zeros, lies in efficiently managing the placement of those ones.  Brute-force approaches, while conceptually simple, become computationally expensive for larger tensors. My experience optimizing similar processes in high-throughput data pipelines led me to develop strategies leveraging TensorFlow's built-in functions for superior performance.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The solution hinges on understanding that we're essentially generating a binary matrix where each row's Hamming weight (the number of ones) is predefined.  Naive approaches involve looping through each row and randomly assigning the ones' positions. However, this is inefficient.  A superior technique involves leveraging TensorFlow's random permutation functions.  For each row, we generate a random permutation of indices, select the first `k` indices (where `k` is the desired number of ones), and then use these indices to populate a zero-filled tensor with ones.  This method avoids explicit looping within TensorFlow's computation graph, resulting in significant speed improvements, particularly for larger tensors.

The process can be decomposed into these steps:

a. **Initialization:** Create a tensor of zeros with the desired dimensions.

b. **Random Index Generation:** For each row, generate a random permutation of indices from 0 to the row length.  This permutation defines the order in which we'll place the ones.

c. **Selection and Assignment:** Select the first `k` indices from each row's permutation. These indices represent the positions where we'll place the ones in that row.

d. **Tensor Population:** Use `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` to efficiently place the ones at the selected indices within the initialized zero tensor.

This approach guarantees a fixed number of ones per row and leverages TensorFlow's optimized operations for efficient computation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `tf.random.shuffle` and `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_binary_tensor(rows, cols, ones_per_row):
    """Creates a TensorFlow tensor with a fixed number of 1s per row.

    Args:
      rows: Number of rows in the tensor.
      cols: Number of columns in the tensor.
      ones_per_row: Number of 1s in each row.

    Returns:
      A TensorFlow tensor of shape (rows, cols) with the specified number of 1s per row.
      Returns None if ones_per_row exceeds cols.
    """
    if ones_per_row > cols:
        return None

    tensor = tf.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=tf.int32)
    for i in range(rows):
        indices = tf.random.shuffle(tf.range(cols))[:ones_per_row]
        updates = tf.ones(ones_per_row, dtype=tf.int32)
        row_indices = tf.stack([tf.repeat(i, ones_per_row), indices], axis=1)
        tensor = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(tensor, row_indices, updates)
    return tensor

# Example usage:
tensor = create_binary_tensor(rows=5, cols=10, ones_per_row=3)
print(tensor)
```

This example directly implements the steps outlined in the explanation. The iterative approach, while clear, might not be the most efficient for extremely large tensors.


**Example 2:  Vectorized approach leveraging `tf.argsort`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_binary_tensor_vectorized(rows, cols, ones_per_row):
    """Creates a TensorFlow tensor with a fixed number of 1s per row using vectorized operations."""
    if ones_per_row > cols:
        return None

    random_numbers = tf.random.uniform((rows, cols))
    sorted_indices = tf.argsort(random_numbers, axis=1)
    mask = tf.one_hot(sorted_indices[:, :ones_per_row], depth=cols, dtype=tf.int32)
    return tf.reduce_sum(mask, axis=1)

# Example usage:
tensor_vectorized = create_binary_tensor_vectorized(rows=5, cols=10, ones_per_row=3)
print(tensor_vectorized)
```

This example showcases a vectorized approach utilizing `tf.argsort` and `tf.one_hot` for increased efficiency. It avoids explicit looping, leading to better performance with larger datasets.  However, it introduces a slightly less intuitive method of generating the indices.


**Example 3: Handling edge cases and error checks**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_binary_tensor_robust(rows, cols, ones_per_row):
    """Creates a TensorFlow tensor with error handling and input validation."""
    if not isinstance(rows, int) or rows <= 0 or not isinstance(cols, int) or cols <= 0 or not isinstance(ones_per_row, int) or ones_per_row <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Rows, cols, and ones_per_row must be positive integers.")
    if ones_per_row > cols:
        raise ValueError("ones_per_row cannot exceed cols.")

    # ... (Implementation from Example 1 or 2 can be placed here) ...


# Example Usage (demonstrates error handling):
try:
    tensor = create_binary_tensor_robust(rows=5, cols=10, ones_per_row=11)  # This will raise a ValueError
    print(tensor)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

```

This example demonstrates the importance of input validation and error handling, a critical aspect of robust code.  It adds checks to ensure that the input parameters are valid, preventing unexpected behavior or crashes.  It can incorporate either Example 1 or 2's core logic.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   **TensorFlow documentation:**  Thoroughly review the official documentation for functions like `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`, `tf.random.shuffle`, `tf.argsort`, and `tf.one_hot` to understand their nuances and potential optimizations.
*   **Numerical Linear Algebra texts:**  A solid understanding of linear algebra, particularly matrix operations and vectorization, is beneficial for optimizing tensor manipulations.
*   **Performance profiling tools:**  Utilize TensorFlow's profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in your code and guide optimization efforts.  This is crucial when working with large tensors.


Through careful consideration of algorithmic efficiency and leveraging TensorFlow's optimized operations, we can efficiently generate tensors with the specified constraints.  The choice between the provided examples depends on the specific performance requirements and preferred coding style, with the vectorized approach generally offering superior performance for large datasets.  Remember that robust error handling is paramount for production-ready code.
