`torch.nn.functional.grid_sample`, while exceptionally powerful for image warping, texture mapping, and spatial transformations, doesn't inherently operate on 'subtensors' in the way one might typically expect using Pythonic indexing. It works directly with the entire input tensor based on a grid that dictates the sampling locations. Therefore, the challenge when dealing with what we can loosely call subtensors is less about direct compatibility and more about manipulating the input tensor and the sampling grid to achieve the desired behavior. Having spent considerable time optimizing medical image processing pipelines, I’ve encountered this scenario frequently.

To clarify, when someone asks about using `grid_sample` with subtensors, they usually mean operating on a specific region of an input image or feature map, applying a transform within that region, and leaving the rest of the tensor untouched. `grid_sample` itself doesn’t support this notion of an active "ROI." We must therefore construct a sampling grid that effectively acts as an identity transform in the unaffected areas and performs the transformation only within the intended subregion. This can be achieved by carefully crafting the `grid` tensor, a crucial parameter for `grid_sample`.

The `grid` tensor specifies the input pixel locations, and it has a shape of `(N, H_out, W_out, 2)` for 2D images or `(N, D_out, H_out, W_out, 3)` for 3D volumes, where N is the batch size, and H, W and D refer to height, width, and depth respectively for the output tensor. Each value in the last dimension represents normalized coordinates between [-1,1]. These coordinates are used to sample from the input tensor. This normalized coordinate system ranges from (-1, -1) at the top left corner to (1, 1) at the bottom right for a single channel in 2D. By generating the appropriate normalized coordinate values in the `grid` tensor, we can control how the input tensor is sampled to generate the output. Therefore, to use grid_sample on regions of the input tensor, we must first create the coordinate grid, make adjustments only within the region of interest, and then feed this adjusted grid into grid_sample.

Here are three examples illustrating how this might be achieved:

**Example 1: Shifting a Region**

Suppose we have a 2D image, and we want to shift a specific region 10 pixels to the right.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def shift_subtensor(input_tensor, shift_x, start_x, end_x):
  """Shifts a rectangular region of an image horizontally.

  Args:
    input_tensor: A 4D tensor (N, C, H, W).
    shift_x: The number of pixels to shift (positive shifts to right).
    start_x: Starting column index of the region.
    end_x: Ending column index of the region.

  Returns:
      A 4D tensor with the region shifted.
  """

  N, C, H, W = input_tensor.shape

  # Create base grid (identity transformation)
  x_coords = torch.linspace(-1, 1, W).to(input_tensor.device)
  y_coords = torch.linspace(-1, 1, H).to(input_tensor.device)
  grid_x, grid_y = torch.meshgrid(x_coords, y_coords, indexing='xy')
  grid = torch.stack((grid_x, grid_y), dim=-1).unsqueeze(0)  # (1, H, W, 2)
  grid = grid.repeat(N, 1, 1, 1) # (N, H, W, 2)

  # Calculate shift in normalized coordinates
  normalized_shift = shift_x / (W / 2)
  
  # Create a mask for the region of interest
  x_mask = (grid[:,:,:,0] >= (start_x/(W/2) -1)) & (grid[:,:,:,0] <= (end_x/(W/2) - 1))
  # Apply the horizontal shift only to the specific region
  grid[x_mask, 0] =  grid[x_mask, 0] + normalized_shift

  # Perform grid sampling
  output_tensor = F.grid_sample(input_tensor, grid, align_corners=True)
  return output_tensor

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_img = torch.rand(1, 3, 64, 128)  # Example input: batch=1, channels=3, H=64, W=128
    shifted_img = shift_subtensor(input_img, 20, 20, 80)
    print(f"Output tensor shape: {shifted_img.shape}")
```

In this example, the base coordinate grid represents no transformation, but the code shifts the grid in a specific x-range. Note that we are not accessing a slice of the input tensor directly. Instead, we are changing the coordinates in a specific region. The `align_corners=True` argument is crucial for accurate sampling, especially when dealing with transforms near the image boundaries.

**Example 2: Rotating a Square Region**

Here, we will rotate a square region of the image around its center. This is a more complex manipulation of the grid coordinates.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
import math

def rotate_subtensor(input_tensor, angle_deg, center_x, center_y, region_size):
  """Rotates a square region of an image.

    Args:
        input_tensor: A 4D tensor (N, C, H, W).
        angle_deg: The rotation angle in degrees (positive is counterclockwise).
        center_x: The x-coordinate of the center of the region.
        center_y: The y-coordinate of the center of the region.
        region_size: The size (both H and W) of the square region.

    Returns:
        A 4D tensor with the region rotated.
  """
  N, C, H, W = input_tensor.shape

  # Create base grid
  x_coords = torch.linspace(-1, 1, W).to(input_tensor.device)
  y_coords = torch.linspace(-1, 1, H).to(input_tensor.device)
  grid_x, grid_y = torch.meshgrid(x_coords, y_coords, indexing='xy')
  grid = torch.stack((grid_x, grid_y), dim=-1).unsqueeze(0)  # (1, H, W, 2)
  grid = grid.repeat(N, 1, 1, 1) # (N, H, W, 2)


  # Normalize center and region size
  norm_center_x = (center_x / (W / 2) ) -1
  norm_center_y = (center_y / (H / 2) ) -1
  norm_half_size = region_size / (W/2)

  # Create the region mask
  mask_x = (grid[:,:,:,0] >= (norm_center_x-norm_half_size)) & (grid[:,:,:,0] <= (norm_center_x+norm_half_size))
  mask_y = (grid[:,:,:,1] >= (norm_center_y-norm_half_size)) & (grid[:,:,:,1] <= (norm_center_y+norm_half_size))
  region_mask = mask_x & mask_y


  # Translate grid so center of rotation is at (0,0)
  grid_x_centered = grid[...,0] - norm_center_x
  grid_y_centered = grid[...,1] - norm_center_y

  # Calculate rotation angle in radians
  angle_rad = math.radians(angle_deg)

  # Perform rotation calculation
  rotated_x = (grid_x_centered * torch.cos(angle_rad) - grid_y_centered * torch.sin(angle_rad))
  rotated_y = (grid_x_centered * torch.sin(angle_rad) + grid_y_centered * torch.cos(angle_rad))
  
  # Translate back
  rotated_x = rotated_x + norm_center_x
  rotated_y = rotated_y + norm_center_y

  # Update grid coordinates only within region
  grid[region_mask, 0] = rotated_x[region_mask]
  grid[region_mask, 1] = rotated_y[region_mask]
  
  # Perform grid sampling
  output_tensor = F.grid_sample(input_tensor, grid, align_corners=True)

  return output_tensor


# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_img = torch.rand(1, 3, 128, 128)  # Example input: batch=1, channels=3, H=128, W=128
    rotated_img = rotate_subtensor(input_img, 45, 64, 64, 60)
    print(f"Output tensor shape: {rotated_img.shape}")
```

This is more involved because it involves creating a mask and then modifying both grid coordinates inside of it with rotation math. The center of the rotation is also explicitly defined. This is a very typical setup when one needs more than just simple transformations of local regions of an image.

**Example 3: Scaling a Rectangular Region**

This final example will scale a rectangular region of an input tensor.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def scale_subtensor(input_tensor, scale_x, scale_y, start_x, end_x, start_y, end_y):
  """Scales a rectangular region of an image.

    Args:
        input_tensor: A 4D tensor (N, C, H, W).
        scale_x: Scaling factor in the x direction.
        scale_y: Scaling factor in the y direction.
        start_x: Starting x-coordinate of the region.
        end_x: Ending x-coordinate of the region.
        start_y: Starting y-coordinate of the region.
        end_y: Ending y-coordinate of the region.

    Returns:
        A 4D tensor with the region scaled.
    """
  N, C, H, W = input_tensor.shape

  # Create base grid
  x_coords = torch.linspace(-1, 1, W).to(input_tensor.device)
  y_coords = torch.linspace(-1, 1, H).to(input_tensor.device)
  grid_x, grid_y = torch.meshgrid(x_coords, y_coords, indexing='xy')
  grid = torch.stack((grid_x, grid_y), dim=-1).unsqueeze(0)
  grid = grid.repeat(N, 1, 1, 1) # (N, H, W, 2)

  # Normalize region bounds
  norm_start_x = (start_x / (W/2)) -1
  norm_end_x = (end_x / (W/2)) - 1
  norm_start_y = (start_y / (H/2)) -1
  norm_end_y = (end_y / (H/2)) - 1

  # Create mask for the region
  mask_x = (grid[...,0] >= norm_start_x) & (grid[...,0] <= norm_end_x)
  mask_y = (grid[...,1] >= norm_start_y) & (grid[...,1] <= norm_end_y)
  region_mask = mask_x & mask_y

  # Calculate scaled coordinates (assuming scaling is around the center of the region)
  center_x = (norm_start_x + norm_end_x) / 2
  center_y = (norm_start_y + norm_end_y) / 2
  
  # Translate to origin for scaling
  scaled_x = (grid[...,0] - center_x) * scale_x + center_x
  scaled_y = (grid[...,1] - center_y) * scale_y + center_y

  # Update the grid only inside the mask
  grid[region_mask, 0] = scaled_x[region_mask]
  grid[region_mask, 1] = scaled_y[region_mask]

  # Perform grid sampling
  output_tensor = F.grid_sample(input_tensor, grid, align_corners=True)

  return output_tensor

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_img = torch.rand(1, 3, 128, 128)  # Example input: batch=1, channels=3, H=128, W=128
    scaled_img = scale_subtensor(input_img, 1.5, 0.75, 20, 100, 30, 90)
    print(f"Output tensor shape: {scaled_img.shape}")
```
This final example scales a region differently in the x and y directions, again requiring translations to perform the correct mathematical operation. The key in all examples is to keep in mind that we are not modifying the input, but the coordinates we use to sample from it.

**Resource Recommendations**

To deepen your understanding of `grid_sample` and spatial transformations, I recommend exploring resources that focus on image processing and computer vision. Specifically, materials that cover topics such as affine transformations, homographies, and coordinate systems in images would be beneficial. I have found it helpful to review the mathematical principles behind these transformations alongside the PyTorch implementation. Furthermore, looking at implementations of image warping using libraries like OpenCV can provide a useful conceptual framework. Finally, working through interactive examples, if you can find them, is incredibly helpful as it provides immediate visual feedback.
