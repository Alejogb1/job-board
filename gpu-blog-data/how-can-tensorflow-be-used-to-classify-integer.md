TensorFlow's strength lies in its ability to handle high-dimensional numerical data, making it suitable for integer classification even though it's not its most immediately intuitive application.  My experience working on fraud detection systems heavily involved classifying transactional data, much of which was represented as integers (transaction amounts, timestamps represented as Unix epochs, product IDs).  Directly applying TensorFlow to integer data necessitates careful preprocessing and model selection.  The key insight is that, while TensorFlow can't intrinsically understand the *semantic* meaning of integers (e.g., product ID 1234 isn't inherently "better" than 5678), it can learn correlations and patterns within these integer representations.

**1. Data Preprocessing: The Foundation of Effective Integer Classification**

Raw integer data rarely presents itself in a form suitable for direct input to a TensorFlow model.  Consider a scenario where we're classifying different types of financial transactions (e.g., 0: legitimate, 1: fraudulent) based on several integer features.  Simply feeding these integers into a model without preprocessing is inefficient and likely to yield poor results.  The most crucial preprocessing steps include:

* **Normalization or Standardization:**  Integers representing disparate quantities (e.g., transaction amounts ranging from 1 to 10,000 and product IDs from 1 to 100) can negatively impact model training.  Normalization scales values to a range between 0 and 1, while standardization centers the data around a mean of 0 with a standard deviation of 1.  This prevents features with larger values from dominating the learning process.

* **One-Hot Encoding (for categorical integers):** If an integer represents a categorical variable (like product ID or transaction type), direct numerical interpretation is misleading. One-hot encoding transforms each unique integer into a binary vector, where only one element is 1, and others are 0, thus representing the category explicitly.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Derived features can greatly improve model performance. For example, instead of only using the transaction amount, we can engineer features such as "transaction amount squared" or "logarithm of transaction amount" to capture non-linear relationships. Similarly, temporal features like "day of week" or "hour of day" can be derived from the Unix epoch timestamp.


**2. Model Selection: Choosing the Right Architecture**

TensorFlow offers a variety of model architectures suitable for classification. The choice depends on the complexity of the data and the desired level of performance. Here are three commonly used approaches:

* **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP):** A simple and effective approach, particularly suitable for relatively low-dimensional datasets.  MLP's ability to learn complex non-linear relationships through multiple layers makes it a good starting point.

* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** While CNNs are typically associated with image data, they can be applied to sequential integer data if a temporal structure is present. This could be useful if transaction order matters.  In such a scenario, the integer sequences could be represented as 1D tensors.

* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTMs:** RNNs are ideal when the sequence of integers carries significant information, and order within the sequence is critical. This could be applicable if classifying sequences of transactions over time.


**3. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: MLP for basic integer classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Sample data:  Transaction amount and product ID predicting fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0) transactions.
X = np.array([[100, 12], [5000, 3], [20, 12], [150, 7], [8000, 1]])
y = np.array([0, 1, 0, 0, 1])

# Normalize features
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X, y, verbose=0)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This example uses a simple MLP with two dense layers and a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.  MinMaxScaler normalizes the input data.


**Example 2: One-Hot Encoding with an MLP**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

#Sample data with categorical integer features
X = np.array([[1,2],[3,1],[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]])
y = np.array([0,1,0,1,0])

#One-hot encode the categorical features
enc = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')
X = enc.fit_transform(X).toarray()

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Define, compile and fit the model - similar to Example 1 but with appropriate input shape
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)
model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
```

Here, OneHotEncoder handles categorical integer features before feeding them to the MLP.  Data splitting demonstrates best practice.

**Example 3:  LSTM for sequential integer data**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample sequential data:  Sequences of transaction amounts
X = np.array([[[10], [20], [30]], [[50], [60], [70]], [[100], [110], [120]]])
y = np.array([0, 1, 0])  # Class labels

# Reshape data for LSTM input (samples, timesteps, features)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.LSTM(32, input_shape=(X.shape[1], X.shape[2])),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)
model.evaluate(X,y,verbose=0)

```

This example demonstrates using an LSTM to classify sequences of integer data. The input data is reshaped to be suitable for an LSTM layer, explicitly defining the number of timesteps and features.

**4. Resource Recommendations**

The TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on Keras and model building, are invaluable.  Books on deep learning fundamentals, specifically those covering neural network architectures and training techniques, provide a strong theoretical basis.  Furthermore, exploring advanced preprocessing techniques and feature engineering methods will further enhance performance.  Practical experience through working on projects involving similar datasets significantly accelerates learning.
