Determining the number of active GPU cores and their identification requires a nuanced approach, varying significantly based on the operating system, GPU architecture, and the specific application's access methods.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects, particularly those involving heterogeneous systems, has highlighted the complexities involved. Simply querying the total number of cores reported by the driver often misrepresents the reality of concurrent execution.  The operational count depends on factors like power limits, thermal throttling, and the specific workload distribution across the GPU's Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs).

The core challenge lies in distinguishing between *physical* cores (processing units within the GPU) and *active* cores (processing units currently engaged in computation).  The total core count is a static hardware specification, readily accessible through driver APIs. However, the number of *currently active* cores is dynamic and depends on the application and the system's state.  A GPU scheduler actively manages core allocation, potentially leaving some cores idle even when the GPU is under heavy load, optimizing for power efficiency or preventing overheating.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Effective detection necessitates a multi-pronged strategy. Firstly, we ascertain the total number of cores using vendor-specific libraries. These libraries provide access to detailed hardware information, including core counts, clock speeds, and memory configurations. Secondly, we need to monitor the GPU's utilization metrics during program execution. These metrics, typically accessible through operating system performance counters or driver-level APIs, reveal the percentage of cores actively involved in computation at any given time.  Directly counting active cores is generally not possible; inferring their number from utilization data provides a reasonable approximation.  Finally, the programming model used (e.g., CUDA, OpenCL, Vulkan) significantly impacts how the application interacts with the GPU's resources.  CUDA, for instance, offers mechanisms for managing thread blocks and warps, allowing for granular control but requiring a deeper understanding of the underlying hardware.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate how to retrieve GPU information using different approaches, assuming a CUDA environment for illustration.  Adapting these examples to OpenCL or Vulkan would require using their respective APIs.

**Example 1:  CUDA - Retrieving Total Core Count (Approximation)**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

    for (int i = 0; i < deviceCount; i++) {
        cudaDeviceProp prop;
        cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, i);

        printf("Device %d:\n", i);
        printf("  Name: %s\n", prop.name);
        printf("  Total cores (approximate): %d (Multiprocessors * Cores/MP)\n", prop.multiProcessorCount * prop.maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor); //Approximation, actual active cores vary
        printf("  SM count: %d\n", prop.multiProcessorCount);
        //Further properties available, like clock speeds and memory information.
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This example utilizes the CUDA runtime API to access device properties. The core count is *approximated* by multiplying the number of multiprocessors (`prop.multiProcessorCount`) by the maximum threads per multiprocessor (`prop.maxThreadsPerMultiProcessor`). This provides an upper bound, as not all threads within a multiprocessor might be active concurrently.  The actual number of active cores at any given time is dynamic and cannot be directly obtained via this method.

**Example 2:  Monitoring GPU Utilization (Linux - Using NVML)**

```c++
#include <nvidia-ml.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  unsigned int deviceCount;
  nvidia_ml_get_device_count(&deviceCount);

  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < deviceCount; i++) {
    nvidia_ml_device_handle_t handle;
    nvidia_ml_get_device_handle_by_index(i, &handle);

    float utilization;
    nvidia_ml_device_get_utilization_rate(handle, NVML_UTILIZATION_GPU, &utilization);

    printf("Device %d GPU Utilization: %.1f%%\n", i, utilization);
    nvidia_ml_device_handle_destroy(handle);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This code snippet uses the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML), a Linux-specific tool, to obtain GPU utilization. This percentage reflects the proportion of active cores at the time of the query.  It provides an indirect measure of active core count.  Higher utilization implies a greater number of active cores, but a precise count remains elusive.  Remember to install the NVML library before compiling and running this code.

**Example 3:  CUDA - Profiling with nvprof (Indirect Measurement)**

```bash
nvprof ./myCUDAprogram
```

**Commentary:**  Instead of direct coding, using the `nvprof` profiler offers a more comprehensive view of GPU activity. `nvprof` provides detailed performance metrics, including kernel execution times, memory access patterns, and occupancy, which can be used to infer active core usage.  Analyzing the profiler output reveals bottlenecks and allows for optimization, leading to a better understanding of the resource utilization and implicitly, the number of active cores during various phases of the application's execution.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend exploring the official documentation for CUDA, OpenCL, and Vulkan.  Consult materials on GPU architecture, specifically focusing on the organization of Streaming Multiprocessors and their thread scheduling mechanisms.  Furthermore, studying performance analysis tools like NVIDIA Nsight and AMD ROCm profiler is highly beneficial for advanced GPU programming and utilization monitoring.  Finally, textbooks on parallel computing and high-performance computing would provide the necessary theoretical background to understand the complexities involved in managing and utilizing GPU resources effectively.
