The issue of pre-trained PyTorch Lightning model weights remaining unchanged after loading often stems from a mismatch between the model's state dictionary and the loaded weights, not necessarily a problem with the loading mechanism itself.  In my experience debugging similar scenarios across numerous projects, including a large-scale NLP application and several image classification tasks, the root cause frequently lies in inconsistencies between the model architecture definition at load time and the architecture used during the initial training and weight saving.

**1. Clear Explanation**

PyTorch Lightning's `load_state_dict()` method, commonly used for loading pre-trained weights, expects a precise correspondence between the keys in the state dictionary (containing the weights) and the parameters in the model's architecture.  A discrepancy can arise in several ways.  First, consider architectural modifications.  If the model's architecture, defined in the `__init__` method of your LightningModule, is altered after the weights were saved, the keys in the state dictionary will no longer align with the parameters in the updated model.  This leads to the weights not being correctly assigned, leaving the model's parameters at their initialized values.

Second, subtle differences in naming conventions can also lead to this problem. A slight change in a layer name, such as adding a suffix, or inconsistent use of naming conventions (e.g., mixing `layer1` and `layer_1`) will prevent the loading process from finding a match between the loaded weights and the current model's parameters.

Third, the use of different random seeds or different hardware (CPU vs. GPU) during training and loading can impact the initialization process slightly, potentially leading to an apparent mismatch despite the architecture being identical. Though this is less common, it's crucial to ensure consistent environments whenever possible.  Finally, a simple oversight, such as forgetting to actually call `load_state_dict()` or providing an incorrect path to the weight file, can also result in the issue.

Debugging this requires careful inspection of the model's architecture, the content of the state dictionary, and the loading process itself.  Printing the keys of both the loaded state dictionary and the model's state dictionary (`model.state_dict().keys()`) helps identify mismatches.  Using a debugger to step through the `load_state_dict()` function can pinpoint the exact location where the problem occurs.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Architectural Mismatch**

```python
import torch
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from torch import nn

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.layer2(self.layer1(x))

# Training and saving weights (omitted for brevity)

# Loading with an altered architecture
model_loaded = MyModel() # Layer3 added
model_loaded.layer3 = nn.Linear(2,1)  #This line causes the mismatch.
checkpoint = torch.load("model.ckpt")
model_loaded.load_state_dict(checkpoint["state_dict"])

#Print keys to check for mismatches
print(model_loaded.state_dict().keys())
print(checkpoint["state_dict"].keys())
```

In this example, adding `layer3` after the weights were saved creates a key mismatch. The loaded weights for `layer1` and `layer2` will be available in `checkpoint["state_dict"]`, but `layer3` is missing from the saved weights and the loading will proceed silently, potentially leaving `layer3` uninitialized correctly.


**Example 2: Naming Inconsistency**

```python
import torch
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from torch import nn

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer_1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)  #Note the underscore
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.layer2(self.layer_1(x))

# Training and saving weights (omitted for brevity)


#Loading with inconsistent naming
model_loaded = MyModel()
model_loaded.layer1 = nn.Linear(10,5) #Inconsistent naming - causes mismatch
checkpoint = torch.load("model.ckpt")
model_loaded.load_state_dict(checkpoint["state_dict"])

print(model_loaded.state_dict().keys())
print(checkpoint["state_dict"].keys())
```

Here, the inconsistency between `layer_1` during training and `layer1` during loading prevents the weights from being assigned correctly to `layer_1`.  Again, a careful comparison of the keys reveals the problem.


**Example 3:  Incorrect Path or Missing `load_state_dict()` call**

```python
import torch
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from torch import nn

class MyModel(pl.LightningModule):
    # ... (Model definition as before) ...
    pass

# Training and saving weights (omitted for brevity)

model_loaded = MyModel()
#Incorrect path or missing call:
#model_loaded.load_state_dict(torch.load("incorrect_path.ckpt")["state_dict"]) #Incorrect path
#or just missing the call entirely!

#Observe that weights haven't changed:
print(model_loaded.state_dict())
```

This illustrates the simplest mistakes.  Using an incorrect file path or simply omitting the `load_state_dict()` call will obviously result in unchanged weights.  The printed state dictionary will show the model's weights initialized to their default values.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For in-depth understanding of PyTorch Lightning, consult the official PyTorch Lightning documentation.  A thorough understanding of PyTorch's state dictionaries and model serialization is crucial.  Familiarize yourself with PyTorch's debugging tools, especially when working with complex models.  Finally, effective use of version control and careful logging practices can significantly reduce the occurrence of these types of issues.  Consider using a dedicated debugger such as pdb or the IDE's debugging tools for more comprehensive analysis.  Practicing meticulous attention to naming conventions and consistency in your code is paramount.
