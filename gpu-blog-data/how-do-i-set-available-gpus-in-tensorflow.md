TensorFlow 2.0's GPU management hinges on leveraging CUDA and, critically, understanding the underlying interaction between TensorFlow, CUDA, and the operating system's resource allocation mechanisms.  My experience troubleshooting GPU allocation issues across diverse hardware configurations – from single-GPU workstations to multi-node clusters – highlights the need for precise control at multiple levels.  Simply specifying the number of GPUs is often insufficient;  prioritizing visibility into CUDA contexts and memory allocation is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's GPU utilization is not automatically determined by simply having GPUs installed.  The process involves several steps:  first, ensuring CUDA and cuDNN are correctly installed and compatible with your TensorFlow version.  Next, configuring TensorFlow to recognize and utilize the available GPUs. Finally, and this is often overlooked, managing GPU memory allocation effectively to prevent resource contention and improve performance.

The primary mechanism for specifying GPU usage in TensorFlow is through the `tf.config.set_visible_devices` function.  This function allows you to explicitly list the GPUs that TensorFlow should consider.  However, this only controls *which* GPUs are visible; effective memory management still requires attention.  Ignoring memory allocation can lead to out-of-memory errors even if you have ample GPU resources available.

Furthermore,  `tf.distribute.Strategy` provides mechanisms for distributing training across multiple GPUs, but understanding the nuances of its different implementations—`MirroredStrategy`, `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`—is essential for optimal performance and scalability.  Selecting the right strategy depends significantly on your hardware and training setup.

Understanding CUDA contexts is also crucial. Each GPU has its own CUDA context, which manages its resources. Incorrectly managing these contexts can lead to unpredictable behavior and errors.  It's common, especially in debugging, to unintentionally create multiple contexts, leading to resource fragmentation and performance degradation.  Explicitly managing these contexts, often through careful code structuring and resource cleanup, is a critical aspect that is seldom explicitly documented.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Selecting Specific GPUs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# List GPUs available to the system.  This should be performed
# prior to setting visible devices to confirm availability
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# This will only make GPU 0 and GPU 2 visible to TensorFlow
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
try:
    tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU') #GPU 0
    tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[2], 'GPU') #GPU 2

    # Verify which GPUs are now visible
    print("Visible GPUs: ", tf.config.get_visible_devices('GPU'))

except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e)

# Proceed with your TensorFlow model construction and training.
# The model will only utilize GPU 0 and GPU 2
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates the use of `tf.config.set_visible_devices` to selectively enable specific GPUs.  The crucial step is listing available GPUs before attempting to set visible devices to avoid runtime errors.  The `try-except` block handles potential `RuntimeError` exceptions that arise when attempting to modify device visibility after operations have begun.


**Example 2:  Using MirroredStrategy for Multi-GPU Training**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        # Define your model layers here
    ])
    model.compile(...) # Compile your model
    model.fit(...) # Train your model
```

**Commentary:** This example employs `MirroredStrategy`, a strategy that replicates the model across multiple available GPUs.  The `with strategy.scope():` block ensures that all model variables are mirrored across the available GPUs.  This approach is suitable for data parallelism, where the training data is split and processed in parallel.  The system implicitly handles assigning different parts of the model to the appropriate GPU and manages communication between them.  This simplifies development but lacks the fine-grained control offered by manual device placement.

**Example 3:  Addressing GPU Memory Allocation Issues**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
for gpu in gpus:
    tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)


#...Rest of your code
```

**Commentary:** This example addresses potential memory issues by enabling memory growth.  This allows TensorFlow to dynamically allocate GPU memory as needed, preventing out-of-memory errors.  This approach requires careful monitoring of GPU memory usage to avoid exceeding total available memory.  Without memory growth, a fixed amount of memory is allocated upfront, which can be wasteful or insufficient depending on the model's size and data.  This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or complex models where memory requirements are dynamic.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation.  Understanding the specifics of different `tf.distribute.Strategy` implementations is highly recommended for advanced GPU usage.  Familiarizing yourself with CUDA programming concepts will prove invaluable for troubleshooting low-level GPU resource issues.  Deep dive into the CUDA programming guide.  Consult relevant publications and research papers on distributed deep learning frameworks for advanced techniques.


In conclusion, efficiently utilizing GPUs in TensorFlow 2.0 requires a layered approach.  Begin with confirming the correct installation and compatibility of CUDA and cuDNN. Then, utilize `tf.config.set_visible_devices` for precise GPU selection.  Leverage `tf.distribute.Strategy` for distributed training.  Finally, and critically, effectively manage GPU memory allocation via techniques like `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth`, consistently monitoring your resource utilization.  Remember, addressing GPU utilization is not a one-size-fits-all solution; it demands a deep understanding of both the TensorFlow framework and the underlying hardware architecture.
