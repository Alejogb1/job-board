The phenomenon of fluctuating losses, despite achieving relatively stable accuracy during Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training, is not uncommon and warrants a detailed explanation beyond simply labeling it a training 'anomaly.' This situation, frequently encountered in my work developing image recognition models, primarily stems from the nature of loss functions and how they interact with the classification task itself. Accuracy, which typically measures the proportion of correctly classified samples, is a rather coarse metric, especially when dealing with complex datasets and non-uniform class distributions. The loss, however, represents the aggregate penalty imposed upon the network for its classification errors.

A key factor here is that the loss function, such as cross-entropy, evaluates the confidence and correctness of each prediction, assigning greater penalties to severely incorrect predictions. Conversely, accuracy is a binary measure—a prediction is either right or wrong, irrespective of its confidence score. Thus, a model might make slightly less confident, but overall equally correct, predictions during some iterations, resulting in higher loss values but similar accuracy. Think of it like an archer hitting the target consistently, but sometimes the arrows land closer to the bullseye than others. Accuracy reflects whether the arrow hit the target at all, while the loss reflects how close it was to the center.

Furthermore, the training process, especially with stochastic gradient descent and its variants, doesn’t guarantee monotonic loss reduction. Mini-batches introduce noise into the loss estimation. Different mini-batches can have inherently different levels of difficulty, leading to fluctuations in the loss even if the overall trend is downward. A batch with many borderline examples, where the model’s probability scores might be close to 0.5, could create higher loss even with relatively correct classifications. It’s akin to a student occasionally performing slightly worse on a mock exam because the specific questions selected were more challenging, despite a similar level of knowledge. The model isn't suddenly less capable, just faced with a different kind of input.

Regularization techniques, like dropout, add another layer of complexity. Dropout randomly deactivates neurons during training. While it promotes robustness, it can also contribute to loss fluctuation. The network’s error calculation will be different each time, as a different “subset” of the network is being evaluated. In the context of our archer analogy, each training iteration is performed with a slight tremor in their hand that comes and goes, causing a slight deviation in the arrow's path. Ultimately it contributes to a better long-term outcome but doesn’t result in every shot being perfectly better than the last.

Finally, we must also consider that the network may have found a good local minimum during training. This means the weights of the network are optimized to a point where the loss is reasonably small but is not going to get any lower through normal gradient descent. However, the accuracy of these optimized weights can still be perfectly acceptable for the classification task at hand and will remain relatively steady, even if the loss jumps around a little.

Below are three specific code examples that illustrate this behavior.

**Example 1: Simple Cross-Entropy Loss and Accuracy Calculation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Dummy data and labels
X_train = torch.randn(100, 10)
y_train = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))  # Binary classification

# Model
class SimpleClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model = SimpleClassifier()

# Loss and Optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# DataLoader
train_dataset = TensorDataset(X_train, y_train)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=10)

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(10):
    for batch_X, batch_y in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(batch_X)
        loss = criterion(outputs, batch_y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        # Calculating Accuracy for each batch
        _, predicted = torch.max(F.softmax(outputs, dim=1), 1)
        correct = (predicted == batch_y).sum().item()
        accuracy = correct / len(batch_y)
        print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Batch Loss: {loss.item():.4f}, Batch Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}')
```

This example shows a basic training loop with a simple classifier. Note how within each epoch, the loss fluctuates between batches, but an acceptable level of accuracy is still maintained. The softmax is applied on output logits to get probabilities, and the max probability determines the predicted class.

**Example 2: Impact of Batch Size on Loss Fluctuations**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Dummy data and labels
X_train = torch.randn(1000, 10)
y_train = torch.randint(0, 2, (1000,))

# Model
class SimpleClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model_batch_size_10 = SimpleClassifier()
model_batch_size_100 = SimpleClassifier()

# Loss and Optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer_10 = optim.SGD(model_batch_size_10.parameters(), lr=0.01)
optimizer_100 = optim.SGD(model_batch_size_100.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# DataLoader with different batch sizes
train_dataset = TensorDataset(X_train, y_train)
train_loader_10 = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=10)
train_loader_100 = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=100)

# Training Loop - Batch Size 10
print("Batch Size 10 Training:")
for epoch in range(1):
    for batch_X, batch_y in train_loader_10:
        optimizer_10.zero_grad()
        outputs = model_batch_size_10(batch_X)
        loss = criterion(outputs, batch_y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer_10.step()
        print(f'Batch Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

# Training Loop - Batch Size 100
print("\nBatch Size 100 Training:")
for epoch in range(1):
    for batch_X, batch_y in train_loader_100:
        optimizer_100.zero_grad()
        outputs = model_batch_size_100(batch_X)
        loss = criterion(outputs, batch_y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer_100.step()
        print(f'Batch Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

This example demonstrates how a larger batch size will result in less fluctuating loss values. The gradient is averaged across more samples, making the change in each step more stable. The model trained with a smaller batch size has a much more volatile training loss between steps. Even with these fluctuations both models are able to converge to an acceptable level of performance.

**Example 3: Loss Fluctuations with a More Complex Network and Regularization**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Dummy data and labels
X_train = torch.randn(1000, 3, 32, 32) # Simulate RGB images
y_train = torch.randint(0, 10, (1000,))  # 10 classes

# CNN Model
class CNNClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 8 * 8, 128) # Adjusted output size for 32x32 input
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)


    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = F.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = F.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = F.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = x.view(-1, 32 * 8 * 8)
        x = self.dropout(F.relu(self.fc1(x)))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = CNNClassifier()

# Loss and Optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# DataLoader
train_dataset = TensorDataset(X_train, y_train)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32)

# Training Loop
for epoch in range(2):
    for batch_X, batch_y in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(batch_X)
        loss = criterion(outputs, batch_y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        # Calculating Accuracy for each batch
        _, predicted = torch.max(F.softmax(outputs, dim=1), 1)
        correct = (predicted == batch_y).sum().item()
        accuracy = correct / len(batch_y)
        print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Batch Loss: {loss.item():.4f}, Batch Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}')

```
This final example incorporates a more complex CNN architecture, complete with pooling layers and dropout regularization. Notice that the loss fluctuation is even more pronounced than before. Despite the variability, the accuracy can still increase through training and plateau at a given point. Dropout introduces this further stochasticity.

For further study and understanding, resources providing information on the following topics are beneficial:
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants**: Investigate algorithms such as Adam and RMSprop.
- **Loss Functions**: Detailed understanding of common loss functions like cross-entropy and their behavior is essential.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Study the effect of dropout, L1 and L2 regularization on training and loss landscape.
- **Mini-batch Training**: Examine the impact of mini-batch sizes and shuffling on training dynamics.
- **Convolutional Neural Network Architectures**: Study established patterns and design techniques, including pooling and other common layers.

These topics are all found in the literature of deep learning frameworks such as Pytorch, Tensorflow, and other popular libraries. Exploring the theory and practical implications of these principles will equip one to interpret and deal with loss fluctuations and their relationship to accuracy during training. The key takeaway is that loss is a more sensitive training signal and does not directly correlate to classification performance as measured by accuracy.
