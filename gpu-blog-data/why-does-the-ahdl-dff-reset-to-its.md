The asynchronous reset in AHDL D-type flip-flops (DFFs) behaves as designed, overriding the clocked data input when the reset signal is active.  This isn't a bug, but a fundamental characteristic of their implementation, stemming from the need for immediate, predictable behavior in critical state machine applications.  Over the years, having worked extensively with Altera's legacy AHDL and its synthesis tools, I've encountered and resolved numerous issues relating to this seemingly straightforward behavior. The key misunderstanding often lies in the subtle interplay between asynchronous reset and the clock cycle.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

An asynchronous reset, unlike a synchronous reset, operates independently of the clock signal. When the reset signal is asserted (typically high or low, depending on the specific device and design), the DFF's internal state is immediately forced to its default value, typically '0'. This action bypasses the normal clocked data-capture mechanism.  The reset signal's priority is higher.  Once the reset signal de-asserts, the DFF resumes normal operation, capturing data from the 'D' input on the rising (or falling, depending on the DFF configuration) edge of the clock.

The seeming unpredictability often arises from failing to account for the propagation delay of the reset signal.  The flip-flop doesn't instantaneously transition to the reset state. There's a small, but finite, delay between the reset assertion and the internal state changing to the default. This delay, coupled with potential clock skew or asynchronous timing issues, can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully considered in the timing analysis and design constraints.  Furthermore, the precise timing of the reset's de-assertion relative to the clock edge is also critical.  If the reset is released too close to a clock edge, metastable behavior can result, leading to unpredictable output values.

The default reset value is inherent to the design of the specific DFF cell within the target FPGA architecture.  This is dictated by the underlying hardware structure and can be found in the device's data sheet and associated documentation.  It is not something that can be arbitrarily changed in AHDL code, but it is a parameter to consider when designing the reset logic.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Asynchronous Reset**

```ahdl
-- A simple DFF with asynchronous reset
signal reset : std_logic;
signal clk : std_logic;
signal d_in : std_logic;
signal q_out : std_logic;

entity dff_async_reset is
  port (
    reset : in std_logic;
    clk : in std_logic;
    d_in : in std_logic;
    q_out : out std_logic
  );
end dff_async_reset;

architecture behavioral of dff_async_reset is
begin
  process (clk, reset)
  begin
    if reset = '1' then -- Asynchronous reset active high
      q_out <= '0';  -- Default value upon reset
    elsif rising_edge(clk) then
      q_out <= d_in;
    end if;
  end process;
end behavioral;
```

This code demonstrates a typical asynchronous reset.  Note the `if reset = '1'` condition;  this is the crucial part that directly overrides the clocked behavior.  The reset is active high, immediately forcing `q_out` to '0' regardless of the clock state.

**Example 2: Reset Handling in a State Machine**

```ahdl
-- State machine with asynchronous reset
type state_type is (idle, process1, process2);
signal current_state : state_type;
signal reset : std_logic;
signal clk : std_logic;

entity state_machine is
  port (
    reset : in std_logic;
    clk : in std_logic;
    -- other inputs and outputs
  );
end state_machine;

architecture behavioral of state_machine is
begin
  process (clk, reset)
  begin
    if reset = '1' then
      current_state <= idle; -- Reset to idle state
    elsif rising_edge(clk) then
      case current_state is
        when idle => -- ... state transitions ...
        when process1 => -- ... state transitions ...
        when process2 => -- ... state transitions ...
      end case;
    end if;
  end process;
end behavioral;
```

This shows a more complex scenario. The asynchronous reset is used to force the state machine to a known, safe state (`idle`) when the reset is asserted.  This is crucial for predictability upon power-up or system reset.

**Example 3:  Active-low Reset**

```ahdl
-- DFF with active-low asynchronous reset
signal reset : std_logic;
signal clk : std_logic;
signal d_in : std_logic;
signal q_out : std_logic;

entity dff_async_reset_low is
  port (
    reset : in std_logic;
    clk : in std_logic;
    d_in : in std_logic;
    q_out : out std_logic
  );
end dff_async_reset_low;

architecture behavioral of dff_async_reset_low is
begin
  process (clk, reset)
  begin
    if reset = '0' then -- Asynchronous reset active low
      q_out <= '0'; -- Default value upon reset
    elsif rising_edge(clk) then
      q_out <= d_in;
    end if;
  end process;
end behavioral;
```

Here, the reset is active-low.  The behavior is the same, except the condition checks for `reset = '0'`.  This highlights the importance of understanding the specific polarity of the reset signal for the given hardware.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Altera's (now Intel) AHDL documentation, specifically the sections dealing with flip-flop design and asynchronous reset implementation, are essential.  Consult the relevant data sheets for your target FPGA device to understand the specific characteristics of the DFF cells, including their reset behavior and timing parameters. A good digital design textbook covering sequential logic and state machines will provide a solid theoretical foundation.  Finally, a thorough understanding of timing analysis and constraint files (for your chosen synthesis tool) is critical for ensuring correct operation and avoiding metastable behavior.
