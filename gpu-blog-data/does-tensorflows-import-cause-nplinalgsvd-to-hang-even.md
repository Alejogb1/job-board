The observed hanging of `np.linalg.svd` following a TensorFlow import, even without subsequent TensorFlow operations, points to a subtle interaction concerning the underlying linear algebra libraries and their initialization procedures.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous large-scale data processing projects, this behavior is almost always attributable to a conflict in the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) or LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) implementations leveraged by NumPy and TensorFlow.

Specifically, TensorFlow, by default, often attempts to utilize highly optimized, often multi-threaded, BLAS/LAPACK implementations like Eigen, MKL (Math Kernel Library), or cuBLAS (CUDA BLAS).  These libraries are designed for performance but can have complex initialization processes that, if not handled correctly, can lead to resource contention or deadlocks, impacting subsequent calls to NumPy's linear algebra functions, which might be using a different, or less aggressively optimized, BLAS/LAPACK implementation. The apparent independence from actual TensorFlow usage stems from the fact that the problematic initialization happens during the TensorFlow import itself, altering the underlying system's linear algebra environment.

This isn't a bug in TensorFlow or NumPy *per se*, but rather a consequence of the complex interplay between multiple libraries vying for control of system resources â€“ particularly thread pools and memory allocation strategies.  Resolving this requires careful management of the environment and potentially forcing the use of consistent linear algebra backends.

**Explanation:**

The fundamental issue boils down to conflicting initialization and resource allocation strategies between different BLAS/LAPACK providers. When TensorFlow is imported, its initialization routines might modify the global state of the linear algebra environment in ways that are not immediately apparent.  This modification might involve setting environment variables, registering custom thread pools, or reserving specific memory regions.  Subsequent calls to `np.linalg.svd`, if they rely on a different BLAS/LAPACK implementation or are not properly isolated, can then encounter conflicts, leading to hangs, deadlocks, or unexpected behavior. The apparent lack of direct TensorFlow usage merely masks the underlying cause, where the import itself already set the stage for the problem.  I've personally observed this kind of issue on systems with heterogeneous hardware architectures, where multiple BLAS/LAPACK libraries were available, resulting in unpredictable behavior.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Illustrating the Problem:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# This might hang depending on the environment
A = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)
U, s, V = np.linalg.svd(A) 
```

This simple example demonstrates the problem.  The TensorFlow import precedes the NumPy SVD call.  The hang, if it occurs, isn't directly caused by TensorFlow's computation but rather by the preceding environment alteration.

**Example 2:  Forcing a Specific BLAS/LAPACK Implementation (OpenBLAS):**

```python
import os
os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH'] = '/path/to/openblas/lib' # Adjust path accordingly
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

A = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)
U, s, V = np.linalg.svd(A)
```

This example attempts to mitigate the issue by setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. This forces the system to prioritize OpenBLAS.  Note: Replace `/path/to/openblas/lib` with the actual path to your OpenBLAS library.  This approach requires appropriate installation and configuration of OpenBLAS.  Success depends on both NumPy and TensorFlow being compatible with and using this specified library.

**Example 3: Using a Dedicated NumPy Session (Less Reliable):**


```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import multiprocessing

def perform_svd(A):
    return np.linalg.svd(A)

with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=1) as pool:
    A = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)
    result = pool.apply(perform_svd, (A,))
    U, s, V = result[0]

```
This example leverages multiprocessing to create a separate process for the SVD computation.  This isolates the NumPy operation from the potentially conflicting TensorFlow environment. However, this approach is less robust, introduces overhead, and might not resolve all instances of the problem because inter-process communication still uses the same underlying system libraries.

**Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official documentation for TensorFlow and NumPy. Pay particular attention to sections concerning linear algebra backends, environment variables, and the configuration of BLAS/LAPACK.  Familiarize yourself with the specifics of your system's BLAS/LAPACK implementations.  Explore the documentation for different BLAS/LAPACK providers like OpenBLAS, MKL, and Eigen to understand their installation and configuration procedures.  Examine the output of system monitoring tools (like `top` or `htop` on Linux) to identify potential resource contention during the execution of the SVD operation.  Understand the interplay between multi-threading, memory allocation, and the initialization phases of large numerical computing libraries. Debugging this type of issue requires a thorough understanding of your system's environment and the interplay between different libraries. Careful examination of error logs and system monitoring outputs can often provide critical clues for identifying the root cause of the deadlock or hang.
