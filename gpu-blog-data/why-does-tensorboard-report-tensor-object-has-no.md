The error "Tensor" object has no attribute 'value' in TensorBoard stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of TensorFlow's eager execution and graph execution modes, and how they interact with TensorBoard's logging mechanisms.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous large-scale machine learning projects highlighted the crucial distinction:  TensorBoard visualizations require specific data formats, not raw TensorFlow tensors in eager execution.  Directly attempting to log a tensor using `tf.summary.scalar` or similar functions without proper conversion will consistently result in this error.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow, in its evolution, transitioned from a primarily graph-based execution model (where computations were defined as a graph before execution) to an eager execution model (where computations are performed immediately).  TensorBoard, however, is fundamentally designed to work with the graph-based execution model's structure. While it has adapted somewhat, it still expects data prepared in a specific manner for visualization.

In eager execution, a `Tensor` object represents the result of a computation, similar to a NumPy array.  Crucially, this `Tensor` object is *not* a container of a single value directly accessible via `.value`.  Instead, it holds the computed numerical data itself.  The `value` attribute was more relevant in the older graph execution mode, where tensors existed as placeholders before actual computation.  Attempting to extract a 'value' from a tensor in eager mode leads to the `AttributeError`.

To successfully log data to TensorBoard, one must explicitly extract the numerical value from the `Tensor` object using `.numpy()` method, converting it into a NumPy array, which TensorBoard can handle appropriately.  Failure to perform this conversion is the primary cause of this error.  Furthermore, the correct usage of the `tf.summary` APIs is also vital.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Logging (Eager Execution)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.enable_eager_execution() # Explicitly enable eager execution

x = tf.constant(10.0)
y = tf.constant(5.0)
z = x + y

with tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/my_log') as writer:
  with writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.scalar('z', z, step=0) # Incorrect: Logging the Tensor directly

```

This code directly attempts to log the TensorFlow `Tensor` object `z`. This will invariably lead to the "Tensor" object has no attribute 'value' error.  TensorBoard will not be able to interpret the Tensor object itself.


**Example 2: Correct Logging (Eager Execution)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.enable_eager_execution()

x = tf.constant(10.0)
y = tf.constant(5.0)
z = x + y

with tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/my_log') as writer:
  with writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.scalar('z', z.numpy(), step=0) # Correct: Logging the NumPy value

```

This corrected version utilizes the `.numpy()` method to extract the numerical value from the `Tensor` object `z`, converting it into a NumPy array before logging.  This is the key to resolving the error.  The `step` parameter is crucial for tracking the progression of training or evaluation.


**Example 3:  Logging Multiple Scalars (Eager Execution with Loop)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tf.enable_eager_execution()

with tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/multiple_scalars') as writer:
  for i in range(10):
      x = tf.constant(i * 2.0)
      y = tf.constant(i * 0.5)
      z = x + y
      with writer.as_default():
          tf.summary.scalar('z', z.numpy(), step=i) # Correct: Logging in a loop

```

This example showcases how to log multiple scalar values over iterations.  Note the explicit conversion to a NumPy array (`z.numpy()`) within each iteration of the loop.  This approach is common when tracking metrics during training. The `step` parameter, incrementing with each iteration, allows TensorBoard to properly display the scalar value over time.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guides on using TensorBoard and understanding eager execution.  Refer to the sections on data logging and visualization within the TensorFlow documentation.  Furthermore, exploring the TensorBoard API reference itself will prove valuable in understanding the available logging functionalities and their requirements.  Finally, consulting TensorFlow's tutorials on implementing common machine learning models will offer practical examples of properly integrating TensorBoard logging into your workflows.  These resources will offer detailed explanations and further examples beyond what is presented here.  Reviewing the changelog for TensorFlow versions will help clarify potential changes in the API and behavior related to eager execution and TensorBoard interaction.  Thorough understanding of the NumPy library is also crucial for efficient data manipulation within the TensorFlow ecosystem.
