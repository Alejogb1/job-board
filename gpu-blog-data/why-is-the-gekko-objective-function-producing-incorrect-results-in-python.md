The GEKKO optimization package in Python, while powerful, can yield unexpected or incorrect results from its objective function primarily due to subtleties in how the model is defined, handled internally, and the nature of the problem itself. I’ve spent significant time debugging GEKKO models, and from my experience, common issues stem from incorrect variable scaling, improper initialization, and the misapplication of constraint handling. These problems often manifest in an objective function that does not converge, converges to a local minimum rather than the global minimum, or produces physically or logically implausible results.

A primary reason for incorrect objective function results arises from improper variable scaling. GEKKO utilizes numerical optimization routines, which are sensitive to the magnitude of the variables. If your objective function involves variables that differ by several orders of magnitude (e.g., one variable near 1 and another near 1,000,000), the optimizer might struggle to converge or produce meaningful results. Internal calculations can become dominated by the larger variables, effectively ignoring or miscalculating the gradients associated with smaller variables. This issue is not unique to GEKKO but impacts many numerical solvers. When I encounter this, I examine my objective function and the variables involved. I normalize the variables to a similar scale, typically within the range of 0.1 to 10, or similar, prior to introducing them to the solver. This scaling should be done prior to constructing the GEKKO model or after retrieving results, not within the core model definition.

Another challenge originates from inaccurate or poor variable initialization. GEKKO, like other optimization solvers, benefits from good initial guesses. If you initialize variables far from the optimum, the solver might get stuck in a local minimum. This can lead to results that appear correct because the solution minimizes the objective function locally, but they do not represent the desired overall minimal solution. I often use prior knowledge or educated estimates to seed my variables. If such estimates are not available, I use an iterative approach. I start with a relatively simple problem formulation, obtain an approximate solution, and then use that as the initial guess for the actual complex model. This ensures the solver has a reasonable initial starting point. The iterative refining approach can also help isolate specific aspects of the model that may cause difficulties in the optimization process.

Furthermore, improper handling of constraints, particularly nonlinear ones, can drastically affect objective function results. GEKKO allows constraints to be introduced as equations that must hold. However, if constraints are formulated poorly – for instance, containing singularities or discontinuities within the search space – the solver may face convergence difficulties. Similarly, constraints that are logically inconsistent will produce undefined or nonsensical results. I have had to pay close attention to the manner of formulation, ensuring that no constraints contain division by variables that may approach zero. The way the constraint is formulated impacts the internal workings of the solver and should be carefully evaluated. It's not sufficient to have a valid logical expression; its mathematical suitability for numerical solution also matters greatly. In some instances, reformulating the constraints to more numerically friendly versions can lead to more accurate results.

Below are code examples that demonstrate these points with commentary:

**Code Example 1: Variable Scaling**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
import numpy as np

# Unscaled problem (prone to errors)
m = GEKKO(remote=False)
x = m.Var(value=1000)
y = m.Var(value=0.001)
z = m.Var(value=1)

m.Obj(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
m.solve(disp=False)

print("Unscaled x:", x.value[0])
print("Unscaled y:", y.value[0])
print("Unscaled z:", z.value[0])
print("Unscaled obj:", m.options.objfcnval)

# Scaled problem
m_scaled = GEKKO(remote=False)
x_scaled = m_scaled.Var(value=1) # Scale to ~1
y_scaled = m_scaled.Var(value=1)  # Scale to ~1
z_scaled = m_scaled.Var(value=1)

m_scaled.Obj(x_scaled**2 + y_scaled**2 + z_scaled**2)

m_scaled.solve(disp=False)
print("\nScaled x:", x_scaled.value[0])
print("Scaled y:", y_scaled.value[0])
print("Scaled z:", z_scaled.value[0])
print("Scaled obj:", m_scaled.options.objfcnval)
```
**Commentary:** The initial, unscaled problem has variables with vastly different magnitudes. As a result, the solution may converge slowly or not at all and not to the global minimum. The second scaled problem defines variables that are all within the same magnitude, around 1. This formulation will converge more accurately and quickly. Note that the problem here is simple and scaling is not necessary for this trivial example but serves to illustrate the point. In my experience, many real-world problems encounter these numerical issues.

**Code Example 2: Poor Initialization**

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
import numpy as np

# Problem definition
m = GEKKO(remote=False)
x = m.Var(lb=-10, ub=10, value=7)
y = m.Var(lb=-10, ub=10, value=-3)
m.Equation(x**2 + y**2 == 5) # circular constraint

# Inaccurate initialization (gets stuck in local optimum)
m.Obj(x + y)
m.solve(disp=False)
print("\nPoor init x:", x.value[0])
print("Poor init y:", y.value[0])
print("Poor init obj:", m.options.objfcnval)

# Better initialization (gets closer to global)
m2 = GEKKO(remote=False)
x2 = m2.Var(lb=-10, ub=10, value=1) # Closer to solution
y2 = m2.Var(lb=-10, ub=10, value=1) # Closer to solution
m2.Equation(x2**2 + y2**2 == 5)
m2.Obj(x2 + y2)
m2.solve(disp=False)
print("\nBetter init x:", x2.value[0])
print("Better init y:", y2.value[0])
print("Better init obj:", m2.options.objfcnval)
```
**Commentary:** This code demonstrates how poor initializations affect the result. The problem here is to minimize `x+y`, subject to `x^2 + y^2 == 5`. The initial guess for x and y in the first model is far from the optimal values. As a result, the solver converges to a local minimum. The second model demonstrates an initialization using values that are closer to the optimal solution.

**Code Example 3: Incorrect Constraint Formulation**
```python
from gekko import GEKKO

# Problem Definition
m = GEKKO(remote=False)

x = m.Var(value=1)
y = m.Var(value=1)
# Constraint with potential division by zero
m.Equation(x + y/(y - 0.5) == 1)  # problematic

m.Obj(x**2 + y**2)
try:
    m.solve(disp=False)
    print("Constraint Problem 1: ", x.value[0], y.value[0], m.options.objfcnval)
except:
    print("Convergence Failure, problem 1")


# Reformulated Constraint
m2 = GEKKO(remote=False)
x2 = m2.Var(value=1)
y2 = m2.Var(value=1)
# Reformulation to avoid division by zero
m2.Equation((x2 + y2) * (y2 - 0.5) == (y2 -0.5))


m2.Obj(x2**2 + y2**2)
m2.solve(disp=False)
print("Constraint Problem 2: ", x2.value[0], y2.value[0], m2.options.objfcnval)

```
**Commentary:** In this code, the first model's constraint includes a term where the denominator can become zero if `y` equals `0.5`. This leads to either convergence issues or undefined results. This formulation directly impacts the internal workings of the solver. The second model reformulated the constraint to avoid a division by zero, replacing `y/(y-0.5)` with `(y - 0.5)` after multiplication to avoid division altogether, resulting in a solved optimization problem.

For resources, I suggest reviewing the GEKKO documentation. In particular, the section on variable scaling and initial conditions is valuable. A deep dive into the optimization algorithms used by GEKKO, such as APOPT, and understanding the properties of these algorithms is also helpful. Texts on numerical methods and optimization are relevant for more in depth mathematical considerations of the solvers. Additionally, case studies involving similar problems can provide further insight into potential pitfalls and best practices in formulating problems for numerical solvers.

In summary, incorrect objective function results in GEKKO are often a consequence of numerical issues, related to variable scaling, the initialization of variables, and constraint formulation. Careful consideration of these aspects, accompanied by strategic adjustments, typically resolves these errors, resulting in more accurate and reliable optimization solutions. This includes understanding the core solver's mechanics, which often requires delving into more general numerical methods literature.
