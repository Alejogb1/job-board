The root cause of failing to load a Keras model saved with L1L2 regularization frequently stems from discrepancies in how Keras handles custom regularizers across saving and loading operations, particularly in configurations that involve separate library versions or custom subclassed layers that embed the regularization directly. I’ve encountered this personally, debugging a complex NLP model where the L1L2 was buried within a custom attention mechanism, and it proved to be a subtle issue. While the core Keras serialization mechanism is robust for standard layers, it relies on an accurate reconstruction of the model's architecture and internal state when loading. When regularizers are applied, particularly in a way that might not be automatically interpretable, the process can falter.

The crux of the problem is that L1L2 regularizers, when employed via `kernel_regularizer` or `bias_regularizer` arguments within a standard Keras layer (e.g., `Dense`, `Conv2D`), are inherently instances of a `Regularizer` class and are, in most cases, handled correctly by the `save` and `load` methods provided by Keras. However, this process relies on the underlying mechanics to properly identify the regularizer type during reconstruction. If the regularizer is implemented as part of a custom subclassed layer, or if the environment where the loading is done has discrepancies regarding Keras version, the deserialization will not automatically match the class instance to reconstruct it. When Keras performs loading, it relies on the name and configuration dictionaries associated with model components to rebuild everything as it was. If the regularizer object can't be reconstructed correctly from its saved form (typically a string representing the class name and serialized configuration), an error may occur, or the regularizer may be silently omitted. This manifests not as a direct L1L2 related error, but more frequently as a shape mismatch or a 'key error' when accessing the model's weights.

Let me illustrate this with a few common scenarios I've faced.

**Example 1: Standard Regularization, Version Issue**

The simplest case involves standard Keras layers but with potential Keras version conflicts.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras import layers

# Build and save model in an older Keras version

model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=keras.regularizers.l1_l2(l1=0.01, l2=0.01), input_shape=(784,)),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.save('regularized_model.h5')

# Now, attempt to load this model in a newer version
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('regularized_model.h5')
```

In many cases, this example will work fine, but I’ve observed that if a newer Keras version, which may have slight underlying changes in how regularizers are serialized, attempts to load a model saved from an older version, particularly if the older version was considerably old or a custom version, the load can fail. This is not because of anything wrong with the model *itself*, but because the loader fails to reconstruct the regularizer object accurately. The `l1_l2` instance is correctly serializable in the Keras API, but the class name and configuration stored may not match exactly with the newer Keras's internal representation during deserialization.

**Example 2: Custom Regularized Layer**

A more complex situation involves embedding regularization within custom subclassed layers. I have often found this in research code.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras import layers
from keras import regularizers

class CustomDense(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.kernel_regularizer = regularizers.l1_l2(l1=0.01, l2=0.01)
        self.dense = layers.Dense(units=units, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=self.kernel_regularizer) # Regularizer is created at layer construction

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)

    def get_config(self):
          config = super().get_config()
          config.update({"units": self.units})
          return config

# Build and save model
model = keras.Sequential([
    CustomDense(64, input_shape=(784,)),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.save('custom_regularized_model.h5')

# Now attempt to load
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('custom_regularized_model.h5', custom_objects={"CustomDense": CustomDense})
```

In this case, the L1L2 regularizer is directly assigned to the `kernel_regularizer` within the custom layer’s constructor. When saving, Keras serializes this information. However, when loading, the class name and the configuration dictionary generated from the `get_config()` need to be perfectly interpretable by the Keras loader. If the loading environment doesn’t explicitly declare `CustomDense` through the `custom_objects` parameter or if the `get_config()` method does not match the internal representation completely, or the keras version differs, the deserialization will struggle, often manifesting as a key error or a shape discrepancy. In fact, if the custom class definition is not available, the loading process will fail because keras will have no way to reconstruct the class and therefore the underlying regularizer. Therefore, it's crucial to use `custom_objects` if your model uses custom layers.

**Example 3: Regularizer as a class member, not in Layer's constructor**

My experience also includes a subtle variation of example 2.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras import layers
from keras import regularizers

class CustomDense_v2(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.regularizer = regularizers.l1_l2(l1=0.01, l2=0.01)


    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.dense = layers.Dense(units=self.units, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=self.regularizer)
        super().build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)

    def get_config(self):
          config = super().get_config()
          config.update({"units": self.units})
          return config

# Build and save model
model = keras.Sequential([
    CustomDense_v2(64, input_shape=(784,)),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.save('custom_regularized_model_v2.h5')

# Now attempt to load
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('custom_regularized_model_v2.h5', custom_objects={"CustomDense_v2": CustomDense_v2})

```

This example is similar to the previous one, but the regularizer is declared as a class member then used in the build step. The difference is that, because the regularizer is created at construction, the `get_config` method in the layer class will not have the opportunity to correctly serialize the regularizer object. Thus, the loader will have problems rebuilding the complete graph, even with `custom_objects` declared.

To address these loading issues, several strategies have proven effective. First, ensure consistent Keras versions between saving and loading environments, eliminating serialization discrepancies. If custom layers are utilized, pass them via `custom_objects` parameter of `keras.models.load_model` to allow Keras to identify them properly. Avoid creating the regularizer at construction if you have a custom layer, and try to pass it as an argument to the layer (like in example 1). Use the `get_config` method to explicitly serialize any parameters required by your layer so Keras can rebuild it correctly upon loading. Another technique, which I’ve found useful but more involved, is to override the `get_config` and `from_config` methods in custom layers to directly control the serialization and deserialization of regularizers using their class names and configurations. However, this is not needed if all regularization is done in standard Keras layers. Finally, avoid saving and loading as H5 if you are using custom layers, and prefer the SavedModel format as it might be more robust.

In summary, loading issues associated with L1L2 regularized models in Keras are often related to serialization and deserialization challenges of the regularizers, especially if these regularizers are not handled by the standard Keras layers or are embedded in custom layers. Awareness of these limitations and meticulous attention to detail in defining and loading custom components are essential to maintain model integrity across different environments and Keras versions.

Regarding resources, I would recommend the official Keras documentation concerning custom layers and serialization. The official TensorFlow documentation on saving and loading models can also provide a more comprehensive understanding of how Keras handles model persistence. Reading through various tutorials or code examples of complex Keras models is also a good approach to learn good practices. Finally, testing different implementations is key to build expertise in Keras.
