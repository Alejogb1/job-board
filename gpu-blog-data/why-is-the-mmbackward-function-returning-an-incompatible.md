MmBackward, specifically within the context of deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, frequently returns gradient tensors with shapes that do not align with the corresponding input tensors due to a confluence of factors during backpropagation, arising from the mathematical operations involved and the framework's internal workings. The core issue typically revolves around how matrix multiplications (hence the 'Mm' prefix) and associated operations, including reductions, affect gradient flow. The problem is not always an error in the user's logic; rather, it reflects how gradients are calculated and propagated through a computational graph.

Let's break this down. Consider a standard feedforward neural network. A fundamental operation within its layers is the matrix multiplication: `output = torch.mm(input, weight)`. During the forward pass, this calculates the output activations based on the input and the layer's weights. During backpropagation, gradients with respect to the `output` (let's denote them as `grad_output`) are computed. These gradients are then used to compute the gradients with respect to the `input` (`grad_input`) and the `weight` (`grad_weight`). The key point is that `grad_input` and `grad_weight` are not directly equal in shape to `input` and `weight`. Instead, their shapes are dictated by the transpose rule and the chain rule of calculus. Specifically:

*   `grad_input` has the same shape as `input`
*   `grad_weight` has the same shape as `weight`.

However, if other operations follow the `torch.mm` or its equivalent at this level or subsequent levels, those operations, particularly those that induce dimensional reduction via summation, mean, or indexing, fundamentally alter the gradient flow shape. The issue arises when we have operations like a sum reduction operation, often implicitly bundled with activation functions or loss functions. These can cause the gradient tensor dimensions to change, and the back-propagation step might not be as straightforward as you may anticipate when attempting a direct back propagation of the gradient calculated from that specific step.

For example, let’s take a look at an example where this commonly happens. We start with a fully connected layer (matrix multiplication) and follow it with reduction via a loss function.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Example 1: Mismatched Shape due to reduction via Loss Function.
input_tensor = torch.randn(10, 5, requires_grad=True) # Batch of 10 samples, each with 5 features
weight_matrix = torch.randn(5, 3, requires_grad=True) # Maps 5 input features to 3 output features.

output_tensor = torch.mm(input_tensor, weight_matrix) # (10, 3)
target_tensor = torch.randn(10, 3)  # Target matching dimensions of output

criterion = nn.MSELoss()  # Using Mean Squared Error loss - This will also reduce over the batch and output dimensions.
loss = criterion(output_tensor, target_tensor) # Scalar Loss value

loss.backward() # Compute gradients
print("Input Gradient Shape:", input_tensor.grad.shape)
print("Weight Gradient Shape:", weight_matrix.grad.shape)

```

In this instance, the `criterion = nn.MSELoss()`, while it operates on tensors of size (10,3), reduces the output to a single scalar value via summation and division, which is why we can use `.backward()` here. Critically, the call `loss.backward()` initiates the backpropagation, calculating `grad_output` (the gradient of the loss with respect to the output tensor), which will have the same shape as the `output_tensor` which was (10,3). As a result, the shapes of `input_tensor.grad` and `weight_matrix.grad` as computed by the `torch.mm` derivative rules will be (10,5) and (5,3), respectively, which is precisely what you would expect from the standard back propagation of matrix multiplication, and the shape of the input and weight respectively.

However, not all instances involve a loss function explicitly. The next case demonstrates a more subtle and complex case involving activation layers. Let’s illustrate this with a fully connected layer followed by a custom reduction via summation and division across a specified dimension:

```python
# Example 2: Mismatched Shape due to custom reduction operation
import torch
input_tensor_2 = torch.randn(10, 5, requires_grad=True) # 10 samples, 5 features
weight_matrix_2 = torch.randn(5, 3, requires_grad=True) # 5 -> 3 output features
output_tensor_2 = torch.mm(input_tensor_2, weight_matrix_2) # (10, 3)
reduced_tensor_2 = torch.sum(output_tensor_2, dim=1, keepdim = False) # Reduced to (10, ) by summing along the features dimension.

# Assume a dummy gradient is needed here. This illustrates the problem.
# Normally this would be backpropagated from the loss function output.
grad_reduced = torch.randn(10) # Shape to be (10, )
reduced_tensor_2.backward(grad_reduced) # Backprop with a custom gradient shape. This call will work.

print("Input Gradient Shape:", input_tensor_2.grad.shape) # Shape: (10, 5)
print("Weight Gradient Shape:", weight_matrix_2.grad.shape) # Shape: (5, 3)

```

Here, `torch.sum(output_tensor_2, dim=1, keepdim=False)` reduces the dimension from (10, 3) to (10,) by summing along axis 1 (the feature axis). When we backpropagate, we need to pass in a gradient that is compatible with the reduced tensor’s shape, thus a gradient with shape (10, ). The subsequent calls to `input_tensor_2.grad` and `weight_matrix_2.grad` still follow the transpose and chain rule of the underlying matrix multiplication. Hence their shapes will be (10,5) and (5,3), respectively. It might seem counter-intuitive because we have gone from a shape of (10,3) to a shape of (10, ), but in fact there’s no issue. We reduced dimensions after a matrix multiplication, but the derivative of the matrix multiplication itself respects its inputs and weights shapes.

The problem is exacerbated if, instead of passing in a gradient that aligns with the reduced tensor, we attempt to pass in a gradient that aligns with the shape before the reduction. In the following example, we are not backpropagating from the output of a loss, but rather artificially backpropagating as if `output_tensor_2` was directly followed by the loss function. Here is an example:

```python
# Example 3: Invalid gradient shape due to incompatible gradient tensor
import torch
input_tensor_3 = torch.randn(10, 5, requires_grad=True)
weight_matrix_3 = torch.randn(5, 3, requires_grad=True)
output_tensor_3 = torch.mm(input_tensor_3, weight_matrix_3)  # Shape: (10, 3)
reduced_tensor_3 = torch.sum(output_tensor_3, dim=1, keepdim = False) # Shape: (10,)

# Incorrect: Gradient not aligned with reduced_tensor_3
grad_incorrect = torch.randn(10, 3)  # Gradient shape does NOT match output shape after sum reduction
try:
  reduced_tensor_3.backward(grad_incorrect)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Runtime Error: {e}")

```

Here, an attempt to backpropagate through `reduced_tensor_3` using a gradient with shape (10, 3) will result in a runtime error. `MmBackward` doesn't directly throw the error; it’s the backpropagation mechanism associated with reduction functions like `torch.sum` that triggers the check. The underlying reason is that gradients cannot be passed between layers or operations when there is a dimensional mismatch. This becomes more complex as the neural network structure becomes more complex, because multiple non-linear operations will modify the intermediate shapes, making debugging more difficult if they are not carefully tracked.

When diagnosing shape mismatches from `MmBackward`, I recommend systematically tracing the tensor shapes throughout your computation graph. Utilize the `shape` attributes of intermediate tensors. Consider using a debugger if necessary. Specifically note where reductions are being used, either explicitly or implicitly via a loss function or activation function.

For further understanding, explore these resources. Look into the documentation that details the mechanics of backpropagation in deep learning frameworks, specifically focusing on how gradients are propagated with respect to matrix operations and dimension reduction. Seek information on chain rule, transpose rule, and automatic differentiation. Study the implementation of autograd in PyTorch or the equivalent in other frameworks. These areas will deepen your comprehension and reduce errors.
