TensorFlow's `GradientTape.gradient` returning `None` typically stems from a mismatch between the tape's recorded operations and the variables for which gradients are requested.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous large-scale machine learning projects has highlighted several common culprits, often related to variable creation, control flow, and the scope of the `GradientTape` itself.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The `tf.GradientTape` records the operations performed within its context.  When `gradient()` is called, it uses this recorded information to compute gradients with respect to specified target tensors.  A `None` return indicates it failed to establish a differentiable path between the target tensor (typically your loss) and the variables you've specified.  This often results from one of the following:

* **Variables not watched:**  The `GradientTape` only tracks variables explicitly "watched" or those created within its context. If you create a variable outside the `tape.watch()` call or the tape's context, it won't be included in the gradient computation. This commonly occurs when using custom layers or complex model architectures.

* **Control flow inconsistencies:**  Conditional statements (if/else) and loops (for, while) can disrupt the tape's ability to track gradients if the execution path isn't consistently differentiable.  If a variable's value is only modified under specific conditions, the tape might not register this dependence correctly.

* **Tensor operations outside the tape's scope:** If operations affecting the target tensor occur *outside* the `GradientTape` context, these operations won't be included in the gradient calculation, leading to an inability to trace the gradient back to the watched variables.

* **Incorrect variable types or shapes:** Using untracked tensors or tensors with incompatible shapes or data types can prevent successful gradient calculations.  For instance, using `tf.Variable` with a non-numeric dtype or attempting to compute gradients of string tensors will lead to errors.

* **Detached gradients:**  Certain operations, particularly those involving custom gradients or specific layers (e.g., some forms of dropout or batch normalization), might detach gradients explicitly, interrupting the backward pass.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Unwatched Variable**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = x * x
    z = y * 2  # z is dependent on x, but x is not watched

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x) # dz_dx will be None
print(dz_dx)  # Output: None

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    x = tf.Variable(1.0)
    tape.watch(x) #Now we explicitly watch x
    y = x * x
    z = y * 2

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(dz_dx) # Output: tf.Tensor(4.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
```

In this example, the initial attempt fails because `x` wasn't explicitly watched. The corrected version uses `tape.watch(x)`, ensuring the tape tracks `x`'s contribution to `z`.


**Example 2: Control Flow Issue**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch(x)
  if x > 0:
    y = x * x
  else:
    y = x
  z = y * 2

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(dz_dx) # Output: tf.Tensor(4.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)

x = tf.Variable(-1.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch(x)
  if x > 0:
    y = x * x
  else:
    y = x
  z = y * 2

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(dz_dx) # Output: tf.Tensor(2.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
```

Here, the gradient calculation successfully accounts for the conditional logic. The gradient correctly reflects the different paths through the conditional.


**Example 3: Operation Outside Tape Scope**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch(x)
  y = x * x

z = y * 2 #This operation is outside the gradient tape
dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(dz_dx)  #Output: None

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    x = tf.Variable(1.0)
    tape.watch(x)
    y = x * x
    z = y * 2

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(dz_dx)  #Output: tf.Tensor(4.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)

```

This illustrates that `z`'s calculation must be within the tape's context. Moving the `z = y * 2` line inside the `with` block resolves the issue.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of automatic differentiation in TensorFlow, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  Thoroughly review the sections on `tf.GradientTape`, variable management, and the intricacies of automatic differentiation in the context of control flow.  Supplement this with a well-regarded textbook on deep learning, paying close attention to chapters covering backpropagation and computational graphs.  Finally, utilize debugging tools within your IDE, leveraging breakpoints and variable inspection to monitor the flow of computation and identify any discrepancies in variable values or gradient calculations.  Careful examination of your model's architecture and the flow of data through it is paramount.  Reviewing relevant StackOverflow threads, specifically those addressing similar `None` gradient issues, provides valuable insights.
