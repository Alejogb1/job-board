The deprecation of `tf.contrib` in TensorFlow 2.0 necessitated a significant restructuring of codebases relying on its functionalities.  My experience migrating large-scale production models underscored the crucial need for understanding the underlying TensorFlow APIs and choosing appropriate replacements based on the specific task.  Simply substituting `tf.contrib` calls with direct equivalents often proved insufficient, demanding a deeper architectural rethink in many instances.

**1. Explanation:**

The `tf.contrib` module served as a repository for experimental and community-contributed components, lacking the stability and long-term support of the core TensorFlow API.  Its removal in TensorFlow 2.0 was deliberate, promoting a more streamlined and maintainable core library.  Consequently, code relying on `tf.contrib` modules required a careful assessment and often substantial rewriting. The migration process involved three primary steps:

* **Identifying Contrib Dependencies:** The initial phase involves a thorough analysis of the existing codebase to pinpoint all usages of `tf.contrib` modules.  Tools like static analysis or IDE-integrated code search capabilities can greatly expedite this process.  This analysis is critical, as overlooking even a single dependency can lead to runtime errors.

* **Locating Suitable Replacements:** Once the dependencies are identified, the next step is to find suitable replacements within the core TensorFlow 2.0 API or other established libraries.  This requires a thorough understanding of both the functionality provided by the `tf.contrib` module and the capabilities of its potential substitutes.  Often, direct replacements are unavailable, demanding a more involved refactoring of the affected code segments.  For instance, some functionalities might necessitate the use of custom layers or the implementation of alternative algorithms.

* **Testing and Validation:**  The final step involves rigorous testing to ensure the migrated code functions correctly and produces the expected results.  Unit tests are essential in this phase, verifying the accuracy and robustness of the rewritten code against the original implementation.  Performance benchmarking is also crucial to identify any potential bottlenecks introduced during the migration.  In my experience, overlooking comprehensive testing was the single biggest source of post-migration issues.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Replacing `tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm`**

Prior to TensorFlow 2.0, batch normalization was often achieved using `tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm`.  The equivalent in TensorFlow 2.0 utilizes `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization`.

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x with tf.contrib
import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10])
normalized_x = tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm(x, is_training=True)

# TensorFlow 2.x equivalent
import tensorflow as tf
x = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,))
normalization_layer = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
normalized_x = normalization_layer(x)
```

The key difference lies in the shift to the Keras sequential model approach.  In TensorFlow 2.0, Keras is tightly integrated, making it the preferred method for building and managing layers.  This example highlights the shift from a more functional style to an object-oriented approach using Keras layers.

**Example 2:  Handling `tf.contrib.rnn`**

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) frequently relied upon `tf.contrib.rnn` for various cell implementations.  TensorFlow 2.0 integrates these functionalities directly into `tf.keras.layers`.

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x with tf.contrib
import tensorflow as tf
lstm_cell = tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell(num_units=128)
outputs, state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(lstm_cell, inputs, dtype=tf.float32)

# TensorFlow 2.x equivalent
import tensorflow as tf
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=128, return_state=True)
outputs, h, c = lstm_layer(inputs)
```

This showcases the migration from the lower-level `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` to the higher-level `tf.keras.layers.LSTM`.  The simplification and improved readability are evident.  The use of `return_state=True` explicitly manages the hidden and cell states, offering greater control over the RNN's internal state.

**Example 3:  Addressing `tf.contrib.estimator`**

Estimators provided a high-level API for model training and evaluation.  `tf.contrib.estimator` offered various extensions.  TensorFlow 2.0 encourages the use of Keras for model building and `tf.compat.v1.estimator` for legacy estimator code, although using Keras is often preferable.


```python
# TensorFlow 1.x with tf.contrib (Illustrative - Specific contrib estimators varied)
import tensorflow as tf
# ... (contrib estimator definition) ...
estimator = tf.contrib.estimator.some_estimator(...)  # Example, replaced by tf.estimator.Estimator in tf.compat.v1

# TensorFlow 2.x equivalent (Keras preferred)
import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    # ... Keras layers ...
])
model.compile(...)
model.fit(...)
```

This example demonstrates the significant shift towards Keras as the primary model building framework.  Directly using  `tf.compat.v1.estimator` can maintain some legacy functionality, but adopting Keras often provides a cleaner and more modern approach.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 2.0 migration guide.  The TensorFlow API documentation.  Relevant chapters in advanced machine learning and deep learning textbooks focused on TensorFlow.  Searching and filtering StackOverflow questions and answers tagged with "TensorFlow 2.0 migration."  Consulting the documentation for specific libraries utilized within the `tf.contrib` module, often their successor libraries have corresponding documentation that outlines replacement procedures.   Finally, examining code examples from open-source projects that have successfully completed similar migrations can prove invaluable.
