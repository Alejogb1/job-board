The core challenge in efficiently indexing CUDA tensors without NumPy conversion lies in directly leveraging the GPU's memory architecture and avoiding data transfers between the host (CPU) and device (GPU).  My experience developing accelerated simulations has highlighted that frequent conversions, while convenient for certain workflows, quickly become a major bottleneck, particularly when dealing with large tensors. The PyTorch `torch.Tensor` API, alongside CUDA's inherent capabilities, offers the necessary tools for direct device indexing.

The primary method for indexing CUDA tensors directly involves utilizing slicing operations on tensors located within GPU memory. Crucially, these slicing operations return a view, not a copy. This means that modifying the returned view directly modifies the original tensor, and all operations occur entirely on the GPU. Unlike indexing in NumPy, which often involves creating new arrays, this approach maintains data locality, leading to significant performance benefits. Furthermore, PyTorch enables advanced indexing using masks and lists of indices, all within the CUDA environment. This is crucial when you need to index using the results of a GPU computation or manipulate irregular tensor regions. Failing to leverage these techniques typically leads to unnecessary memory transfers back to the CPU for index computations and subsequent transfers back to the GPU for the actual tensor access, resulting in significant overhead.

Here's how I typically approach this, with several illustrative examples:

**Example 1: Basic Slicing**

This demonstrates straightforward access to tensor regions using start, end, and step parameters. It parallels NumPyâ€™s slicing syntax but operates natively on the GPU.

```python
import torch

# Create a tensor on the GPU
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
tensor = torch.arange(24, dtype=torch.float32, device=device).reshape(2, 3, 4)

# Simple slice: first row from the first batch
slice1 = tensor[0, :, :]
print("Slice 1:\n", slice1)

# Slice with step: every other column from the second batch
slice2 = tensor[1, :, ::2]
print("\nSlice 2:\n", slice2)


# Modify slice2 - this will change the original tensor
slice2[0, 0] = -100
print("\nOriginal tensor after modifying slice 2:\n", tensor)
```

In this example, the `tensor` is initialized directly on the CUDA device. The first slice, `tensor[0, :, :]`, extracts the entire first row from the first dimension. The second slice, `tensor[1, :, ::2]`, takes every other column from the second row in the first dimension. Importantly, modifying `slice2` directly changes the underlying data in `tensor`. This highlights the view concept, a critical optimization for in-place GPU manipulations. The printed outputs clearly show the results of these indexing operations.

**Example 2: Advanced Indexing with Masks**

This illustrates selective tensor access using Boolean masks, generated directly on the GPU. This method is highly effective for filtering tensor elements based on computed conditions.

```python
# Create a tensor on the GPU
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
tensor = torch.randn(3, 3, device=device)
print("Original tensor:\n", tensor)

# Create a mask based on a condition
mask = tensor > 0
print("\nBoolean mask:\n", mask)


# Use the mask to select elements
masked_tensor = tensor[mask]
print("\nMasked tensor:\n", masked_tensor)

# Modification with mask
tensor[mask] = -1

print("\nModified tensor with mask:\n", tensor)
```

Here, a random tensor is generated on the GPU, and then a boolean `mask` is created using the condition `tensor > 0`.  This mask, again located on the GPU, is used to select only the positive elements of the original tensor, which results in a flattened 1D tensor containing only the elements that satisfy the mask condition.  Moreover, the mask is then used to change the positive elements in place to the value of -1, demonstrating how masks facilitate in-place modification of specific elements.

**Example 3: Advanced Indexing with Index Lists**

This demonstrates access to specific tensor elements using lists of indices, allowing irregular selections without creating explicit boolean masks. This approach is essential when manipulating sparse or randomly distributed tensor data.

```python
# Create a tensor on the GPU
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
tensor = torch.arange(16, dtype=torch.float32, device=device).reshape(4, 4)
print("Original tensor:\n", tensor)


# Define indices
row_indices = torch.tensor([0, 2], device=device)
col_indices = torch.tensor([1, 3], device=device)

# Use advanced indexing with lists
indexed_tensor = tensor[row_indices, col_indices]
print("\nIndexed tensor:\n", indexed_tensor)

# Assign new values to the indexed positions
tensor[row_indices, col_indices] = torch.tensor([-100, -200], device=device)

print("\nModified tensor after assignment:\n", tensor)


```
In this example, lists of `row_indices` and `col_indices`, themselves residing on the GPU, are used to select specific elements of the original tensor. The result is a new tensor consisting of the selected elements from the corresponding row and column coordinates. Further, values are assigned to the indexed positions, changing the elements of the original tensor in place based on the provided indices.

These examples are designed to showcase some typical indexing strategies I apply. There exist more complex indexing techniques, such as using boolean masks with higher dimensional tensors and nested lists of indices, but the core principles remain consistent: keeping computations and data access within the CUDA context for optimal speed.

When encountering indexing problems, several resources have proven useful. The official PyTorch documentation provides exhaustive details on tensor indexing. Specific to CUDA, the PyTorch documentation on device tensors is essential to fully understanding the mechanics and performance implications. Furthermore, various online forums provide insights from the PyTorch community, as well as discussions specific to advanced indexing. Books and tutorials related to parallel programming using CUDA often include examples of tensor manipulation. While these sources don't offer specific code snippets relevant to the specific problem at hand, they enhance fundamental understanding and provide essential background knowledge. Finally, I strongly recommend conducting targeted benchmark experiments. The performance of various indexing methods can vary depending on the specific hardware and the shape of the tensor. Performing experiments under realistic workloads is vital for understanding when and how to apply various indexing techniques. Experimentation with various sizes and indexing patterns is required to build an intuition for best practices.
