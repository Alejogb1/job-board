Infeasibility, specifically denoted by an objective function value of zero and a flag indicating infeasibility (INFES = 1), can absolutely lead to scenarios that appear as local optima within the context of optimization algorithms, particularly in constrained problems. I've encountered this several times during my work with structural optimization and robotic motion planning algorithms. These algorithms often employ penalty methods or barrier functions to handle constraints, and a premature convergence towards an infeasible region can be a significant hurdle.

The core problem stems from how these algorithms navigate the search space. When constraints are violated, a penalty term is introduced into the objective function, attempting to 'push' the search back towards the feasible region. However, if the initial guess is far from a feasible solution or the penalty term is poorly scaled, the algorithm might become 'trapped' in an area where reducing the (potentially penalized) objective function means further violations of the constraints. The algorithm sees a local minimum in terms of the penalized objective, but this minimum corresponds to an infeasible solution in the original, constrained problem, making it not a true solution.

To understand this better, imagine a scenario where a robotic arm needs to reach a specific point while avoiding obstacles. The objective function might minimize the energy consumption of the arm's motors. The constraints would be that the arm must physically reach the point, and it must not collide with obstacles. If the initial configuration of the arm is in a region where any slight movement reduces energy consumption (the objective) but also moves the arm further into an obstacle (constraint violation), the optimization algorithm might conclude that it has found the best (local) solution, even though the position is infeasible and therefore undesirable. The algorithm has found a local minimum in the penalized search space that isn't a local minimum of the constrained optimization problem itself. This situation is further complicated by the fact that some optimization algorithms use gradients, and in such infeasible zones, the gradients might point toward local 'minima' in the penalized objective that lead further into infeasibility.

Let me illustrate this with a simplified numerical example using a gradient-descent algorithm. Consider a minimization problem:

Minimize: f(x) = x^2
Subject to: x >= 2

Here, the minimum of the objective function itself (x^2) occurs at x=0. Now, consider implementing a penalty method where we add a penalty to the objective function if x < 2. For instance, if we used a quadratic penalty, we'd minimize:

f_p(x) = x^2 + p * max(0, 2 - x)^2

where p is the penalty parameter.

**Code Example 1 (Python): Infeasible Local Optimum**

```python
import numpy as np

def objective(x):
  return x**2

def constraint_violation(x):
  return max(0, 2 - x)

def penalized_objective(x, p):
  return objective(x) + p * constraint_violation(x)**2

def gradient_descent(start_x, learning_rate, penalty, iterations):
  x = start_x
  for i in range(iterations):
    grad = 2 * x - 2 * penalty * constraint_violation(x)
    if x < 2:
      grad += 2 * penalty * (2 - x) * (-1)

    x = x - learning_rate * grad
  return x, penalized_objective(x, penalty)

# Example
start_x = -1
learning_rate = 0.01
penalty_value = 100
iterations = 1000
final_x, final_objective = gradient_descent(start_x, learning_rate, penalty_value, iterations)

print(f"Starting point: {start_x}")
print(f"Resulting x: {final_x}")
print(f"Objective value (penalized): {final_objective}")
print(f"Constraint Violated: {constraint_violation(final_x) > 0}")
```
In this example, a starting point of -1 will result in a local, infeasible solution. The large penalty parameter, *penalty_value* = 100 pushes the optimizer towards a region close to x=0, even if this is far from the feasible region. The result showcases convergence to a solution with *x* less than 2, which is infeasible and also not the true optimum of the original constrained problem (which is x=2).

**Code Example 2 (Matlab): Another Implementation**
```matlab
function [final_x, final_objective] = gradientDescent(start_x, learning_rate, penalty, iterations)
    x = start_x;
    for i = 1:iterations
      grad = 2 * x - 2 * penalty * max(0, 2 - x);
        if x < 2
          grad = grad + 2 * penalty * (2 - x) * (-1);
        end
      x = x - learning_rate * grad;
    end
    final_x = x;
    final_objective = x^2 + penalty * max(0, 2 - x)^2;
end
% Example
start_x = -1;
learning_rate = 0.01;
penalty_value = 100;
iterations = 1000;

[final_x, final_objective] = gradientDescent(start_x, learning_rate, penalty_value, iterations);

disp(['Starting point: ', num2str(start_x)]);
disp(['Resulting x: ', num2str(final_x)]);
disp(['Objective value (penalized): ', num2str(final_objective)]);
disp(['Constraint Violated: ', num2str(max(0, 2 - final_x) > 0)]);
```
This Matlab implementation replicates the Python example, showing the same tendency for a large penalty parameter to force the solution into an infeasible region.

**Code Example 3 (C++): Demonstrating the Concept**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

double objective(double x) {
    return std::pow(x, 2);
}

double constraint_violation(double x) {
    return std::max(0.0, 2.0 - x);
}

double penalized_objective(double x, double p) {
    return objective(x) + p * std::pow(constraint_violation(x), 2);
}

std::pair<double, double> gradient_descent(double start_x, double learning_rate, double penalty, int iterations) {
    double x = start_x;
    for (int i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        double grad = 2 * x - 2 * penalty * constraint_violation(x);
         if (x < 2)
          grad = grad + 2 * penalty * (2-x)*(-1);
        x = x - learning_rate * grad;
    }
    return {x, penalized_objective(x, penalty)};
}

int main() {
    double start_x = -1.0;
    double learning_rate = 0.01;
    double penalty_value = 100.0;
    int iterations = 1000;

    auto result = gradient_descent(start_x, learning_rate, penalty_value, iterations);
    double final_x = result.first;
    double final_objective = result.second;

    std::cout << "Starting point: " << start_x << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Resulting x: " << final_x << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Objective value (penalized): " << final_objective << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Constraint Violated: " << (constraint_violation(final_x) > 0) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
This C++ implementation further confirms how infeasibility (a constraint is violated) can cause the algorithm to terminate in a region that looks like a minimum in terms of the penalized objective function.

These examples use gradient descent which, while illustrative, is not the only optimization algorithm susceptible to this. Many optimization methods, including those using interior-point methods, can also encounter this when the penalty or barrier parameters are not appropriately chosen or when the starting point is excessively far from the feasible space. In practice, several techniques help mitigate these issues:

1. **Constraint Preprocessing:** Analyzing constraints beforehand to ensure consistency and potentially reformulating them can improve algorithm performance. Techniques like constraint relaxation can also be used to avoid immediate infeasibilities during the initial steps.
2. **Penalty Parameter Annealing:** Instead of using a fixed penalty parameter, slowly increasing it during optimization can lead to a better balance between objective function optimization and constraint satisfaction. This allows the algorithm to gradually approach feasibility rather than becoming trapped by a large initial penalty.
3. **Better Initial Points:** Using prior knowledge about the problem or using heuristics to find a point closer to the feasible region can decrease the chance of the algorithm converging to an infeasible point.
4. **Augmented Lagrangian Methods:** These are a more robust approach to constrained optimization that combines penalty functions with Lagrange multipliers. These methods often exhibit better convergence properties than simple penalty methods.
5. **Hybrid approaches:** Combining different types of optimization algorithms, leveraging their respective strengths, can also result in more robust solutions.

For further study, I suggest delving into numerical optimization textbooks that focus on constrained optimization, the practical application of penalty and barrier methods, and advanced techniques like augmented Lagrangian approaches. Resources covering global optimization methods may also offer insights into avoiding local optima generally, including those induced by infeasibility. Furthermore, studying papers on specific applications (like structural or robotics) might provide context-specific nuances regarding the issues discussed. I have found the texts by Nocedal and Wright on Numerical Optimization, and Boyd and Vandenberghe's work on convex optimization particularly helpful in my research.
