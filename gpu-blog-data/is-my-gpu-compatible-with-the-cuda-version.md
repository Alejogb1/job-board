The primary determinant of CUDA compatibility lies within the compute capability of the installed GPU. This capability, a numerical designation reflecting the GPU's hardware features, must meet or exceed the minimum requirement specified by the CUDA toolkit version. Years of troubleshooting CUDA installations, especially when dealing with custom-built workstations, have underscored the criticality of this seemingly simple check, and its impact on application performance, or even functional viability. Incorrect pairings often lead to cryptic runtime errors or, worse, silently degraded performance that can be difficult to diagnose without systematic analysis.

To elaborate, each CUDA toolkit release targets GPUs with a specific range of compute capabilities. Nvidia, the developer of CUDA, assigns these capability numbers that evolve with new GPU architectures. For example, an older GTX 680 might have a compute capability of 3.0, while a newer RTX 3090 boasts an 8.6 capability. A CUDA toolkit compiled for compute capability 6.0 will generally execute without error on devices possessing compute capability equal to or greater than 6.0. However, if you attempt to run a binary compiled for 6.0 on a GPU with a compute capability of, say, 3.0, the kernel won't execute, as it lacks essential hardware features presumed present during compilation. While runtime detection *can* sometimes fall back to compatibility modes, it often results in significantly less efficient execution, essentially negating the benefits of GPU acceleration. The critical detail is that, generally, a newer compute capability will support all lower capabilities within the same major architecture, but never the other way around. Therefore, the GPU must not only be *supported* by a particular CUDA toolkit, but its *maximum* supported architecture, specified during compilation, must be equal to or lower than that of the GPU itself.

I have learned this lesson multiple times, most notably during a machine learning project where I was testing models developed on a modern server using an older workstation for inference. The initial results were perplexing as execution time was unreasonably slow, ultimately tracing back to mismatched compute capabilities. This highlights the importance of consistently checking both the hardware specification and the CUDA build target.

Let's demonstrate with some examples:

**Example 1: Determining GPU Compute Capability**

To accurately diagnose a potential compatibility issue, you first need to ascertain your GPU's compute capability. This can be done in multiple ways, but I find the `nvidia-smi` utility to be the most reliable method. It is part of the Nvidia driver package and almost always available on systems with a functional CUDA installation. I've included a standard terminal invocation example below:

```bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute_cap --format=csv
```

The output will list the compute capability of each installed Nvidia GPU on your system as a comma-separated value. For instance, an output might look like:

```
compute_cap
8.6
```

This means the installed GPU has a compute capability of 8.6. Note that the precise format of the output can differ slightly across different versions of `nvidia-smi`, but the essential piece of information—the compute capability value—will always be present. This output is indispensable for assessing compatibility with the compiled binaries used in applications.

**Example 2: CUDA Compilation and Target Architecture**

The target architecture is crucial. When developing CUDA applications, you specify the target compute capabilities during the compilation process using the `nvcc` compiler (Nvidia's CUDA compiler). The flags `arch=compute_xx,code=sm_yy` define, respectively, the minimum compute capability the code can execute on, and the specific hardware architecture for optimization. For instance:

```bash
nvcc -arch=compute_60 -code=sm_60 my_kernel.cu -o my_kernel
```

Here, `compute_60` specifies a minimum compute capability of 6.0, and `sm_60` specifies optimizations specifically for the 6.0 architecture. In a situation where the GPU has a lower capability (e.g., 5.2), the compiled code *will not execute correctly*. Conversely, a device with 7.5 could execute this code with full functionality, potentially without taking advantage of features only available in the 7.5 architecture. For optimal performance, you should typically target the lowest acceptable architecture compatible with your target GPU and consider compiling separately optimized versions. I've experienced situations where pre-compiled binaries targeted older architectures to ensure broad compatibility, resulting in substantial performance losses compared to targeted builds. I typically use the `compute_xx,sm_yy` pattern even for newer architectures to ensure I clearly declare both the architecture version for optimization and the minimum supported version. Failing to specify these parameters correctly will, at best, leave performance on the table, and at worst, result in runtime errors.

**Example 3: Runtime Verification**

While compile-time compatibility is essential, a program may still need to check GPU features at runtime. The CUDA API provides functions that allow a program to retrieve the compute capability of the current device dynamically. Here is a highly simplified example within C++:

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        std::cerr << "No CUDA-capable devices found." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    cudaDeviceProp deviceProp;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&deviceProp, 0);

    std::cout << "Device Name: " << deviceProp.name << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Compute Capability: " << deviceProp.major << "." << deviceProp.minor << std::endl;

    // Example check (assuming compiled for 7.0)
    if (deviceProp.major < 7) {
      std::cerr << "Warning: Device has compute capability less than 7.0." << std::endl;
    }
     return 0;

}
```

This code snippet queries the properties of the currently selected CUDA device (device 0, in this case), specifically retrieving the major and minor components of the compute capability. This value, `deviceProp.major` and `deviceProp.minor`, can then be compared to the requirements of the application to issue warnings or trigger fallback behavior as needed. I often embed this sort of validation within my software to handle cases where the software is deployed on unexpected hardware. The `cudaGetDeviceProperties` function provides a plethora of additional information about the device, which can be useful for dynamic optimization strategies within the application. This information includes things such as the amount of available memory, the clock frequency, and the number of multi-processors.

In summary, to address the initial query, determining GPU compatibility with a particular CUDA toolkit involves more than just the presence of the library. You must confirm that: 1) your GPU's compute capability (obtained through `nvidia-smi`) meets or exceeds the minimum required by your compiled software; 2) the CUDA compiler uses the correct compute architecture flags to create executable code that runs correctly on the target hardware; and 3) incorporate runtime checks into your code for robustness to gracefully handle incompatible hardware configurations if required by your system.

For further information on CUDA and hardware compatibility, I recommend reviewing Nvidia's official CUDA documentation and the developer forums dedicated to GPU computing. The Nvidia website also contains detailed architecture specifics for all GPUs that should be referenced before deploying any CUDA-accelerated applications. A general review of CUDA compilation flags should also be performed before any GPU build to fully understand how code targeting is configured.
