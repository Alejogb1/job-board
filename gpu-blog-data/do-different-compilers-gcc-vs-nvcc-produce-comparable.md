The assertion that identical source code will invariably yield bit-for-bit identical results across different compilers, specifically gcc and nvcc, is demonstrably false.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications, particularly those leveraging CUDA, has repeatedly highlighted subtle, and sometimes significant, disparities in compiled binaries. These differences stem from variations in optimization strategies, underlying architectures, and the inherent differences between general-purpose CPUs (targeted by gcc) and GPUs (targeted by nvcc).

**1. Explanation of Compiler Differences and Their Impact on Code Execution:**

The gcc compiler, targeting x86-64 architectures (or other CPU architectures depending on the configuration), prioritizes optimizing for CPU instruction sets.  Its optimization techniques often involve instruction reordering, loop unrolling, and sophisticated register allocation strategies designed for sequential processing.  It operates within the constraints and capabilities of a general-purpose CPU, considering factors like cache hierarchy and branch prediction.

Conversely, nvcc, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler, targets the massively parallel architecture of NVIDIA GPUs.  Its optimization strategies focus on maximizing thread-level parallelism, memory coalescing, and efficient utilization of the GPU's specialized hardware units like Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs).  Furthermore, nvcc handles the complexities of data transfer between the CPU host and the GPU device, a process absent in standard CPU compilation.  This leads to a fundamentally different approach to code generation.  Consequently, even seemingly straightforward C/C++ code will often translate into drastically different assembly instructions when compiled with gcc versus nvcc.  These differences are not merely aesthetic; they affect performance, numerical precision, and potentially even the correctness of the results, particularly in scenarios involving floating-point arithmetic or memory management.

Differences in floating-point arithmetic are crucial.  While both compilers adhere to IEEE 754 standards, the implementation details (e.g., rounding modes, optimization of floating-point operations) can vary, leading to slightly different results.  This becomes particularly relevant in computationally intensive applications where accumulated rounding errors can magnify to produce noticeable discrepancies.  Furthermore, GPUs may use different precision levels for certain operations than CPUs, leading to further divergence.

Memory access patterns also contribute significantly.  On a CPU, memory access is generally sequential and predictable.  However, GPU memory access requires careful consideration of memory coalescing to achieve optimal performance.  The compiler’s strategy for managing this aspect significantly affects the efficiency of the kernel execution, potentially influencing final results if memory access patterns are non-deterministic or dependent on specific memory locations.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the potential for divergence between gcc and nvcc compilations.

**Example 1:  Simple Floating-Point Accumulation:**

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  float sum = 0.0f;
  for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
    sum += 0.000001f;
  }
  std::cout.precision(17);
  std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Compiling this simple code with gcc and nvcc (after adaptation for CUDA, potentially within a kernel) may yield slightly different values for `sum` due to variations in floating-point summation and the order of operations. While the difference may be small, it demonstrates the principle of non-identical results.

**Example 2:  Memory Access Pattern in CUDA:**

```c++
__global__ void kernel(float *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    data[i] = data[i] * 2.0f;
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation and data initialization) ...
  kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(dev_data, N);
  // ... (Data retrieval and verification) ...
  return 0;
}
```

Here, the memory access pattern within the CUDA kernel is crucial.  The compiler's choice of memory access strategy—influenced by block and thread arrangement—significantly impacts performance.  The same code compiled with gcc (which wouldn't even compile this CUDA kernel without modification) would result in completely different memory access patterns.


**Example 3:  Function Inlining:**

```c++
#include <iostream>

inline float myFunc(float x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    float result = myFunc(5.0f);
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

While this seems trivial, the compiler’s decision regarding function inlining (replacing the function call with the function's body) can vary.  gcc and nvcc might have different heuristics for determining when inlining is beneficial, leading to variations in the generated assembly code, even for this small example. The impact might be subtle here but becomes more pronounced with larger, more complex functions.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To deepen your understanding of compiler optimization techniques, I would recommend consulting the documentation for both gcc and nvcc, specifically focusing on their optimization flags and their impact on code generation.  Furthermore, studying compiler internals—at least at a high level—will illuminate the reasons for such discrepancies.  Exploring assembly language will provide direct insight into the compiled code’s behavior.  Finally, texts on high-performance computing and parallel programming (specifically CUDA programming) offer valuable context.  These resources provide a deeper understanding of the architectural constraints and optimization opportunities that influence compilation outcomes.  Careful experimentation with different compiler flags, coupled with performance analysis tools, is essential to mastering these nuances.
