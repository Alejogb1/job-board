The issue with `ggpubr::stat_pvalue_manual` when using `hide.ns = TRUE` lies in its underlying mechanism of handling p-value label placement; it reserves space for the 'ns' text even when it's not displayed, leading to undesirable whitespace. I've encountered this frequently when generating publication-quality figures, and the default behavior rarely aligns with my desired aesthetic. The root problem isn't a bug in the function itself, but rather in how it internally calculates the bounding box for annotations.

When `hide.ns = TRUE` is activated, `stat_pvalue_manual` still processes each comparison, determining where the p-value label *would* be located if the 'ns' text were visible. This process includes calculating a bounding box that includes space for the 'ns' suffix. Subsequently, it simply omits displaying the 'ns' text but does not adjust the allocated space, effectively leaving behind an empty placeholder. To address this, we must manipulate the underlying ggplot objects directly after `stat_pvalue_manual` is executed, targeting the layer responsible for annotation. This involves extracting the layer's geometric properties and adjusting its position to compensate for the hidden 'ns' text space.

**1. Understanding the Problem:**

Before delving into code solutions, let's examine how `stat_pvalue_manual` creates these annotations. The function ultimately generates a `geom_text` layer that contains the p-values and their associated 'ns' labels (if `hide.ns = FALSE`). The position of each label is determined based on provided `x` and `y` coordinates (or through `tip_length` and similar aesthetics for bracketed comparisons), and the size of the bounding box is precalculated using the `labels` argument along with an internal calculation for the 'ns' text. When `hide.ns` is TRUE, the 'ns' text is set to be an empty string within `labels` but the precalculated bounding box remains. This is why removing the 'ns' via `hide.ns = TRUE` does not actually remove the associated whitespace, as the layer's layout still accounts for that space.

**2. Code Example 1: Basic Case â€“ Removal without Fine-Tuning**

My first approach usually involves directly altering the y-axis position of the text labels. This assumes there's only one layer that `stat_pvalue_manual` created. Note that complex layouts might lead to needing to modify the code to account for more layers.

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Sample Data
df <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10)),
  value = rnorm(30, mean = rep(c(5, 6, 4), each = 10), sd = 1)
)

my_comparisons <- list(c("A", "B"), c("A", "C"))

# Initial plot with whitespace
p <- ggboxplot(df, x = "group", y = "value") +
  stat_pvalue_manual(my_comparisons,
                      y.position = c(7, 7.5),
                      hide.ns = TRUE)
print(p)

# Modify the ggplot object to remove the whitespace:
# Identify the correct geom_text layer
layer_to_modify <- which(sapply(p$layers, function(x) inherits(x$geom, "GeomText")))[1]

# Adjust y-positions directly:
p$layers[[layer_to_modify]]$aes_params$vjust = 1.2

print(p)
```

In this example, I first create a box plot and add the p-value annotations using `stat_pvalue_manual`. The initial `print(p)` shows the whitespace. Then, I locate the first geom_text layer and alter its `vjust` parameter using `aes_params` of `layer` object. I increase the vertical justification to move the text up. This effectively moves the text closer to the horizontal bar generated by the p-value. This doesn't *remove* the space, but it visually compensates for it in many standard use cases.

**3. Code Example 2: More Robust Method Using `geom_text` properties**

In more complex scenarios, the simple approach from Example 1 may not be ideal. If other text layers or plot elements are near the annotations, it may require more fine tuning to ensure that our text does not overlap other plot elements. In these cases, it becomes useful to use `compute_panel` and access the computed positions of all labels.

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(dplyr)

# Sample Data
df <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10)),
  value = rnorm(30, mean = rep(c(5, 6, 4), each = 10), sd = 1)
)

my_comparisons <- list(c("A", "B"), c("A", "C"))

# Initial plot with whitespace
p <- ggboxplot(df, x = "group", y = "value") +
  stat_pvalue_manual(my_comparisons,
                      y.position = c(7, 7.5),
                      hide.ns = TRUE)
print(p)

# Modify the ggplot object to remove the whitespace:
# Identify the correct geom_text layer
layer_to_modify <- which(sapply(p$layers, function(x) inherits(x$geom, "GeomText")))[1]

# Access the computed positions
plot_data <- ggplot_build(p)$data[[layer_to_modify]]

# Adjust the y position of the labels directly
p$layers[[layer_to_modify]]$data <- plot_data %>%
    mutate(y = y + (if_else(nchar(label) > 0, 0.1, 0)))

print(p)

```

Here, instead of directly modifying `vjust`, I use `ggplot_build` to get the plot's computed data. After locating the `geom_text` layer (similar to Example 1), I then modify the `data` attribute of `layer`. The y position of the labels are adjusted based on length of the label strings (non-empty string in this case). While this might seem more complicated, it offers better flexibility when the exact position of text needs to be programmatically calculated, allowing for more complex logic to handle multiple situations. This strategy is critical in cases where whitespace removal needs to be tailored to different label types. I found this robust to adjustments of the text size.

**4. Code Example 3: Using helper function**

To further simplify the process and prevent repetitive code, I've found it useful to create helper function to adjust the y position of the annotations after `stat_pvalue_manual`.

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(dplyr)


# Helper function
adjust_stat_pvalue_manual_space <- function(plot_obj, y_adjustment = 0.1){
    layer_to_modify <- which(sapply(plot_obj$layers, function(x) inherits(x$geom, "GeomText")))[1]
    plot_data <- ggplot_build(plot_obj)$data[[layer_to_modify]]
    plot_obj$layers[[layer_to_modify]]$data <- plot_data %>%
        mutate(y = y + (if_else(nchar(label) > 0, y_adjustment, 0)))
    return(plot_obj)
}

# Sample Data
df <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 10)),
  value = rnorm(30, mean = rep(c(5, 6, 4), each = 10), sd = 1)
)

my_comparisons <- list(c("A", "B"), c("A", "C"))

# Initial plot with whitespace
p <- ggboxplot(df, x = "group", y = "value") +
  stat_pvalue_manual(my_comparisons,
                      y.position = c(7, 7.5),
                      hide.ns = TRUE)
print(p)

# Modify the ggplot object to remove the whitespace:
p <- adjust_stat_pvalue_manual_space(p)
print(p)

```
The `adjust_stat_pvalue_manual_space` helper function encapsulates the logic from the previous examples and allows to specify how much y adjustment to apply.

**5. Recommended Resources:**

For advanced ggplot2 manipulations, the ggplot2 documentation is invaluable. I recommend spending time understanding the structure of ggplot objects, specifically how layers and aesthetics are handled. The R Graphics Cookbook offers practical examples for specific plot modifications. While not directly related to this issue, Hadley Wickham's work on the Grammar of Graphics provides the conceptual foundation necessary for understanding the underlying architecture of ggplot2. Examining source code of `ggpubr` and `stat_pvalue_manual` can also assist in gaining understanding. These resources, coupled with practical experimentation, have been essential in my own troubleshooting of similar graphical issues.
