`tf.data` datasets operate within the TensorFlow graph, and directly slicing them using standard Python indexing syntax breaks this fundamental operating principle. The issue arises because graph execution requires symbolic tensors, not concrete values. Direct indexing with Python syntax attempts to treat `tf.data` objects as iterable collections in eager mode, which they are not when building a computational graph, leading to the aforementioned error. I've encountered this several times during the development of custom data pipelines for sequence-to-sequence models, and it always stems from a misunderstanding of how `tf.data` interacts with TensorFlow's computational graph.

The core of the problem lies in the distinction between eager execution and graph execution in TensorFlow. When eager execution is enabled (which is the default in TensorFlow 2.x), operations are performed immediately, and you can interact with tensors as you would with NumPy arrays. However, when defining models or data pipelines intended for deployment, TensorFlow constructs a symbolic computational graph, representing the sequence of operations to be performed. This graph allows optimizations, distributed execution, and efficient deployment to various hardware. `tf.data` pipelines are designed to function within this graph, efficiently streaming data and performing transformations. Directly slicing a `tf.data` object, such as `dataset[1:5]`, tries to extract data before the graph is executed. In the graph context, `dataset` is a symbolic representation of the pipeline, not a material collection of data, hence the error. When the graph attempts to 'evaluate' what is at `dataset[1:5]`, it does not have the ability to index the data directly. This differs from python lists or numpy arrays, which can be accessed by their indices.

To illustrate, consider an example where I attempt to create a dataset from a NumPy array and then slice it using Python indexing within a function that could form part of a TensorFlow model. This fails as soon as the tensor is passed as part of a `tf.function`. I have deliberately created this example with the most common approach that causes issues. This often happens when developers with Pythonic thinking try to apply normal python practices to TensorFlow code.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

@tf.function
def problematic_slice(data):
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
    sliced_dataset = dataset[1:5] # This line causes the error during graph construction
    return sliced_dataset

data = np.arange(10)
try:
    result = problematic_slice(data)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

The output will include "TypeError: 'DatasetV1Adapter' object is not subscriptable". This error message reinforces that we cannot use Python's built-in slicing capabilities with TensorFlow `Dataset` objects. The `tf.function` decorator ensures that the `problematic_slice` is compiled into a computational graph.

Instead of direct indexing, we must use the appropriate `tf.data` methods. The method `skip()` for skipping elements, and `take()` for selecting a number of elements can emulate Pythonâ€™s slicing behavior within the computation graph. The next example refactors the problem from the previous example with `skip()` and `take()` to correctly extract the required data from the dataset.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

@tf.function
def correct_slice(data):
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
    sliced_dataset = dataset.skip(1).take(4) # skip one then take the next four elements
    return sliced_dataset

data = np.arange(10)
result = correct_slice(data)
for item in result:
    print(item)
```

This code will now execute without any graph construction errors. The output will be a sequence of tensors, corresponding to elements `[1, 2, 3, 4]` from the original NumPy array, which is what we would have expected from a python slice of `[1:5]`. The key here is the use of `skip(1)` to move past the initial element at index 0, and then `take(4)` which takes the next four elements of the dataset. This avoids any direct indexing of the dataset, and the operations can be performed by TensorFlow during graph execution.

The final example involves a more complex slicing scenario, where I want to implement a sliding window over the data, this often arises with time series data. If not done correctly, it will incur slicing errors. Consider the following function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

@tf.function
def sliding_window_incorrect(data, window_size, stride):
  dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
  windows = []
  for i in range(0, len(data) - window_size + 1, stride):
      windows.append(dataset[i:i + window_size]) #Incorrect Slicing
  return windows
  
data = np.arange(10)
window_size = 3
stride = 1
try:
    result = sliding_window_incorrect(data, window_size, stride)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Again, the error will be a type error stating that the dataset is not subscriptable. This can be corrected by using the `window` function, that was built for the exact purpose of applying sliding window functions on data. The corrected code is:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

@tf.function
def sliding_window_correct(data, window_size, stride):
  dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
  windows = dataset.window(window_size, shift=stride, drop_remainder = True)
  return windows.flat_map(lambda window: window.batch(window_size))

data = np.arange(10)
window_size = 3
stride = 1
result = sliding_window_correct(data, window_size, stride)
for window in result:
  print(window)
```

This corrected version utilizes the `window()` function and the `flat_map()` function, which enables the extraction of windowed data. By setting the drop remainder to true, all incomplete windows are dropped, and it provides correctly windowed batches of the data. By using the flatmap to `batch` the window into the correct shape, the dataset now has the correct format to be used as input to a neural network.

To summarize, when dealing with `tf.data`, it is essential to understand that the dataset is a representation of a data processing graph, not just a simple data structure. Therefore, slicing operations that are common to Python sequences do not work. Instead, use the `tf.data` API which provides methods like `skip()`, `take()`, and `window()` to manipulate data flow correctly within the graph.

For further learning, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data`, focusing particularly on the following areas: Dataset creation (from various sources), dataset transformations (`map`, `filter`, `batch`, `shuffle`), and performance optimization strategies (caching, prefetching, and parallel processing). The TensorFlow tutorials and guides on data input pipelines, available on the official TensorFlow website are invaluable. Finally, reviewing examples on sites like GitHub or StackOverflow that demonstrate the correct use of the `tf.data` library will help solidify the necessary understanding.
