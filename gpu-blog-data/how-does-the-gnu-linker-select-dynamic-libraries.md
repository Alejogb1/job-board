The GNU linker's dynamic library selection process is fundamentally driven by the interplay between the program's dependency specifications, the system's runtime linker configuration, and the available library locations.  My experience working on embedded systems and large-scale Linux applications has solidified my understanding of this intricate mechanism.  It's not simply a matter of searching a predefined path; it's a carefully orchestrated sequence of steps subject to numerous environmental variables and configuration options.

**1.  The Search Process Explained:**

The process begins with the executable file, which contains a program header detailing its dependencies on shared libraries (.so files on Linux).  These dependencies are specified by library names, often without explicit version information or paths.  The dynamic linker, typically `ld-linux.so` (or a variant thereof), intercepts the program's execution. Its primary role is to resolve these dependencies at runtime.

This resolution involves a systematic search through a hierarchy of directories defined primarily by the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, `/etc/ld.so.conf` (and its included files), and finally, the system's default library paths, typically `/lib` and `/usr/lib`.  The order is crucial; the linker stops searching once it finds a matching library. This implies that a library in a directory specified earlier in the search path will take precedence over an identically named library in a later directory, even if the latter is a newer version.

The matching process itself isn't just a simple string comparison. The linker considers library versioning (using the `SONAME`, a symbolic name embedded in the library), and attempts to find the best-matching library based on its version compatibility requirements as stated in the program's dependency specifications. If the exact version specified isn't available, the linker attempts to find a compatible version, relying on the versioning scheme embedded in the library filenames (e.g., `libmylib.so.1.2.3` where `1.2.3` represents the version). The `libmylib.so.1` symbolic link typically points to the latest compatible version. Failure to find a compatible library results in a runtime linking error.

Furthermore, the linker uses a cache file, typically `/etc/ld.so.cache`, to speed up subsequent searches.  This cache is dynamically updated when library files are added, removed, or modified. It efficiently indexes the libraries across the various search directories.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate these aspects with examples.  Note that error handling and more robust code would be necessary in a production environment.

**Example 1:  Basic Dependency:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello from main!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This simple program implicitly links to the `libc` library (via `stdio.h`). The linker automatically resolves this dependency during compilation and linking (using `gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c`).  No explicit library specification is needed in this case; `libc` is a fundamental system library.


**Example 2: Explicit Dependency:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "mylib.h"

int main() {
    mylib_function();
    printf("Hello from main!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

`mylib.h` declares a function `mylib_function()`. To link this, we use the `-lmylib` option (assuming `libmylib.so` is in one of the linker's search paths):

```bash
gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -lmylib
```

This explicitly tells the linker to search for `libmylib.so` during linking. The linker will locate the library using its search strategy, described above.  If `-L/path/to/mylib` is added,  it adds `/path/to/mylib` to the beginning of the search path for the library.


**Example 3:  Versioning and LD_LIBRARY_PATH:**

Suppose `libmylib.so.1.0.0` and `libmylib.so.1.1.0` exist in different locations. To force the use of `libmylib.so.1.1.0` located in `/opt/mylibs`, while also compiling against the header files from the 1.0.0 version (potentially due to source code differences), we can manipulate the environment:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/mylibs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -lmylib #mylib.h is still assumed to be from version 1.0.0
```

This sets `/opt/mylibs` as the first directory in the search path, ensuring `libmylib.so.1.1.0` is used (assuming `libmylib.so.1` points to the appropriate file there).  The order of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is crucial.  Without this explicit setting, the linker might find a different version in a system directory, leading to potential compatibility issues.  This demonstrates the runtime control over the selection process.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding, I strongly recommend thoroughly studying the GNU linker manual.  The system administrator's guide for your specific Linux distribution will also provide valuable insights into the configuration of dynamic linking and library management.  Finally, consulting advanced texts on operating systems and system programming can provide a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and intricacies involved in the runtime linking process.  These resources contain far more detail than I can provide here.
