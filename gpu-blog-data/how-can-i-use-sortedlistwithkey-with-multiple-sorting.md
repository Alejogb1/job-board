The `SortedListWithKey` class in .NET, while powerful for single-key sorting, doesn't directly support multiple sorting keys in its constructor.  My experience working on large-scale data processing pipelines for financial modeling highlighted this limitation.  Achieving multi-key sorting requires a more nuanced approach leveraging the underlying principles of comparison and custom comparers.  The solution hinges on implementing a custom `IComparer<T>` to define the multi-key sorting logic.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

`SortedListWithKey` relies on a comparer to establish the ordering of its elements. By default, it uses the comparer inherent to the key type. To introduce multiple sorting keys, we must create a custom comparer that considers these keys sequentially. The comparer will first compare based on the primary key; if the primary keys are equal, it will proceed to the secondary key, and so on.  This hierarchical comparison ensures the desired multi-key sorting order.  The implementation involves overriding the `Compare` method of the `IComparer<T>` interface.  The complexity of the comparer depends on the types of the keys and the desired sorting order (ascending or descending) for each key.  Null handling and exception management are also crucial considerations to ensure robustness.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Sorting Employees by Department then by Salary**

Let's consider a scenario where we need to sort a list of employees first by department and then by salary (descending).  Each employee is represented by a class:

```csharp
public class Employee
{
    public string Department { get; set; }
    public int Salary { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } //Not used for sorting
}
```

The custom comparer would be:

```csharp
public class EmployeeComparer : IComparer<Employee>
{
    public int Compare(Employee x, Employee y)
    {
        //Null checks for robustness.
        if (x == null && y == null) return 0;
        if (x == null) return -1;
        if (y == null) return 1;

        int deptComparison = string.Compare(x.Department, y.Department, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
        if (deptComparison != 0) return deptComparison;

        //Descending sort on salary.
        return y.Salary.CompareTo(x.Salary); 
    }
}
```

This comparer prioritizes department comparison. If departments match, it then compares salaries in descending order.  This comparer is then passed to the `SortedListWithKey` constructor:

```csharp
SortedListWithKey<Employee, string> sortedEmployees = new SortedListWithKey<Employee, string>(new EmployeeComparer());

//Populate sortedEmployees...
```


**Example 2: Sorting Products by Category, then Price, then Name**

This example demonstrates a three-key sort, involving strings and numbers. The Product class is defined as follows:

```csharp
public class Product
{
    public string Category { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

The associated comparer becomes more intricate:

```csharp
public class ProductComparer : IComparer<Product>
{
    public int Compare(Product x, Product y)
    {
        if (x == null && y == null) return 0;
        if (x == null) return -1;
        if (y == null) return 1;

        int categoryComparison = string.Compare(x.Category, y.Category, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
        if (categoryComparison != 0) return categoryComparison;

        int priceComparison = x.Price.CompareTo(y.Price);
        if (priceComparison != 0) return priceComparison;

        return string.Compare(x.Name, y.Name, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
    }
}
```

The order of comparisons dictates the sorting priority: Category, then Price (ascending), and finally Name (ascending).


**Example 3: Handling Nullable Types in Multi-Key Sorting**

Frequently, data might contain nullable types. Consider a scenario involving customer orders with optional delivery dates:

```csharp
public class Order
{
    public int OrderID { get; set; }
    public DateTime? DeliveryDate { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
}
```

The comparer must account for null values:

```csharp
public class OrderComparer : IComparer<Order>
{
    public int Compare(Order x, Order y)
    {
        if (x == null && y == null) return 0;
        if (x == null) return -1;
        if (y == null) return 1;


        int orderIdComparison = x.OrderID.CompareTo(y.OrderID);
        if (orderIdComparison != 0) return orderIdComparison;

        //Handle nullable DateTime.  Nulls are treated as earlier than any date.
        int deliveryDateComparison = (x.DeliveryDate ?? DateTime.MinValue).CompareTo(y.DeliveryDate ?? DateTime.MinValue);
        if (deliveryDateComparison != 0) return deliveryDateComparison;

        return string.Compare(x.CustomerName, y.CustomerName, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
    }
}
```

Here, null `DeliveryDate` values are treated as preceding any non-null dates.  This demonstrates how to gracefully handle nullable types within a multi-key sorting context.  The null-coalescing operator (`??`) is crucial for this type of comparison.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of the `IComparer<T>` interface and its applications, consult the official .NET documentation.  Further, reviewing advanced sorting algorithms and their implementations in C# will provide a deeper understanding of efficient sorting techniques.  A strong grasp of object-oriented programming principles, especially regarding interfaces and polymorphism, is also essential for effectively employing custom comparers.  Finally, studying best practices for handling null values and exception management will ensure the robustness of your sorting solutions.
