The absence of gradients in Keras, manifesting as `None` instead of the expected zero, typically stems from a disconnect between the model's computational graph and the backpropagation process.  This often arises from improper loss function specification, incorrect model architecture, or issues within the custom training loop.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, including a large-scale recommendation system and a complex time-series forecasting model, I've found that careful scrutiny of data flow within the TensorFlow backend is paramount.  Let's examine the potential causes and demonstrate practical solutions.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Keras, being a high-level API, abstracts away much of the underlying TensorFlow (or Theano, in legacy instances) computations.  When a gradient is `None`, it signifies that TensorFlow couldn't compute a derivative for a particular tensor during the backward pass. This doesn't automatically imply an error in your code; rather, it indicates a structural problem within the model's computational graph preventing gradient calculation.  Several common scenarios contribute to this:

* **Disconnected Layers:** If a layer's output isn't directly or indirectly connected to the loss function, its gradients will be `None`.  This can happen with improperly configured custom layers or when layers are unintentionally bypassed during the forward pass.  Layers which don't perform differentiable operations also contribute to this.  Consider a layer that simply selects a random element â€“ no gradient can be computed.

* **Loss Function Issues:**  An incorrectly defined or improperly used loss function is a frequent culprit.  For example, using a loss function that's not differentiable with respect to the model's weights (e.g., a loss function incorporating non-differentiable operations like argmax or relying on discrete variables) will yield `None` gradients. The loss function must be compatible with the output of your model and differentiable across the parameter space.

* **Incorrect Masking:** When dealing with variable-length sequences (common in NLP or time series), incorrect masking can lead to gradients being `None`.  Masking ensures that gradients aren't computed for padded regions in sequences. An incorrectly applied mask effectively prevents gradient flow through relevant parts of the network.

* **Numerical Instability:** In rare cases, extreme values in activations or weights can lead to numerical instability during backpropagation, resulting in `NaN` or `None` gradients.  This is often related to poorly scaled data or inappropriate activation functions.

* **Custom Training Loops:**  When crafting custom training loops, mistakes in gradient calculation or application using `tf.GradientTape` are possible. Incorrectly specifying the `variables` argument or failing to apply gradients to the optimizer can lead to `None` gradient outputs.



**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Disconnected Layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'), # This layer's output is not used
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# The gradient of the second dense layer will be None because its output is not involved in loss calculation
x = tf.random.normal((10, 10))
y = tf.random.uniform((10, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  predictions = model(x)
  loss = model.compiled_loss(y, predictions)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
print(gradients) # The gradient for the second dense layer will be None
```

This demonstrates a scenario where the middle `Dense` layer's output is ignored. The loss only depends on the final layer's output; therefore, backpropagation doesn't propagate through the disconnected layer.

**Example 2: Incorrect Loss Function:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=lambda y_true, y_pred: tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.abs(y_true - y_pred) > 0.5, tf.float32))) # Non-differentiable loss

x = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
y = tf.constant([[0.0], [1.0], [0.0]])

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = model.compiled_loss(y, y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
print(gradients) # Gradients will likely be None due to the non-differentiable loss
```

Here, a custom loss function based on a non-differentiable comparison (`tf.abs(y_true - y_pred) > 0.5`) prevents gradient calculation.  Replacing this with a differentiable loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy) would resolve the issue.


**Example 3: Custom Training Loop with Error:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(10,))])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

x = tf.random.normal((10, 10))
y = tf.random.normal((10, 1))

for epoch in range(1):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(x)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(predictions - y)) # MSE Loss
        #ERROR: Missing application of gradients
        #optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables), model.trainable_variables))
    print(tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)) # Gradients will be computed but not applied.
```

This example showcases a custom training loop where the `optimizer.apply_gradients` step is omitted (commented out). While gradients are calculated, they aren't applied to the model's weights, leaving the model unchanged.  The final `print` statement will show the computed gradients, which are not `None` in this particular case because the loss function is well-defined and differentiable. However, the model won't learn because the weights are not updated.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on automatic differentiation (`tf.GradientTape`), custom training loops, and the specific layers and loss functions used in your model, are crucial.  Thoroughly understanding the TensorFlow computational graph is essential.  Furthermore, debugging tools integrated within TensorFlow and Jupyter notebooks can greatly assist in tracing the flow of gradients and identifying problematic areas within the model.  Finally, a strong grasp of the mathematical underpinnings of backpropagation and automatic differentiation is necessary for advanced troubleshooting.
