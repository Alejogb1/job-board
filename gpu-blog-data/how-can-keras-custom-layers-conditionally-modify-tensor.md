Conditional modification of tensor values within Keras custom layers necessitates a deep understanding of TensorFlow's underlying operations and the limitations of Keras's high-level API.  My experience building complex generative models and deploying them in production environments highlighted the crucial role of efficient conditional logic within custom layers.  The key is leveraging TensorFlow's conditional operations directly within the `call` method of your custom layer, avoiding reliance solely on Keras' built-in functions which may lack the necessary granularity.  This often involves employing TensorFlow's `tf.where` or `tf.cond` for element-wise or block-wise conditional tensor manipulation, respectively.  Failing to do so can lead to inefficient computations or unexpected behavior, especially with large tensors.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras custom layers are defined by extending the `Layer` class. The core functionality resides within the `call` method, which takes the input tensor and returns the modified tensor.  To implement conditional modifications, we must introduce conditional logic within this method.  Directly using Python's `if` statements is generally inefficient for tensor operations.  Instead, TensorFlow's conditional operations, specifically `tf.where` and `tf.cond`, are indispensable.

`tf.where` offers element-wise conditional selection.  Given a condition tensor (a boolean tensor of the same shape as the input), `tf.where` selects elements from either a `x` or `y` tensor based on the corresponding boolean value in the condition tensor. This is exceptionally useful for applying different transformations to different elements of a tensor based on some criteria.

`tf.cond` facilitates block-wise conditional execution.  It executes one of two distinct blocks of code based on a boolean condition.  This is suitable for scenarios where different transformations are needed depending on a global condition rather than element-wise conditions.  For instance, applying a different normalization technique based on the input tensor's norm.

Crucially, ensuring the data types and shapes of tensors involved in conditional operations align precisely is paramount to avoid errors and ensure computational efficiency. Explicit type casting (e.g., using `tf.cast`) might be necessary to guarantee compatibility.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Element-wise Conditional Scaling using `tf.where`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class ConditionalScaler(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, threshold=0.5):
        super(ConditionalScaler, self).__init__()
        self.threshold = threshold

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Scale values above the threshold by 2, otherwise by 0.5
        scaled_tensor = tf.where(inputs > self.threshold, inputs * 2.0, inputs * 0.5)
        return scaled_tensor

# Example usage
inputs = tf.constant([[0.2, 0.8], [0.1, 0.9]])
layer = ConditionalScaler()
output = layer(inputs)
print(output)
```

This example showcases the use of `tf.where`. The condition `inputs > self.threshold` generates a boolean tensor, and `tf.where` selects values from either `inputs * 2.0` or `inputs * 0.5` based on this condition.  This achieves element-wise conditional scaling efficiently.

**Example 2: Conditional Batch Normalization using `tf.cond`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class ConditionalBatchNorm(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, threshold=10.0):
        super(ConditionalBatchNorm, self).__init__()
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.bn = keras.layers.BatchNormalization()

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Apply BatchNormalization only if the L2 norm of the input is above a threshold
        norm = tf.norm(inputs)
        normalized_tensor = tf.cond(norm > self.threshold, lambda: self.bn(inputs), lambda: inputs)
        return normalized_tensor

# Example usage
inputs = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
layer = ConditionalBatchNorm()
output = layer(inputs)
print(output)
```

This demonstrates `tf.cond`.  Batch normalization is conditionally applied based on the L2 norm of the input tensor.  If the norm exceeds the `threshold`, `self.bn(inputs)` (batch normalization) is executed; otherwise, the input is passed through unchanged.  This highlights the efficient control over complex operations.

**Example 3:  Combining `tf.where` and  `tf.cond` for sophisticated control**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class AdvancedConditionalLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(AdvancedConditionalLayer, self).__init__()
        self.dense = keras.layers.Dense(10)

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Apply a Dense layer only to positive values, otherwise, zero them out.
        # Then, apply ReLU only if the norm of the intermediate output is > 5
        positive_values = tf.where(inputs > 0, inputs, tf.zeros_like(inputs))
        intermediate = self.dense(positive_values)
        norm = tf.norm(intermediate)
        final_output = tf.cond(norm > 5, lambda: tf.nn.relu(intermediate), lambda: intermediate)
        return final_output

# Example usage
inputs = tf.constant([[-1, 2], [3, -4]])
layer = AdvancedConditionalLayer()
output = layer(inputs)
print(output)
```

This intricate example combines both `tf.where` for element-wise selection and `tf.cond` for block-wise conditional application of the ReLU activation. This showcases the flexibility and power in designing highly customized and controlled layer behavior.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* TensorFlow documentation focusing on tensor manipulation operations.  Pay close attention to the specifics of `tf.where`, `tf.cond`, and related functions for efficient tensor management within custom layers.
*  Keras' documentation on custom layer creation. This is essential for a thorough understanding of the `Layer` class, the `call` method, and other crucial components of building custom Keras layers.
* A comprehensive text on deep learning frameworks. This provides the broader context for understanding the interplay between TensorFlow's underlying mechanics and Keras' high-level API.  Focusing on sections dealing with custom layers and efficient tensor operations will be particularly beneficial.  Understanding the limitations of eager execution versus graph execution is also critical for performance optimization in these scenarios.


Through diligent implementation of TensorFlow's conditional operations within the `call` method of your custom Keras layer and a thorough understanding of TensorFlow's underlying mechanisms, you can effectively create highly specialized and adaptable neural network components. Remember to always validate the data types and shapes of tensors to ensure the smooth execution of conditional logic.  The examples provided highlight different strategies and their combinations for managing conditional tensor transformations in Keras custom layers, showcasing best practices for efficient and flexible model construction.
