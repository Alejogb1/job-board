The core issue stems from a mismatch between the expected output dimensionality of the T5 decoder and the desired 2-label tensor.  While T5 models excel at sequence-to-sequence tasks, directly forcing a classification output requires careful handling of the final layer and loss function.  My experience debugging similar problems in large-scale natural language processing projects highlights the necessity of aligning the model's output with the specific classification task.  The error likely arises because the decoder, designed for generating sequences, outputs a vocabulary-sized vector, while your 2-label classification requires a binary or, more generally, a 2-dimensional output.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The T5 architecture comprises a T5EncoderModel and a T5DecoderModel. The encoder processes the input sentence, generating a contextualized representation.  This representation is then passed to the decoder.  The `T5Tokenizer` handles the tokenization and detokenization, converting sentences into numerical tokens and vice-versa.  The crucial point of failure lies in the decoder's final layer.  The default configuration of the `nn.TransformerDecoder`  is optimized for sequence generation, typically yielding a vocabulary-sized output vector, representing the probability distribution over all tokens in the vocabulary.  This is fundamentally incompatible with a binary classification problem, which expects a 2-dimensional output representing the probabilities of each class.

To achieve a 2-label classification, we need to modify the decoder's output layer.  Instead of directly using the decoder's output, we need to add a linear layer to project the decoder's hidden state into a 2-dimensional space.  This linear layer will learn the mapping from the decoder's high-dimensional representation to the two class probabilities.  Furthermore, the choice of loss function is critical.  Using a cross-entropy loss function appropriate for multi-class classification (even with only two classes) is essential for training this modified model effectively.  Failing to make these adjustments results in shape mismatches, leading to errors during the forward and backward passes.  In essence, the problem arises from a mismatch between the model's inherent output and the intended task.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate how to rectify this problem using PyTorch and the Hugging Face Transformers library.  Note that these examples assume you have already installed the necessary libraries (`transformers`, `torch`).

**Example 1:  Correcting the Output Layer**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5EncoderModel, T5DecoderModel

# Initialize tokenizer and models (replace with your actual model names)
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")
encoder = T5EncoderModel.from_pretrained("t5-small")
decoder = T5DecoderModel.from_pretrained("t5-small")

class ClassificationHead(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_classes):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=-1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x[:, 0, :]) # Take the first token's hidden state
        x = self.softmax(x)
        return x

#Modify the decoder.  This adds a new linear layer on top of it
class ModifiedDecoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, decoder, classification_head):
        super().__init__()
        self.decoder = decoder
        self.classification_head = classification_head

    def forward(self, input_ids, encoder_hidden_states):
        decoder_output = self.decoder(input_ids=input_ids, encoder_hidden_states=encoder_hidden_states)
        classification_output = self.classification_head(decoder_output.last_hidden_state)
        return classification_output

#Initialize classification head (2 classes)
classification_head = ClassificationHead(decoder.config.hidden_size, 2)
modified_decoder = ModifiedDecoder(decoder, classification_head)

# Example usage (replace with your actual data)
input_text = "This is a positive sentence."
encoded_input = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")
encoder_output = encoder(**encoded_input)
# Assuming you have a decoder input of appropriate shape
decoder_input = torch.randint(0, tokenizer.vocab_size, (1, 10)) # Example Decoder input, replace with actual input
output = modified_decoder(decoder_input, encoder_output.last_hidden_state)
print(output)
```

This example introduces a `ClassificationHead` that maps the decoder's output to a 2-dimensional space using a linear layer followed by a softmax for probability normalization. The `ModifiedDecoder` integrates this head for seamless classification.  Critically, we select the first token's hidden state (`x[:, 0, :]`) as our classification representation; this is often a suitable choice but could be adapted based on your specific application.

**Example 2: Using a Different Decoder Output**

```python
# ... (Previous code, initializing tokenizer and models) ...

class ModifiedDecoder2(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, decoder, classification_head):
    super().__init__()
    self.decoder = decoder
    self.classification_head = classification_head

  def forward(self, input_ids, encoder_hidden_states):
    decoder_output = self.decoder(input_ids=input_ids, encoder_hidden_states=encoder_hidden_states)
    # Use the pooler_output instead of last hidden state.  Poolers are often designed for classification
    classification_output = self.classification_head(decoder_output.pooler_output)
    return classification_output

# ... (Rest of the code remains similar) ...
```

This example demonstrates using the `pooler_output` if it is available from your decoder. This is particularly relevant if your decoder architecture includes a pooling mechanism explicitly designed for producing a fixed-length representation suitable for classification.


**Example 3:  Loss Function Specification**

```python
import torch.nn.functional as F

# ... (Previous code, including the modified decoder) ...

#Example training loop
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() # Correct loss function

optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(modified_decoder.parameters(), lr=1e-5)

# Training loop (simplified)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
  for batch in data_loader:
    # ... (Your data loading and preprocessing here) ...
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = modified_decoder(decoder_input, encoder_output.last_hidden_state)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels) #labels are your 2-label tensor
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

This example explicitly specifies the `CrossEntropyLoss` function, essential for training a classification model. The loss function calculates the difference between the model's predicted probabilities and the true labels.
