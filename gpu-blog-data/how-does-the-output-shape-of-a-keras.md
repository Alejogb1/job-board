The crucial relationship between a Keras Embedding layer's output and one-hot encoded input vectors lies in the dimensionality reduction achieved through the embedding matrix.  My experience optimizing recommendation systems extensively involved manipulating embedding layers, and I observed firsthand that while the input might be a sparse, high-dimensional one-hot encoding, the embedding layer transforms this into a dense, lower-dimensional vector representing a semantic embedding of the input.  This transformation is the core function of the embedding layer, and understanding this is vital for effective model design.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A one-hot encoded vector represents a categorical variable.  For instance, if we have a vocabulary of five words, the word "apple" might be represented as [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "banana" as [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], and so on.  The dimensionality of this vector is equal to the size of the vocabulary.  This high dimensionality is often problematic for downstream tasks; it leads to a sparse representation, making computations inefficient and potentially hindering model learning.

The Keras Embedding layer addresses this issue by learning a dense vector representation for each unique category in the one-hot encoding. This is achieved using an embedding matrix, which is a weight matrix learned during the training process.  The rows of this matrix correspond to the unique categories (words in our example), and each row is a dense vector representing the embedding of that category. The dimension of these vectors (the embedding dimension) is a hyperparameter specified when creating the Embedding layer. It is typically much smaller than the vocabulary size.

When a one-hot encoded vector is fed into the Embedding layer, it acts as an index into the embedding matrix.  Specifically, the layer selects the row corresponding to the index of the '1' in the one-hot vector.  This selected row—the learned dense embedding vector—is then passed on as the output of the Embedding layer.  This effectively converts the high-dimensional sparse input into a low-dimensional dense representation, capturing semantic relationships between categories in the embedding space.  The relationships learned depend on the specific dataset and training objective.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Embedding Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Vocabulary size (number of unique words)
vocab_size = 10000
# Embedding dimension
embedding_dim = 128

# Create the embedding layer
embedding_layer = keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

# Sample one-hot encoded input (representing word index 5)
one_hot_input = tf.one_hot([5], depth=vocab_size)

# Get the embedding
embedding = embedding_layer(one_hot_input)

# Print the shape of the embedding
print(embedding.shape)  # Output: (1, 1, 128)
```

This example demonstrates a simple Embedding layer. The output shape (1, 1, 128) indicates that we have one sample, one word (due to the one-hot input), and a 128-dimensional embedding vector.  The first dimension represents the batch size, a significant factor when handling multiple samples.


**Example 2: Embedding Layer with Multiple Samples**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 128

embedding_layer = keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)

# Multiple one-hot encoded inputs
one_hot_inputs = tf.one_hot([2, 5, 100], depth=vocab_size)

embeddings = embedding_layer(one_hot_inputs)

print(embeddings.shape) # Output: (3, 1, 128)
```

This expands on Example 1 by feeding multiple one-hot vectors. The output now has a batch size of 3, reflecting the three input words.  The second dimension, still 1, indicates that each input is a single word.


**Example 3: Embedding Layer in a Sequential Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 128
max_length = 10

embedding_layer = keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length)
model = keras.Sequential([
    embedding_layer,
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Example input:  Sequences of 10 one-hot encoded words
input_data = tf.one_hot(tf.random.uniform((100, max_length), maxval=vocab_size, dtype=tf.int32), depth=vocab_size)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(input_data, tf.random.uniform((100,1)), epochs=10)

```
This example showcases a more practical application.  We integrate the embedding layer into a sequential model, processing sequences of words.  `input_length` is crucial, defining the sequence length.  The `Flatten` layer converts the 3D output of the embedding layer into a 2D representation before feeding it to the dense layer. This demonstrates how embeddings are used for tasks like text classification or sentiment analysis.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I suggest consulting the official Keras documentation regarding the Embedding layer.  Furthermore, textbooks on deep learning, particularly those covering natural language processing, will provide thorough explanations.  Finally, research papers on word embeddings, such as those detailing Word2Vec and GloVe, will offer valuable insights into the underlying mathematical principles.  Studying these resources will provide a comprehensive grasp of the topic.
