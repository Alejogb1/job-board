The asynchronous nature of TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset.map` function, coupled with its execution in a separate thread pool, frequently leads to unexpected behavior, particularly when developers presume a synchronous, in-order execution pattern. This arises because the `map` operation, unlike a traditional iterator, doesn’t apply the mapped function to each element sequentially, waiting for completion before moving to the next. Instead, it initiates multiple instances of the mapping function concurrently, possibly introducing race conditions or non-deterministic results if the mapped function depends on external mutable states or global variables.

The primary culprit is TensorFlow's optimization for performance. It prefetches elements from the input dataset into a buffer. Subsequently, it dispatches batches of these prefetched elements to a thread pool for processing via the supplied `map` function. This parallelism drastically increases throughput, especially on operations that might be computationally expensive, such as image decoding or augmentation. However, this benefit comes at the cost of predictable, sequential execution.

Consider a scenario where, during data preprocessing, you intend to maintain a global counter indicating the number of elements processed. A naïve implementation might involve something like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

counter = 0

def increment_and_return(x):
  global counter
  counter += 1
  return x, counter

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(10)
mapped_dataset = dataset.map(increment_and_return)

for _, count in mapped_dataset:
  print(count)

print("Final Counter Value:", counter)
```

This code snippet, often, will produce varying results. Each time it is executed, the printed counter values will not be strictly ascending, and the final counter value will not necessarily be 10. This happens due to the `increment_and_return` function, where modifications to the global variable `counter` aren’t atomic and might be accessed simultaneously by different threads. This introduces a race condition; the increment operations from different threads may interleave, resulting in a miscounting. It's critical to recognize that the `map` function's asynchronous behavior isn't an implementation bug, but rather an optimization designed for efficient parallel processing of data. Expecting it to mirror the synchronous, single-threaded behavior of a Python list comprehension is where the confusion arises.

Another common pitfall emerges when the mapped function relies on external mutable states initialized outside of the TensorFlow graph and intended to be modified during the mapping process. For example, imagine you have a file containing configurations for data augmentation, and you want the map function to load a new configuration from the file for each image. The following code would likely yield unpredictable results:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import random

config_file_index = 0
config_files = ['config1.txt', 'config2.txt', 'config3.txt'] # Assume these files exist


def load_and_augment(image):
    global config_file_index

    with open(config_files[config_file_index % len(config_files)], 'r') as f:
        config = f.readline().strip()

    config_file_index +=1

    # Dummy augmentation based on config string
    if config == "rotate":
      augmented_image = tf.image.rot90(image)
    elif config == "flip":
       augmented_image = tf.image.flip_left_right(image)
    else:
      augmented_image = image

    return augmented_image


dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.zeros((10, 28, 28, 3), dtype=tf.float32))
mapped_dataset = dataset.map(load_and_augment)

for img in mapped_dataset:
  print(img.shape)
```

In this instance, the global variable `config_file_index` is not thread-safe. Multiple threads might attempt to access and increment this index simultaneously, potentially resulting in multiple threads reading the same configuration file, and also skipping config files. Moreover, since TensorFlow might also aggressively cache the outputs of the map function, the file might not be reloaded as often as the user might expect. This introduces both inconsistencies in the per-element configurations and also potentially non-deterministic processing.

Finally, understanding how TensorFlow's data pipelines work is critical in debugging this sort of issue. A seemingly straightforward use-case may lead to subtle errors. Let's consider the application of a `tf.function` decorated Python function within the `map` operation, aiming to leverage TensorFlow's graph execution advantages. When this function relies on operations, specifically those that are not strictly TensorFlow operations, like printing, or random seed manipulations, the intended effect might be lost, or yield unpredictable output.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import random

@tf.function
def augment_image(image):
   random.seed(42) # intended to be deterministic
   if random.random() > 0.5:
     augmented_image = tf.image.flip_left_right(image)
   else:
     augmented_image = image
   print("Shape inside augment:", image.shape) #side-effect
   return augmented_image


dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(tf.zeros((10, 28, 28, 3), dtype=tf.float32))
mapped_dataset = dataset.map(augment_image)

for img in mapped_dataset:
    print("Final shape:", img.shape)
```

Here, although `random.seed(42)` is used within the TensorFlow graph, it's important to realize that the random number generation and seeding operations are executed at graph *construction* time, not at runtime for each element. This implies that multiple calls to the function from different threads during dataset processing won’t each call `random.seed(42)`, but the seed initialization is done only once, at graph definition. Similarly, the `print` statement is executed during tracing of the graph, not on every element processed by the map function. So, the "Shape inside augment:" is not printed for every image. This can be misleading because when a function not traced by Tensorflow is called, this call will execute sequentially and each time the dataset is iterated through, this portion would execute, whereas, a `tf.function` execution will have this traced once and the generated graph executed by the dataset.

To address such issues, several approaches can be adopted. First, avoid relying on mutable global states or non-thread-safe operations within the map function. Encapsulate all necessary data and logic within the function's scope and utilize TensorFlow operations. Where necessary, wrap the map operation in a function to avoid using variables outside of the map function context. Second, for operations like random transformations, leverage TensorFlow's `tf.random` module, ensuring determinism as needed via `tf.random.set_seed()`. Third, when state needs to be maintained across multiple elements, look into the usage of TensorFlow's `tf.Variable`, which are designed to be managed within the TensorFlow graph and its state. Finally, when the intent is explicitly for the map function to process elements sequentially, then a non-parallel method is preferred; this can often be achieved by using other data-processing tools in python before building the data pipeline.

For further understanding of TensorFlow data pipelines, I recommend exploring the TensorFlow documentation on data loading, specifically focusing on `tf.data` modules, prefetching and caching mechanisms, and the best practices for building robust pipelines. Additionally, studying examples of concurrent programming in Python, such as threading and multiprocessing, will build an understanding of the challenges involved in thread safety and state management when working with asynchronous execution models.  A thorough reading of resources explaining TensorFlow graph execution and function tracing would further clarify where the side-effects are evaluated in TensorFlow graphs.
