Rasterizers, specifically hardware-based rasterizers, achieve superior performance over general-purpose shaders largely due to their highly specialized and parallel architecture designed for a very specific task: transforming and projecting 2D primitives, predominantly triangles, and determining which pixels should be affected based on their coverage of those primitives. This narrow focus allows for hardware optimizations that shader pipelines, aiming for broader flexibility, cannot effectively replicate.

I’ve spent considerable time implementing both CPU-based software rasterizers and working with various graphics APIs like OpenGL and Vulkan, directly encountering this performance difference firsthand. While shaders excel at complex per-pixel computations like lighting, texturing, or advanced material models, they generally execute on a massively parallel but fundamentally programmable architecture. Rasterization, on the other hand, is an inherently parallel, fixed-function process.

The core disparity stems from how each subsystem processes geometry data. Rasterization relies on a process known as triangle setup. This preliminary step involves calculating edge equations – essentially, mathematical descriptions of each triangle's edges. These equations allow for efficient inside/outside testing of pixels. Once these edge equations are generated, rasterization can proceed in parallel, testing each pixel against each triangle’s edges, and if a pixel lies within the triangle's bounds, generating fragments. This process leverages a highly optimized series of mathematical operations, specifically geared towards this very computation. These operations are implemented in hardware, often as dedicated circuitry in the GPU, achieving extremely high throughput due to fixed-function logic that eliminates branching and conditional execution.

Shaders, conversely, lack this fixed-function optimization. While shaders certainly benefit from parallelism via SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) execution and heavily pipelined architectures, their generalized nature means they need to execute code based on the programmed logic. This involves fetching data from various sources like textures, uniform buffers, and input attributes, followed by a series of calculations. Even highly optimized shader code will still incur overhead from data fetching, memory access patterns, and conditional statements – necessary for implementing flexible shading and material models. Rasterization avoids much of this.

Moreover, rasterizers benefit from “early-Z culling”.  Before the fragment shader even begins execution, rasterization pipelines can discard fragments that will be occluded by nearer geometry.  This early depth test significantly reduces the computational load on the shader stage, as a significant portion of potential fragments may be culled before shaders need to process them. Shaders, operating on fragments, cannot trivially replicate this pre-processing optimization across a large number of fragments. While a shader can perform depth testing, it must do so after it completes its other calculations and the test is per-fragment instead of before fragment processing, making it a much less efficient filtering method.

Furthermore, rasterizers often use hierarchical depth buffer (Hi-Z) techniques. Hi-Z is a pre-computed mipmap pyramid of minimum depth values, allowing for efficient coarse occlusion testing. This further eliminates large groups of fragments quickly and efficiently.  Hi-Z is again an optimization not directly applicable to shader programs operating on individual fragments after their creation.

To illustrate these points, consider a simple scene composed of millions of small triangles. A rasterizer, utilizing its fixed-function processing, will perform triangle setup and clipping quickly on each primitive and use early-Z testing and Hi-Z to cull significant overdraw before shading starts. A shader attempting to perform similar tasks would struggle due to the sheer number of primitives and depth tests that would be handled in a more sequential manner, even in a highly parallel environment.

Now, let's consider a few code examples to clarify the conceptual differences. These examples are simplified for demonstration purposes and do not represent actual GPU hardware or API implementation.

**Example 1: Simplified Triangle Rasterization (Conceptual)**

```c++
struct Triangle {
    float x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2; // Screen space coordinates
    float z0, z1, z2;
};

struct Fragment {
    float x, y, z;
};

bool insideTriangle(const Triangle& tri, float x, float y) {
    // Simplified inside-outside test based on barycentric coordinates. In reality optimized edge equations would be used.
    float s = (tri.y0 - tri.y2) * (x - tri.x2) + (tri.x2 - tri.x0) * (y - tri.y2);
    float t = (tri.y1 - tri.y0) * (x - tri.x0) + (tri.x0 - tri.x1) * (y - tri.y0);

    if (s < 0 || t < 0 || (s+t) > ((tri.y0-tri.y2) * (tri.x1-tri.x2) + (tri.x2-tri.x0) * (tri.y1 - tri.y2) ))
    {
      return false; //Outside
    }

    return true; // Inside
}

Fragment processPixel(const Triangle& tri, int pixel_x, int pixel_y) {
    if (insideTriangle(tri, static_cast<float>(pixel_x) + 0.5f , static_cast<float>(pixel_y) + 0.5f)) {
      // Interpolate depth z values and generate a fragment
      float alpha = 0.333; //simplistic barycentric coords
      float interpolatedZ = tri.z0 * alpha + tri.z1*alpha + tri.z2*alpha;
      return {static_cast<float>(pixel_x), static_cast<float>(pixel_y), interpolatedZ};
    } else {
        return {0.0f, 0.0f, -FLT_MAX};
    }
}
```

*Commentary*: This code demonstrates a very basic and highly simplified rasterization algorithm. `insideTriangle` checks if a pixel location is within the bounds of a given triangle. `processPixel` generates a fragment only if a pixel is inside the triangle, with an interpolated depth. The actual process in hardware involves optimized edge equation testing performed in parallel, not a single barycentric computation. This is a very simple and inefficient representation of the actual process.

**Example 2: Naive Shader-Based Rasterization (Inefficient)**

```c++
struct Vertex {
    float x, y, z;
};

struct Output {
    float depth;
};


Output vertexShader(const Vertex& vertex) {
  //Transform vertex (simplified)
    return {vertex.z}; // depth is z for the sake of this example
}

// Highly inefficient fragment "shader" emulation. Not a fragment shader in reality.
Output pixelShader(const Triangle& tri, int pixel_x, int pixel_y) {
    if (insideTriangle(tri,static_cast<float>(pixel_x) + 0.5f , static_cast<float>(pixel_y) + 0.5f)) {
       float alpha = 0.333; //simplistic barycentric coords
       float interpolatedZ = tri.z0 * alpha + tri.z1*alpha + tri.z2*alpha;
       return {interpolatedZ};
    }
    return {-FLT_MAX}; // return a large depth to simulate culling
}


//Simulated Raster process
void shaderBasedRasterize(const Triangle& triangle, int screenWidth, int screenHeight, float* depthBuffer){
  //Simplified Vertex shader processing:
    Vertex v0 = {triangle.x0, triangle.y0, triangle.z0};
    Vertex v1 = {triangle.x1, triangle.y1, triangle.z1};
    Vertex v2 = {triangle.x2, triangle.y2, triangle.z2};

  Output outv0 = vertexShader(v0);
  Output outv1 = vertexShader(v1);
  Output outv2 = vertexShader(v2);

  Triangle transformed_tri = {triangle.x0, triangle.y0, triangle.x1, triangle.y1, triangle.x2, triangle.y2, outv0.depth, outv1.depth, outv2.depth };
  for(int y = 0; y < screenHeight; ++y){
    for(int x = 0; x < screenWidth; ++x){
      Output pixelOut = pixelShader(transformed_tri, x, y);
        int buffer_index = y*screenWidth+x;
      if(pixelOut.depth > -FLT_MAX && pixelOut.depth < depthBuffer[buffer_index])
      {
        depthBuffer[buffer_index] = pixelOut.depth;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*Commentary:* This example shows how rasterization might be performed using an extremely inefficient software emulation of a shader. The pixelShader essentially replicates the rasterizer's pixel test but executes it for *every* pixel in the image. Each pixel is processed independently, and depth testing is done only *after* per-pixel raster check. A real fragment shader would not be used to do this kind of broad check as it is not its purpose. The vertex shader and pixel shader here are extremely simplistic.

**Example 3: A Conceptual Early-Z Optimization (Illustrative)**

```c++
bool earlyZCull(const Triangle& tri, float pixel_x, float pixel_y, const float* depthBuffer, int screenWidth)
{
  if (insideTriangle(tri, pixel_x, pixel_y))
  {
    float alpha = 0.333; //simplistic barycentric coords
     float interpolatedZ = tri.z0 * alpha + tri.z1*alpha + tri.z2*alpha;

     int buffer_index = static_cast<int>(pixel_y) * screenWidth + static_cast<int>(pixel_x);
     if (interpolatedZ >= depthBuffer[buffer_index])
     {
       return true; //Pixel is occluded. Don't need to shade
     }
  }
  return false; // no occlusion or pixel is outside triangle
}
//Simulated Raster process with Z-culling
void shaderBasedRasterizeEarlyZ(const Triangle& triangle, int screenWidth, int screenHeight, float* depthBuffer){
  //Simplified Vertex shader processing:
    Vertex v0 = {triangle.x0, triangle.y0, triangle.z0};
    Vertex v1 = {triangle.x1, triangle.y1, triangle.z1};
    Vertex v2 = {triangle.x2, triangle.y2, triangle.z2};

  Output outv0 = vertexShader(v0);
  Output outv1 = vertexShader(v1);
  Output outv2 = vertexShader(v2);

  Triangle transformed_tri = {triangle.x0, triangle.y0, triangle.x1, triangle.y1, triangle.x2, triangle.y2, outv0.depth, outv1.depth, outv2.depth };
  for(int y = 0; y < screenHeight; ++y){
    for(int x = 0; x < screenWidth; ++x){
      if (!earlyZCull(transformed_tri, x, y, depthBuffer, screenWidth))
      {
         Output pixelOut = pixelShader(transformed_tri, x, y);
         int buffer_index = y*screenWidth+x;
      if(pixelOut.depth > -FLT_MAX)
        {
            depthBuffer[buffer_index] = pixelOut.depth;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*Commentary:* This code adds a basic "early-Z" test before the "shader" is called. While this still doesn't capture the true hardware efficiency of an actual rasterizer, it highlights how a rasterizer can potentially discard fragments earlier and achieve speedups through depth culling. A real early-Z pass is done before the fragments are generated using much more optimized hardware and data structures like Hi-Z.

For further understanding, I recommend delving into resources on graphics hardware architecture, particularly focusing on the fixed-function units of a GPU. Explore materials detailing triangle setup, edge equation computations, and hardware depth buffer optimization techniques. Articles explaining the graphics pipeline, specifically the fixed-function stages, will also provide insights. Also investigate techniques such as hierarchical depth buffer and early Z-culling mechanisms, as these directly contribute to the performance disparity. While delving into specific GPU architectures is highly technical, understanding the general concepts of fixed-function versus programmable units will give you a strong grasp of the topic.
