TensorFlow 2.0's reliance on eager execution significantly alters the approach to updating variable slices compared to earlier versions.  Directly modifying a portion of a variable without creating a new tensor is crucial for performance, especially in scenarios involving large models and frequent updates.  My experience optimizing recurrent neural network training highlights the importance of this nuanced understanding.  Inefficient slice updates often lead to performance bottlenecks, especially during gradient descent iterations.  This stems from the creation and subsequent disposal of intermediate tensors.

The core principle lies in leveraging TensorFlow's built-in functionalities for scatter updates, specifically `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`.  This function allows for updating specific indices of a tensor without needing to reconstruct the entire variable. This avoids the significant overhead associated with creating a new tensor, copying data, and then assigning it back to the variable.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow variables are essentially wrappers around tensors. While it might seem intuitive to directly index and assign new values to a slice of a variable, this often leads to unintended consequences.  TensorFlow's automatic differentiation and gradient calculations rely on maintaining a computational graph.  Direct indexing and assignment outside of the graph often breaks this dependency tracking, resulting in incorrect gradient computations or, worse, runtime errors.

Instead, `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` provides a mechanism to specify which indices to update and their corresponding new values. The function takes three arguments:

* **tensor:** The target tensor (TensorFlow variable) to be updated.
* **indices:** A tensor of indices specifying the locations to update. This tensor must have a shape of `[N, M]`, where N is the number of updates and M is the number of dimensions in the tensor.  The indices should be specified relative to the variable's shape.
* **updates:** A tensor containing the new values to be assigned at the specified indices. This tensor must have a shape of `[N, ...]`, where `...` represents the dimensions after the first dimension (which aligns with the number of indices).

The function returns a *new* tensor with the updated values. To apply this update to the variable, it's crucial to perform an assignment operation using the assignment operator specific to TensorFlow variables.  This ensures TensorFlow's internal mechanisms remain consistent and the update is correctly tracked within the graph.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Updating a single element in a 1D tensor:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initialize a TensorFlow variable
my_var = tf.Variable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Update the third element (index 2) to 10
updated_var = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(my_var, [[2]], [10])

# Assign the updated tensor back to the variable
my_var.assign(updated_var)

print(my_var)  # Output: <tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=(5,) dtype=int32, numpy=array([ 1,  2, 10,  4,  5], dtype=int32)>
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward update.  We directly provide the index and the new value.  The `assign` method ensures the change is reflected in the variable.


**Example 2: Updating multiple elements in a 2D tensor:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initialize a 2D TensorFlow variable
my_var = tf.Variable([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])

# Update multiple elements
indices = [[0, 1], [2, 0]]  # Update (0,1) and (2,0)
updates = [10, 20]

updated_var = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(my_var, indices, updates)
my_var.assign(updated_var)

print(my_var) # Output: <tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=(3, 2) dtype=int32, numpy=array([[ 1, 10], [ 3,  4], [20,  6]], dtype=int32)>
```

This showcases the flexibility of updating multiple indices simultaneously.  The `indices` tensor specifies the row and column for each update.


**Example 3:  Handling a more complex scenario with broadcasting:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initialize a 3D TensorFlow variable
my_var = tf.Variable([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])

# Update a slice using broadcasting
indices = [[0, 1, 0]] # Update (0,1,0)
updates = [[100]]

updated_var = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(my_var, indices, updates)
my_var.assign(updated_var)

print(my_var) # Output: <tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=(2, 2, 2) dtype=int32, numpy=array([[[  1,   2], [100,   4]], [[  5,   6], [  7,   8]]], dtype=int32)>
```

This example demonstrates how broadcasting works within `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`.  The single value in `updates` is automatically broadcast to match the dimensions specified by the index.  Careful consideration of broadcasting rules is crucial for avoiding unexpected behavior.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on variable manipulation is a vital resource. Thoroughly understanding the nuances of TensorFlow's variable assignment mechanisms and eager execution is critical. Consulting advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on custom training loops and gradient calculations will provide further insight into efficient variable updates within complex models.  Finally, exploring the source code of established TensorFlow projects can offer practical examples of optimal practices.  These combined resources provide a comprehensive understanding of effective variable handling in TensorFlow 2.0.
