Achieving true reproducibility in TensorFlow, especially when utilizing GPUs, presents a nuanced challenge beyond simply setting random seeds. The non-deterministic nature of GPU operations, often stemming from parallel processing and the specific cuDNN implementation, necessitates careful consideration and implementation of several strategies. My experience developing deep learning models for medical image analysis has reinforced this, where inconsistent results can have significant implications.

The core issue is that TensorFlow's eager execution, while making debugging simpler, doesn't inherently guarantee identical computations across different runs, even with fixed seeds. Operations like convolution, matrix multiplication, and pooling, heavily used in neural networks, can exhibit variability on GPUs due to the way threads are scheduled and how floating-point operations are handled at a low level. Furthermore, CUDA and cuDNN, the libraries TensorFlow leverages for GPU acceleration, themselves have versions and configurations that contribute to result variations.

To address this, we must control as many factors as possible. Setting random seeds for TensorFlow, NumPy, and Python's built-in random module is a fundamental first step. However, this only affects the initial values and some operations that specifically rely on random generation, like initialization of weight matrices or augmentation routines. Seed setting alone does not resolve the deterministic nature issues within the GPU-accelerated parts of the graph.

Specifically, the issue stems from the parallel execution of operations. For instance, when performing a summation of values on a GPU, the specific ordering in which partial results are combined can vary between runs, and this ordering can subtly impact final results due to the nature of how floating-point numbers are represented and computed. This variation is especially pronounced on high precision floating point operations. These operations will not behave deterministically across all hardware without explicit constraints. Additionally, if a kernel has non-deterministic logic in the implementation, this may lead to discrepancies even on same hardware.

To enforce determinism, we need to instruct TensorFlow to avoid algorithms that inherently rely on non-deterministic behavior, such as cuDNN's default convolutional routines, which often use non-deterministic algorithms for optimization. This involves configuring TensorFlow to prefer deterministic algorithms. Further complicating matters is the fact that cuDNN itself has different versions, and its algorithms for the same operations can change, introducing another layer of inconsistency. We must ensure the same cuDNN version is installed and active during execution.

Here are three code examples demonstrating effective strategies, drawn from my past project experiences:

**Example 1: Core Seed Setting and Deterministic Operations**

```python
import os
import random
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Set environment variables to force deterministic behavior
os.environ['TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS'] = '1'
os.environ['TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC'] = '1'

# Set Python, NumPy, and TensorFlow seeds
seed_value = 42
random.seed(seed_value)
np.random.seed(seed_value)
tf.random.set_seed(seed_value)

# Function to demonstrate a simple operation
def simple_computation(inputs):
  weights = tf.random.normal(shape=inputs.shape[-1:])
  return tf.matmul(inputs, tf.reshape(weights, [-1, 1]))

# Create a sample tensor and run computation
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 5))
result1 = simple_computation(input_tensor)
result2 = simple_computation(input_tensor)

# Output results to demonstrate identical behavior
print(f"Result 1: {result1}")
print(f"Result 2: {result2}")
# Expected: Result 1 and Result 2 will be identical if determinism is enforced.

# Verify Determinism by comparing results
are_identical = tf.reduce_all(result1==result2)
print(f"Are Results identical: {are_identical}") # Expected True
```

This code begins by setting environment variables, `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` and `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. The first forces TensorFlow to use deterministic operations wherever possible. The second specifically requests cuDNN to use deterministic algorithms when available, and will throw an error when a non-deterministic approach must be used. Then we set the random seeds for Python, NumPy, and TensorFlow to initialize the random number generators in a fixed state. We then create sample data and calculate the same output with the exact same inputs using deterministic operations and compare the results. Running the code will produce the same result every time the script is run.

**Example 2: Deterministic Convolutions**

```python
import os
import random
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Set environment variables to force deterministic behavior
os.environ['TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS'] = '1'
os.environ['TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC'] = '1'

# Set Python, NumPy, and TensorFlow seeds
seed_value = 42
random.seed(seed_value)
np.random.seed(seed_value)
tf.random.set_seed(seed_value)

# Function to demonstrate a convolutional operation
def convolutional_computation(inputs):
    filters = tf.random.normal(shape=(3, 3, inputs.shape[-1], 16))
    conv = tf.nn.conv2d(inputs, filters, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')
    return conv

# Generate a sample 4D tensor and test the function
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 28, 28, 3))
result1 = convolutional_computation(input_tensor)
result2 = convolutional_computation(input_tensor)

# Output results to demonstrate identical behavior
print(f"Result 1: {result1}")
print(f"Result 2: {result2}")
# Expected: Result 1 and Result 2 will be identical if determinism is enforced.

# Verify Determinism by comparing results
are_identical = tf.reduce_all(result1==result2)
print(f"Are Results identical: {are_identical}") # Expected True
```

Here, the code introduces convolution. Again, we begin with the core seed settings. We then define a convolution function with randomly generated filters, and perform the convolution on the same sample input twice. If determinism is properly enforced, both runs will result in the same output. It is crucial to recognize that while we have set environment variables and seeds, not all convolutional operations are deterministic even when `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC=1` is set. Therefore, the convolution operation must be deterministic by design; in other words, we must choose the correct implementations of convolution that are deterministic.

**Example 3: Control for Hardware and Software Versions**

```python
import os
import random
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Set environment variables to force deterministic behavior
os.environ['TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS'] = '1'
os.environ['TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC'] = '1'


# Set Python, NumPy, and TensorFlow seeds
seed_value = 42
random.seed(seed_value)
np.random.seed(seed_value)
tf.random.set_seed(seed_value)


# Check and print system information for reproducibility
print(f"TensorFlow Version: {tf.__version__}")
print(f"NumPy Version: {np.__version__}")
print(f"CUDA Version: (Inspect in terminal: `nvcc --version`)")
print(f"cuDNN Version: (Inspect in terminal or in TensorFlow logs)")
print(f"Python Version: (Inspect in terminal: `python --version`)")
print(f"Operating System: (Inspect OS Settings)")
print(f"GPU Device Information: (Inspect in terminal: `nvidia-smi`)")

# Function to demonstrate a simple operation
def simple_computation(inputs):
  weights = tf.random.normal(shape=inputs.shape[-1:])
  return tf.matmul(inputs, tf.reshape(weights, [-1, 1]))

# Create a sample tensor and run computation
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 5))
result1 = simple_computation(input_tensor)
result2 = simple_computation(input_tensor)

# Output results to demonstrate identical behavior
print(f"Result 1: {result1}")
print(f"Result 2: {result2}")

# Verify Determinism by comparing results
are_identical = tf.reduce_all(result1==result2)
print(f"Are Results identical: {are_identical}") # Expected True

```

This code emphasizes the importance of tracking your environment. I have included code to display relevant information, including the used version of Tensorflow, Numpy, CUDA, and cuDNN. By storing this information in your experiments, you have better insights into discrepancies that arise. In addition, it is important to use specific docker containers to enforce consistency in your execution environment. Note that while this sample shows an operation that can be made deterministic, tracking versions is important even when using non-deterministic operations, so the nature of any result differences can be investigated.

To summarize, achieving deterministic behavior on GPUs requires several combined steps. Setting random seeds, ensuring the same environment (including libraries), controlling for the deterministic operations of cuDNN and TF, and careful bookkeeping of all changes made. It's not merely a matter of setting one magic flag, but rather a collection of best practices.

I recommend reviewing TensorFlow documentation on reproducibility, and referring to articles on deterministic GPU behavior for a deeper dive into the nuances. Also the release notes for each of the libraries used for the experiment should be reviewed to see if behavior has changed. Finally, experimentation, meticulous logging and testing will assist to uncover any unexpected discrepancies.
