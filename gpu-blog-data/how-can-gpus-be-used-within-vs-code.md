GPU acceleration within VS Code containers, while powerful, requires a careful interplay between the container’s environment, the host system's hardware, and VS Code's remote development capabilities. Fundamentally, the container runtime needs explicit instruction to access the host’s GPU resources. This isn’t automatic, and failure to configure this correctly will result in the container only utilizing the CPU, nullifying the performance gains sought through GPU use. This process deviates from typical CPU-bound containers.

The core issue lies in how container runtimes isolate resources. By default, containers operate within their own namespaces, preventing direct hardware access. To expose the GPU, the container needs to mount the appropriate device files and load the necessary drivers. This is a multi-step process that needs to occur both during container image creation and the container runtime process itself. Furthermore, VS Code’s remote extension connects to the container over a network interface, necessitating that the container be set up correctly before connection.

The most common approach involves leveraging the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, or a similar toolkit for other GPU vendors like AMD. These toolkits simplify the process of integrating GPU support into container workflows. They provide runtime modifications and utilities to handle the mounting of device files, driver installation within the container (though best practice is to avoid driver installation), and communication with the host system’s GPU. The following examples will predominantly use NVIDIA’s toolkit. While other vendors possess similar tools, their implementation details may differ.

**Code Example 1: Dockerfile for a GPU-enabled Container**

```dockerfile
FROM nvidia/cuda:12.2.2-base-ubuntu22.04

# Install any needed libraries. Here a basic python environment
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
RUN pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the necessary application files to the container.
COPY . .

# Install the base requirements for any user scripts
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Set the command to run by default
CMD ["python3", "your_script.py"]
```

**Commentary:** This `Dockerfile` provides the base image necessary for GPU utilization. It starts from an `nvidia/cuda` base image. These images, maintained by NVIDIA, contain the libraries and utilities for CUDA interaction. Notably, this step does not install the host drivers within the image. Instead, it prepares a minimal environment for the code. The image version `12.2.2-base-ubuntu22.04` indicates CUDA version 12.2.2 using a base of Ubuntu 22.04. It installs python3, pip3, and basic torch/vision/audio for a deep learning workload for demonstration. The working directory is established as `/app`. Copying the application and installing base requirements is a normal step for container build. The final CMD command represents the startup entry point of the container when executed. The user will have to replace "your\_script.py" with the actual script and make sure requirements.txt is also prepared as a file.

**Code Example 2: `devcontainer.json` for VS Code**

```json
{
	"name": "GPU Enabled Container",
	"image": "my_gpu_image:latest",
	"remoteUser": "vscode",
	"runArgs": [
        "--gpus", "all",
        "--ulimit", "memlock=-1",
		"--ulimit", "stack=67108864"
    ],
    "settings": {
    	"python.pythonPath": "/usr/bin/python3",
		"terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
    },
    "extensions": [
        "ms-python.python",
        "ms-toolsai.jupyter"
    ]
}
```

**Commentary:** This `devcontainer.json` file configures VS Code's remote development environment to use the GPU-enabled container. The `name` attribute specifies the display name of the environment. The `image` attribute references the docker image, here `my_gpu_image:latest`, which is the image created from the `Dockerfile` example (assuming you tag it as `my_gpu_image:latest`). The `remoteUser` attribute sets the user within the container context for remote connection, usually `vscode`. The `runArgs` array includes critical arguments. The `--gpus all` argument instructs Docker to expose all available GPUs on the host to the container. `--ulimit memlock=-1` and `--ulimit stack=67108864` adjusts the container's resource limits, often required for deep learning frameworks, preventing out-of-memory errors. The `settings` object configures python path and terminal shell. Finally `extensions` are used to define the extensions that will automatically be installed in the container environment, in this case Python and Jupyter.

**Code Example 3: Verifying GPU Access within the Container**

```python
import torch
import os

def check_gpu():
    print(f"CUDA is available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        print(f"Device name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
        print(f"Number of CUDA devices: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
    else:
        print("CUDA device not available.")
    print(f"Environment variables related to CUDA: {os.environ.get('CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES')}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_gpu()
```

**Commentary:** This python script uses the `torch` library to check for GPU availability inside the container. `torch.cuda.is_available()` will return true if CUDA is correctly configured. If true, the device name and the number of CUDA devices are printed, which corresponds to the host’s GPU. The environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` can also provide additional information concerning the utilization of devices. Running this simple script within the container, after establishing the remote connection through VS Code, will either confirm or deny successful GPU access.  This script should be saved as `your_script.py` and placed in the same directory as the `requirements.txt` file containing at least `torch torchvision torchaudio`.

Troubleshooting GPU access involves carefully verifying that the installed driver on the host machine is compatible with the CUDA version used in the base image, and verifying that the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is installed on the host. The `nvidia-smi` command on the host system will confirm that NVIDIA drivers are installed and functional.

Further considerations include that the Docker image size may increase due to the inclusion of the CUDA base image. Using multi-stage builds can mitigate this to an extent. Network and storage I/O can sometimes become bottlenecks in GPU-accelerated workflows. Optimizing data loading and transfer mechanisms can improve end-to-end performance. Finally, the container’s resource limits should be set appropriately to avoid GPU memory exhaustion.  For instance, if multiple containers or processes attempt to access the same GPU simultaneously, one may encounter resource-related errors.

In summary, GPU usage within VS Code containers is enabled through a combination of careful container image creation using vendor-provided base images, correct runtime configurations that map the host’s GPU, and a verification stage inside the container using tools like PyTorch. While complexity exists in ensuring a proper link, the effort delivers significant computational gains in deep learning and other high-performance computing tasks.  For further research, resources from NVIDIA's official documentation on the Container Toolkit and similar resources for other GPU vendors would be advisable. Documentation concerning `devcontainer.json` from Microsoft is also a recommended resource. Reading forums related to deep learning and containerization may also provide specific solutions for niche cases.
