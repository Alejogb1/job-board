The core challenge in altering the device of a PyTorch model lies not in a single function call, but in the comprehensive relocation of all model parameters, buffers, and potentially associated optimizer states.  During my years developing large-scale NLP models, I've encountered this repeatedly, and a naive approach often leads to subtle, hard-to-debug errors.  The solution necessitates a systematic approach ensuring every tensor within the model's structure is transferred correctly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch leverages CUDA for GPU acceleration.  Model devices are implicitly defined during tensor creation.  Moving a model means transferring all its constituent tensors—weights, biases, gradients (if applicable), and any other buffers—from the CPU (default) or one GPU to another GPU, or back to the CPU.  Simply assigning the model to a device using `.to()` is insufficient if the model's submodules aren't also correctly handled. Recursively traversing the model's architecture and applying `.to()` to each parameter and buffer is necessary for a complete transfer.  This becomes particularly crucial when dealing with complex architectures encompassing numerous nested modules and custom layers.  Furthermore, if you are using an optimizer, you must also move the optimizer's state to the new device. Failure to do so will result in computations continuing on the original device, leading to mismatched data locations and runtime errors.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Model Transfer:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

model = SimpleModel()
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Correct method: Iterates through all parameters and buffers
for param in model.parameters():
    param.data = param.data.to(device)
for buffer in model.buffers():
    buffer.data = buffer.data.to(device)
model.to(device)


# Incorrect method (Illustrative):  Only the top-level model is moved.  Submodules remain on the original device.
# model = model.to(device) # This is insufficient!

# Verify the transfer
print(next(model.parameters()).device)
```

This example demonstrates the correct procedure.  The loop iterates through the model's parameters and buffers, explicitly transferring each tensor to the designated device.  The final `model.to(device)` call is included for completeness; it handles the model's overall device attribute, but the crucial step is the parameter and buffer transfers. The commented-out line highlights the insufficient approach that leaves submodules on the original device.

**Example 2: Model with Optimizer Transfer:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... (SimpleModel definition from Example 1) ...

model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Correct method: Move model and optimizer state
model.to(device)
for state in optimizer.state.values():
    for k, v in state.items():
        if torch.is_tensor(v):
            state[k] = v.to(device)

# Verify transfer
print(next(model.parameters()).device)
print(next(iter(optimizer.state.values()))['momentum_buffer'].device) #Example optimizer state element
```

This example extends the process to include an optimizer.  The optimizer's state dictionary must also be moved to avoid conflicts.  The nested loops iterate through the optimizer's internal state and transfer all tensors found within.  Failure to perform this step leads to errors during backpropagation.

**Example 3:  Handling Custom Modules:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(5, 5))
        self.buffer = torch.randn(5, 5)


    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.mm(x, self.weight)


class ComplexModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ComplexModel, self).__init__()
        self.custom = CustomLayer()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.custom(x)
        return self.linear(x)


model = ComplexModel()
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Correct method for complex architecture with custom layers
model.to(device) # This is sufficient for models with properly defined parameters and buffers.

# Verification (illustrative)
print(model.custom.weight.device)
print(model.linear.weight.device)

```

This example underscores the importance of correct parameter and buffer declaration within custom modules. If the custom layers are defined correctly as `nn.Module` subclasses and their parameters and buffers are properly registered, the `model.to(device)` call is sufficient to transfer the entire model, including custom components.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation itself is your primary resource.  Pay close attention to the sections on `nn.Module`, tensor manipulation, and the specific optimizers you employ.  Furthermore, consulting relevant chapters of introductory and advanced deep learning texts focusing on PyTorch will provide deeper contextual understanding.  Thorough testing and debugging, including verifying tensor locations at each step, are critical for assuring a correct implementation.  Finally, familiarize yourself with PyTorch's debugging tools to pinpoint issues quickly and efficiently.
