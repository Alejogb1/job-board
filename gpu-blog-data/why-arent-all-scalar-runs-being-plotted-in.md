TensorBoard's scalar plotting functionality hinges on the correct structuring and logging of scalar data within your TensorFlow or Keras training process.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous projects, ranging from simple regression models to complex GAN architectures, points to a consistent underlying cause: inconsistent or improperly formatted logging calls.  While TensorBoard itself is robust, the onus of supplying correctly formatted data lies entirely with the user.  Failure to adhere to these requirements inevitably leads to incomplete visualizations.

1. **Clear Explanation:**  TensorBoard's scalar visualization relies on the `tf.summary.scalar()` function (or its Keras equivalent) to record scalar values during training.  These functions expect a specific format: a tag (a descriptive string identifying the scalar value), the value itself (a single numerical value), and a global step (an integer representing the training iteration).  If any of these components are missing, incorrectly typed, or inconsistently provided, TensorBoard will either fail to plot the data or, more subtly, only plot a subset of your runs.  This incomplete plotting is frequently observed when dealing with multiple training runs, where some runs might have logging errors while others execute flawlessly.  The lack of complete data often leads to misinterpretations of training progress and model performance, hindering effective analysis and model tuning.

Moreover, the problem can manifest differently depending on the environment and logging frequency.  In distributed training scenarios, inconsistencies in logging across worker nodes can lead to missing data points. Similarly, infrequent or sporadic logging can result in an incomplete representation of the scalar values throughout the training process.  Finally, issues with the TensorBoard server itself or improper configuration of the logging directory can further complicate the problem.  Therefore, a systematic approach to investigating the problem is crucial.  It's essential to examine both the logging code and the TensorBoard configuration to pinpoint the root cause.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Scalar Logging**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your model definition and training loop ...

# Assuming 'loss' and 'accuracy' are your scalar metrics
with tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/my_run') as writer:
  for step, (x, y) in enumerate(training_dataset):
    # ... your training step ...
    loss, accuracy = calculate_loss_and_accuracy(model, x, y)
    with writer.as_default():
      tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=step)
      tf.summary.scalar('accuracy', accuracy, step=step)
```

This example demonstrates the correct usage of `tf.summary.scalar()`.  A file writer is created to specify the log directory.  Crucially, both the scalar value (`loss`, `accuracy`) and the global step (`step`) are provided for every training iteration.  The `with writer.as_default():` context ensures the summary is written to the correct location.


**Example 2: Incorrect Step Handling (Potential Source of Missing Data)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your model definition and training loop ...

with tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/my_run') as writer:
  step = 0  # Incorrect: Step is not incremented correctly
  for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in training_dataset:
      # ... your training step ...
      loss, accuracy = calculate_loss_and_accuracy(model, batch[0], batch[1])
      with writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=step) # step remains 0 for every batch
        tf.summary.scalar('accuracy', accuracy, step=step)
```

This example is flawed because the `step` variable isn't correctly incremented. This results in all scalar values being written with the same step, causing TensorBoard to only plot a single data point for each scalar, effectively overwriting previous values.  The correct approach involves incrementing `step` with every iteration within the training loop.


**Example 3:  Missing or Inconsistent Logging**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your model definition and training loop ...

with tf.summary.create_file_writer('logs/my_run') as writer:
  for step, (x, y) in enumerate(training_dataset):
    # ... your training step ...
    loss, accuracy = calculate_loss_and_accuracy(model, x, y)
    if step % 10 == 0: # Conditional logging
      with writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=step)

```

In this example, logging is conditional.  Only every tenth step is logged. While not necessarily incorrect, it leads to a sparser representation of the data, potentially masking trends.  This can be problematic if the infrequent sampling doesnâ€™t accurately capture the behavior of the scalar throughout the training process.  While this might be acceptable in certain situations (for instance, to reduce logging overhead), it's essential to be aware that it can lead to incomplete visualizations.



3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guidance on using TensorBoard and the summary API.  Thoroughly reviewing this documentation will clarify the intricacies of logging scalars correctly.  Additionally, studying example projects and notebooks that demonstrate effective TensorBoard usage can prove invaluable.  Understanding the structure of the log directories generated by TensorFlow is essential for debugging.  Finally, utilizing a robust debugging workflow, involving careful examination of logs and intermediate data, can greatly aid in identifying issues like inconsistent scalar logging.  Leveraging logging statements strategically in your training script can significantly improve the ability to debug logging problems.  Carefully analyzing the output of your training script will reveal where and how summaries are written.
