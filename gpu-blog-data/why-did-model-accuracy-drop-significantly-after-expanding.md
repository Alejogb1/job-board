The most probable cause for a significant drop in model accuracy following dataset expansion and cleaning is the introduction of noise or bias, despite the improved size.  My experience working on large-scale sentiment analysis projects has repeatedly highlighted this issue.  While a larger dataset intuitively suggests better performance, the quality of the additional data trumps its quantity.  Careful analysis of the expanded dataset is paramount; inadequately processed or inherently flawed data can readily overwhelm the positive contributions of increased samples.

**1. Explanation:**

Increased model accuracy with larger datasets is predicated on the assumption that the added data conforms to the existing data distribution and enhances the signal-to-noise ratio.  Expanding the dataset introduces the risk of violating this assumption. Several factors contribute to this accuracy drop:

* **Concept Drift:** The expanded dataset might contain data representing a different distribution than the original dataset. This is common when the data source changes or the underlying phenomenon being modeled evolves over time. For instance, sentiment expressed towards a particular product might shift due to a marketing campaign or negative press coverage.  If the original training data reflected one period and the expanded data another, the model's performance on unseen data, representative of the newer distribution, will degrade.

* **Noisy Data:** The cleaning process, while intended to improve data quality, can inadvertently introduce noise.  Errors in data annotation or inconsistent labeling during the expansion phase can negatively impact model training. A simple example is mislabeling positive sentiment as negative.  Even subtle inconsistencies in labeling can significantly impact the model's learning process, potentially leading to inaccurate weights and biases.

* **Class Imbalance Exacerbation:** Dataset expansion may unintentionally exacerbate existing class imbalances.  If the additional data disproportionately favors a specific class, the model might become biased toward that class, compromising its ability to generalize to under-represented classes.  In binary classification, for example, an excessive increase in one class might cause the model to predict that class with high confidence, even when incorrect.

* **Data Leakage:** In the process of expanding and cleaning, sensitive information might be inadvertently introduced, leading to data leakage. This refers to the inclusion of information in the training set that would not be available during the real-world deployment of the model.  For example, including a future timestamp or a variable indirectly correlated with the target variable can lead to overly optimistic performance on training data but severely degraded performance on unseen data.

Addressing these issues requires careful examination of the data at different stages. Visual inspection of data distributions, statistical analysis to identify biases, and robust validation techniques are crucial for preventing or mitigating this performance degradation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following code examples illustrate potential approaches to identifying and mitigating problems after dataset expansion.  These are implemented in Python using scikit-learn, a library I've consistently found invaluable for such tasks.

**Example 1: Detecting Concept Drift using K-Means Clustering:**

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Assume 'original_data' and 'expanded_data' are pandas DataFrames
combined_data = pd.concat([original_data, expanded_data])

# Feature scaling for K-Means
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(combined_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1))

# K-Means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(scaled_data)
labels = kmeans.labels_

# Analyze cluster distribution in original and expanded data
original_labels = labels[:len(original_data)]
expanded_labels = labels[len(original_data):]
print("Original Data Cluster Distribution:", pd.Series(original_labels).value_counts())
print("Expanded Data Cluster Distribution:", pd.Series(expanded_labels).value_counts())

# Significant difference in cluster distribution suggests concept drift.
```

This code first combines the original and expanded datasets.  Then, it utilizes K-Means clustering to identify potential groupings within the data based on its features.  Disparities in the cluster distribution between the original and expanded datasets suggest potential concept drift.

**Example 2: Identifying Noisy Data using Isolation Forest:**

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Assume 'expanded_data' is a pandas DataFrame
model = IsolationForest(contamination='auto', random_state=42)  # 'auto' estimates contamination
model.fit(expanded_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1))
predictions = model.predict(expanded_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1))

# Identify outliers (-1 indicates anomaly)
outliers = expanded_data[predictions == -1]
print("Number of identified outliers:", len(outliers))
# Further investigation of outliers is required.
```

This example uses Isolation Forest, an anomaly detection algorithm, to identify potential outliers or noisy data points within the expanded dataset.  Outliers are then flagged for further investigation and potential removal.

**Example 3: Addressing Class Imbalance using SMOTE:**

```python
import pandas as pd
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Assume 'expanded_data' is a pandas DataFrame, 'X' is features, 'y' is target
X = expanded_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
y = expanded_data['target_variable']

# Apply SMOTE to oversample the minority class
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)

# Create a new balanced dataset
balanced_data = pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(X_resampled), pd.DataFrame(y_resampled)], axis=1)
```

This code demonstrates the use of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance in the expanded dataset.  SMOTE synthetically generates new samples for the minority class, balancing the class distribution and potentially improving model performance.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   Comprehensive texts on machine learning and data mining.
*   Advanced statistical analysis textbooks focusing on hypothesis testing and distribution analysis.
*   Books and articles specifically addressing issues of bias and fairness in machine learning.
*   Documentation for popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
*   Research papers on anomaly detection and data cleaning techniques.


By meticulously analyzing the expanded dataset for the aforementioned issues and employing appropriate data preprocessing and model selection techniques, the accuracy drop can often be reversed or at least significantly mitigated.  The key is to prioritize data quality over sheer volume.  A well-cleaned and representative subset is often superior to a larger, noisy dataset.
