TensorFlow/Keras GPU utilization issues frequently stem from a mismatch between model architecture, data pipeline design, and hardware capabilities.  In my experience troubleshooting hundreds of such instances, the problem rarely originates from a single, easily identifiable culprit. It usually involves a complex interplay of factors, often hidden within seemingly innocuous parts of the code.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

GPU acceleration in TensorFlow/Keras relies on several interdependent components. First, the model itself must be compatible with CUDA and cuDNN.  These libraries enable TensorFlow to leverage NVIDIA GPUs.  Secondly, the data feeding the model needs to be efficiently preprocessed and batched to minimize data transfer bottlenecks.  Thirdly, the TensorFlow installation must be correctly configured to identify and utilize the available GPU.  Finally, the model's architecture might inadvertently constrain GPU utilization – certain architectures inherently map poorly onto parallel processing structures.  Issues can arise in any of these stages.

Improper data handling is a common source of GPU underutilization.  For example, insufficient batch size can lead to idle GPU cores waiting for data, resulting in low GPU occupancy. Similarly, if data preprocessing is performed on the CPU, this can create a significant bottleneck, negating any GPU acceleration benefits.  Furthermore, memory limitations on the GPU can also severely impact performance.  A model that requires more GPU memory than is available will either fail completely or will resort to slow CPU computation, rendering the GPU largely unused.  Finally,  incorrectly configured TensorFlow installations or driver issues often cause problems.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Insufficient Batch Size:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect batch size leading to low GPU utilization
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Batch size is too small, leading to poor GPU utilization
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=1, verbose=1)
```

**Commentary:** A batch size of 1 means each data sample is processed individually.  This dramatically reduces parallel processing opportunities on the GPU, leading to low occupancy.  A larger batch size, optimally tuned to the GPU's memory capacity, is necessary for effective utilization.  Experimenting with batch sizes (e.g., 32, 64, 128, 256) is crucial for optimization.

**Example 2: CPU-Bound Preprocessing:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# CPU-bound preprocessing step
def preprocess_data(data):
    for i in range(len(data)):
        data[i] = np.sqrt(data[i])  # Example computationally expensive operation
    return data

# ... (model definition remains the same as in Example 1)

x_train_preprocessed = preprocess_data(x_train) #Preprocessing on CPU before feeding to GPU

model.fit(x_train_preprocessed, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=1)
```

**Commentary:** This example showcases how computationally expensive preprocessing performed on the CPU creates a bottleneck. The `preprocess_data` function, while simple here, could represent complex image augmentation or feature engineering.  To resolve this, the preprocessing should be incorporated into the TensorFlow data pipeline using `tf.data.Dataset`. This allows for parallel data augmentation and preprocessing on the GPU, significantly improving efficiency.


**Example 3:  Memory Exhaustion:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Model with excessive parameters, potentially exceeding GPU memory
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=1)
```

**Commentary:**  This model has a large number of parameters.  If the GPU's memory is insufficient to hold the model weights, activations, and gradients, it will result in either an out-of-memory error or slow performance due to excessive swapping between GPU and CPU memory.  To address this, consider reducing the model's size (e.g., using fewer layers or smaller layer sizes), using techniques like model pruning or quantization, or employing mixed precision training (fp16).


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guidance on GPU setup, configuration, and troubleshooting.  Understanding the intricacies of CUDA and cuDNN is essential for advanced optimization.  Familiarize yourself with profiling tools like NVIDIA Nsight Systems and TensorBoard to identify performance bottlenecks within your code.  Consider exploring techniques like mixed precision training and tensor cores for improved GPU utilization efficiency.  Finally,  thoroughly investigate and understand your specific GPU’s memory capacity and compute capabilities to avoid exceeding its limitations.  Efficient data handling through the use of `tf.data` is paramount.   Reviewing literature on efficient deep learning model architectures for your specific task can also provide substantial performance gains.
