Direct transfer of an EMA's state between TensorFlow custom model instances isn't directly supported through standard TensorFlow mechanisms.  The challenge lies in the fact that the EMA is not a model parameter in the conventional sense; it's a separate, dynamically updated variable tracking the exponential average of model weights.  My experience working on high-frequency trading models, where efficient parameter transfer is critical, highlighted this limitation. I've had to engineer solutions involving explicit handling of the EMA's internal state.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue stems from TensorFlow's object-oriented structure. Each `tf.keras.Model` instance maintains its own internal state, including its weights and optimizers.  An EMA, usually implemented using a separate variable (often a shadow copy of the model's weights), is not automatically managed by the model itself.  Therefore, simply copying the model's weights will not transfer the EMA. You must explicitly manage the EMA variable and its transfer separately.  This involves creating a mechanism to track and transfer the EMA's running average alongside the model's weights.  This is typically achieved through custom training loops or by creating a wrapper class to manage both the model and its associated EMA.

Several approaches exist, but the most reliable centers around manually saving and loading the EMA's weights.  This requires creating the EMA variable outside the modelâ€™s structure, ensuring consistent initialization between instances, and directly transferring its values during the transfer process.  The difficulty scales with the complexity of your model architecture, particularly when dealing with multiple EMA instances (e.g., for different parts of a model).

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic EMA Implementation and Transfer:**

This example demonstrates a simple EMA implementation and its transfer between two model instances using a custom training loop.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class EMAModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, base_model, decay=0.99):
        super().__init__()
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.decay = decay
        self.ema = {}
        self.shadow_weights = {}
        self.initialize_ema()

    def initialize_ema(self):
        for var in self.base_model.trainable_variables:
            self.ema[var.name] = tf.Variable(tf.zeros_like(var), trainable=False)
            self.shadow_weights[var.name] = tf.Variable(var, trainable=False)

    def update_ema(self, weights):
        for var in self.base_model.trainable_variables:
          self.ema[var.name].assign(self.decay * self.ema[var.name] + (1-self.decay)*weights[var.name])
          self.shadow_weights[var.name].assign(weights[var.name])

    def call(self, inputs):
      return self.base_model(inputs)

    def get_ema_weights(self):
      return self.ema

    def set_ema_weights(self, ema_weights):
      for var_name, var_value in ema_weights.items():
        self.ema[var_name].assign(var_value)

#Example usage
base_model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])
model1 = EMAModel(base_model)
model2 = EMAModel(base_model)

#Training loop (simplified)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
for i in range(100):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    loss = model1(tf.random.normal((1,10)))
  grads = tape.gradient(loss, model1.base_model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model1.base_model.trainable_variables))
  weights = dict(zip([var.name for var in model1.base_model.trainable_variables], model1.base_model.trainable_variables))
  model1.update_ema(weights)


#Transfer EMA
ema_weights = model1.get_ema_weights()
model2.set_ema_weights(ema_weights)


```

This example explicitly manages the EMA using a custom class.  The `update_ema` function updates the EMA after each training step. The `get_ema_weights` and `set_ema_weights` methods enable transferring the EMA state.

**Example 2: Using `tf.train.Saver` (for simpler models):**

For simpler models, a `tf.compat.v1.train.Saver` (or its equivalent in the latest TF versions, perhaps using `tf.saved_model`) can be employed. However, this approach requires careful management of the save/restore operations to include the EMA variables explicitly.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
tf.compat.v1.disable_v2_behavior() # Needed for tf.compat.v1.train.Saver

# ... (Model definition and training as in Example 1, but with tf.Variable for ema)...

saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver(var_list = {"ema" : model1.ema}) # Save only the EMA variable

saver.save(sess, "ema_checkpoint")

# Load into model2
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    saver.restore(sess, "ema_checkpoint")
```

This approach relies on saving the EMA as a separate checkpoint, which can be loaded into a new model instance. Remember to manage the variable scope correctly to avoid naming conflicts.

**Example 3:  Handling Complex Architectures with Checkpoints:**

For complex models with multiple EMA instances or nested structures, using TensorFlow's checkpointing capabilities, such as `tf.train.Checkpoint` (or the `tf.saved_model` approach), is highly recommended.  This offers better organization and error handling.  You will explicitly list the EMA variables to be saved.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model1, ema=model1.ema)
checkpoint.save("complex_model_checkpoint")

#For loading into model2.  Ensure model2 has an EMA variable initialized properly.
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model2, ema=model2.ema)
checkpoint.restore("complex_model_checkpoint")

```

This illustrates saving and restoring multiple objects (the model and its EMA) within a single checkpoint, providing a robust mechanism for transfer.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   TensorFlow documentation on saving and restoring models.
*   TensorFlow documentation on custom training loops.
*   A comprehensive text on deep learning with TensorFlow, focusing on advanced topics.


Remember,  the optimal approach depends on the complexity of your model and your comfort level with TensorFlow's lower-level APIs.  For very complex models, careful planning and explicit management of EMA variables within custom classes and training loops is essential to ensure successful transfer.  Always thoroughly test your implementation to verify the accuracy and consistency of the transferred EMA.
