Adadelta's lack of a readily accessible effective learning rate is a frequently overlooked nuance.  My experience optimizing deep reinforcement learning agents, specifically those employing actor-critic architectures, consistently highlighted this limitation. Unlike optimizers like Adam which directly expose a learning rate parameter, Adadelta's adaptive nature necessitates a more indirect approach to gauging its effect on parameter updates.  The "effective learning rate" isn't a single, readily computed scalar value but rather a per-parameter, time-varying quantity dependent upon the accumulated gradients and parameter updates.

To understand this, we must delve into Adadelta's core mechanics.  Unlike optimizers relying on a fixed or decaying learning rate, Adadelta maintains separate exponentially decaying averages for squared gradients (E[g²]) and squared parameter updates (E[Δθ²]).  These averages are crucial because they inform the scaling factor for each parameter's update. The update rule itself is given by:

Δθ<sub>t</sub> = -RMS[Δθ]<sub>t-1</sub> / RMS[g]<sub>t</sub> * g<sub>t</sub>

where:

* g<sub>t</sub> represents the gradient at time step *t*.
* RMS[g]<sub>t</sub> represents the root mean square of the exponentially decaying average of squared gradients.  Specifically, RMS[g]<sub>t</sub> = √(E[g²]<sub>t</sub> + ε), where ε is a small constant to prevent division by zero.
* RMS[Δθ]<sub>t-1</sub> represents the root mean square of the exponentially decaying average of squared parameter updates from the previous time step.
* Δθ<sub>t</sub> is the parameter update at time step *t*.


This formulation reveals that the influence on parameter updates isn't directly controlled by a single learning rate. Instead, the ratio RMS[Δθ]<sub>t-1</sub> / RMS[g]<sub>t</sub> acts as a dynamic, parameter-specific learning rate at each iteration. This dynamic scaling is precisely what contributes to Adadelta's adaptive nature and inherent lack of a single, easily extractable "effective learning rate."


**1.  Approximating Effective Learning Rate via Parameter Update Magnitude:**

The most practical approach involves analyzing the magnitude of the parameter updates (Δθ<sub>t</sub>) across iterations.  While not a direct representation of a global effective learning rate, the norm (e.g., L2 norm) of these updates across all parameters provides a reasonable proxy, indicating the overall magnitude of parameter adjustments.  Larger norms suggest a higher effective learning rate, and vice versa.  In scenarios where parameter adjustments become excessively large, it indicates the need for potential adjustments to Adadelta's decay parameters (ρ) influencing the exponential averaging.


```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

# ... model definition ...

optimizer = optim.Adadelta(model.parameters())

# ... training loop ...

for i in range(num_epochs):
    # ... data loading and forward pass ...
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    # Approximate effective learning rate: L2 norm of parameter updates
    param_updates = []
    for p in model.parameters():
        param_updates.append(p.grad.clone().detach())  #Save grad before zero_grad()

    total_update_norm = torch.norm(torch.cat([p.reshape(-1) for p in param_updates]), 2)
    print(f"Epoch {i+1}: Approximate Effective Learning Rate (L2 norm) = {total_update_norm.item()}")

```

**Commentary:** This code snippet calculates the L2 norm of the parameter updates after each epoch. Note the use of `.clone().detach()` to ensure that the gradient is not affected by subsequent operations. This value serves as an indicator of the overall update strength, providing an indirect measure of the effective learning rate's influence.


**2. Monitoring RMS of Gradients and Updates:**

A more detailed insight can be gleaned by directly observing the RMS[g]<sub>t</sub> and RMS[Δθ]<sub>t</sub> values. While PyTorch doesn't directly expose these values from the Adadelta optimizer, you can track them by manually maintaining the running averages as part of your training loop. This offers a finer-grained understanding of how the adaptive scaling is changing over time.


```python
import torch
import torch.optim as optim

# ... model definition ...

optimizer = optim.Adadelta(model.parameters(), rho=0.95, eps=1e-6)
rho = optimizer.rho  # Decay factor for averages
eps = optimizer.eps   # Smoothing constant


# ... training loop ...

running_avg_sq_grad = [torch.zeros_like(p.data) for p in model.parameters()]
running_avg_sq_update = [torch.zeros_like(p.data) for p in model.parameters()]

for i in range(num_epochs):
    # ... data loading and forward pass ...
    loss.backward()

    for idx, p in enumerate(model.parameters()):
        grad = p.grad
        running_avg_sq_grad[idx] = rho * running_avg_sq_grad[idx] + (1 - rho) * (grad ** 2)
        RMS_grad = torch.sqrt(running_avg_sq_grad[idx] + eps)

        update = - torch.sqrt(running_avg_sq_update[idx] + eps) / RMS_grad * grad
        running_avg_sq_update[idx] = rho * running_avg_sq_update[idx] + (1 - rho) * (update**2)

        p.data.add_(update) # Apply update
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    #Monitoring
    avg_RMS_grad = torch.mean(torch.cat([torch.mean(r) for r in running_avg_sq_grad])).item()
    avg_RMS_update = torch.mean(torch.cat([torch.mean(r) for r in running_avg_sq_update])).item()
    print(f"Epoch {i+1}: Avg. RMS[g] = {avg_RMS_grad:.4f}, Avg. RMS[Δθ] = {avg_RMS_update:.4f}")
```

**Commentary:** This example explicitly computes and tracks the running averages of squared gradients and updates.  Averaging these across all parameters provides a high-level view of how the adaptive scaling is behaving. The ratio between these averages offers a more nuanced understanding of Adadelta's effective learning rate dynamics compared to the previous method.


**3. Visualization for Insights:**

Plotting the parameter update norms or the calculated RMS values over training epochs can provide valuable visual insights into the dynamics of Adadelta's adaptive learning.  Identifying trends, oscillations, or sudden changes in these metrics helps to diagnose potential training issues and guide hyperparameter tuning (rho and epsilon). Using tools like Matplotlib, you can effectively visualize these calculated values to gain further qualitative understanding.


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#...Previous code...

#Store the values in lists
rms_grad_list = []
rms_update_list = []
update_norm_list = []

# ... training loop ...
#...previous code...

    rms_grad_list.append(avg_RMS_grad)
    rms_update_list.append(avg_RMS_update)
    update_norm_list.append(total_update_norm.item())


plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(rms_grad_list, label='Avg RMS[g]')
plt.plot(rms_update_list, label='Avg RMS[Δθ]')
plt.legend()
plt.title('RMS of Gradients and Updates')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Magnitude')


plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(update_norm_list, label='L2 Norm of Updates')
plt.legend()
plt.title('L2 Norm of Parameter Updates')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Magnitude')


plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```
