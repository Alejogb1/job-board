Multi-input models in TensorFlow/Keras are crucial for handling data stemming from diverse sources or modalities.  My experience building recommendation systems heavily relied on this capability, combining user demographics with product features for accurate prediction.  The core principle lies in using the `keras.layers.Input` layer to define multiple input tensors, which are then processed independently before converging into a shared representation.  This contrasts sharply with simply concatenating inputs, which ignores potential differences in their inherent structures and data types.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The most effective strategy for handling multiple inputs involves creating separate input layers for each data source. Each input layer defines a specific input shape, reflecting the dimensionality of the corresponding data.  These separate branches are then processed individually, potentially utilizing different layers appropriate to each input's characteristics. For instance, image data might benefit from convolutional layers, while textual data would necessitate embedding and recurrent layers.  Finally, the processed outputs from these independent branches are combined, often through concatenation or averaging, feeding into a shared layer(s) before the final output layer.  This architecture leverages the strengths of each input type while simultaneously learning their synergistic interactions.

Critical considerations include:

* **Data Preprocessing:**  Inputs must be appropriately preprocessed before feeding into the model.  This includes normalization, standardization, and handling missing values, which may differ according to input type.  Inconsistent preprocessing can significantly hinder model performance and should be carefully addressed.

* **Layer Choice:** The choice of layers within each branch should align with the nature of the data.  Convolutional layers for images, recurrent layers for sequences, and dense layers for numerical vectors are examples of such alignment.  Improper layer selection leads to suboptimal feature extraction.

* **Feature Engineering:**  Consider the inherent representation of your data.  Effective feature engineering, prior to model training, can drastically improve results.  Feature selection methods can also be used to reduce dimensionality and improve training efficiency.

* **Output Layer Selection:** The output layer's activation function and shape should reflect the task at hand.  For instance, regression problems utilize a linear activation with a single output neuron, whereas multi-class classification demands a softmax activation with a number of outputs corresponding to the classes.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Combining Numerical and Categorical Data for Regression**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define input layers
numerical_input = keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,), name='numerical_input')
categorical_input = keras.layers.Input(shape=(1,), name='categorical_input')

# Process numerical input
numerical_processed = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(numerical_input)
numerical_processed = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(numerical_processed)

# Process categorical input (assuming one-hot encoding)
categorical_embedded = keras.layers.Embedding(100, 16)(categorical_input) # 100 categories, 16-dimensional embedding
categorical_processed = keras.layers.Flatten()(categorical_embedded)

# Concatenate processed inputs
merged = keras.layers.concatenate([numerical_processed, categorical_processed])

# Output layer
output = keras.layers.Dense(1)(merged) # Regression task

# Create model
model = keras.models.Model(inputs=[numerical_input, categorical_input], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model (replace with your data)
model.fit([numerical_data, categorical_data], target_data, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates a regression task combining numerical and categorical data.  The numerical data passes through dense layers, while the categorical data is first embedded before flattening and merging with the numerical features.

**Example 2:  Image and Text Input for Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define input layers
image_input = keras.layers.Input(shape=(64, 64, 3), name='image_input')
text_input = keras.layers.Input(shape=(100,), name='text_input') # Assuming 100-word sequences

# Process image input
image_processed = keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(image_input)
image_processed = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(image_processed)
image_processed = keras.layers.Flatten()(image_processed)

# Process text input
text_processed = keras.layers.Embedding(10000, 64)(text_input) # 10000 words in vocabulary, 64-dimensional embeddings
text_processed = keras.layers.LSTM(32)(text_processed)

# Concatenate processed inputs
merged = keras.layers.concatenate([image_processed, text_processed])

# Output layer
output = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(merged) # 10 classes

# Create model
model = keras.models.Model(inputs=[image_input, text_input], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model (replace with your data)
model.fit([image_data, text_data], labels, epochs=10)
```

This example shows classification using images and text as inputs.  Convolutional layers handle images, while an LSTM processes the text.  The outputs are combined, and a softmax activation provides probabilities for each class.

**Example 3: Handling Missing Inputs with Conditional Logic**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define input layers
input_a = keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,), name='input_a')
input_b = keras.layers.Input(shape=(5,), name='input_b')

#Conditional layer to handle missing input_b
def conditional_layer(inputs):
    input_a, input_b_mask = inputs
    input_b_processed = tf.where(tf.equal(input_b_mask, 1), input_b, tf.zeros_like(input_b))
    return keras.layers.concatenate([input_a, input_b_processed])

# Process inputs, handle missing input_b via lambda layer and custom function
merged = keras.layers.Lambda(conditional_layer)([input_a, keras.layers.Input(shape=(1,), name='input_b_mask')]) #Input_b_mask indicates presence (1) or absence (0) of input_b

#Further processing and output layer as per needs
dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(merged)
output = keras.layers.Dense(1)(dense1)

# Create model
model = keras.models.Model(inputs=[input_a, keras.layers.Input(shape=(1,), name='input_b_mask'), input_b], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model (replace with your data; input_b_mask is 1 if input_b is present, 0 otherwise)
model.fit([input_a_data, input_b_mask_data, input_b_data], target_data, epochs=10)
```

This example shows how to deal with potentially missing input features using a custom lambda layer and a conditional function.  A mask input is introduced to determine whether input B should be considered; otherwise, it is replaced with zeros. This approach is crucial for dealing with incomplete or inconsistent datasets.
