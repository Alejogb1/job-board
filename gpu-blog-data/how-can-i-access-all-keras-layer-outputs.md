Accessing all Keras layer outputs requires a nuanced understanding of the Keras functional API and its capabilities beyond the sequential model paradigm.  My experience building and optimizing complex deep learning architectures for image recognition projects highlighted the limitations of simply inspecting intermediate layer activations post-training.  Directly accessing and manipulating these outputs during the forward pass is crucial for model introspection, feature extraction, and the construction of more sophisticated architectures.  This necessitates employing the Keras functional API, which offers the flexibility to define and control the flow of data within a model.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The sequential model in Keras, while convenient for straightforward architectures, lacks the explicit control required for accessing intermediate layer outputs. The functional API, conversely, allows for the creation of arbitrary graph structures, enabling precise specification of data flow and access points.  Each layer in a functional model is a callable object that accepts a tensor as input and produces a tensor as output.  By defining the model as a graph where intermediate outputs are explicitly named and accessed, we can retrieve the activations of any layer.  This is achieved through the use of the `keras.Model` class, creating a model with multiple inputs and/or outputs.

The process involves defining the base layers of the network as usual, then using these layers to construct the model graph, explicitly designating the desired intermediate outputs as outputs of the `keras.Model`.  This allows for subsequent retrieval of these outputs during the inference phase.  Crucially, this method does not require modifying the internal workings of the layers themselves; it merely leverages the flexibility provided by the functional API to manage the data flow. This differs from techniques involving custom layers which add complexity and can obscure the model architecture.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Accessing Outputs from a Simple CNN**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define individual layers
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
conv1 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_layer)
pool1 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(conv1)
conv2 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(pool1)
pool2 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(conv2)
flatten = Flatten()(pool2)
dense1 = Dense(128, activation='relu')(flatten)
output_layer = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(dense1)

# Create the model with multiple outputs.  Note that intermediate outputs are also passed to the output list
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=[output_layer, conv1, pool2])

# Compile the model (Note: loss is only specified for the primary output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'], loss_weights=[1, 0, 0])

# Access outputs during inference
_, conv1_output, pool2_output = model.predict(x_test) #x_test is your test data

print(conv1_output.shape)
print(pool2_output.shape)
```

This example demonstrates the creation of a simple CNN with the functional API.  The intermediate outputs of `conv1` and `pool2` are explicitly included as outputs of the `keras.Model`.  During prediction, `model.predict` returns a tuple containing the outputs of all specified outputs. The loss weights are set to prioritize the main output during training, while still allowing the retrieval of other layer's output.


**Example 2:  Conditional Output Selection**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, Lambda, Layer
import numpy as np

# Define a custom layer to conditionally select outputs. This provides finer control than the basic example.
class ConditionalOutput(Layer):
    def __init__(self, index):
        super(ConditionalOutput, self).__init__()
        self.index = index

    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs[self.index]

# Define layers
input_tensor = Input(shape=(10,))
dense1 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
dense2 = Dense(32, activation='relu')(dense1)
dense3 = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(dense2)

# Create multiple outputs using a Lambda Layer and ConditionalOutput for illustration
output1 = dense3
output2 = Lambda(lambda x: x)(dense1)  #Simple Passthrough
output3 = ConditionalOutput(0)([dense1, dense2]) #Select based on index

# Create the functional model with multiple outputs
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=[output1, output2, output3])

#Example inference
x = np.random.rand(1, 10)
o1, o2, o3 = model.predict(x)

print(o1.shape)
print(o2.shape)
print(o3.shape)
```

This exemplifies advanced control. A `ConditionalOutput` custom layer demonstrates how to select outputs based on conditions (here, an index). The `Lambda` layer allows for straightforward data manipulation and transformations within the graph. This approach provides flexibility to choose specific outputs dynamically or conditionally.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Input Branches**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, concatenate, Flatten, Dense

# Define separate input branches
input_a = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
input_b = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))

# Process each branch separately
branch_a = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_a)
branch_a = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(branch_a)
branch_b = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_b)
branch_b = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(branch_b)

# Concatenate the branches
merged = concatenate([branch_a, branch_b])

# Remaining layers
flatten = Flatten()(merged)
dense1 = Dense(128, activation='relu')(flatten)
output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(dense1)

# Create the model with multiple inputs and single output, but access intermediate branches
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=[output, branch_a, branch_b])

#Dummy data for inference
x_a = np.random.rand(1,28,28,1)
x_b = np.random.rand(1,28,28,1)

out, a, b = model.predict([x_a, x_b])

print(out.shape)
print(a.shape)
print(b.shape)

```

This showcases handling multiple input branches.  Each branch is processed independently, then concatenated before the final layers.  Access to the outputs of individual branches is retained, providing insights into feature representations within each branch before merging. This method is critical when working with multimodal data or architectures that require separate processing paths.
