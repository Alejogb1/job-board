The core issue with updating `torch.zeros` with other tensors lies in understanding PyTorch's tensor immutability and the implications for in-place operations.  While it's possible to *seemingly* update a `torch.zeros` tensor,  the underlying mechanism often involves creating a new tensor, rather than modifying the original in place. This distinction is crucial for memory management and performance optimization, especially in large-scale models.  My experience optimizing deep learning architectures has highlighted this repeatedly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`torch.zeros` creates a tensor filled with zeros.  PyTorch tensors, by default, are not mutable in the sense that operations like element-wise addition or assignment don't change the original tensor's memory location. Instead, they create a *new* tensor with the modified values. This behavior is consistent across many numerical computing libraries. To achieve the effect of updating `torch.zeros`, several approaches exist, each with its own tradeoffs regarding memory efficiency and computational speed.

The most straightforward but potentially memory-intensive approach involves direct assignment or arithmetic operations.  This creates a new tensor; the original `torch.zeros` remains unchanged.  To update the original `torch.zeros` tensor in-place, one must utilize methods explicitly designed for this purpose, such as `torch.add_` or similar in-place operators (denoted by the trailing underscore). These in-place operations modify the tensor directly, avoiding the overhead of creating a new tensor. This becomes particularly critical when dealing with extremely large tensors where memory allocation can become a significant bottleneck.

Furthermore, the choice of update method depends on the context.  If the update involves adding values from another tensor,  `torch.add_` is efficient.  For more complex updates or selective assignments, indexing and scattering operations offer more granular control.  Understanding the shape compatibility of tensors and broadcasting rules is paramount for error-free updates.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient update – creating a new tensor**

```python
import torch

zeros_tensor = torch.zeros(3, 3)
update_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Inefficient – creates a new tensor
updated_tensor = zeros_tensor + update_tensor  

print("Original zeros tensor:\n", zeros_tensor)
print("Updated tensor:\n", updated_tensor)
```

*Commentary:* This code demonstrates the default behavior.  `zeros_tensor` remains unchanged; `updated_tensor` holds the sum of the two tensors.  This approach is simple but inefficient for repeated updates due to repeated memory allocations.

**Example 2: Efficient in-place update using `add_`**

```python
import torch

zeros_tensor = torch.zeros(3, 3)
update_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Efficient in-place update
zeros_tensor.add_(update_tensor) #In-place addition

print("Updated zeros tensor:\n", zeros_tensor)
```

*Commentary:* This example showcases an efficient in-place update. `add_` modifies `zeros_tensor` directly, avoiding the creation of a new tensor.  This improves memory efficiency significantly, especially when dealing with large tensors or repetitive updates within a loop. Note the trailing underscore indicating an in-place operation.

**Example 3: Selective update using indexing and scattering**

```python
import torch

zeros_tensor = torch.zeros(5,5)
update_tensor = torch.tensor([10, 20, 30])
indices = torch.tensor([[1, 1],[2,2],[3,3]])

# Selective update using indexing and scattering
zeros_tensor[indices[:,0], indices[:,1]] = update_tensor

print("Updated zeros tensor:\n", zeros_tensor)

```

*Commentary:* This demonstrates a more controlled update using indexing.  Only specific elements of `zeros_tensor` are modified according to the indices provided in the `indices` tensor. This approach is valuable when you need to update only a subset of the tensor elements, preventing unnecessary computation.  Careful consideration of index boundaries is necessary to avoid `IndexError`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would strongly recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation for comprehensive details on tensor operations and in-place modifications.  The PyTorch tutorials provide practical examples covering various tensor manipulation techniques.  Furthermore, exploring advanced topics such as automatic differentiation (autograd) and CUDA programming will enhance your understanding of tensor computations and memory management within the PyTorch framework.  Finally, a deep dive into linear algebra fundamentals is highly beneficial for effectively using PyTorch for numerical computation.  Understanding broadcasting and matrix operations will significantly improve your code's efficiency and clarity.  These resources offer a structured approach to mastering tensor manipulation and optimization within PyTorch.
