Batch-based and full-dataset metrics represent distinct approaches to evaluating model performance, each with inherent strengths and weaknesses.  My experience developing large-scale recommendation systems has highlighted the crucial differences between these methodologies, primarily revolving around computational cost, data recency, and the nature of the insights they provide.  Full-dataset metrics, while providing a complete picture, are often computationally prohibitive for large datasets, whereas batch-based metrics offer a more pragmatic, albeit potentially less precise, alternative.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Full-dataset metrics calculate performance indicators using the entirety of the available data.  This approach yields the most accurate and comprehensive assessment of a model's capabilities.  However, the computational demands scale linearly (or even superlinearly depending on the metric) with the dataset size.  For instance, calculating the exact precision@k for a recommendation system with millions of users and items necessitates processing the entire interaction matrix, a task that can be computationally intensive and time-consuming.  This renders full-dataset evaluations impractical for real-time monitoring or frequent model updates in scenarios involving high data volumes or computationally expensive metrics.

Batch-based metrics, in contrast, operate on subsets of the data, typically sampled randomly or selected based on specific criteria such as time window or user segments. This approach significantly reduces computational cost, making frequent evaluations feasible.  The trade-off is a reduction in statistical precision.  A smaller sample size naturally introduces sampling error, leading to potentially inaccurate estimates of the true model performance on the entire dataset.  The magnitude of this error is inversely proportional to the sample size; larger batches yield more accurate estimates but at the cost of increased computational burden.  The choice between batch and full-dataset evaluation often involves a cost-benefit analysis balancing computational feasibility against the desired precision.  Furthermore, the choice significantly impacts the insight derived. A full-dataset metric provides a complete performance snapshot; a batch metric provides a point estimate within a certain confidence interval.  The implication for decision-making is that decisions based on batch metrics should account for their inherent uncertainty.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate calculating a simple accuracy metric using both full-dataset and batch-based approaches in Python.  These examples assume a dataset represented as a NumPy array where the first column represents the true labels and the second column represents the model predictions.

**Example 1: Full-Dataset Accuracy**

```python
import numpy as np

def full_dataset_accuracy(data):
    """Calculates accuracy using the entire dataset.

    Args:
        data: A NumPy array where the first column is true labels and the second is predictions.

    Returns:
        The accuracy score (float).
    """
    true_labels = data[:, 0]
    predictions = data[:, 1]
    correct_predictions = np.sum(true_labels == predictions)
    accuracy = correct_predictions / len(true_labels)
    return accuracy

# Sample data
data = np.array([[1, 1], [0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1,1]])
accuracy = full_dataset_accuracy(data)
print(f"Full-dataset accuracy: {accuracy}")

```

This function processes the entire `data` array to calculate accuracy.  Suitable for smaller datasets, but computationally expensive for large-scale applications.


**Example 2: Batch-Based Accuracy with Random Sampling**

```python
import numpy as np
import random

def batch_accuracy(data, batch_size):
    """Calculates accuracy on a random batch of the dataset.

    Args:
        data: A NumPy array where the first column is true labels and the second is predictions.
        batch_size: The size of the random batch.

    Returns:
        The accuracy score (float).
    """
    batch = random.sample(list(data), batch_size)
    batch = np.array(batch)
    true_labels = batch[:, 0]
    predictions = batch[:, 1]
    correct_predictions = np.sum(true_labels == predictions)
    accuracy = correct_predictions / len(true_labels)
    return accuracy

# Sample data (same as above)
data = np.array([[1, 1], [0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1,1]])
batch_size = 3
accuracy = batch_accuracy(data, batch_size)
print(f"Batch accuracy (batch size {batch_size}): {accuracy}")

```

This function calculates accuracy on a random subset of the data, controlled by `batch_size`.  This significantly reduces computational cost but introduces sampling error.


**Example 3: Batch-Based Accuracy with Time-Based Partitioning**

```python
import numpy as np

def time_based_batch_accuracy(data, timestamp_column, start_time, end_time):
    """Calculates accuracy on a time-based subset of the data.

    Args:
        data: A NumPy array with a timestamp column.
        timestamp_column: Index of the timestamp column.
        start_time: Start timestamp for the batch.
        end_time: End timestamp for the batch.

    Returns:
        The accuracy score (float).
    """
    batch = data[(data[:, timestamp_column] >= start_time) & (data[:, timestamp_column] < end_time)]
    true_labels = batch[:, 0]
    predictions = batch[:, 1]
    correct_predictions = np.sum(true_labels == predictions)
    accuracy = correct_predictions / len(true_labels) if len(true_labels) > 0 else 0
    return accuracy

#Sample data with timestamps
data_time = np.array([[1,1,1678886400],[0,0,1678886460],[1,1,1678887000],[0,0,1678887060],[1,0,1678887600]])
start = 1678886400
end = 1678887000
accuracy_time = time_based_batch_accuracy(data_time, 2, start, end)
print(f"Time-based batch accuracy from {start} to {end}: {accuracy_time}")
```

This function selects a batch based on a time range, which is particularly useful for monitoring model performance over time. This avoids the potential bias of random sampling and is more representative of performance across time periods.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of statistical sampling and its impact on metric estimation, consult introductory texts on statistical inference and sampling theory.  For advanced techniques in large-scale machine learning model evaluation, research papers on online learning and streaming algorithms are valuable.  Furthermore, exploring documentation for relevant machine learning libraries will provide practical guidance on implementing both batch and full-dataset evaluation methods efficiently.
