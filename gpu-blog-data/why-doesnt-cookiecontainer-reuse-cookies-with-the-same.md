The behavior of `CookieContainer` not reusing cookies with the same name stems from its primary function: to meticulously adhere to the cookie specifications outlined in RFC 6265, rather than acting as a simple key-value store. This includes respecting the domain, path, and other attributes that together define a cookie's scope and uniqueness, even when the name is identical. My experience working on web service integrations has repeatedly shown that deviating from this strict adherence can lead to unexpected authentication failures and data corruption, highlighting the need for the rigorous implementation found in `CookieContainer`.

A cookie isn’t just identified by its name. In fact, the name is one component of what could be called a cookie's “full key,” which consists of its name, domain, path, and, since the introduction of the `SameSite` attribute, this additional modifier as well. The `CookieContainer` utilizes this composite key to determine uniqueness. If a server sends multiple cookies with the same name, but differing in any other characteristic, such as domain, path, or `SameSite` configuration, the `CookieContainer` correctly stores each separately. Conversely, if an existing cookie with the same full key is received, it will replace the stored version based on its set policy. This replacement, controlled by its internal mechanism, will either fully update or discard the incoming cookie. It's not simply a matter of looking up the name and overriding the existing one; it is much more nuanced.

To illustrate, consider a scenario where two different web applications, let's say `app1.example.com` and `app2.example.com`, both attempt to set cookies named `sessionID`. Without the domain distinction, these session identifiers would conflict, potentially leading to users being improperly logged into one application when they should be accessing the other. The `CookieContainer` avoids this problem by treating `sessionID` for `app1.example.com` and `sessionID` for `app2.example.com` as entirely separate entities. The container does not simply discard one in favor of the other. It remembers both.

Furthermore, path sensitivity can also play a key role. Imagine an application that sets the `sessionID` cookie on `/api` and `/`, where `/` is the base application path. The `CookieContainer` will treat these as distinct cookies since the path attribute is different, preventing the API's session identifier from inadvertently being used for the base application's authentication. This separation is a crucial component of web security, preventing cookie hijacking and other common attack vectors. This strict adherence is the rationale behind `CookieContainer`’s design. It's designed not as a simple associative collection but instead as a meticulous implementation of cookie standards.

Let's now explore some practical code examples to better demonstrate this behavior. First, I will demonstrate how cookies with the same name but different domain values are stored separately.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;

public static class CookieExample
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var cookieContainer = new CookieContainer();
        
        // Adding a cookie for domain app1.example.com
        var cookie1 = new Cookie("sessionID", "12345") { Domain = "app1.example.com", Path = "/" };
        cookieContainer.Add(cookie1);

        // Adding a cookie with same name, for different domain app2.example.com
        var cookie2 = new Cookie("sessionID", "67890") { Domain = "app2.example.com", Path = "/" };
        cookieContainer.Add(cookie2);


        Console.WriteLine($"Cookie Count: {cookieContainer.Count}"); //Output: Cookie Count: 2

        //Iterate and display the cookies to see their individual properties
        foreach (Cookie cookie in cookieContainer.GetCookies(new Uri("http://app1.example.com")))
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Cookie Name: {cookie.Name}, Value: {cookie.Value}, Domain: {cookie.Domain}");
        }
         foreach (Cookie cookie in cookieContainer.GetCookies(new Uri("http://app2.example.com")))
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Cookie Name: {cookie.Name}, Value: {cookie.Value}, Domain: {cookie.Domain}");
        }

       // Output: 
       //  Cookie Name: sessionID, Value: 12345, Domain: app1.example.com
       //  Cookie Name: sessionID, Value: 67890, Domain: app2.example.com
    }
}
```

In this example, we can see that two cookies named `sessionID` are both present in the container. The difference lies in their respective domains; hence, they are treated as separate cookies. The container effectively demonstrates its ability to distinguish between them, which is important to maintain application functionality.

Now, let's take a look at a second scenario illustrating how the path attribute affects cookie uniqueness.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;

public static class CookiePathExample
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var cookieContainer = new CookieContainer();
        
        // Adding a cookie with name 'test' for base path '/'
        var cookie1 = new Cookie("test", "value1") { Domain = "example.com", Path = "/" };
        cookieContainer.Add(cookie1);

        // Adding cookie with the same name 'test' for path '/api'
        var cookie2 = new Cookie("test", "value2") { Domain = "example.com", Path = "/api" };
        cookieContainer.Add(cookie2);

         Console.WriteLine($"Cookie Count: {cookieContainer.Count}"); //Output: Cookie Count: 2

         //Iterate and display the cookies to see their individual properties
         foreach (Cookie cookie in cookieContainer.GetCookies(new Uri("http://example.com")))
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Cookie Name: {cookie.Name}, Value: {cookie.Value}, Path: {cookie.Path}");
        }

        foreach (Cookie cookie in cookieContainer.GetCookies(new Uri("http://example.com/api")))
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Cookie Name: {cookie.Name}, Value: {cookie.Value}, Path: {cookie.Path}");
        }
        // Output:
        // Cookie Name: test, Value: value1, Path: /
        // Cookie Name: test, Value: value2, Path: /api
    }
}
```

Here, even though the cookie name is the same, the paths are different (`/` and `/api`). Consequently, the `CookieContainer` treats these as distinct cookies. One cookie would be available for requests to `example.com`, whereas the other would only be available for requests to `example.com/api`, reflecting the intended behavior as laid out in RFC 6265.

Finally, let's look at the behaviour of replacing existing cookies with similar keys. I'm going to focus on updating the value.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;

public static class CookieUpdateExample
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var cookieContainer = new CookieContainer();
        
        // Adding an initial cookie
        var initialCookie = new Cookie("testCookie", "oldValue") { Domain = "example.com", Path = "/" };
        cookieContainer.Add(initialCookie);

        Console.WriteLine("Initial Cookie:");
        foreach(Cookie cookie in cookieContainer.GetCookies(new Uri("http://example.com"))){
            Console.WriteLine($"Cookie Name: {cookie.Name}, Value: {cookie.Value}, Domain: {cookie.Domain}, Path: {cookie.Path}");
        }
        // Output: Cookie Name: testCookie, Value: oldValue, Domain: example.com, Path: /

        // Adding a new cookie with the same full key, but new value
        var updatedCookie = new Cookie("testCookie", "newValue") { Domain = "example.com", Path = "/" };
        cookieContainer.Add(updatedCookie);


        Console.WriteLine("\nUpdated Cookie:");
          foreach(Cookie cookie in cookieContainer.GetCookies(new Uri("http://example.com"))){
            Console.WriteLine($"Cookie Name: {cookie.Name}, Value: {cookie.Value}, Domain: {cookie.Domain}, Path: {cookie.Path}");
        }

        // Output:
        // Updated Cookie:
        // Cookie Name: testCookie, Value: newValue, Domain: example.com, Path: /

        Console.WriteLine($"\nCookie Count: {cookieContainer.Count}"); //Output: Cookie Count: 1

    }
}
```

In this instance, when a new cookie with the same name, domain, and path as an existing one is added, `CookieContainer` will replace the stored cookie. Note that, the count remains `1`. This also means that additional properties of the cookie object, such as the `HttpOnly` flag, are also updated by the replacement operation. This example clarifies the replacing behavior when a cookie with the same full key is encountered.

To understand cookie management in greater detail, I recommend consulting the following resources. First, the official documentation for `System.Net.CookieContainer` provides in-depth information about its implementation and available methods. Additionally, examining RFC 6265 offers a precise definition of HTTP state management mechanism, including the attributes that govern cookie behavior. Finally, reviewing Microsoft's .NET documentation related to HTTP clients, specifically the `HttpClient` and its associated components, can assist in the larger context of web interactions with cookies. These resources provide the fundamental understanding to manipulate cookies correctly in .NET applications, and highlight why the `CookieContainer` needs to consider a full key for cookie uniqueness, and not solely rely on the name.
