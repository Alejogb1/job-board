The inherent stochasticity of many training algorithms renders consistent accuracy and loss values across epochs using `train_on_batch` practically unattainable.  My experience optimizing deep learning models for high-throughput financial applications highlighted this limitation repeatedly.  While deterministic behavior is achievable under specific, and often impractical, conditions, the very nature of mini-batch gradient descent and the inherent randomness in data shuffling contribute to variations in these metrics.

**1. Explanation:**

The `train_on_batch` method in frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras processes a single batch of data at a time.  The accuracy and loss calculated after each call to `train_on_batch` are derived from that specific batch.  Even if the underlying model architecture and hyperparameters remain constant, variations arise from several factors.

Firstly, the order of data within each batch significantly influences the gradient update.  Unless explicitly disabled, data shuffling usually occurs before each epoch, introducing randomness.  Consequently, even with the same data, a different batch ordering results in a unique sequence of weight updates, leading to slightly different model states at the end of each batch and epoch.

Secondly, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) – the optimization algorithm underpinning most deep learning training – uses a stochastic estimate of the gradient based on a single batch. This estimate inherently contains noise, varying from batch to batch.  Consequently, the update direction and magnitude fluctuate, directly affecting the model's accuracy and loss.  Even if batch ordering were perfectly controlled, this stochasticity remains.

Thirdly, the choice of activation functions within the neural network model contributes to non-linearity.  Slight variations in the weight updates, propagated through these non-linear functions, can lead to larger differences in the output layer's predictions, amplifying minor differences in training trajectories.

Finally, floating-point arithmetic introduces numerical instability.  The cumulative effect of rounding errors during computations across multiple epochs can lead to observable discrepancies in accuracy and loss calculations, even when using the same data and algorithm.  This phenomenon is particularly relevant when dealing with deep networks containing numerous layers and weights.

Achieving consistent results would necessitate a deterministic training procedure.  This could involve using a deterministic random number generator with a fixed seed, disabling data shuffling, and employing an optimization algorithm devoid of inherent randomness.  However, these restrictions often compromise model generalizability and might lead to suboptimal performance on unseen data.


**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate the variability using Keras and a simple sequential model.  Note that the observed inconsistencies highlight the principle; precise values will vary across runs.

**Example 1: Demonstrating Variability with Default Settings:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Generate synthetic data
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

batch_size = 32
epochs = 5

history = []
for epoch in range(epochs):
    epoch_history = []
    for i in range(len(X) // batch_size):
        batch_x = X[i * batch_size:(i + 1) * batch_size]
        batch_y = y[i * batch_size:(i + 1) * batch_size]
        loss, accuracy = model.train_on_batch(batch_x, batch_y)
        epoch_history.append((loss, accuracy))
    history.append(epoch_history)

print(history) # Observe variability in loss and accuracy across batches and epochs.
```

**Commentary:** This code demonstrates the inherent variability.  The output `history` list contains the loss and accuracy for each batch within each epoch.  Observe the fluctuations even within a single epoch, let alone across epochs.

**Example 2:  Illustrating the Impact of Data Shuffling:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# ... (Data generation as in Example 1) ...

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

batch_size = 32
epochs = 5

# Disable data shuffling for comparison
history_noshuffle = model.fit(X, y, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=epochs, shuffle=False)

#Enable data shuffling for comparison
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history_shuffle = model.fit(X, y, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=epochs, shuffle=True)


print(history_noshuffle.history)
print(history_shuffle.history) #Compare the difference in loss and accuracy across epochs with and without shuffling
```

**Commentary:**  This example compares training with and without data shuffling.  The difference in accuracy and loss across epochs will be apparent, directly demonstrating the effect of data ordering on training trajectory.  While shuffling is generally beneficial, it introduces this source of inconsistency.

**Example 3:  Exploring a Deterministic Approach (Limited Applicability):**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
import random

# ... (Data generation as in Example 1) ...

# Fix random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)
random.seed(42)

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

batch_size = 32
epochs = 5

# Manual Batch Iteration with no data shuffling
history = []
for epoch in range(epochs):
    epoch_history = []
    for i in range(len(X) // batch_size):
        batch_x = X[i * batch_size:(i + 1) * batch_size]
        batch_y = y[i * batch_size:(i + 1) * batch_size]
        loss, accuracy = model.train_on_batch(batch_x, batch_y)
        epoch_history.append((loss, accuracy))
    history.append(epoch_history)

print(history) #Observe variability still exists due to inherent stochasticity of the algorithm
```

**Commentary:** This example attempts to improve consistency by fixing the random seed. However, the inherent stochasticity of the optimizer and floating-point arithmetic still contribute to variations in accuracy and loss.  This example underscores the limitations of simply aiming for deterministic behaviour.  True consistency requires significant alterations beyond seed fixing.

In conclusion, while strategies can mitigate variations, perfectly consistent accuracy and loss values across epochs using `train_on_batch` are generally unattainable due to the fundamental properties of stochastic gradient descent and the inherent randomness associated with data shuffling and floating-point arithmetic.  Understanding these limitations is crucial for interpreting training results and developing robust model evaluation strategies.
