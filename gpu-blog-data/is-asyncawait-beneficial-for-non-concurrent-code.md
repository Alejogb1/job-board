The perceived performance benefit of `async`/`await` in purely sequential code is often a misconception stemming from a misunderstanding of its fundamental purpose.  While it doesn't inherently introduce parallelism, its utility lies in improving the structure and readability of code that handles asynchronous operations, even if those operations are not executed concurrently.  In my experience architecting high-throughput systems, I've found that strategically employing `async`/`await` even in scenarios without true concurrency significantly simplifies asynchronous logic, which leads to indirect performance improvements via better code maintainability and reduced complexity.

**1.  Explanation:**

The core function of `async`/`await` is to enable the synchronous-like writing of asynchronous code.  Consider a scenario involving several I/O-bound operations, such as reading from a database or making network requests.  Without `async`/`await`, handling these operations often results in complex callback structures or deeply nested promises, making the code difficult to follow and debug. `async`/`await`, however, transforms this spaghetti code into a linear, sequential structure that mirrors the logical flow of operations.  This improvement in readability and maintainability is paramount, particularly in larger projects.

Even if these I/O-bound operations are performed sequentially, and thus not concurrently, the asynchronous nature of the operations themselves means that the program doesn't necessarily block while waiting for each operation to complete.  The underlying event loop continues to process other tasks, such as handling user input or performing internal housekeeping, thus optimizing resource utilization.  The illusion of concurrency is created by the seamless switching between operations.  This "context switching" is handled efficiently by the runtime environment, leading to improved responsiveness and potentially reduced latency, even without explicit multithreading or multiprocessing.

Crucially, the benefit in non-concurrent scenarios lies primarily in code organization and maintainability.  The avoidance of callback hell and improved readability contribute to a reduced likelihood of errors and simplifies future modifications.  While the direct performance gain might be negligible in some simple cases, the indirect benefits stemming from enhanced developer productivity and maintainability often far outweigh any marginal performance improvement or lack thereof in the execution speed itself.  This is especially true as the codebase grows in complexity.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Synchronous File I/O (No Async/Await):**

```python
import time

def process_file(filename):
    start_time = time.time()
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        contents = f.read()
    # Simulate some processing
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulates I/O-bound operation
    print(f"Processed {filename} in {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds")

process_file("file1.txt")
process_file("file2.txt")
process_file("file3.txt")
```

This code processes files sequentially.  Each `process_file` call blocks until completion.


**Example 2: Asynchronous File I/O (With Async/Await):**

```python
import asyncio
import time

async def process_file_async(filename):
    start_time = time.time()
    async with aiofiles.open(filename, 'r') as f:
        contents = await f.read()
    # Simulate some processing
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulates I/O-bound operation
    print(f"Processed {filename} in {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(
        process_file_async("file1.txt"),
        process_file_async("file2.txt"),
        process_file_async("file3.txt")
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

Even though `asyncio.gather` runs these functions concurrently, the individual `process_file_async` functions are still I/O-bound and don't inherently use multiple cores.  The benefit here is better structure and the ability to perform other tasks during the `await asyncio.sleep(2)` calls.


**Example 3: Simulating CPU-Bound Task with Async/Await:**

```python
import asyncio
import time

async def cpu_bound_task(n):
    start_time = time.time()
    result = sum(i * i for i in range(n))
    print(f"CPU-bound task completed in {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds")
    return result

async def main():
    result = await cpu_bound_task(10000000)  #Example CPU bound task
    print(f"Result: {result}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

This example uses `async`/`await` for a CPU-bound task.  There's no performance gain here; `async`/`await` does not magically make CPU-bound operations faster.  In this case, the structure is arguably less efficient than a simple synchronous function call.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of asynchronous programming concepts, I'd suggest consulting advanced texts on concurrent programming and the specific documentation for your chosen language's asynchronous framework.  Furthermore, exploring practical examples of asynchronous I/O operations within the context of database interactions or network programming will provide invaluable insight.  The official language documentation on `async`/`await` is always a crucial starting point, as are books that delve into design patterns for concurrent and parallel systems.  Finally, understanding the nuances of event loops and their operation within your chosen runtime environment is essential for optimization.
