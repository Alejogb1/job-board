The core challenge in locating elements containing a specific character within a text or a data structure lies in the need to iterate over individual components and apply a string-matching comparison. I've encountered this frequently while processing log files, handling user input sanitization, and debugging data serialization routines where specific character sequences needed to be identified across vast amounts of unstructured text. It's not simply about knowing *if* a character exists, but identifying the precise location and the container holding it, which often involves parsing, indexing, and applying logical operators to pinpoint specific instances. Direct string search algorithms or regular expressions are key tools, and understanding their nuanced application to different data types—strings, lists of strings, dictionaries, etc.—is critical for efficient implementation.

In the simplest case, consider working with a single string. We need to sequentially examine each character and check if it matches the one we are looking for. The basic methodology involves a loop, but Python provides a far more succinct approach leveraging the `in` keyword. For more advanced cases or when we need to know the position of the target character, string methods like `find()` or a loop with manual indexing is necessary.  Additionally, if we are looking for pattern matching, utilizing regular expressions can offer much more powerful search capabilities, though it introduces the overhead of compiling the expression pattern.

Here is the first illustrative example demonstrating a basic search for a character within a string, and subsequently locating all instances.

```python
def find_char_in_string(text, char):
    """
    Locates all positions of a character within a given string.

    Args:
        text (str): The string to search within.
        char (str): The character to locate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of indices where the character is found, empty if not present.
    """
    indices = []
    for i, c in enumerate(text):
        if c == char:
            indices.append(i)
    return indices

sample_text = "abracadabra"
target_char = 'a'
positions = find_char_in_string(sample_text, target_char)

if positions:
   print(f"Character '{target_char}' found at positions: {positions}")
else:
   print(f"Character '{target_char}' not found in the string.")

#Output: Character 'a' found at positions: [0, 3, 5, 7, 10]
```

This `find_char_in_string` function avoids using `str.find()` to demonstrate a manual indexing approach. The function iterates through each character of the given string using `enumerate`, which also gives the position. A check `if c == char` locates matching characters, and their positions are appended to the `indices` list. The output provides a clear list of the index positions where the character 'a' appears in "abracadabra". This method is valuable when you need access to the character's position in the string, for instance, in character manipulation.

Next, consider a scenario where you are dealing with a list of strings. In this situation, I've often encountered the necessity to identify which strings within a list contain a specific character, rather than just the overall position within the entire concatenated list of characters.  The key difference here lies in iterating over the list of strings and then performing individual character checks on each string.

Here's an example to identify which strings in a list contain a particular character:

```python
def find_char_in_string_list(string_list, char):
    """
    Locates strings within a list that contain a specific character.

    Args:
        string_list (list): A list of strings to search within.
        char (str): The character to locate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of strings that contain the specified character.
    """
    matching_strings = []
    for s in string_list:
        if char in s:
            matching_strings.append(s)
    return matching_strings

sample_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
target_char = 'e'
matching_list = find_char_in_string_list(sample_list, target_char)

if matching_list:
    print(f"Strings containing '{target_char}': {matching_list}")
else:
    print(f"No strings containing '{target_char}' found.")

# Output: Strings containing 'e': ['apple', 'cherry', 'date']
```

The `find_char_in_string_list` function illustrates a more complex task of searching in a collection of strings. Unlike the previous example, we're not trying to identify the position of a char inside one string but the strings containing specific char. The code iterates through each string in the `string_list`. The `if char in s` concisely checks if the target character exists in the current string. Matching strings are then accumulated into `matching_strings`. The output displays a list of all strings in the original list that contain the character 'e'. This technique is critical in scenarios like filtering search results or parsing structured text files, such as CSV.

Finally, the challenge elevates with a more complex structure, for example, a dictionary. In this case, you may need to check for character occurrences within both keys and values. The process now demands that we navigate through the dictionary items and apply similar string checks on each key and corresponding value. This method requires careful consideration of whether keys, values, or both need to be searched.

This example shows how to find keys containing a specific character, but it can be modified easily to check for values or both as required.

```python
def find_char_in_dict_keys(dictionary, char):
    """
     Locates keys within a dictionary that contain a specific character.

    Args:
        dictionary (dict): The dictionary to search within.
        char (str): The character to locate.

    Returns:
        list: A list of keys that contain the specified character.
    """
    matching_keys = []
    for key in dictionary:
        if char in key:
            matching_keys.append(key)
    return matching_keys

sample_dictionary = {"apple": 1, "banana": 2, "orange": 3, "grapefruit":4}
target_char = 'g'
matching_keys = find_char_in_dict_keys(sample_dictionary, target_char)

if matching_keys:
  print(f"Keys containing '{target_char}': {matching_keys}")
else:
   print(f"No keys containing '{target_char}' found.")

#Output: Keys containing 'g': ['orange', 'grapefruit']
```
Here, the `find_char_in_dict_keys` function iterates through each key in the `dictionary`. The same `if char in key` test is applied, and if a key contains the specified character it is added to `matching_keys`. The output provides a list of keys from the original dictionary that contain the character 'g'. This approach becomes vital while processing config files, web service responses (often represented as dictionaries in Python), or mapping structures that require specific elements to be located based on character patterns in their keys.

Regarding resource recommendations, I find that thoroughly exploring Python's official documentation on sequence types (lists, strings), mapping types (dictionaries), and the `re` module (for regular expressions) is essential. Also, working through examples in introductory books covering basic string processing and searching algorithms provides a solid foundational understanding. Practice with realistic scenarios, such as text parsing, log analysis, and data validation, significantly enhances the application of these concepts. The most effective approach I have found is to try different solutions, comparing their performance, and identifying edge cases. These experiences, particularly the errors I’ve encountered along the way, are invaluable for building a robust skill set in element location and character matching.
