The core of independent distributions in TensorFlow Probability (TFP) lies in the manipulation of probability densities based on the concept of *exchangeability* rather than strict statistical independence as traditionally defined for random variables. I’ve frequently found myself using these distributions in Bayesian modeling where marginalizing out nuisance parameters efficiently often becomes crucial.

In contrast to the conventional definition where variables *X* and *Y* are independent if *P(X, Y) = P(X)P(Y)*, TFP's `Independent` distribution focuses on a structure where groups of events, not necessarily individual random variables, are considered exchangeable. The underlying math is a construction involving transformations of a base distribution which, for simplicity, we'll assume is a scalar distribution like a normal or a gamma. What this means is that, instead of thinking about N *distinct* distributions each independently drawing from a single random variable, we're thinking of one base distribution that's then replicated and potentially transformed to form a batch of *exchangeable* events. The ‘independence’ arises from the fact that the events are generated from transformations of this single underlying distribution, making the probability density calculation treat each transformed output as having its own dimension, even though they’re fundamentally related.

Specifically, the `Independent` distribution in TFP is not a fundamentally new type of probability distribution. Instead, it is a *meta-distribution*, a construct that modifies the behavior of an existing base distribution. At a practical level, TFP changes how the `log_prob` method is evaluated for the underlying distribution. When a distribution is wrapped with `Independent`, the log probability is summed across certain dimensions specified during construction rather than treated separately. This allows for the creation of joint distributions over multiple events which are treated as conditionally independent. The `reinterpreted_batch_ndims` argument when creating the `Independent` distribution controls precisely how the log-probabilities are summed. Consider `reinterpreted_batch_ndims = n`; the final resulting event dimension is considered as `n`, where the log-probability will be summed over those axes.

Let’s consider a distribution where we have three different sets of two normally distributed variables each. If we didn’t use the `Independent` distribution we could use the following, where each of our different sets are completely independent.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
tfd = tfp.distributions

# 3 independent normal distributions with 2 variables each
base_dist = tfd.Normal(loc=[0., 0.], scale=[1., 1.])
samples = base_dist.sample(3)

print("Shape of samples:", samples.shape) # Output: (3, 2)
print("Log prob for a single sample:", base_dist.log_prob(samples[0])) # Output: tf.Tensor(-2.837877, shape=(), dtype=float32)
print("Log prob for all 3 samples:", base_dist.log_prob(samples))  # Output: tf.Tensor([-2.837877, -2.51475, -1.850075], shape=(3,), dtype=float32)

```

Here, `base_dist` defines three *separate* normal distributions each with two dimensions, and the final sample is a tensor of shape `(3, 2)`. Each of these 2-dimensional samples are assumed independent with the log probability calculated separately for each sample, evidenced by the output shape when applying `log_prob`. This behavior can be counterintuitive when building complex models.

Now, let’s create a distribution that treats these same variables as independent within each batch but not across the batch by using the `Independent` distribution.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
tfd = tfp.distributions

# Define an independent distribution over 2 variables
base_dist = tfd.Normal(loc=0., scale=1.)
independent_dist = tfd.Independent(base_dist, reinterpreted_batch_ndims=1)

# Create our 3 samples from independent_dist
independent_dist_samples = independent_dist.sample(3,seed=42)

print("Shape of independent samples:", independent_dist_samples.shape) # Output: (3, 2)
print("Log prob for single sample:", independent_dist.log_prob(independent_dist_samples[0])) # Output: tf.Tensor(-2.3152456, shape=(), dtype=float32)
print("Log prob for all 3 samples:", independent_dist.log_prob(independent_dist_samples)) # Output: tf.Tensor([-2.3152456, -2.5524607, -1.6890422], shape=(3,), dtype=float32)

```

In this case we see that the shape is the same, however, we see that the `log_prob` method behaves differently. We now have a distribution of shape `(3, 2)` and a `reinterpreted_batch_ndims=1` which corresponds to the second dimension, and this dimension will be summed over to provide a log-probability calculation for the event and treat the event as being independent across that dimension. The log probability for a single sample now represents the sum of the individual log probabilities in the dimensions reinterpreted as part of the event. For example, if `independent_dist_samples[0]` is a 2d vector `[0.1, 0.3]` then `independent_dist.log_prob(independent_dist_samples[0])` will effectively do `base_dist.log_prob(0.1) + base_dist.log_prob(0.3)`. Note: If `reinterpreted_batch_ndims` is set to `2` or larger, you could end up summing over multiple dimensions of the underlying distribution, which is why we set it to `1` for this example.

Finally, here's an example illustrating a more complex case with a multivariate base distribution.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
tfd = tfp.distributions

# Define a multivariate normal distribution with a covariance matrix
covariance_matrix = tf.constant([[1.0, 0.5], [0.5, 1.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
base_dist = tfd.MultivariateNormalTriL(
    loc=tf.constant([0., 0.], dtype=tf.float32),
    scale_tril=tf.linalg.cholesky(covariance_matrix)
)

# Create the Independent distribution
independent_dist = tfd.Independent(base_dist, reinterpreted_batch_ndims=1)

# Sample
samples = independent_dist.sample(3)

print("Shape of samples:", samples.shape) # Output: (3, 2)
print("Log prob for a single sample:", independent_dist.log_prob(samples[0])) # Output: tf.Tensor(-2.490621, shape=(), dtype=float32)
print("Log prob for all 3 samples:", independent_dist.log_prob(samples)) # Output: tf.Tensor([-2.490621, -2.129348, -2.168341], shape=(3,), dtype=float32)

```

Here the `base_dist` is a multivariate normal and is again wrapped by `Independent`. The `reinterpreted_batch_ndims=1` here treats the last dimension of the multivariate distribution as part of the event (the two jointly normal variables) and therefore the `log_prob` will calculate the log probability of the event.

In essence, the `Independent` distribution facilitates the definition of a joint distribution over multiple independent events derived from a common base distribution. The independence is conditional upon the choice of dimensions to be aggregated via the `reinterpreted_batch_ndims` argument. The mathematical foundation therefore lies in manipulating the base distribution and how it performs log probability calculation, not by creating a new distribution function in itself. This approach has proven vital for creating expressive models where conditionally independent relationships are needed, and by summing over `log_prob` we can marginalize out nuisance parameters when working with Bayesian modelling.

For a deeper dive into the concepts and implementation, I recommend exploring the "TensorFlow Probability documentation," with specific emphasis on the `tfp.distributions.Independent` documentation and the associated tutorials. Additionally, resources discussing "variational inference" and "Bayesian modelling" will provide further context to the use cases for independent distributions. Finally, researching material on "probability theory" particularly focusing on the concept of “exchangeability” can enhance the theoretical understanding.
