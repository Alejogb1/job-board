Copy elision, while a powerful optimization technique in C++, doesn't universally eliminate all copy operations.  Its effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the limitations of the compiler's ability to perform static analysis and the presence of certain language constructs.  In my experience optimizing high-performance C++ applications, I've observed several recurring scenarios where copy elision fails to materialize.

**1.  Limitations of Static Analysis:**

Copy elision relies heavily on the compiler's ability to analyze the code at compile time and determine whether a copy operation is truly unnecessary.  The compiler performs this analysis by examining the control flow and the lifetime of temporary objects. However, this analysis is not infallible, especially in complex scenarios involving templates, function pointers, or dynamic memory allocation.

Consider a function returning a large object by value:

```c++
struct LargeObject {
  double data[1000000];
};

LargeObject createLargeObject() {
  LargeObject obj;
  // ... initialization ...
  return obj;
}

int main() {
  LargeObject myObject = createLargeObject(); // Copy elision may or may not occur here
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, the compiler *might* elide the copy of `LargeObject` in `main()`.  The compiler identifies that the returned object is immediately assigned to `myObject`, and under certain optimization levels (typically -O2 or higher), it can optimize the copy away by constructing the object directly into the memory location allocated for `myObject`. However, the presence of intervening operations, function calls, or exceptions could prevent the compiler from confidently performing this optimization.  Adding a simple `std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl;` between the function call and assignment might, in some compiler implementations, preclude elision, as the compiler is unable to guarantee the precise temporal relationship between the function call and the subsequent assignment.


**2.  Explicit Copy/Move Constructors and Assignment Operators:**

The use of explicitly defined copy or move constructors (or assignment operators) can also hinder copy elision.  The compiler's ability to perform optimization is limited by the programmer's intent.  If a class explicitly defines a copy constructor or move constructor, the compiler is obliged to invoke these methods, even if a direct in-place construction would be more efficient. This often happens when dealing with resource management or custom memory allocation.


```c++
class ResourceHolder {
public:
  ResourceHolder() { resource = new int; *resource = 10; }
  ResourceHolder(const ResourceHolder& other) { resource = new int; *resource = *other.resource; } // Explicit copy constructor
  ~ResourceHolder() { delete resource; }
private:
  int* resource;
};

ResourceHolder createResource() {
  return ResourceHolder();
}

int main() {
  ResourceHolder holder = createResource(); // Copy constructor will be called; elision is prevented
  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the explicit copy constructor prevents copy elision.  Even though it's seemingly a simple assignment, the compiler cannot avoid calling the explicit copy constructor, leading to an unnecessary allocation and copy of the integer pointed to by `resource`. The move constructor, if defined, would help in this scenario, but the lack of one would also impede elision.


**3.  Return Value Optimization (RVO) and Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO):**

While closely related, RVO and NRVO are distinct from copy elision. RVO directly constructs the returned object in the location where the caller expects it, effectively eliminating the need for a copy or move operation. NRVO is a more sophisticated form of RVO that works even if the returned object is named within the function before being returned. The limitation here lies in the compilerâ€™s capacity to guarantee that this optimization is always possible. Complex control flow, exceptions, or the involvement of temporaries might prevent the compiler from executing NRVO.

```c++
struct ComplexStruct {
  // ... considerable data members ...
  ComplexStruct(int a, int b) : value1(a), value2(b) {}
  int value1;
  int value2;
};

ComplexStruct createComplexStruct(int a, int b) {
  ComplexStruct temp(a, b);  //potential candidate for NRVO
  return temp;
}

int main() {
  ComplexStruct result = createComplexStruct(5, 10); // NRVO might happen, but not guaranteed
  return 0;
}

```

In this example, the compiler *aims* to perform NRVO, eliminating the need for a copy. However, the compiler may not be able to guarantee this optimization, particularly if exceptions might be thrown or further complexities are introduced in the function `createComplexStruct`.

*  Effective Modern C++ (Scott Meyers)
*  Effective C++ (Scott Meyers)
*  More Effective C++ (Scott Meyers)


In summary, although copy elision is a significant optimization, it's not a silver bullet for eliminating all copy operations in C++. Compiler limitations in performing static analysis, explicit definition of copy/move constructors, and limitations inherent in RVO/NRVO all contribute to cases where copy elision fails to fully optimize copy operations. Understanding these limitations is crucial for writing efficient and predictable C++ code.  My years of experience working on high-frequency trading platforms have repeatedly highlighted the importance of being aware of these subtleties, as even small inefficiencies can accumulate to significant performance bottlenecks.
