The core issue with missing gradients in TensorFlow models often stems from improper control flow, particularly within custom training loops or when employing operations that TensorFlow's automatic differentiation (autograd) system cannot seamlessly traverse.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, including a large-scale recommendation system and a complex physics simulation, highlighted the critical role of `tf.GradientTape`'s `persistent` flag and the careful consideration of variable creation contexts.  Simply put, gradients aren't calculated for variables that are not part of the computational graph actively tracked by the `GradientTape`.

**1. Clear Explanation of Gradient Calculation in TensorFlow**

TensorFlow's gradient calculation relies on the concept of a computational graph.  Each operation performed on a tensor is implicitly (or explicitly, using `tf.function`) added to this graph. When `tf.GradientTape` is used, it records the operations within a specific scope. The `gradient()` method subsequently uses reverse-mode automatic differentiation to compute gradients of a target tensor (usually the loss) with respect to the trainable variables recorded by the `GradientTape`.  Variables outside this recorded scope, or variables created in a context where the `GradientTape` cannot track their dependencies, will not have gradients computed for them.  This typically manifests as `None` values when attempting to retrieve the gradients.

This frequently arises in situations involving conditional statements ( `if` blocks), loops ( `for`, `while`), and custom functions that are not appropriately decorated with `@tf.function`.  Within these structures, the variable creation or assignment might occur outside the tape's recording scope, resulting in the gradient calculation failing for those specific variables.  Furthermore, using `tf.stop_gradient` explicitly prevents the calculation of gradients for a given tensor, which can also lead to missing gradients if unintentionally applied to variables needing optimization.

Another subtle cause is the interaction between variable scopes and `GradientTape`.  Creating variables within nested scopes might inadvertently isolate them from the main `GradientTape`, rendering them untracked.  Finally, inconsistencies in data types or tensor shapes can trigger unexpected behaviors, often masking the underlying problem of gradient calculation.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

**Example 1: Incorrect Variable Creation within a Loop**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(0.0)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)

for i in range(10):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y = x * x  #Simple calculation
        loss = y
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, x)
    optimizer.apply_gradients([(grads, x)])

print(x)
```

This example demonstrates correct variable creation and gradient calculation. The variable `x` is created outside the loop, and each iteration of the loop correctly records the calculation of `y` and `loss` within the `GradientTape`.


**Example 2: Incorrect Variable Creation within a Conditional Statement**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    condition = tf.random.uniform([]) > 0.5
    if condition:
        x = tf.Variable(0.0) # Incorrect placement
        y = x * x
        loss = y
    else:
        x = tf.Variable(0.0) # Incorrect placement
        y = x + x
        loss = y

grads = tape.gradient(loss, x)
try:
    optimizer.apply_gradients([(grads, x)])
except:
    print("Gradient Calculation Failed - Variable x not tracked.")
```

Here, the creation of `x` is inside the conditional statement.  Since the `GradientTape` is initialized *before* the conditional statement, it cannot track the variable `x`. The `try-except` block catches the inevitable failure.  To rectify this, `x` must be created outside the conditional block.

**Example 3:  Using `tf.stop_gradient` incorrectly**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
y = tf.Variable(2.0)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    z = tf.stop_gradient(x) * y #Incorrect application of tf.stop_gradient
    loss = z * z

grads = tape.gradient(loss, [x,y])
print(grads) # Will show None for x, non-zero for y.

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  z = x * y
  loss = z * z
  grads = tape.gradient(loss, [x, y])
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, [x, y]))
  print(grads) #Will show non-zero gradients for both x and y
```

This illustrates the misuse of `tf.stop_gradient`.  While useful for preventing gradient flow through specific parts of the computation graph (e.g., in generative adversarial networks or when dealing with pre-trained layers),  applying it incorrectly will prevent gradient calculations for the variable `x`, leading to its weights remaining unchanged during optimization.  The second part showcases the correct usage, resulting in gradients being calculated and applied for both variables.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections detailing `tf.GradientTape` and its functionalities.  Further study of the TensorFlow eager execution model and its implications for gradient calculation is also beneficial.  Exploring resources on advanced TensorFlow techniques, including custom training loops and model optimization strategies, can provide insights into effective management of variables and gradient flows within complex models. A thorough understanding of calculus, particularly partial derivatives, is also crucial for comprehending the underlying mathematical principles of automatic differentiation.  Finally, working through practical examples and debugging common issues will solidify your understanding of gradient calculation mechanics within TensorFlow.
