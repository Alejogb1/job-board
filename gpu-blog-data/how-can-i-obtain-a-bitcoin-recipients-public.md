Obtaining a Bitcoin recipient's public key directly is impossible within the established framework of the Bitcoin protocol.  The protocol prioritizes the privacy and security of users, and public keys are not broadcast alongside transactions in a readily accessible manner.  Instead, the system relies on a cryptographic handshake, where the sender encrypts the transaction using the recipient's public key, which the recipient then decrypts using their corresponding private key.  My experience working on several Bitcoin-related projects, including a custom multi-signature wallet implementation and a Lightning Network node, has reinforced this understanding.

The core misunderstanding often lies in conflating a Bitcoin address with a public key.  A Bitcoin address is a one-way hash function of a public key, designed for human readability and ease of sharing.  Recovering the public key from the address is computationally infeasible due to the cryptographic properties of the hash function used (typically ripemd160 or SHA-256 variants). Attempting to reverse-engineer it would be analogous to trying to reconstruct a shredded document; the information is irreversibly lost.

Therefore, the only legitimate way to obtain a recipient's public key is through a direct, explicit exchange between the sender and the recipient. This exchange must be established outside the Bitcoin transaction layer and utilizes secure communication channels to prevent interception or manipulation. This process typically involves:

1. **Establishing Trust:**  Both parties must trust each other, either through pre-existing relationships or through verified identity methods.
2. **Secure Communication:**  A secure channel (e.g., a pre-shared secret, a digitally signed message, or a secure messaging platform) is necessary to prevent eavesdropping during the key exchange.
3. **Public Key Exchange:** The recipient provides their public key directly to the sender.  This is often done through a QR code, a text message, or an encrypted email exchange.


Let's illustrate this with three code examples, representing different scenarios and focusing on the exchange and verification phases.  Note that these examples focus on the exchange process, not the cryptographic algorithms themselves, as the implementation of those is readily available in existing cryptographic libraries. These examples are simplified for illustrative purposes and would require robust error handling and security measures in a production environment.  My experience with integrating libraries like OpenSSL and libsecp256k1 has informed these simplified representations.

**Example 1:  Simple Public Key Exchange (Python)**

This example showcases a simplified key exchange using Python's `base64` module for encoding and decoding the public key.  It assumes a secure communication channel is already established.

```python
import base64

# Assume recipient has a public key represented as bytes: recipient_public_key
recipient_public_key_base64 = base64.b64encode(recipient_public_key).decode('utf-8')

# Sender receives the public key
received_public_key_base64 = input("Enter recipient's public key (base64 encoded): ")
received_public_key = base64.b64decode(received_public_key_base64)

# Sender verifies the public key (This would involve a more robust check in a real system)
if received_public_key == recipient_public_key:
    print("Public key verified successfully.")
    # Proceed with transaction signing using received_public_key
else:
    print("Public key verification failed.")
```

**Example 2: Public Key Exchange with Signature Verification (C++)**

This example highlights signature verification to ensure the public key originates from the intended recipient. This requires a shared secret or a public key infrastructure (PKI) system for key authentication, outside the scope of this demonstration.  The code below is a conceptual outline.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
// ...Include necessary cryptographic libraries (e.g., OpenSSL)...

// ... Function to verify a signature using the recipient's public key ...
bool verifySignature(const std::string& message, const std::string& signature, const PublicKey& recipientPublicKey) {
    // ...Implementation using OpenSSL or similar library...
}

int main() {
    std::string recipientPublicKey; // Obtained securely from the recipient
    std::string message = "This is a test message";
    std::string signature; // Obtained securely from the recipient

    if (verifySignature(message, signature, recipientPublicKey)) {
        std::cout << "Signature verified. Public key is authenticated." << std::endl;
        // Proceed with transaction using recipientPublicKey
    } else {
        std::cout << "Signature verification failed." << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Example 3:  Secure Key Exchange using a Secure Messaging System (Conceptual)**

This illustrates a more secure approach leveraging a dedicated secure messaging platform. This abstract example avoids implementation details of specific messaging systems, focusing on the high-level process.

```
1. Sender and recipient establish communication via a secure messaging platform (e.g., Signal, a custom system with end-to-end encryption).
2. Recipient generates a key pair and sends their public key to the sender through the secure channel, potentially including a digital signature to verify authenticity.
3. Sender verifies the signature if applicable and uses the received public key to encrypt a transaction.
4. The sender shares the encrypted transaction with the recipient using the same secure channel.  The recipient uses their private key to decrypt and access the transaction.
```


Resource Recommendations:

For a deeper understanding of Bitcoin cryptography, explore books on elliptic curve cryptography and digital signatures.  Refer to documented specifications of the Bitcoin protocol and the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) for the most current and accurate information.  Consult reputable cryptographic libraries for their secure implementation of elliptic curve operations and signature schemes.  Study well-established security best practices when implementing key management and secure communication protocols to ensure robust security against various attacks.  Understanding these concepts is crucial for working securely with Bitcoin and its underlying infrastructure, as my experience has repeatedly shown.
