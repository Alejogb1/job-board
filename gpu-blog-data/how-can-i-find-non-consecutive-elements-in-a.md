Finding non-consecutive elements in a PyTorch tensor, specifically those matching a certain condition or set of conditions, requires leveraging the powerful indexing capabilities of the library combined with logical operations. My experience optimizing image processing pipelines within a large-scale medical imaging project has repeatedly highlighted the importance of efficient tensor manipulation; direct iteration, while conceptually simple, proves catastrophically slow on sizable tensors. The key is to use boolean masks and `torch.where` to avoid explicit loops and benefit from PyTorch's optimized backend.

Here's a structured approach to extract non-consecutive elements based on defined conditions:

**Explanation**

The core strategy involves generating a boolean mask tensor of the same shape as your input tensor. Each element within this mask is `True` if the corresponding element in the input tensor satisfies our defined condition(s), and `False` otherwise. This mask is then used as an index into the original tensor, effectively selecting only those values where the mask is `True`. Crucially, `torch.where` lets us retrieve the indices themselves when needed.

Consider a simple scenario: you want to find all elements in a tensor that are greater than a specific value. Instead of looping through the tensor and individually checking each element, you construct the boolean mask via a simple comparison like `tensor > threshold`. This operation is efficiently vectorized by PyTorch, making it much faster.

If you have multiple conditions, you combine the boolean masks using logical operations like `&` (AND), `|` (OR), and `~` (NOT). For example, to find elements within a specific range, you could combine two masks using AND, `(tensor > lower_bound) & (tensor < upper_bound)`. These logical operations are also vectorized and thus efficient.

Once you have a mask, you have two common options: retrieving the values themselves or finding the indices. The mask can be used to directly index the tensor itself, returning a 1D tensor of matching values. If the indices are also required, `torch.where` function comes in handy.  `torch.where(mask)` will return a tuple of tensors, each representing the coordinates where the mask is True. For example, if your tensor is 2D, `torch.where(mask)` returns two tensors: one representing the row indices and the other, the column indices of the matching elements.

**Code Examples**

Below are three examples demonstrating different scenarios encountered during my work, with detailed commentary:

**Example 1: Finding Elements Above a Threshold in a 1D Tensor**

```python
import torch

# Create a 1D tensor
tensor_1d = torch.tensor([1, 5, 2, 8, 3, 9, 4, 7, 6])

# Define a threshold
threshold = 5

# Create the boolean mask
mask_1d = tensor_1d > threshold

# Extract values meeting condition
values_above_threshold = tensor_1d[mask_1d]

# Get indices of the selected elements
indices_above_threshold = torch.where(mask_1d)[0]


print("Original Tensor:", tensor_1d)
print("Mask:", mask_1d)
print("Values Above Threshold:", values_above_threshold)
print("Indices Above Threshold:", indices_above_threshold)

```

*   **Commentary:** This demonstrates the most basic case: finding elements exceeding a single threshold in a 1D tensor. The mask `mask_1d` evaluates to `[False, False, False, True, False, True, False, True, True]`, selecting elements at indices 3, 5, 7, and 8 from the original tensor. `torch.where` is used to extract the corresponding indices which are [3,5,7,8]. Note that the return of `torch.where` is always a tuple, so for a 1D tensor the indices will be at the 0th index.

**Example 2: Finding Elements Within a Range in a 2D Tensor**

```python
import torch

# Create a 2D tensor
tensor_2d = torch.tensor([[1, 6, 2],
                        [9, 3, 8],
                        [5, 4, 7]])

# Define lower and upper bounds
lower_bound = 3
upper_bound = 7

# Create boolean masks for lower and upper bounds
mask_lower = tensor_2d > lower_bound
mask_upper = tensor_2d < upper_bound

# Combine masks using 'AND' operation
mask_combined = mask_lower & mask_upper

# Extract values matching the combined condition
values_in_range = tensor_2d[mask_combined]

# Get indices of the selected elements
indices_in_range = torch.where(mask_combined)

print("Original Tensor:\n", tensor_2d)
print("Mask (Lower):\n", mask_lower)
print("Mask (Upper):\n", mask_upper)
print("Combined Mask:\n", mask_combined)
print("Values in Range:", values_in_range)
print("Indices in Range:", indices_in_range)
```

*   **Commentary:** Here, we address a more complex scenario involving multiple conditions on a 2D tensor. We first create individual masks for `> lower_bound` and `< upper_bound`. These are then combined with `&` to create the `mask_combined`. We obtain the values with indexing, and `torch.where` returns a tuple with the row and column indices where the condition is met. Observe that indices are returned as tensors.

**Example 3: Finding Elements That Satisfy Complex Conditions Involving Multiple Tensor Values**

```python
import torch

# Create two 2D tensors
tensor_A = torch.tensor([[1, 6, 2],
                        [9, 3, 8],
                        [5, 4, 7]])

tensor_B = torch.tensor([[5, 2, 7],
                        [1, 8, 3],
                        [6, 9, 4]])

# Define conditions :
# Element in tensor_A > 3 AND Element in tensor B < 5

mask_A = tensor_A > 3
mask_B = tensor_B < 5

# Combine using AND operation
mask_combined = mask_A & mask_B

# Extract values based on mask
values_A_meeting_cond = tensor_A[mask_combined]
values_B_meeting_cond = tensor_B[mask_combined]

# get indices from the combined mask
indices_matching = torch.where(mask_combined)

print("Tensor A:\n", tensor_A)
print("Tensor B:\n", tensor_B)
print("Mask A:\n", mask_A)
print("Mask B:\n", mask_B)
print("Combined mask\n", mask_combined)
print("Values from A that meet the condition", values_A_meeting_cond)
print("Values from B that meet the condition", values_B_meeting_cond)
print("Indices of Matching elements", indices_matching)
```

*   **Commentary:** This shows combining conditions across multiple tensors. The example uses element-wise comparisons to form boolean masks for both tensors and the `&` operator to combine them. The resultant mask is then used to find specific elements from each tensor. Note that elementwise boolean logic is performed at the same location in each tensor, for example,  `mask_A` in location (0,0) is combined with `mask_B` location (0,0) to produce a `mask_combined` value at (0,0).

**Resource Recommendations**

For further study, I recommend exploring several avenues within the PyTorch ecosystem and the broader deep learning field:

1.  **PyTorch Documentation:** The official PyTorch documentation contains detailed explanations of all tensor operations, including advanced indexing and logical operations. Focus on the sections covering tensor creation, indexing, broadcasting and logical comparisons.

2.  **PyTorch Tutorials:** The PyTorch website also includes tutorials for a variety of tasks. Specifically, explore tutorials focusing on advanced tensor manipulation, where mask based filtering is often used.

3.  **Deep Learning Specialization Courses:** Online platforms offer courses that provide a theoretical background to deep learning and related tensor manipulations. These courses often include practical assignments where these techniques can be applied. These often cover vectorization in numpy and the underlying concepts are similar in PyTorch.

4. **General Python and Numerical Methods Resources**: Refreshing understanding on logical comparisons, boolean algebra and basic linear algebra concepts is highly beneficial for effective tensor programming.

By mastering these concepts, one can efficiently process large volumes of data by avoiding slow, procedural code. This method of using boolean masks and `torch.where` for non-consecutive element selection is the most performant way to deal with tensor elements conditional selection in PyTorch.
