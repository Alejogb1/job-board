PyTorch’s distributed training framework does, in fact, support GPU-to-GPU point-to-point (P2P) communication, although its implementation and utility require nuanced understanding. My experience building a large-scale object detection system involving multiple GPUs across different nodes highlighted the importance of efficient inter-GPU data transfer, leading me to delve deep into this specific area of PyTorch's distributed capabilities. While PyTorch's primary abstraction for distributed operations relies on collective communications (e.g., `all_reduce`, `all_gather`), P2P communication via `torch.distributed.send` and `torch.distributed.recv` offers a more granular approach, especially crucial for scenarios involving complex, irregular data dependencies between processes.

Fundamentally, P2P communication in PyTorch’s distributed setup relies on CUDA-aware MPI (Message Passing Interface) or NVIDIA’s NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library), depending on the selected backend. These libraries provide the low-level primitives for transferring tensors directly between GPUs without necessarily involving the CPU as an intermediary, which would be a bottleneck in high-throughput distributed training scenarios. While `torch.distributed` wraps these lower-level implementations, it is essential to recognize that the underlying infrastructure enables these efficient GPU-to-GPU data exchanges. The key distinction from collective operations is the directionality; collective operations typically operate on data across all participating ranks, whereas P2P is rank-specific. Thus, to implement P2P communication, one explicitly defines source and destination ranks and initiates transfers between them.

The primary use case I encountered for P2P operations was in implementing asynchronous gradient aggregation within a model-parallel training scheme. Model parallelism often necessitates that different parts of a neural network reside on different GPUs or nodes. After each mini-batch, only some GPUs may have the gradients necessary for further computation, requiring an irregular, point-to-point communication pattern. Rather than collecting all gradients on a single rank and then redistributing, which could introduce latency and memory pressure, I found directly passing the calculated gradients between the responsible processes via P2P significantly improved throughput. I utilized this approach for transferring embedding outputs in a transformer-based model where different parts of the input sequence were processed on different devices, and the intermediate results had to be aggregated before final processing layers.

Here are examples that illustrate how P2P communication can be used:

**Example 1: Simple Tensor Send and Receive:**

```python
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist
import os

def run_p2p(rank, world_size):
    dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl", init_method="env://", world_size=world_size, rank=rank)

    if rank == 0:
        tensor_to_send = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], device=f'cuda:{rank}')
        dist.send(tensor_to_send, dst=1)
        print(f"Rank {rank} sent tensor: {tensor_to_send}")
    elif rank == 1:
        tensor_to_receive = torch.zeros(3, device=f'cuda:{rank}')
        dist.recv(tensor_to_receive, src=0)
        print(f"Rank {rank} received tensor: {tensor_to_receive}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    world_size = 2
    os.environ['MASTER_ADDR'] = 'localhost'
    os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '12355'

    import torch.multiprocessing as mp
    mp.spawn(run_p2p,
            args=(world_size,),
            nprocs=world_size,
            join=True)
```

In this example, I initiate two processes. Process with `rank=0` creates a tensor on its GPU and then sends it to the process with `rank=1` which receives the tensor on its GPU. Note the explicit specification of `dst` (destination) and `src` (source) arguments, which are necessary for point-to-point communication. The tensors reside on GPUs in both send and receive operations without an intermediate transfer to CPU memory, enabled by the NCCL backend.

**Example 2: Using `isend` and `irecv` for Non-Blocking Operations:**

```python
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist
import os

def run_async_p2p(rank, world_size):
    dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl", init_method="env://", world_size=world_size, rank=rank)

    if rank == 0:
        tensor_to_send = torch.tensor([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], device=f'cuda:{rank}')
        send_req = dist.isend(tensor_to_send, dst=1)
        print(f"Rank {rank} initiated asynchronous send")
        send_req.wait()
        print(f"Rank {rank} send completed")
    elif rank == 1:
        tensor_to_receive = torch.zeros(3, device=f'cuda:{rank}')
        recv_req = dist.irecv(tensor_to_receive, src=0)
        print(f"Rank {rank} initiated asynchronous receive")
        recv_req.wait()
        print(f"Rank {rank} received tensor: {tensor_to_receive}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    world_size = 2
    os.environ['MASTER_ADDR'] = 'localhost'
    os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '12356'

    import torch.multiprocessing as mp
    mp.spawn(run_async_p2p,
            args=(world_size,),
            nprocs=world_size,
            join=True)

```

Here, I use `dist.isend` and `dist.irecv` for asynchronous communication. These operations are non-blocking, allowing the processes to proceed without immediately waiting for the data transfer to complete. I utilize the `wait()` method on the returned request objects to synchronize on the completion of the send and receive operations, ensuring data integrity. These non-blocking functions enable increased concurrency in situations where computations do not strictly depend on the incoming tensors, allowing for overlapping computation and communication.

**Example 3: Point-to-Point Communication in a Mini-Model Parallel Setting (Conceptual):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.distributed as dist
import os

class SubModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super(SubModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)


def model_parallel_run(rank, world_size):
    dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl", init_method="env://", world_size=world_size, rank=rank)

    input_size = 10
    hidden_size = 20
    output_size = 5

    if rank == 0:
        model_part1 = SubModel(input_size, hidden_size).to(f'cuda:{rank}')
        input_tensor = torch.randn(1, input_size, device=f'cuda:{rank}')
        intermediate_output = model_part1(input_tensor)
        dist.send(intermediate_output, dst=1)
        print(f"Rank {rank} sent intermediate output.")
    elif rank == 1:
        model_part2 = SubModel(hidden_size, output_size).to(f'cuda:{rank}')
        intermediate_output = torch.zeros(1, hidden_size, device=f'cuda:{rank}')
        dist.recv(intermediate_output, src=0)
        final_output = model_part2(intermediate_output)
        print(f"Rank {rank} received intermediate output and produced final output.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    world_size = 2
    os.environ['MASTER_ADDR'] = 'localhost'
    os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '12357'

    import torch.multiprocessing as mp
    mp.spawn(model_parallel_run,
            args=(world_size,),
            nprocs=world_size,
            join=True)
```

This third example is conceptual, demonstrating how P2P is applied in model parallel training. A simple model is split into two parts, placed on different GPUs, and P2P communication facilitates the transfer of intermediate outputs. While simplified, this illustrates the fundamental workflow in more sophisticated model-parallel architectures where different parts of a neural network can be spread across ranks.  While collective communication can achieve similar results in this specific scenario, the complexity of a larger model with more dependencies warrants the precision of targeted P2P operations.

In closing, while collective operations usually satisfy the requirements of standard data-parallel training, the capabilities for targeted communication using `torch.distributed.send` and `torch.distributed.recv` (and their asynchronous counterparts) in PyTorch are essential for achieving optimal performance in advanced distributed training scenarios.  Further deep dives can be achieved by researching the details of CUDA-aware MPI and NCCL. I recommend consulting relevant documentation on these technologies and exploring their specifics for enhancing the effectiveness of distributed training implementations. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and the nuances of these libraries facilitates both debugging and optimization within PyTorch's distributed framework.
