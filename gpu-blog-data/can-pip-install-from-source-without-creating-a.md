The core mechanism of `pip install` hinges on the creation of a wheel file (.whl) as an intermediate step, even when installing directly from source.  While this isn't strictly mandatory for simple projects, avoiding wheel creation entirely is exceptionally uncommon and generally discouraged for reasons I will elaborate on below. My experience building and distributing Python packages over the last decade, including contributions to several open-source libraries and internal tools, reinforces this observation.  The apparent circumvention is often a consequence of the build process itself and not a direct feature of `pip`.

**1. Explanation:**

`pip`'s workflow, at its foundation, aims for efficiency and reproducibility. The wheel format serves as a pre-built, platform-specific distribution that significantly accelerates subsequent installations.  When installing from source (using a setup.py or pyproject.toml), `pip` first checks if a suitable wheel exists. If not, it enters the build process. This build process, regardless of whether it involves setuptools, build, or a custom build backend, will ultimately produce a wheel file, even if only temporarily.  This wheel is then used for installation.  The temporary nature of this intermediate wheel is often the source of confusion; the user doesn't explicitly see it, and it’s often deleted after the installation.  To truly avoid wheel creation, you'd need to bypass `pip`'s standard build and install process completely, which is generally not recommended for maintainability and consistency.

The reasons for this structured approach are multifaceted:

* **Reproducibility:** The wheel file encapsulates the build environment and its dependencies, ensuring consistent installations across different systems. This is critical for avoiding discrepancies between development and deployment environments.

* **Efficiency:**  Building and installing from source is computationally expensive. The wheel acts as a cache, allowing subsequent installations (or installs on different machines) to bypass the potentially lengthy build process.

* **Platform Specificity:** Wheels are compiled for specific operating systems and Python versions (e.g., cp39-cp39-win_amd64).  This targeted compilation further enhances performance and compatibility.

* **Dependency Management:**  The wheel file inherently includes metadata about dependencies, allowing `pip` to handle dependency resolution more effectively.

Attempts to force `pip` to install directly from the uncompiled source without an intermediate wheel usually involve modifying build scripts or using extremely specific command-line flags. However, these methods often create more problems than they solve, introducing significant risks of broken installations or inconsistent behavior.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Standard `pip` Installation (Implicit Wheel Creation):**

```bash
pip install .  # Installs from the current directory's setup.py or pyproject.toml
```

This is the standard approach.  `pip` will detect the project structure, invoke the appropriate build system (setuptools, poetry, etc.), create a wheel file (likely in a temporary directory), install the package from the wheel, and then clean up the temporary files.  There's no explicit wheel creation command; it's handled internally.  Observing the temporary directory during the installation will reveal the presence of the temporary wheel file.

**Example 2:  Illustrative (and generally discouraged) attempt to bypass wheel creation (using --no-binary):**

```bash
pip install --no-binary :all: .
```

The `--no-binary :all:` flag tells `pip` to avoid using pre-built binaries, including wheels.  However, this doesn't guarantee that a wheel isn't created as an intermediate step by the build backend; it only prevents `pip` from using pre-existing wheels. The build process itself might still generate a wheel, albeit temporarily.  This is unreliable and strongly discouraged for production environments due to its unpredictable behavior across different project setups and build backends. In some cases,  it might simply lead to a build failure if the project requires compilation steps.

**Example 3:  Installing a purely Python project without explicit build steps (rare and project-specific):**

Let’s assume a simplified project that consists only of Python files with no C extensions or other compilation requirements.  In such a specific circumstance, `pip` might not produce a wheel file (although it is possible).

```python
# my_package/__init__.py
def my_function():
    return "Hello from my package!"
```

Assuming no `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`, `pip install .` could, depending on pip's implementation and your system, install the package directly without generating a wheel file. This is, however, a highly specific scenario, and such projects are exceedingly uncommon.  Real-world projects will almost always involve a `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` to manage dependencies and build processes, triggering wheel generation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official `pip` documentation.
* The documentation for your chosen build system (setuptools, poetry, flit, etc.).
* Advanced Python packaging tutorials and books.  These resources usually cover build systems, dependency management, and deployment in detail.
* Documentation related to the wheel package format itself.  Understanding the wheel format aids in comprehending `pip`'s internal operations.


In conclusion, while `pip`'s internal mechanisms might create and subsequently delete a wheel file as a temporary intermediate build artifact even when seemingly installing directly from source, attempting to completely bypass wheel creation is generally counterproductive.  The wheel format is integral to `pip`'s design for efficient, reproducible, and robust package management.  The methods that seem to avoid wheel creation are often unreliable, potentially leading to build failures or inconsistent installations.  Focusing on proper project structuring and utilizing standard build tools like setuptools or poetry remains the most effective approach for managing Python packages.
