Determining the input size for a PyTorch script module, especially when dealing with models loaded from disk or those constructed with flexible architectures, requires a slightly different approach than what’s often used for standard PyTorch models. Specifically, a scripted model doesn’t automatically expose input dimension information in the same way a dynamically built model might during forward passes. My experience has shown that relying on introspection of the forward method’s argument signature after scripting is generally unreliable. The primary challenge stems from the static nature of a script module – once compiled by `torch.jit.script`, it no longer behaves like a standard Python class with dynamically discoverable properties. Thus, we must explore alternative methods to ascertain expected input dimensions.

The most robust way I've found to handle this challenge involves explicitly recording the expected input shape during the model definition or during the scripting process itself. This information can be embedded within the script module as metadata or retrieved separately. The key is to avoid relying on runtime inferences, as the `torch.jit.script` compilation process essentially hardcodes the tensor shapes the model is designed to accept. Let's consider three scenarios and code implementations that illustrate this concept.

**Scenario 1: Embedding input size during module definition using a custom attribute**

In this approach, we modify the module constructor to store the expected input shape as an attribute. This method is particularly useful when building a model from scratch.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(CustomModule, self).__init__()
        self.input_size = input_size # Store the input size
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Initialize with input shape (10)
model = CustomModule(input_size=10, hidden_size=32)
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(model)

# Access the stored input size from the scripted module's attributes
input_size = scripted_model.input_size
print(f"Scripted model expects input size: {input_size}")

dummy_input = torch.randn(1, input_size) # use stored size to generate input
output = scripted_model(dummy_input)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")

```

This example demonstrates embedding the input size as `self.input_size` within the `CustomModule`. During scripting, this value gets retained. We can retrieve it from `scripted_model.input_size` after scripting. This offers a straightforward way to track the anticipated input dimension for subsequent uses. Note the explicit use of `1` in `torch.randn(1, input_size)` indicating the batch size for the input. For a multi batch scenario, use `torch.randn(n, input_size)` where `n` is the batch size.

**Scenario 2: Explicitly capturing the input size during scripting with a wrapper function**

If modifying the original model definition is not feasible (e.g., loading a pre-trained model), a wrapper function that captures the input size just before scripting can be an effective technique. This technique decouples the recording mechanism from the core model architecture.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class PretrainedModel(nn.Module):  # Imagine this was loaded from disk
    def __init__(self):
        super(PretrainedModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128) # Example input size (flattened MNIST)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

def script_model_with_input_size(model, input_size):
    """Scripts a model and captures its input size.

    Args:
        model: The PyTorch model to script.
        input_size: A tuple or list representing the expected input size.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing the scripted model and its expected input size.
    """

    class WrappedModel(nn.Module): # Define a wrapper
        def __init__(self, model):
            super(WrappedModel, self).__init__()
            self.model = model
            self.input_size = input_size # Assign here, outside the original module
        def forward(self, x):
            return self.model(x)

    wrapper_model = WrappedModel(model)
    scripted_wrapper = torch.jit.script(wrapper_model)
    return scripted_wrapper, scripted_wrapper.input_size # return the scripted module and its size


# Load the pre-trained model
pretrained_model = PretrainedModel()
# Capture input size: (batch_size, 784)
scripted_model, input_size = script_model_with_input_size(pretrained_model, (1, 784))

print(f"Scripted model expects input size: {input_size}")
dummy_input = torch.randn(input_size) # use captured size to generate input
output = scripted_model(dummy_input)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")

```

Here, the `script_model_with_input_size` function encapsulates the model and the input size into a wrapper class. This wrapper includes a custom `input_size` attribute, and the model can be scripted within this scope. As the wrapper is explicitly scripted, the attribute is retained for later use. Notably, the `input_size` captured here can now be a tuple or list representing the full input dimension for batched data. This approach provides a non-invasive solution for existing models.

**Scenario 3: Using metadata within the scripted module itself**

This technique entails encoding the input size as metadata during scripting. This is beneficial because it keeps all the relevant information within the script module. However, accessing metadata requires slightly different syntax, compared to accessing a class attribute.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MetadataModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(MetadataModule, self).__init__()
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = MetadataModule(input_size=128, hidden_size=64)

# Use a dictionary to hold metadata
model._input_metadata = {"input_size" : model.input_size}
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(model)


# Access the metadata
input_size = scripted_model._input_metadata["input_size"]

print(f"Scripted model expects input size: {input_size}")

dummy_input = torch.randn(1, input_size)
output = scripted_model(dummy_input)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

In this method, we are setting a protected attribute `_input_metadata` with the input size for the model. `torch.jit.script` will preserve this metadata. Note that the metadata is accessed using the method `_input_metadata` with an index rather than a class attribute. This approach offers another effective way to track input shapes without significantly altering model architectures. While this approach works for basic metadata, more complex data should be handled carefully.

In summary, determining the input size of a PyTorch scripted module requires explicit tracking during definition or the scripting process. I’ve found three approaches to be consistently reliable. Embedding input dimensions as module attributes offers simplicity when building models. Using wrapper functions is more flexible, and allows capturing input information for already available models. Alternatively, using metadata within the script module provides a way to store and access this information directly. The choice of method often depends on the constraints of the project. It is vital to understand the static nature of scripted models, which requires a departure from dynamic introspection of model methods. I recommend consulting PyTorch's official documentation on `torch.jit.script` for further details, as well as exploring tutorials concerning the best practices for deploying torchscript models. Examining the source code of related libraries that use scripted models can offer practical insights. Furthermore, articles that illustrate advanced techniques for static analysis of PyTorch models may prove useful in understanding related topics.
