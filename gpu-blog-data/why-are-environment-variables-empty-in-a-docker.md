The root cause of empty environment variables within a Docker container's bash shell frequently stems from a mismatch between how the environment is defined at build time versus how it's accessed during runtime.  This isn't inherently a Docker flaw, but rather a consequence of how Dockerfiles and container execution interact.  My experience debugging this issue across numerous microservices deployed in production environments – especially those leveraging complex build processes and multi-stage Dockerfiles – highlights the critical need for precision in environment variable management.

**1.  A Clear Explanation:**

Docker containers inherit their environment from the process that creates them. This process isn't simply the `docker run` command, but rather the entrypoint process specified within the Dockerfile, or the default command if none is explicitly set.  The environment variables available within the container are a combination of:

* **Base Image Environment:** The underlying base image (e.g., `ubuntu:latest`, `alpine:3.17`)  might predefine certain environment variables. These are typically limited and often related to the base OS configuration.

* **Dockerfile `ENV` instructions:**  These instructions set environment variables during the image *build* process.  Crucially, variables set this way become part of the image's *layers*.  They are baked into the image itself.

* **`docker run` command-line options:**  The `-e` flag allows setting environment variables at *runtime*. These variables are passed to the container's entrypoint, *overriding* any conflicting variables defined earlier in the Dockerfile.  These are not part of the image layers; they exist only during the container's execution.

* **Entrypoint script behaviour:** If an entrypoint script is used (recommended for robust container orchestration), its behaviour is paramount.  The script might read environment variables from files, override them internally, or even redefine them entirely. This is where many subtle errors arise.

The key takeaway is the separation of build-time and runtime contexts. Variables defined using `ENV` in the Dockerfile are not inherently accessible to the container's bash shell unless correctly propagated by the container's processes.  Similarly, runtime variables passed via `docker run -e` might be overshadowed by how the entrypoint script handles its environment.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Variable Propagation:**

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu:latest

ENV MY_VAR="Hello from build time"

CMD ["bash"]
```

```bash
# Running the container
docker build -t my-image .
docker run -it my-image
echo $MY_VAR # Output: Hello from build time (works as expected)
```

In this case, the variable is set during the build and is directly accessible within the shell, since the `CMD` instruction directly invokes `bash`.  However, this is a simplification.  More complex scenarios will require a more robust handling of the environment.

**Example 2: Runtime Override & Entrypoint Script:**

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu:latest

ENV MY_VAR="Default Value"

COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

```bash
# entrypoint.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Entrypoint script started."
echo "MY_VAR from within script: $MY_VAR"
exec "$@"
```

```bash
# Running the container
docker build -t my-image-2 .
docker run -it -e MY_VAR="Overridden Value" my-image-2
```

Here, the entrypoint script outputs the value of `MY_VAR` as it finds it before executing the rest of the command (in this case, a simple bash shell). The `docker run -e` option overrides the build-time value, demonstrating the runtime prioritization.

**Example 3: Incorrect Environment File Loading in Entrypoint:**

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu:latest

COPY .env /app/.env
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```

```bash
# .env
MY_VAR="Value from .env"
# entrypoint.sh
#!/bin/bash
source /app/.env
echo "MY_VAR from .env: $MY_VAR"
exec "$@"
```

```bash
# Running the container
docker build -t my-image-3 .
docker run -it my-image-3
```

This illustrates potential issues when relying on environment files loaded by an entrypoint.  If the path or file loading mechanism within the entrypoint script is incorrect, the intended environment variables might remain inaccessible.  In this example, if the `.env` file isn't found or the `source` command fails, the variable will be empty.  Robust error handling in the entrypoint is crucial to prevent such issues.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Docker documentation is an invaluable resource for understanding the nuances of Dockerfiles and image building. It offers a wealth of information on best practices and troubleshooting common issues like environment variable handling.  Deepening your understanding of shell scripting and process management within Linux environments is also essential.  Familiarity with the `env`, `export`, and `set` commands will prove indispensable when debugging environment-related problems in Docker containers.  Finally, a thorough grasp of the Linux system call interface, specifically those related to process creation and environment inheritance, provides a deeper, more fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanics.  Mastering these core concepts will greatly improve your ability to avoid and troubleshoot these types of problems.
