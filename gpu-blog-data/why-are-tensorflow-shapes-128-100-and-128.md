TensorFlow's underlying computations are primarily rooted in linear algebra, necessitating precise dimensionality agreement for operations. A shape of `(128, 100)` and a shape of `(128, 100, 139)` are fundamentally incompatible due to their differing ranks (number of dimensions). The first tensor is a 2D matrix, conceptually akin to a table with 128 rows and 100 columns, while the second is a 3D tensor, often visualized as a cube or a stack of 2D matrices, with 128 such matrices, each having 100 rows and 139 columns. These are not merely different shapes; they represent data with distinct structural arrangements, preventing most mathematical operations between them directly.

The core reason for this incompatibility stems from the requirements of matrix multiplication, element-wise operations, and broadcasting. For matrix multiplication, the inner dimensions must align. Element-wise operations, such as addition or subtraction, demand identical shapes. While broadcasting allows operations between tensors of differing ranks under specific conditions, it won't reconcile fundamentally mismatched dimensionalities such as a 2D matrix and a 3D tensor, unless very specific rules are met. In essence, there isn't a mathematically sound way to directly perform element-wise or matrix multiplication between these two tensors without an explicit operation designed to modify them first.

I have encountered these shape mismatches frequently, specifically in image processing and sequence modeling. I can recall debugging an issue in an image classification model where convolutional layers were followed by fully connected layers expecting flattened inputs. The earlier convolutional layers output image data with a shape of `(batch_size, height, width, channels)`. The fully connected layers expected data shaped as `(batch_size, flattened_size)`. If these layers weren't adapted through a reshape or flatten operation, the model would have thrown shape incompatibility errors. I remember another incident during sequence to sequence learning when input sequences and encoded state vector’s shape wouldn't align with the decoder layer’s input and attention mechanisms; such mismatches resulted in runtime exceptions during training. It was during such experiences I started internalizing the importance of dimension awareness when dealing with tensor operations.

Consider the following code examples:

**Example 1: Attempting Element-Wise Addition**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_2d = tf.random.normal(shape=(128, 100))
tensor_3d = tf.random.normal(shape=(128, 100, 139))

try:
  result = tensor_2d + tensor_3d
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
  print(f"Error Encountered: {e}")
```

In this snippet, the addition of a 2D tensor and a 3D tensor, despite having matching leading dimensions (128, 100), triggers an error. TensorFlow cannot broadcast these tensors because their dimensionalities differ. Addition is inherently an element-wise operation, and for the operation to proceed the tensors must have compatible shapes. This highlights that matching leading dimensions isn't sufficient when tensor ranks differ. The `try...except` block catches the `InvalidArgumentError`, allowing us to examine the specific cause. It demonstrates that element-wise operations demand either identical shapes or shape compatibilities that permit broadcasting, neither of which applies here.

**Example 2: Attempting Matrix Multiplication**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_2d = tf.random.normal(shape=(128, 100))
tensor_3d = tf.random.normal(shape=(128, 100, 139))

try:
  result = tf.matmul(tensor_2d, tensor_3d)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
  print(f"Error Encountered: {e}")
```

Here, I attempted matrix multiplication using `tf.matmul`. The fundamental requirement for matrix multiplication is that the inner dimensions must align. For `tf.matmul(A, B)`, the last dimension of 'A' needs to match the second to last dimension of 'B'. In this scenario, A's shape is (128, 100), and B's shape is (128, 100, 139). Notice that while the second dimension of the 2D tensor is 100, the 3D tensor has shapes (128, 100, and 139). This makes matrix multiplication impossible because the inner dimensions do not align, and there's no way to define a compatible operation without prior modifications.

**Example 3: Reshaping and Broadcasting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_2d = tf.random.normal(shape=(128, 100))
tensor_3d = tf.random.normal(shape=(128, 100, 139))

#Reshaping the 2D tensor
tensor_2d_reshaped = tf.reshape(tensor_2d, shape=(128, 100, 1))

#Broadcasting Addition

result = tensor_2d_reshaped + tensor_3d

print(f"Result Shape: {result.shape}")
```

This example illustrates a pathway to perform an operation between the 2D and 3D tensors. I first reshape `tensor_2d` from `(128, 100)` to `(128, 100, 1)`. Now the ranks are equal (both 3D).  Broadcasting rules allow the dimension of 1 in the last axis to stretch and thus enable the element-wise addition with the tensor shaped (128,100, 139). Reshaping or adding a new dimension explicitly makes both tensors compatible.

To enhance understanding, I would recommend consulting the TensorFlow documentation on `tf.reshape`, `tf.matmul`, broadcasting, and the conceptual basis of tensors and their operations. The official TensorFlow tutorials, often organized by task (e.g., image recognition, sequence processing), frequently demonstrate shape manipulations in practical settings. Also, exploring the mathematics behind linear algebra helps solidify comprehension of how tensors are manipulated under the hood. Books detailing tensor algebra, multi-linear algebra and applied linear algebra can be invaluable resources.

In conclusion, the incompatibility between shapes `(128, 100)` and `(128, 100, 139)` arises from their different dimensionalities (rank), which violates the rules of both element-wise operations and matrix multiplication in TensorFlow. While techniques like reshaping and broadcasting can bridge certain shape differences, the fundamental nature of tensors as data structures with specific dimensional arrangements dictates the operations that can be applied without generating errors. Awareness of these constraints and proficiency in tensor manipulation are critical for successful TensorFlow development.
