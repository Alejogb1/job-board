The core challenge in directing Jupyter Notebook to utilize a specific GPU within a multi-GPU system lies in correctly configuring the underlying Python environment and ensuring the chosen GPU is explicitly selected by the kernels used within the notebook.  My experience troubleshooting this on large-scale HPC clusters and cloud instances has highlighted the importance of precise environment management and leveraging the appropriate CUDA/cuDNN libraries, as well as the specific runtime features of the chosen kernel.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Effectively harnessing a dedicated GPU requires a multi-pronged approach.  Firstly, you must have the necessary CUDA toolkit and drivers installed, correctly configured, and compatible with your GPU architecture.  Secondly, your Python environment needs to be aware of the available GPUs and possess the capability to leverage them.  Finally, the Jupyter Notebook kernel itself must be capable of targeting a specific device. This involves setting appropriate environment variables and potentially utilizing library-specific configurations. Incorrect configuration at any of these stages results in the default GPU being selected, or even worse, the CPU being used for computationally intensive operations, severely impacting performance.

The most prevalent mistake I've encountered is assuming that merely having CUDA installed is sufficient.  This is often not the case; the environment must explicitly declare which GPU to use.  Failure to do so leaves the selection to the runtime, leading to unpredictable and inconsistent results, especially across different systems and workloads.

Furthermore, the specific method for GPU selection varies depending on the libraries used within the notebook.  Libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and RAPIDS each have their own mechanisms for device specification.  Inconsistencies between these library configurations can lead to conflicts, with one library potentially overriding the GPU selection made by another.  This often requires careful coordination of the environment variables and configurations related to these libraries.

In summary, successful GPU selection necessitates rigorous control over the CUDA environment, precise Python environment setup, and attentive configuration of the kernels and libraries used within the Jupyter Notebook itself.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES (Environment Variable Approach):**

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf

# Specify the GPU index (0 for the first GPU, 1 for the second, and so on).
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '1'

# Verify GPU selection.  This will print the GPU ID in use.
print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))

# Proceed with TensorFlow operations.
# ... your TensorFlow code ...
```

This method leverages the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable, a common approach across many libraries.  This approach limits the visibility of the CUDA runtime to only the specified GPU.  Any operation using CUDA will implicitly use this designated device.  The verification step ensures the correct GPU is selected before launching computationally expensive tasks.  This is crucial, especially in multi-user environments where accidental overriding of this variable could lead to unexpected resource contention.

**Example 2: PyTorch Device Specification:**

```python
import torch

# Specify the GPU device.
device = torch.device('cuda:1' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

# Move tensors to the specified device.
x = torch.randn(100, 100)
x = x.to(device)

# Perform operations on the device.
# ... your PyTorch code ...
```

PyTorch provides a more direct approach using the `torch.device` object.  This explicitly assigns the tensor operations to the desired GPU. The `if` statement handles the scenario where CUDA is unavailable, gracefully falling back to CPU computation.  The explicit `.to(device)` call is essential; otherwise, operations could still occur on the CPU or a default GPU. This is particularly important in scenarios involving data loading and model transfer.


**Example 3: Using NVIDIA NCCL with RAPIDS:**

```python
import cudf
import cupy as cp

# Assuming cuDF is configured to use GPU 1.
df = cudf.DataFrame({'a': cp.arange(10000)})  # Dataframe on GPU 1

# ... perform computations using cuDF and cuPy ...
```

RAPIDS libraries like cuDF and cuPy, built for GPU acceleration, often implicitly utilize the GPU based on their configuration. While explicit device specification may not always be necessary, proper initialization during library setup is critical.  In larger-scale projects using NCCL for multi-GPU communication, ensuring consistent device selection across all processes is paramount for correct operation. My experience debugging these systems has taught me to diligently check the output of `nvidia-smi` to confirm GPU usage and prevent unexpected behaviour.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* Consult the official documentation for CUDA, cuDNN, and your chosen deep learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, RAPIDS).
* Utilize the NVIDIA Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute profiling tools for detailed GPU performance analysis.
* Familiarize yourself with the system monitoring tools provided by your operating system or cluster manager to track GPU resource utilization.  This is vital for identifying resource contention and optimization opportunities.
* Explore comprehensive guides on setting up and managing CUDA-capable environments for high-performance computing.  Pay attention to the specifics relevant to your chosen GPU architecture.
* Consider investing time in learning advanced techniques like GPU memory management and asynchronous programming for enhanced efficiency in your GPU-accelerated workflows.

By adhering to these practices and utilizing the appropriate tools, you can reliably target specific GPUs within your Jupyter Notebook environment, maximizing computational resources and achieving optimal performance in multi-GPU systems.  Remember that consistent attention to detail throughout the entire process—from environment setup to code execution—is paramount to success.
