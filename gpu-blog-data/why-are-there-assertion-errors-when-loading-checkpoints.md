Assertion errors during checkpoint loading on a CPU are frequently rooted in discrepancies between the model's architecture and the state stored within the checkpoint file.  My experience debugging these issues across numerous projects, predominantly involving large-scale language models and generative adversarial networks, points consistently to this core problem.  The checkpoint, a serialized representation of the model's parameters and potentially optimizer state, must precisely mirror the model's instantiation at load time. Any mismatch – in layer types, parameter shapes, or even the presence of auxiliary data – will trigger assertions designed to prevent silent failures and subsequent unpredictable behavior.

The explanation hinges on the checkpoint's internal structure.  Checkpoints are essentially structured data files, often employing formats like PyTorch's `.pth` or TensorFlow's SavedModel, that encapsulate the numerical values of model weights, biases, and potentially gradients.  Crucially, these files also implicitly (or explicitly) encode the model's architecture. The loading process involves a two-stage comparison: first, a structural verification against the loaded model's definition; second, a numerical assignment of values from the checkpoint to the model's parameters.  Assertion errors arise when the first stage fails; the shapes or types within the checkpoint don't match the expected shapes and types within the newly instantiated model.

This discrepancy can originate from several sources. A common scenario is version mismatch.  If the checkpoint was saved using a different version of a deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch 1.10 vs. 1.13), the internal serialization format might subtly change, leading to incompatibility. Another frequent cause is architectural drift. If the model definition (the code that creates the model) is altered after saving the checkpoint – for example, adding or removing layers, changing activation functions, or modifying parameter sizes – the loading process will inevitably fail. Finally, inconsistencies can be introduced by manual checkpoint manipulation.  Attempts to directly edit checkpoint files, without understanding their internal structure, can easily corrupt the data and lead to assertion errors upon loading.


**Code Example 1: Version Mismatch**

```python
# Model definition (v1)
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModelV1(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)

model_v1 = MyModelV1()
torch.save(model_v1.state_dict(), 'model_v1.pth')

# Model definition (v2) - Added a layer
class MyModelV2(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)  # Added layer

model_v2 = MyModelV2()
try:
    model_v2.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_v1.pth'))
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Assertion error caught: {e}")
    # Expect an error because 'model_v2' has an extra layer.
```

This example demonstrates a version mismatch scenario where adding a layer (`linear2`) in `MyModelV2` causes a mismatch with the checkpoint saved from `MyModelV1`.  The `load_state_dict` function will attempt to map the weights from `model_v1.pth` to `model_v2`, resulting in an assertion error because of a missing key or an unexpected key shape.


**Code Example 2:  Architectural Drift (Parameter Shape)**

```python
# Model definition (v1)
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModelV1(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)

model_v1 = MyModelV1()
torch.save(model_v1.state_dict(), 'model_v1.pth')

# Model definition (v2) - Changed parameter shape
class MyModelV2(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(20, 5)  # Input dimension changed

model_v2 = MyModelV2()
try:
    model_v2.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_v1.pth'))
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Assertion error caught: {e}")
    # Expect an error because of size mismatch in the linear layer.
```

Here, altering the input dimension of the linear layer from 10 to 20 in `MyModelV2` creates an incompatibility. The checkpoint contains weights for a 10-dimensional input, which cannot be directly mapped to a 20-dimensional input layer.  The assertion error highlights this size mismatch.


**Code Example 3:  Data Type Discrepancy (Less Common)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)

model = MyModel()
#Save with float16
model.half()
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model_fp16.pth')

model2 = MyModel()
#Load with float32 (default)
try:
    model2.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_fp16.pth'))
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Assertion error caught: {e}")
    #May result in error if the model doesn't handle mixed precision correctly.
```

This example highlights a less frequent but still possible source of error: data type mismatch.  Saving a model's weights in half-precision (FP16) and loading into a model expecting full-precision (FP32) might lead to an assertion error, depending on the framework's handling of type conversions.  Explicit type casting might resolve it, but implicit conversions can lead to subtle inaccuracies causing unexpected assertion errors later in the training or inference process.



To avoid these assertion errors, meticulous version control of both the model definition and the deep learning framework is paramount.   Employing rigorous testing procedures, particularly unit tests specifically designed to verify checkpoint loading,  is essential.  Moreover, I recommend carefully logging the framework version and model architecture alongside the checkpoint file.  This metadata allows for automated verification during loading.  Finally, understanding the internal structure of your chosen checkpoint format, at least at a high level, will provide invaluable insight during debugging.  The documentation for your specific deep learning framework will provide further detail on checkpoint management and potential error scenarios.
