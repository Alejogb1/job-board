Excessive register allocation in NVCC-generated PTX code can significantly impact performance, particularly in scenarios involving limited register resources on the target hardware.  My experience optimizing CUDA kernels for high-throughput applications on various NVIDIA architectures has consistently shown that inefficient register usage leads to increased spill-fill operations, thereby negating the benefits of parallel processing. This is not simply a matter of code size; the latency and bandwidth overhead associated with memory access for spilled registers dwarf the potential savings from reduced instruction count.

**1. Explanation:**

The NVCC compiler, responsible for translating CUDA C++ code into PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) assembly, employs sophisticated register allocation strategies. Its goal is to minimize register spills, i.e., storing intermediate computation results to memory instead of dedicated registers.  However, several factors can lead to suboptimal register allocation. These include complex data dependencies within the kernel, excessive use of temporary variables, and limitations within the compiler's optimization heuristics.  The architecture itself also plays a vital role; devices with a lower register count per multiprocessor are more susceptible to performance degradation due to register spills.

Registers reside within the Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) and offer significantly faster access times compared to global, shared, or constant memory.  Each thread within a warp executes instructions concurrently, and efficient register usage allows for the concurrent execution of multiple warps, maximizing occupancy.  When registers are exhausted, the compiler introduces spill code, which involves writing register contents to local memory and then reloading them later. This introduces significant latency: accessing local memory incurs a much higher cost than accessing a register.  Furthermore, the increased memory traffic can lead to memory bank conflicts, further impacting performance.  This performance penalty manifests as reduced throughput and increased execution time, particularly noticeable in memory-bound kernels.

Therefore, the detrimental effect isn't solely about code size inflation, although that can impact instruction cache performance. The primary concern is the substantial overhead introduced by the increased memory accesses associated with spill-fill operations.  The impact is most pronounced in computationally intensive kernels where a high degree of parallelism is expected.  In less computationally intensive kernels, the impact might be negligible or even undetectable within the overall execution time.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inefficient Register Usage**

```cuda
__global__ void inefficientKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    int temp1 = a[i] * 2;
    int temp2 = b[i] + 3;
    int temp3 = temp1 * temp2;
    int temp4 = temp3 / 4;
    int temp5 = temp4 + 5;
    c[i] = temp5;
  }
}
```

This kernel uses numerous temporary variables (`temp1` to `temp5`).  The compiler might struggle to allocate all these variables to registers, especially for large `N`.  This can lead to spills and significant performance degradation.  A better approach would be to minimize the use of temporary variables.

**Example 2: Improved Register Usage**

```cuda
__global__ void efficientKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    c[i] = ((a[i] * 2) * (b[i] + 3)) / 4 + 5;
  }
}
```

This revised kernel achieves the same computation with fewer temporary variables.  By combining expressions, we reduce the register pressure, thereby minimizing the likelihood of register spills.  This demonstrates a simple yet effective strategy for improving register utilization.

**Example 3: Shared Memory for Reducing Register Pressure**

```cuda
__global__ void sharedMemoryKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int N) {
  __shared__ int shared_a[256];
  __shared__ int shared_b[256];

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int tid = threadIdx.x;

  if (i < N) {
    shared_a[tid] = a[i];
    shared_b[tid] = b[i];
    __syncthreads(); //synchronize threads within the block

    int result = ((shared_a[tid] * 2) * (shared_b[tid] + 3)) / 4 + 5;

    c[i] = result;
  }
}
```

This example utilizes shared memory to reduce register pressure.  By loading data into shared memory, the kernel reduces the number of global memory accesses, thereby decreasing the overall memory bandwidth consumption and potentially avoiding register spills.  However, careful consideration must be given to shared memory bank conflicts.  This technique is most effective when dealing with data reused within a thread block.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The NVIDIA CUDA C++ Programming Guide, the PTX ISA specification, and the NVIDIA developer documentation on optimizing CUDA kernels are invaluable resources.  Furthermore, studying assembly-level analysis of the generated PTX code using tools like NVIDIA's profiling tools can provide insights into register allocation and potential optimization avenues.  Familiarizing yourself with the nuances of different CUDA architectures and their register limitations is also crucial for effective optimization.  Finally, exploring compiler flags that influence register allocation, such as those related to loop unrolling and inlining, can further enhance performance.
