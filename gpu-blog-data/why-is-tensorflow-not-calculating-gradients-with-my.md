The core issue in failing to compute gradients with a custom TensorFlow loss function frequently stems from the lack of automatic differentiation support within the function itself.  TensorFlow's automatic differentiation relies on the ability to trace operations performed on tensors. If your custom loss function employs operations or utilizes libraries that TensorFlow cannot track, the gradient calculation will fail.  This is a problem I've encountered numerous times in my work optimizing deep reinforcement learning agents, particularly when incorporating custom reward shaping functions or handling complex constraints within the objective function.

**1.  Understanding Automatic Differentiation in TensorFlow**

TensorFlow utilizes automatic differentiation, specifically reverse-mode automatic differentiation (also known as backpropagation), to compute gradients.  This process involves constructing a computational graph representing the operations within your model, including the loss function. During the backward pass, the gradients are calculated efficiently by traversing this graph in reverse order, applying the chain rule of calculus to determine the gradient of the loss with respect to each trainable variable.  The crucial element here is that the operations must be traceable by TensorFlow's automatic differentiation engine.

This traceability hinges on the use of TensorFlow operations within your custom loss function.  Functions implemented using NumPy or other libraries outside of TensorFlow's computational graph will not be automatically differentiated.  Furthermore, even if the function seemingly uses TensorFlow operations, the presence of control flow statements (like `if` conditions or loops) based on tensor values can break automatic differentiation if not handled properly.  These conditional statements can lead to dynamically constructed computational graphs, making gradient calculation challenging for the automatic differentiation system.

**2. Code Examples and Explanations**

Let's examine three scenarios illustrating common pitfalls and their solutions.

**Example 1:  Using NumPy within the Loss Function**

This example demonstrates a faulty custom loss function that utilizes NumPy operations instead of TensorFlow equivalents.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def faulty_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  error = y_true - y_pred
  mse = np.mean(error**2) # Incorrect: Uses NumPy
  return mse

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=faulty_loss)

# Training will fail due to the inability to compute gradients for np.mean
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

The correction involves replacing `np.mean` with `tf.reduce_mean`, ensuring all operations are within TensorFlow's computational graph.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def corrected_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  error = y_true - y_pred
  mse = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(error)) # Correct: Uses TensorFlow
  return mse

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=corrected_loss)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Example 2:  Conditional Logic and Gradient Discontinuity**

Improper handling of conditional logic can also lead to gradient calculation failures.  Consider this example where the loss function depends on a condition involving tensor values.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def problematic_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  if tf.reduce_mean(y_pred) > 0.5:
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_true - y_pred))
  else:
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))
  return loss

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=problematic_loss)

# Training might fail or produce unstable results
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

The issue here is the discontinuous nature of the loss function introduced by the `if` condition.  The gradient might not be well-defined at the point where `tf.reduce_mean(y_pred)` equals 0.5.  A solution involves using `tf.where` to create a smooth transition.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def improved_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    loss = tf.where(tf.reduce_mean(y_pred) > 0.5,
                     tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)),
                     tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred)))
    return loss

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=improved_loss)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

`tf.where` allows for a conditional selection of loss components without introducing discontinuities that hinder gradient calculation.


**Example 3:  Custom Operations without Gradients**

Defining a custom operation that doesn't provide gradient information also breaks the automatic differentiation process.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_custom_op(x):
  return tf.cast(x > 0.5, dtype=tf.float32)

def loss_with_custom_op(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(my_custom_op(y_pred))

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=loss_with_custom_op)

# Gradient calculation will fail.
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

The `my_custom_op` function involves a threshold operation;  while TensorFlow might execute it, it lacks the necessary gradient information. To resolve this, consider differentiable alternatives.  In this particular case, a sigmoid activation might approximate the desired behavior while remaining differentiable.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def loss_with_sigmoid(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.sigmoid(y_pred))

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=loss_with_sigmoid)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**3.  Resource Recommendations**

To delve deeper into this topic, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on custom training loops, automatic differentiation, and gradient computation.  Thorough exploration of the TensorFlow API documentation on relevant functions is crucial.  Understanding the underlying mathematical principles of automatic differentiation, particularly the chain rule, will also greatly enhance your ability to debug these issues.  Finally, studying examples of custom loss functions in established TensorFlow projects can provide valuable insights.
