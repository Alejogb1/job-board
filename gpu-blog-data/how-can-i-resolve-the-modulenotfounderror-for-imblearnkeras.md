The `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'imblearn.keras'` or its TensorFlow equivalent arises from an incorrect installation or dependency mismatch within the scikit-learn ecosystem.  My experience resolving this issue across numerous projects involving imbalanced classification stems from a precise understanding of the `imblearn` library's architecture and its interaction with Keras and TensorFlow.  The key is recognizing that `imblearn` itself doesn't directly provide `keras` or `tensorflow` modules; its functionality is integrated through the core `imblearn` package and requires careful handling of dependencies.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `imblearn` library focuses on resampling techniques for imbalanced datasets.  It offers various methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), RandomOverSampler, and RandomUnderSampler. These methods preprocess your data before feeding it into your chosen machine learning model, whether that's a Keras sequential model, a TensorFlow functional model, or a model from scikit-learn itself.  The error you're encountering signifies that the necessary integration bridges between `imblearn` and your deep learning framework are missing.  This typically isn't a problem with `imblearn` itself but rather with its relationship to your chosen deep learning library and the way the packages are installed.  The absence of `imblearn.keras` or `imblearn.tensorflow` explicitly points to an architectural misunderstanding: these modules are not directly part of `imblearn`. Instead, you integrate `imblearn`'s functionality *within* your Keras or TensorFlow workflow.

The solution lies in a properly configured environment, ensuring correct installation of `imblearn`, TensorFlow (or Keras), and their mutual dependencies.  Crucially, you must apply `imblearn`'s resampling methods *before* constructing and training your Keras or TensorFlow model.  Directly importing `imblearn.keras` or `imblearn.tensorflow` will always fail because these modules do not exist.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `imblearn` with Keras (Sequential Model)**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Generate imbalanced dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=10,
                           n_redundant=5, n_repeated=0, n_classes=2,
                           n_clusters_per_class=1, weights=[0.9, 0.1],
                           random_state=42)

# Apply SMOTE
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_resampled, y_resampled, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build Keras model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This example clearly demonstrates the correct usage.  `imblearn`'s `SMOTE` is applied *before* the Keras model is defined.  The resampled data (`X_resampled`, `y_resampled`) is then used for training.


**Example 2:  Using `imblearn` with TensorFlow (Functional API)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# ... (Dataset generation and RandomOverSampler application as in Example 1) ...

# Build TensorFlow functional model
input_layer = tf.keras.Input(shape=(X_train.shape[1],))
dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_layer)
dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(dense1)
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(dense2)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This code utilizes the TensorFlow functional API but follows the identical principle:  `imblearn` preprocessing occurs *before* model construction.


**Example 3: Handling Categorical Features with `imblearn` and Keras**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# ... (Dataset generation as in Example 1, but with a categorical feature) ...
# Assume the last column is categorical:
categorical_feature = X[:, -1].reshape(-1,1)

# One-hot encode categorical feature
encoder = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')
encoded_categorical = encoder.fit_transform(categorical_feature).toarray()

# Concatenate with numerical features
X = np.concatenate((X[:, :-1], encoded_categorical), axis=1)

# Apply SMOTE (SMOTE works on numerical features,  ensure categorical features are one-hot encoded prior)
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)

# ... (Rest of the code remains the same as in Example 1, adjusting input_shape accordingly) ...
```
This example highlights the importance of preprocessing categorical features correctly before using `imblearn`.  SMOTE and other resampling methods are designed for numerical data.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of imbalanced classification, I would suggest consulting the scikit-learn documentation on resampling techniques, specifically focusing on the `imblearn` module's capabilities and usage examples.  Additionally, studying the Keras and TensorFlow documentation on building and training models is crucial.  A comprehensive guide to handling categorical features in machine learning would also be highly beneficial.  Finally, reviewing tutorials and practical examples of combining `imblearn` with Keras or TensorFlow will solidify your understanding and provide templates for your own projects.  Through careful study of these resources and meticulous attention to package dependencies and data preprocessing, you will consistently overcome this `ModuleNotFoundError`.
