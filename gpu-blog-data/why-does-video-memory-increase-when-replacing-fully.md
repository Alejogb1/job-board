The observed increase in video memory consumption when replacing fully connected layers in a VGG11 architecture with fully convolutional layers stems fundamentally from the altered processing of spatial information and the resultant change in intermediate tensor dimensions.  While intuitively, removing fully connected layers might suggest reduced memory footprint, the convolutional approach implicitly expands the spatial dimensionality of feature maps, ultimately leading to higher overall memory requirements. This counterintuitive behavior is a critical aspect of understanding deep convolutional neural networks and their practical implementation. My experience optimizing similar architectures for real-time video processing on embedded systems has highlighted this phenomenon repeatedly.

**1.  Explanation:**

VGG11 employs a sequence of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers for classification.  Fully connected layers process flattened feature maps – effectively collapsing spatial information into a single vector. This reduction in dimensionality contributes to relatively modest memory usage in later stages.  Conversely, replacing these layers with fully convolutional counterparts maintains the spatial dimensions throughout the network. The output of each convolutional layer retains its spatial characteristics, resulting in significantly larger feature maps compared to the flattened vectors of the fully connected layers.

Consider a typical scenario: a convolutional layer might produce a feature map of shape (N, C, H, W), where N is the batch size, C the number of channels, and H and W the height and width, respectively.  A fully connected layer, on the other hand, transforms this into a tensor of shape (N, D), where D is the number of neurons in the fully connected layer.  This dramatic reduction in spatial dimensions leads to a significant decrease in memory usage for the fully connected layer's weights and activations.  However,  replacing it with a convolutional layer maintains or even increases the spatial dimensions, leading to a larger tensor (N, C', H', W') requiring considerably more memory.  While the number of parameters might be reduced – due to weight sharing in convolutions – the considerable increase in the size of the intermediate activation tensors dominates the memory consumption. The extent of this increase depends on the kernel size, stride, and padding chosen for the convolutional layer replacing the fully connected layer.

Furthermore, the backpropagation process, crucial for training, requires storing the activations of all layers for computing gradients.  With larger activation tensors resulting from the fully convolutional approach, the memory required for gradient calculations escalates accordingly.  This effect is amplified during training with larger batch sizes.  In summary, although the number of parameters might decrease (depending on the design of the convolutional replacements), the size of the intermediate activation tensors, necessary both during forward and backward passes, dramatically increases, leading to increased video memory consumption.


**2. Code Examples:**

Let's illustrate this with PyTorch examples.  These examples highlight the differences in tensor shapes and implied memory usage.  Assume a simplified VGG11-like architecture.

**Example 1: VGG11 with Fully Connected Layers:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class VGG11_FC(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=1000):
        super(VGG11_FC, self).__init__()
        self.features = nn.Sequential(
            # ... convolutional layers ...
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        )
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Linear(512*7*7, 4096), # Example fully connected layer
            nn.ReLU(True),
            nn.Linear(4096, 4096),
            nn.ReLU(True),
            nn.Linear(4096, num_classes)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.features(x)
        x = self.classifier(x)
        return x

# Example usage (replace with your data)
model_fc = VGG11_FC()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)  # Batch size 1, 3 channels, 224x224 image
output = model_fc(input_tensor)
print(output.shape) #Output shape: (1, 1000)
```

This code snippet demonstrates a simplified VGG11 architecture ending with fully connected layers. Notice the flattening operation before the linear layers, significantly reducing the dimensionality.


**Example 2:  VGG11 with Fully Convolutional Layers (simplified):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class VGG11_FCN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=1000):
        super(VGG11_FCN, self).__init__()
        self.features = nn.Sequential(
            # ... convolutional layers ...
            nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
            # ... additional convolutional layers replacing fully connected layers ...
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.features(x)
        return x # Output shape will depend on the final convolutional layers

# Example Usage (replace with your data)
model_fcn = VGG11_FCN()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
output = model_fcn(input_tensor)
print(output.shape) #Output shape depends on the final convolutional layers. It will likely be much larger than (1, 1000)
```

This example illustrates a partially converted architecture. Replacing the fully connected layers with convolutional layers will preserve the spatial dimensions, potentially yielding a significantly larger output tensor. Note the absence of the `nn.Flatten()` operation.  The output shape will depend heavily on the design of the replacement convolutional layers.



**Example 3:  Illustrative comparison of intermediate tensor sizes:**

This example focuses on comparing the sizes of intermediate tensors:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

#Simplified fully connected layer replacement
conv_replacement = nn.Conv2d(512, 1000, kernel_size=7, stride=1)

#Sample tensor from a previous layer (mimicking VGG11 feature extraction)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 512, 7, 7)

#Fully connected processing
fc_output = nn.Linear(512*7*7, 1000)(input_tensor.view(1, -1))
print("Fully Connected Output Shape:", fc_output.shape) #Output shape: (1, 1000)
print("Fully Connected Output Size (elements):", fc_output.numel()) # Output size


#Convolutional processing
conv_output = conv_replacement(input_tensor)
print("Convolutional Output Shape:", conv_output.shape) #Output shape: (1, 1000, 1, 1)
print("Convolutional Output Size (elements):", conv_output.numel()) # Output size

#Demonstrates the difference in the number of elements between the two methods.
```

This illustrates the difference in tensor sizes between the fully connected and fully convolutional approaches at a single point.  The convolutional layer's output remains spatially encoded, unlike the flattened output of the fully connected layer.  Even if the number of channels matches the number of classes, the memory footprint is higher due to the preserved spatial dimensions.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend studying  "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al.,  relevant chapters in the "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop, and exploring publications on convolutional neural network architectures and optimization techniques for memory efficiency in deep learning frameworks.  Specifically, look into research on efficient inference methods for CNNs on resource-constrained hardware.  These resources will provide a strong theoretical and practical foundation for grappling with the memory considerations presented by various deep learning architectures.
