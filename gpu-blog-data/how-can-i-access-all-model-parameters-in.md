Model parameters in PyTorch represent the learnable weights and biases that define the behavior of a neural network. Accessing them directly is fundamental for tasks like inspecting model state, implementing custom training procedures, or performing advanced manipulations like pruning or quantization. Failing to grasp these methods limits the flexibility one has when working with PyTorch models. I have encountered this issue multiple times when optimizing models for deployment on resource-constrained hardware and during debugging training dynamics that were not immediately clear from the loss values alone.

The primary method to access model parameters involves leveraging the `parameters()` method inherited from the `torch.nn.Module` base class. This method returns an iterator yielding `torch.Tensor` objects, where each tensor corresponds to a single parameter within the model's layers. Importantly, this iterator reflects the structured hierarchy of the network, including nested layers. This detail is crucial because it allows selective access based on the specific layers of interest. Without understanding this iterator-based approach, one is limited to predefined training loops or pre-packaged methods that do not always offer the necessary granularity.

Beyond accessing all parameters at once, we can also target specific parameter sets, for instance, those belonging to particular layers. This approach typically relies on the `named_parameters()` method, also from `torch.nn.Module`. This function returns an iterator yielding tuples of `(name, parameter)`, where 'name' is a string describing the hierarchical position of the parameter, e.g., `conv1.weight`, `fc2.bias`, etc. This naming convention allows for precise selection and manipulation. This has proven invaluable for tasks like freezing certain layer weights during transfer learning or selectively applying regularization techniques to certain network parts. Understanding the structure and usage of these iterators is essential for effectively working with and controlling model parameters.

The returned `torch.Tensor` objects themselves are not just read-only values; they can be modified directly, although this modification should be undertaken with care during training as it directly impacts the model behavior. Gradient information is also attached to these tensors through their `grad` attribute during backpropagation, which provides further avenues for analysis and manipulation. Finally, these `torch.Tensor` objects allow for a range of operations, including accessing individual elements using indexing, performing mathematical computations, and exporting to other data formats.

Here are three practical examples illustrating these points:

**Example 1: Accessing all parameters and printing their shapes**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 26 * 26, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 26 * 26)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

model = SimpleNet()

print("Shapes of all parameters:")
for param in model.parameters():
    print(param.shape)
```

This example demonstrates the basic iteration over all model parameters using the `model.parameters()` method. We iterate through the returned tensors and directly print their shapes. This illustrates how `parameters()` provides all learnable tensors without requiring prior knowledge of the model architecture. In more complex models, this becomes essential to rapidly explore parameter characteristics.  This basic access pattern was key when I needed to visualize parameter distributions for an unusual training setup.

**Example 2: Accessing parameters with names and selectively modifying biases**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 26 * 26, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 26 * 26)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x


model = SimpleNet()

print("\nNamed parameters:")
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(f"{name}: {param.shape}")

print("\nModifying bias parameters...")
with torch.no_grad():
    for name, param in model.named_parameters():
        if 'bias' in name:
             param.data.fill_(0)

print("\nBias parameters after modification:")
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
  if 'bias' in name:
        print(f"{name}: {param.data}")

```

This example shows the use of `model.named_parameters()`.  The code iterates over both names and parameter tensors.  It then demonstrates selective modification of bias parameters. We wrap modification of parameters within `torch.no_grad()` to avoid unintended gradient computation. This granular access has been necessary several times when initializing weights using specific distributions or zeroing out biases. Specifically, in this example, all bias parameters are initialized to zero after the model is created, an operation useful for some advanced training techniques. We print the values after modification.

**Example 3: Accessing gradients after a backward pass**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 26 * 26, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 26 * 26)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

model = SimpleNet()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

input_data = torch.randn(1, 3, 28, 28)
target = torch.randint(0, 10, (1,))

output = model(input_data)
loss = criterion(output, target)
loss.backward()

print("\nGradients after backward pass:")
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if param.grad is not None:
        print(f"{name}: {param.grad.shape}")
    else:
        print(f"{name}: No gradient")
```

This example highlights the connection between model parameters and gradients.  After performing a forward pass, calculating the loss, and then calling `backward()`, the `grad` attribute of each parameter tensor becomes populated with gradient information. The code iterates through parameters and prints the shapes of their gradients. This has been crucial when debugging exploding or vanishing gradient issues. When parameter gradients are not available (e.g. with non-learnable layers) the code shows `No gradient`.

In summary, effectively accessing and manipulating model parameters requires understanding the `parameters()` and `named_parameters()` methods of `torch.nn.Module`. These methods return iterators over `torch.Tensor` objects, each representing a parameter. Accessing the parameters provides crucial control, whether during training, debugging, or advanced model modifications.

For further exploration, consider reviewing the official PyTorch documentation for `torch.nn.Module`, specifically the sections regarding parameter access. Textbooks on deep learning provide helpful contextualization, often demonstrating how these techniques are used in complex models. Additionally, examining the source code of common deep learning models in open-source repositories provides invaluable practical insights. Focusing on these resources ensures a strong grounding in both the mechanics and the practical applications of accessing model parameters in PyTorch.
