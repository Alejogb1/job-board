Eigenvectors, by their nature, are outputs of eigenvalue decomposition – a process generally not considered differentiable within standard autodifferentiation frameworks like PyTorch. Directly backpropagating through them requires a specialized approach. My experience implementing spectral methods for neural network regularization revealed this very challenge, forcing me to delve beyond the typical gradient calculation. The core issue is that most libraries treat eigenvalue decompositions as black boxes; the internal computations, which involve iterative numerical methods, aren’t tracked for differentiation. Therefore, a direct application of `.backward()` on a loss derived from eigenvectors won't work. Instead, the solution lies in leveraging implicit differentiation.

First, it’s crucial to understand why a naive approach fails. Standard automatic differentiation works by accumulating gradients along the computational graph during the forward pass. When we compute eigenvectors (let's call these 'V' and the eigenvalues 'D') of a matrix (let's call this 'A'), the `torch.linalg.eig` or similar functions don't explicitly maintain gradient information about how changes in ‘A’ affect ‘V’. These numerical methods are not designed with backpropagation in mind. Trying to directly compute `V.backward()` will result in an error because PyTorch will find no registered gradient function for the `eig` operation.

The resolution involves formulating an implicit function. Let's assume that we have a loss function L(V), which is a scalar based on our computed eigenvectors, and our goal is to compute the gradient of this loss with respect to the input matrix A, i.e., dL/dA. While we don't have a direct computational path to derive dV/dA explicitly, we can use the relationship between A, V, and D. We know that if `A` is diagonalizable, then `AV = VD`. Perturbing `A` slightly by `dA` will lead to perturbations of eigenvectors `dV` and eigenvalues `dD`. Differentiating the above equation yields `(dA)V + A(dV) = (dD)V + D(dV)`. Rearranging, we get: `A(dV) - D(dV) = (dD)V - (dA)V`. This is a linear system involving `dV`. Now, we can calculate the derivative of the loss function with respect to `A` using the chain rule: `dL/dA = (dL/dV) * (dV/dA)`. Here, we calculate `dL/dV` directly from the loss and the eigenvectors V during the forward pass.

The key idea is to avoid directly calculating `dV/dA`. Instead, we solve the linear system implicitly and construct `dV/dA` using the solution. We express the derivative of the eigenvectors with respect to the matrix in terms of a linear system of equations using the relationship AV = VD (for a diagonalisable matrix). Let's denote the differential of matrix A as dA, differentials of eigenvectors as dV, and differentials of eigenvalues as dD. Differentiating the equality, we have dA*V + A*dV = dD*V + D*dV. This differential equation relates dA to dV and can be expressed in the form M*dV = b, where M = A - D, and b = dD*V - dA*V. This linear system can be solved for dV. With the derivative dV computed this way, backpropagation can proceed with a valid dV/dA.

Let's see this in practice using code examples. The first example shows the incorrect, naive attempt:

```python
import torch

def naive_loss(A):
    # A should be a square matrix
    eigvals, eigvecs = torch.linalg.eig(A)
    # Loss based on some property of eigenvectors
    loss = torch.sum(eigvecs[:,0]**2)
    return loss

A = torch.randn(3, 3, requires_grad=True)
loss = naive_loss(A)
try:
    loss.backward()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Will raise an error, gradient not implemented for eig
```

This code snippet demonstrates the standard, but unsuccessful method. It generates an error as no gradient function is defined for `torch.linalg.eig`.

The second example will demonstrate the implicit differentiation approach, showcasing only the necessary sections of a function, omitting irrelevant details such as the loss calculation itself. I'll assume we are working with real-valued matrices and eigenvectors here:

```python
import torch

def implicit_grad_eig(A, loss_function): # Assume loss function computes L(V)
    eigvals, eigvecs = torch.linalg.eig(A)
    eigvals = eigvals.real
    eigvecs = eigvecs.real
    loss = loss_function(eigvecs)

    # Prepare for backpropagation
    grad_outputs = torch.ones_like(loss) # Gradient of the loss function with respect to itself is 1
    grad_eigvecs = torch.autograd.grad(loss, eigvecs, grad_outputs=grad_outputs, create_graph=True)[0]

    # Build the linear system
    n = A.shape[0]
    identity = torch.eye(n, dtype=A.dtype, device=A.device)
    diag_eigvals = torch.diag(eigvals)
    M = A.T - diag_eigvals
    b = torch.matmul(grad_eigvecs.T, eigvecs)

    # Solve the linear system for dV/dA
    dV_dA = torch.linalg.solve(M, b).T

    # Calculate the final gradient with chain rule
    dA_grad = -torch.matmul(grad_eigvecs,dV_dA) # Negative sign for the transpose
    return dA_grad

# Example usage, assuming we have the loss function
def simple_loss(eigvecs):
    return torch.sum(eigvecs[:, 0] ** 2) # Simple example of loss on eigenvectors

A = torch.randn(3, 3, requires_grad=True)
dA_grad = implicit_grad_eig(A, simple_loss) # Returns the gradient dL/dA

# Verify the gradient with finite differences (for illustration)
eps = 1e-4
A_p = A + eps * torch.eye(3)
loss_p = simple_loss(torch.linalg.eig(A_p)[1].real)
A_m = A - eps * torch.eye(3)
loss_m = simple_loss(torch.linalg.eig(A_m)[1].real)

numerical_grad_diag = (loss_p - loss_m) / (2*eps)
print(f"Computed gradient: {dA_grad}")
print(f"Numerical gradient (diag elements): {numerical_grad_diag}")

```

Here, `implicit_grad_eig` calculates the loss using a provided `loss_function` based on eigenvectors. It then computes `grad_eigvecs`, which is dL/dV. We then construct the matrix `M` and vector `b` that define our linear system `M*dV = b`, and solve it to get `dV`. Finally, the code calculates the gradient `dA_grad`. Note that the function assumes that A is a real matrix, using `.real` to extract the real parts of the eigenvalue and eigenvector. The example includes a crude check with finite difference to verify the derivative calculation, which would be suitable only for a diagonal matrix pertubation.

The third and final example will show how to perform this operation when using a batch of matrices:

```python
import torch

def batch_implicit_grad_eig(A_batch, loss_function):
    eigvals, eigvecs = torch.linalg.eig(A_batch)
    eigvals = eigvals.real
    eigvecs = eigvecs.real
    loss = loss_function(eigvecs) # Loss function must be modified to handle batches

    grad_outputs = torch.ones_like(loss)
    grad_eigvecs = torch.autograd.grad(loss, eigvecs, grad_outputs=grad_outputs, create_graph=True)[0]

    n = A_batch.shape[-1]
    diag_eigvals = torch.diag_embed(eigvals)
    identity = torch.eye(n, dtype=A_batch.dtype, device=A_batch.device)
    M = A_batch.transpose(-1, -2) - diag_eigvals

    b = torch.einsum('bij,bjk->bik', grad_eigvecs, eigvecs) # Batched matmul
    dV_dA = torch.linalg.solve(M, b).transpose(-1, -2)
    dA_grad = -torch.einsum('bij,bjk->bik', grad_eigvecs, dV_dA) # Batched matmul
    return dA_grad

def simple_batch_loss(eigvecs):
  return torch.sum(eigvecs[:,:, 0]**2, dim=-1)

A_batch = torch.randn(4, 3, 3, requires_grad=True) # Batched matrices
dA_grad_batch = batch_implicit_grad_eig(A_batch, simple_batch_loss)
print(f"Batch gradient shape: {dA_grad_batch.shape}")
```
This demonstrates how to extend the functionality to operate on batches.  The key changes involve using `torch.diag_embed`, `torch.einsum` for batched matrix multiplication, and ensure the loss function, like `simple_batch_loss`, can handle a batch of input.

To further expand understanding, I recommend researching resources that delve into the following: Numerical Linear Algebra for an overview of eigenvalue solvers and their properties; Implicit Function Theorem in calculus, for grounding in the theoretical basis of this method; and Automatic Differentiation for a more complete understanding of PyTorch's internals. Researching adjoint methods, a related technique for handling non-differentiable processes, would also prove useful. Further investigation into specific matrix decompositions that might offer differentiable solutions could also be beneficial. I've personally found it helpful to go through examples implementing implicit differentiation for various problems beyond just eigenvectors. This builds intuition and adaptability in diverse scenarios. This technique allows us to backpropagate through processes that appear to be non-differentiable.
