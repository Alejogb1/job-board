The core issue stems from nvcc's handling of template instantiation within the context of separate compilation. Unlike traditional C++ compilers, which often perform implicit instantiation during linking, nvcc necessitates explicit instantiation of templates used within CUDA kernels.  This is a crucial distinction arising from the architectural constraints of CUDA's parallel execution model and its separation of host and device code compilation.  My experience debugging this issue across numerous projects involving high-performance computing on NVIDIA GPUs has highlighted the importance of understanding this behavior.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

nvcc, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler, operates under a two-stage compilation process. First, the host code (CPU-bound code) is compiled. Then, the device code (GPU-bound code, typically CUDA kernels) is separately compiled.  When encountering class templates in device code, nvcc lacks the capability of automatically instantiating the required template specializations during linking unless explicitly directed. This is because the device code compilation often happens independently, potentially on a different machine or within a different compilation environment, where the necessary type information might not be readily available.

Failure to provide explicit instantiation leads to undefined symbols during the linking stage. The linker encounters references to methods or member variables of the class template within the kernel, but finds no corresponding compiled code implementing these for the specific data types used in the kernel.  The compiler error messages may appear cryptic, often mentioning undefined symbols or unresolved external references, leading to significant debugging challenges if the underlying cause is not understood.

The problem is exacerbated when dealing with class templates containing complex structures or significant amounts of template code. The resulting compilation units could be substantial, and the errors generated by the linker might not precisely pinpoint the missing instantiation.  This is why a systematic approach using explicit instantiation directives is essential for robust CUDA development.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  The Problem – Missing Instantiation**

```cpp
// host code
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
class MyClass {
public:
  T data;
  __host__ __device__ void setData(T val) { data = val; }
  __host__ __device__ T getData() { return data; }
};

// device code (kernel)
__global__ void myKernel(MyClass<int> *arr, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    arr[i].setData(i * 2);
  }
}


int main() {
  MyClass<int> *h_arr, *d_arr;
  int n = 1024;
  // ... memory allocation and kernel launch ...
  return 0;
}

```

This code will fail to compile because `MyClass<int>` is used in the kernel `myKernel`, but nvcc hasn't been instructed to generate the necessary code for `MyClass<int>`. The linker will complain about undefined symbols related to `MyClass<int>::setData` and `MyClass<int>::getData`.

**Example 2:  The Solution – Explicit Instantiation**

```cpp
// host code
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
class MyClass {
public:
  T data;
  __host__ __device__ void setData(T val) { data = val; }
  __host__ __device__ T getData() { return data; }
};

// Explicit instantiation for int
template class MyClass<int>;

// device code (kernel) - remains unchanged
__global__ void myKernel(MyClass<int> *arr, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    arr[i].setData(i * 2);
  }
}

int main() {
  MyClass<int> *h_arr, *d_arr;
  int n = 1024;
  // ... memory allocation and kernel launch ...
  return 0;
}
```

Adding `template class MyClass<int>;` in the host code explicitly tells the compiler to generate the code for `MyClass<int>`. This resolves the undefined symbol errors during linking.

**Example 3:  Multiple Instantiations**

```cpp
// host code
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
class MyClass {
public:
  T data;
  __host__ __device__ void setData(T val) { data = val; }
  __host__ __device__ T getData() { return data; }
};

// Explicit instantiation for int and float
template class MyClass<int>;
template class MyClass<float>;


// device code (kernel)
__global__ void myKernelInt(MyClass<int> *arr, int n) {
  // ...
}

__global__ void myKernelFloat(MyClass<float> *arr, int n) {
  // ...
}

int main() {
  // ... Kernel launches for both int and float versions ...
  return 0;
}
```

This demonstrates how to handle multiple instantiations.  Each kernel uses a different specialization of `MyClass`, requiring separate explicit instantiations in the host code.  Failure to explicitly instantiate both `MyClass<int>` and `MyClass<float>` would result in unresolved symbols for one or both kernels.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official NVIDIA CUDA Programming Guide.
* A comprehensive C++ template metaprogramming textbook.
* Advanced CUDA C++ programming materials focusing on template instantiation and device code management.


Through careful attention to explicit template instantiation, and a thorough understanding of nvcc's two-stage compilation process, developers can avoid the common pitfalls associated with compiling object-oriented code using CUDA.  Neglecting this often leads to time-consuming debugging efforts, and a deeper understanding of these concepts is crucial for developing efficient and robust GPU-accelerated applications.
