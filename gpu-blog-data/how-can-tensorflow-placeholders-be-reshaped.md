TensorFlow placeholders, prior to the widespread adoption of `tf.data` and eager execution, presented a unique challenge regarding reshaping.  Their inherent flexibility – the ability to accept tensors of varying shapes at runtime – also complicated static shape manipulation.  Directly reshaping a placeholder with standard TensorFlow reshape operations often proved problematic during graph construction, especially when dealing with unknown dimensions. This stemmed from the fact that the placeholder's shape wasn't definitively known until runtime.  My experience debugging large-scale models built on TensorFlow 1.x heavily involved addressing this very issue.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core difficulty lies in the distinction between *static shape* and *dynamic shape*.  The static shape is defined during graph construction and is often partially or fully unknown for placeholders.  The dynamic shape is determined when the placeholder is fed data during execution.  Attempting to reshape a placeholder based solely on its static shape (which might be `None` for unknown dimensions) will often lead to errors.  The solution is to defer the reshaping operation until runtime, utilizing dynamic shape information available only then. This is achieved through TensorFlow operations that handle shape inference at runtime, rather than relying on static shape definitions.

This requires a subtle shift in approach.  Instead of directly reshaping the placeholder, you define the reshaping operation as part of the computational graph, employing operations that can adapt to the actual shape of the input tensor when it is fed to the placeholder during execution.  These operations, notably `tf.reshape` combined with shape-determining operations, are key.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Reshaping with `tf.reshape` and `tf.shape`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Placeholder with unknown shape
x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, None])

# Get the dynamic shape of the input tensor
shape = tf.shape(x)

# Reshape using dynamic shape information.  We use shape[0] and shape[1] for dynamic width and height
reshaped_x = tf.reshape(x, [shape[0], shape[1] * 2])

# Session setup (for TensorFlow 1.x compatibility)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    # Example input data
    input_data = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]
    result = sess.run(reshaped_x, feed_dict={x: input_data})
    print(result) # Output: [[1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.]]

```

This example demonstrates a fundamental approach. `tf.shape(x)` returns a tensor containing the runtime shape of `x`.  This tensor is then used within `tf.reshape` to dynamically adjust the shape of the input.  Note that the example showcases doubling the width; any valid reshaping operation can be substituted.  For TensorFlow 2.x and later, the `tf.compat.v1` components can be removed.  However, the core logic remains unchanged.

**Example 2: Handling Unknown Dimensions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, None, None]) # 3D tensor with unknown shape

# Define a target shape – we keep the first dimension and flatten the rest.
target_shape = tf.concat([[tf.shape(x)[0]], [-1]], axis=0)

reshaped_x = tf.reshape(x, target_shape)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    input_data = [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]
    result = sess.run(reshaped_x, feed_dict={x: input_data})
    print(result) # Output: [[1. 2. 3. 4.] [5. 6. 7. 8.]]
```

Here, we deal with a 3D tensor where the number of elements in the second and third dimensions is unknown.  `tf.concat` dynamically constructs the target shape. `-1` in `tf.concat` instructs TensorFlow to automatically infer the remaining dimension size based on the input tensor's total number of elements.  This is crucial when dealing with partially or completely undefined shapes.

**Example 3:  Reshaping with Conditional Logic (Advanced)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None])

# Determine whether to reshape based on a condition (e.g., length of tensor)
shape_condition = tf.greater(tf.shape(x)[0], 5)

# Define two reshaping operations, one for each case
reshaped_x_1 = tf.reshape(x, [-1, 2])  # Reshape if condition is true
reshaped_x_2 = tf.reshape(x, [-1, 1])  # Reshape if condition is false

# Use `tf.cond` to choose the appropriate reshaping operation at runtime.
reshaped_x = tf.cond(shape_condition, lambda: reshaped_x_1, lambda: reshaped_x_2)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    input_data_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] #Longer than 5
    input_data_2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] #shorter than 5
    result1 = sess.run(reshaped_x, feed_dict={x: input_data_1})
    result2 = sess.run(reshaped_x, feed_dict={x: input_data_2})
    print(result1) # Output: [[1. 2.], [3. 4.], [5. 6.], [7. 8.]]
    print(result2) # Output: [[1.], [2.], [3.], [4.], [5.]]
```

This advanced example employs conditional logic to adapt the reshaping operation based on the runtime shape of the input.  `tf.cond` dynamically selects between two alternative reshaping operations.  This is advantageous when different reshaping strategies are necessary depending on the input data characteristics.  This level of dynamism is often essential in handling variable-length sequences or other scenarios with varying input sizes.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's shape manipulation, consult the official TensorFlow documentation, focusing on the `tf.shape`, `tf.reshape`, `tf.concat`, and `tf.cond` operations.  Furthermore, review materials on TensorFlow's graph execution model and the distinction between static and dynamic shapes.  Thorough exploration of these concepts is essential for effectively managing shape-related issues within complex TensorFlow models.  Finally, studying example code snippets and tutorials focused on handling variable-length sequences or dynamic batch sizes will significantly improve your proficiency in this area.  Working through practical examples involving shape manipulation will solidify your understanding and problem-solving skills.
