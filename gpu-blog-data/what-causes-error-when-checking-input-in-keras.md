The Keras `TimeseriesGenerator` error, vaguely described as "error when checking input," often stems from a mismatch between the expected input shape and the shape of the data provided.  My experience debugging this, spanning several projects involving multivariate time series forecasting, points to this core issue as the most frequent culprit.  The error message itself is unfortunately unhelpful;  it requires a careful examination of your data and the generator's parameters to pinpoint the problem.

**1.  Understanding Input Shape Expectations:**

The `TimeseriesGenerator` expects input data in a specific format.  This format is dictated primarily by the `targets` parameter and secondarily by the `length` parameter.  Let's assume `data` represents your time series data.  Its shape is typically (samples, timesteps, features).  Crucially, the number of samples must be sufficient to generate the specified number of timesteps and target sequences.  If `length` is the length of your input sequences, and `sampling_rate` is how often you sample a point, the number of samples in your data must be at least `length + (target_size - 1) * sampling_rate`, where `target_size` is the length of your target sequence.  Failure to satisfy this constraint directly results in a shape mismatch, triggering the error.

Furthermore, the number of features must be consistent across the input and output.  If your input has three features, your targets must also reflect this, even if some of those features are not directly used in your prediction.  This often happens in multivariate problems where you might be predicting only a single variable, but the model utilizes the complete feature set for prediction.

Finally, the data type must be compatible with the Keras backend.  Usually, this means NumPy arrays with a floating-point data type (e.g., `float32`).  Using integers or incorrect data types can lead to obscure errors manifesting as "error when checking input."

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Usage**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import TimeseriesGenerator

# Sample data: 100 samples, 10 timesteps, 3 features
data = np.random.rand(100, 10, 3)
targets = np.random.rand(100, 1)  # Predicting one variable

data_gen = TimeseriesGenerator(data, targets, length=5, sampling_rate=1, batch_size=32)

print(data_gen[0][0].shape)  # Output: (32, 5, 3) -  Correct Input Shape
print(data_gen[0][1].shape)  # Output: (32, 1) - Correct Target Shape

```

This example demonstrates the correct usage.  The data has a clear structure, and the `TimeseriesGenerator` parameters are carefully selected to avoid shape mismatches. The `sampling_rate` of 1 implies sequential sampling.  The `batch_size` controls how many samples are processed at once.  Output shapes verify that the generator functions correctly.


**Example 2:  Incorrect Sampling Rate**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import TimeseriesGenerator

data = np.random.rand(100, 10, 3)
targets = np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Incorrect sampling rate leads to insufficient data
data_gen = TimeseriesGenerator(data, targets, length=5, sampling_rate=2, batch_size=32)

try:
    print(data_gen[0][0].shape)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Expect a ValueError due to shape mismatch

```

Here, the `sampling_rate` of 2 reduces the effective number of samples available to the generator.  This can result in a `ValueError` during the internal shape checks within `TimeseriesGenerator`.  The error message might not directly mention "shape mismatch" but will indicate a problem during input validation.

**Example 3: Feature Mismatch**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import TimeseriesGenerator

data = np.random.rand(100, 10, 3)
targets = np.random.rand(100, 2) # Incorrect number of features in targets

data_gen = TimeseriesGenerator(data, targets, length=5, sampling_rate=1, batch_size=32)

try:
    print(data_gen[0][0].shape)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Expect a ValueError

```

This example highlights a mismatch between the number of features in the input data (3) and the number of features in the targets (2).  This inconsistency violates the internal logic of `TimeseriesGenerator`, leading to the "error when checking input."  This particular error can be subtle, often surfacing during model training rather than generator creation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation should be your first port of call for detailed explanations of the `TimeseriesGenerator` class and its parameters.  Consult reputable machine learning textbooks covering time series analysis and forecasting.  These often offer detailed examples and explanations of common data preprocessing techniques required for time series models in Keras.  Furthermore, understanding the underlying tensor operations in TensorFlow/Theano (depending on your Keras backend) will enhance your ability to troubleshoot shape-related issues in deep learning frameworks in general.


In summary, the "error when checking input" in `TimeseriesGenerator` is almost always a consequence of shape mismatches stemming from inadequate attention to the interaction between the `length`, `sampling_rate`, `batch_size`, the shape of your input data, and the shape of your target data.  Carefully examining these parameters and ensuring their consistency with the data is essential for successful time series modeling using Keras.  Remember to verify the data type compatibility; while the error message might be generic, the root cause is frequently a subtle incompatibility within your preprocessing pipeline.
