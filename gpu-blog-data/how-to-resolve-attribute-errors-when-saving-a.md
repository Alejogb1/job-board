Attribute errors when saving a PyTorch model often stem from inconsistencies between the model's structure and the state dictionary being saved or loaded. This typically manifests as a mismatch in the expected and actual attributes within the model's architecture, which is critical to address when preserving or deploying trained neural networks. I've encountered this frequently during model serialization for different hardware environments and during version upgrades of codebase, and it is rarely a simple fix without thorough examination.

The core mechanism involves PyTorch's `state_dict()`, which captures a model's learnable parameters—weights and biases—along with registered buffers. When saving a model using `torch.save()`, this dictionary is the primary data structure being serialized. Subsequently, `torch.load()` deserializes this data, and the loaded dictionary is used to restore a model's state with the `load_state_dict()` function. Attribute errors occur when the structure of the loaded dictionary doesn't perfectly align with the model structure during the loading process. This misalignment is usually caused by changes in a model's definition between the saving and loading phases, or by inadvertently saving a different part of model or data structure than intended.

A typical scenario causing such a discrepancy involves modifying a model class after a checkpoint has been saved. For example, if we have a model class that initially defined three linear layers, but then add a fourth one, loading the original checkpoint will lead to a mismatch, since the loaded dictionary only has keys for the original three linear layers. The `load_state_dict` method will try to find all the parameters for all the defined layers in the loaded weights, and any mismatch results in an attribute error, because it cannot find the saved weights for the fourth linear layer. Another typical source is using a wrapped class of the model, for example when using data parallelism that wraps a model. If the saved checkpoint contains the parameters for the wrapped class, but when loading we only load the base class, there is again a mismatch in the keys. Similar issues arise when saving parameters of an optimizer or loss function together with the model, which usually have more parameters than the model, which can cause issues.

To illustrate, consider a model class:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

#Example of saving the state dictionary
model = SimpleModel(10, 20, 5)
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')
```

Here, we save only the state dictionary and not the entire model object. This is usually the preferred method since the class definitions themselves don't need to be saved.

Now, suppose after saving, the `SimpleModel` class is altered by adding another layer:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)


    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
```

When loading the saved state dictionary into this modified model:

```python
model = SimpleModel(10, 20, 5)
loaded_state_dict = torch.load('model.pth')
try:
   model.load_state_dict(loaded_state_dict)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error Loading the saved weights: {e}")
```

A runtime error similar to the following will occur: `RuntimeError: Error(s) in loading state_dict for SimpleModel: Missing key(s) in state_dict: fc3.weight, fc3.bias. `. This error signifies that the `load_state_dict` method expects to find the keys `fc3.weight` and `fc3.bias`, which are not present in the loaded state dictionary.

One way to address this error is to allow partial loading of a saved dictionary, where missing or unexpected keys are ignored, and only matching keys are loaded. While this resolves missing keys, care should be taken when using such option, as it might result in unpredictable behavior if the loaded parameters do not correspond to what is expected, especially if the modification results in different shapes for parameters with similar names.

```python
model = SimpleModel(10, 20, 5)
loaded_state_dict = torch.load('model.pth')
model.load_state_dict(loaded_state_dict, strict=False)
print("Model weights loaded, missing parameters skipped")
```

In this modified example, `strict=False` allows for the loading of parameters that match the current model and will not throw an error for the parameters that do not match. However, this does not load parameters for `fc3` so those parameters will remain untrained and initialized randomly.

Another common issue arises from saving models trained with `torch.nn.DataParallel`, where model is wrapped, as shown below:

```python
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    model = nn.DataParallel(model)
```

When the model is wrapped, all the parameters will belong to the wrapper and not the base model. When saving the state dictionary of a model trained with `DataParallel`, you would need to save state dictionary of the wrapped model and not the base model object. If the weights are saved from the wrapped object and try to load them to base object, there will be a discrepancy because the parameter keys will have `module.` prefix. Here is an example:

```python
model = SimpleModel(10, 20, 5)
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    model = nn.DataParallel(model)
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    model.cuda()

torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'dp_model.pth')

model2 = SimpleModel(10, 20, 5)
try:
    loaded_state_dict = torch.load('dp_model.pth')
    model2.load_state_dict(loaded_state_dict)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error Loading the saved weights: {e}")

model2 = SimpleModel(10, 20, 5)
loaded_state_dict = torch.load('dp_model.pth')
from collections import OrderedDict
new_state_dict = OrderedDict()
for k, v in loaded_state_dict.items():
   name = k[7:] if k.startswith('module.') else k
   new_state_dict[name] = v
model2.load_state_dict(new_state_dict)
print("Model loaded with the wrapper, key names have been fixed")
```

In this example, saving the model that is wrapped with `DataParallel` adds the `module.` prefix to each key. When loading the checkpoint into the base model that has not been wrapped, the `module.` prefix needs to be removed before loading.

In summary, the root cause of attribute errors typically stems from changes or mismatches between the structure of the model and what was serialized in the checkpoint file. It requires care during model development and careful consideration of the saved checkpoint when loading to ensure that these mismatches do not occur.

For continued learning and best practices, consider resources such as the official PyTorch documentation (especially sections concerning saving and loading models), tutorials on PyTorch model deployment, and community forums. Examining well-structured PyTorch open-source repositories can provide valuable practical insights as well, especially in how the model checkpoints are handled within them. Thoroughly analyzing these resources and practicing model serialization and deserialization will aid greatly in avoiding such errors during the development process.
