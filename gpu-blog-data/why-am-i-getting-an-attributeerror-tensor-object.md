The `AttributeError: 'Tensor' object has no attribute '_keras_history'` arises specifically when attempting to access training history information from a TensorFlow/Keras model that doesn't retain that history.  This usually occurs when loading a model from a saved file (like a `.h5` or SavedModel) that omits the training history, or when using a model built without the `fit()` method's return value being captured.  I've encountered this numerous times during my work on large-scale named entity recognition (NER) projects involving custom model architectures and transfer learning strategies.

My experience points to two primary causes:  a lack of explicit history preservation during model saving, and using pre-trained models or layers that haven't been trained within the current session.  The `_keras_history` attribute is an internal Keras mechanism used to store training metrics, like loss and accuracy across epochs.  It's not intended for direct access and its absence indicates that this internal record simply isn't present.


**1.  Explanation:**

The `_keras_history` attribute is inherently tied to the Keras `fit()` method.  When you train a Keras model using `model.fit()`, it returns a `History` object. This object contains a dictionary (`history.history`) that stores the training metrics over each epoch.  Crucially, saving the model using `model.save()` does *not* automatically save this `History` object.  Therefore, loading a model from a saved file results in a model instance lacking the `_keras_history` attribute.  This is by design; saving only the model weights and architecture keeps the file size smaller and improves loading speed.  Attempts to access this attribute after loading will lead to the error.  The situation is exacerbated when using pre-trained models or layers.  The pre-trained weights themselves are loaded, but the training history of the pre-trained model is irrelevant and not included.

The second scenario involves a procedural error.  Even if the model is trained in the current session, failure to store the return value of `model.fit()` will result in the same problem. The `History` object is ephemeral unless explicitly assigned to a variable.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Model Loading and History Access**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Load a model without explicitly saving the history
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('my_ner_model.h5')

# This will raise the AttributeError
try:
    history = loaded_model._keras_history
    print(history)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected error: {e}")

# Correct approach: Access training metrics through other means, like a separate file.

```

**Commentary:** This illustrates the fundamental problem. Loading a model from a file, even one trained with Keras, doesn't automatically load the training history.  Attempting to access `_keras_history` directly will result in the error. The correct approach is to either save the training metrics separately (e.g., to a JSON file) or retrain the model.

**Example 2:  Correct Model Training and History Preservation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    # ... your NER model layers ...
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(...)

# Train the model and capture the history
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

# Access training history
print(history.history['loss'])
print(history.history['val_loss'])

# Save the model and the history separately
model.save('my_ner_model.h5')
import json
with open('training_history.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(history.history, f)
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates the proper method. The `fit()` method's return value is assigned to the `history` variable.  This ensures access to the training metrics.  Importantly, the model is saved separately from the training history, and the history is stored using a more robust and compatible format (JSON).


**Example 3: Using a Pre-trained Model (EfficientNet for example) and Fine-tuning**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from efficientnet.tfkeras import EfficientNetB0 # Example; adapt as needed

# Load pre-trained EfficientNet
base_model = EfficientNetB0(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))  # Adjust input shape as needed

# Freeze base model layers
base_model.trainable = False

# Add custom NER layers
x = base_model.output
x = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x) # num_classes is the number of NER tags

model = keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=outputs)

# Compile and train the model, saving history
model.compile(...)
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

# Access training history (from fine-tuning)
print(history.history['loss'])

# Save everything appropriately
model.save("fine_tuned_ner_model.h5")
with open('fine_tuning_history.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(history.history, f)

```

**Commentary:**  This addresses a common scenario in NER: utilizing a pre-trained model like EfficientNet (though this example is illustrative, a suitable backbone for NER would need adjustments).  The pre-trained weights are loaded, but the pre-training history is irrelevant.  The `_keras_history` attribute will only reflect the *fine-tuning* history, not the original pre-training history.  Saving the fine-tuning history separately is crucial.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation on Keras model saving and loading.  Explore the Keras `ModelCheckpoint` callback for managing model saving during training.  Refer to the documentation on the `fit()` method and its return value.  Consult a reputable textbook or online course on deep learning with a focus on TensorFlow/Keras.  Consider exploring documentation for specific pre-trained models you intend to use.



In summary, the `AttributeError` stems from not appropriately handling the training history during model building and saving.  Always explicitly save the `History` object from `model.fit()` or use techniques like `ModelCheckpoint` to save model weights and metrics at intervals. Remember that loading a pre-trained model only provides weights and architecture, not the original training data's history.  Proper saving and handling of training metrics avoid this common issue during model development and deployment.
