TensorFlow's implementation of Random Forests, specifically those built using the `tf.estimator.BoostedTreesClassifier` or `tf.estimator.BoostedTreesRegressor` (which rely on CART-like decision trees internally), primarily leverages the **Gini impurity** as the default criterion for splitting nodes. This decision is not explicitly exposed as a configurable parameter within the high-level TensorFlow Estimator API but is an architectural choice within the underlying C++ implementations of the boosted tree algorithms.

I’ve spent several years building and deploying machine learning models, and while TensorFlow offers a vast ecosystem, this particular detail regarding impurity measures in its Random Forest variations can be easily overlooked. While theoretically both Gini and entropy could work, the computational efficiency and, arguably, often negligible performance differences make Gini the preferred choice in practice for many implementations, and TensorFlow appears to have aligned with this. The core idea behind these impurity measures is to quantify the degree of homogeneity within a set of labels. A perfectly homogeneous set (all belonging to the same class) would have an impurity value of zero.

To elucidate this further, the Gini impurity for a given node `t` is calculated using the following formula:

Gini(t) = 1 - Σ (p<sub>i</sub>)<sup>2</sup>

Where `p<sub>i</sub>` is the relative frequency of class `i` within the node `t`. In the case of regression trees, a different impurity measure, usually a variance or mean squared error, is used. But for classification based forests that utilize CART, TensorFlow leans towards Gini.

Let’s examine some code examples to demonstrate this in context, bearing in mind that we won’t see a parameter to change this directly, indicating it is indeed hard-coded within the implementation.

**Example 1: Basic Random Forest Classification**

This first example showcases the standard implementation of a boosted trees classifier using TensorFlow's high-level Estimator API. The focus here is to underscore the fact there isn't an option to select the impurity measure.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd

# Sample Data (replace with your actual data)
data = {'feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        'feature2': [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
        'label': [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

features = ['feature1', 'feature2']

feature_columns = [tf.feature_column.numeric_column(key=f) for f in features]

def train_input_fn():
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((dict(df[features]), df['label']))
    dataset = dataset.shuffle(1000).batch(5)
    return dataset

classifier = tf.estimator.BoostedTreesClassifier(
    n_batches_per_layer=1,
    n_trees=10,
    feature_columns=feature_columns,
    model_dir='./random_forest_model' # model directory
)

classifier.train(input_fn=train_input_fn, steps=100)

# Inference (example)
def eval_input_fn():
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((dict(df[features]), df['label']))
    dataset = dataset.batch(1)
    return dataset

eval_results = classifier.evaluate(input_fn=eval_input_fn)
print(eval_results)

```

In this example, the training and evaluation processes are carried out using the `BoostedTreesClassifier`, and though no explicit hyperparameter indicates Gini impurity, it is the default behavior for internal tree building. This isn't directly stated in the training, but the underlying C++ implementation defaults to this measure.

**Example 2: Custom Tree Definition (not available in Estimator API)**

The following example illustrates what is *not* directly available within the high level API. It demonstrates that in order to control the impurity function at a finer grain, one would need to venture into custom tree building, outside of the `tf.estimator` package. This illustrates that we cannot alter this parameter using the built-in Random Forest implementation

```python
# Note: This is conceptual and not within tf.estimator's Random Forest API
# Illustrates that manual control is required to use other methods
# In a pure theoretical scenario, consider pseudo-code:

# class TreeNode:
#      def __init__(self, features, labels, impurity_measure="gini"):
#          self.impurity_measure = impurity_measure
#          self.features = features
#          self.labels = labels
#          self.split_feature = None
#          self.split_threshold = None
#          self.left_child = None
#          self.right_child = None

#      def calculate_impurity(self):
#          if self.impurity_measure == "gini":
#              # Implementation of Gini Calculation
#              pass
#          elif self.impurity_measure == "entropy":
#             # Implementation of entropy Calculation
#              pass
#          else:
#              raise ValueError("Impurity measure must be either 'gini' or 'entropy'")

#     def split_data(self):
#        best_split = find_best_split(self.features, self.labels, self.impurity_measure)
#        if best_split:
#            self.split_feature = best_split['feature']
#            self.split_threshold = best_split['threshold']
#            #split the data here, and create left and right nodes

# The key point here is that a class like the one shown above would allow for switching,
# but this kind of lower level tree building is not exposed in the Estimator API.
# If we wanted to switch from Gini to entropy, it would require a re-implementation
# of the tree building process. This is usually not feasible.
```

This example serves to highlight that if one requires an alternative impurity measure like entropy, a deeper level of control over the tree creation mechanism is needed, rather than directly configuring it within the higher-level `tf.estimator.BoostedTreesClassifier` API. This reaffirms that within the Estimator framework, the Gini impurity is the default and essentially the only option.

**Example 3: Inspecting internal representation (Conceptual)**

It is also important to know that the actual construction of the trees is done internally at the C++ implementation level. Inspecting the model graph using `tf.compat.v1.train.import_meta_graph` reveals the computation graph's operation. However, it doesn't directly show the usage of either Gini or entropy computation within the actual operations, these are hidden inside the implementation of `tf_boosted_trees.GetBestSplits` operator, confirming the behavior is not directly user-configurable.

```python
# This section is very conceptual and primarily to demonstrate what we CAN'T observe easily

# import tensorflow as tf
# import os

# # assuming 'classifier' model from example 1 is trained and saved

# model_dir = "./random_forest_model"
# latest_checkpoint = tf.train.latest_checkpoint(model_dir)

# saver = tf.compat.v1.train.import_meta_graph(latest_checkpoint + '.meta')
# with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
#     saver.restore(sess, latest_checkpoint)
#     graph = tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph()

#     # We can inspect the operations and node names, but we won't find Gini or Entropy
#     # computation happening directly as Tensorflow operators. This logic is
#     # inside the custom C++ operators such as `tf_boosted_trees.GetBestSplits`.
#     # for op in graph.get_operations():
#     #    print(op.name)

#     # We can identify tree building and decision related operations,
#     # but no specific "Gini" or "Entropy" operator will exist in the graph.
#     # The underlying implementation uses Gini as default.
```

This conceptual example is to illustrate the nature of the implementation, not a readily runnable part of the process, and showcases the difficulty in directly manipulating internal choices. It indicates that we are bound to the default choice of Gini impurity unless we would venture to construct the forest via our own custom logic.

To conclude, while the specific impurity measure utilized within a TensorFlow Random Forest is not a directly configurable hyperparameter, based on my experience and understanding of the underlying implementations, it consistently leverages the Gini impurity as the default method for splitting nodes within its CART-like trees. The absence of a configuration parameter for changing the impurity measure points towards a hard-coded default, aligning with performance optimizations made at the C++ level. To obtain further in-depth understanding, consulting TensorFlow's source code, specifically the files involved in building decision trees, is recommended. Specifically, the boosted tree component within the TensorFlow library is relevant. Exploring textbooks and research articles focused on decision trees and ensemble methods offers supplementary knowledge. This includes material on Gradient Boosting and CART algorithms.
