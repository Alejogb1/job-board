SQL Server's failure to initialize `sqlcmd` stems most frequently from insufficient permissions or incorrect configuration of the SQL Server instance's network protocols.  Over my fifteen years working with SQL Server in various enterprise environments, I've encountered this issue countless times, often tracing it back to seemingly minor misconfigurations during server deployments or post-patch updates. Let's delve into the root causes and potential solutions.

**1. Explanation:**

The `sqlcmd` utility is a command-line tool used to interact with SQL Server.  It relies on a robust connection established between the client machine (where `sqlcmd` resides) and the SQL Server instance. This connection necessitates proper network configuration on the SQL Server side, including the correct enabling and configuration of TCP/IP and named pipes protocols, and appropriate firewall rules. On the client machine, it requires appropriate permissions and the correct installation of the SQL Server Client Connectivity components.  Failures typically manifest as error messages related to network connectivity, authentication issues, or insufficient permissions.  Furthermore, incorrect SQL Server service accounts or limitations imposed by the operating system's User Account Control (UAC) can hinder `sqlcmd` initialization.

Specific error messages vary significantly depending on the exact cause. However, common indicators include:

* **Errors related to network connectivity:** These usually point to a problem with the TCP/IP or named pipes protocols on the SQL Server instance, or network firewall restrictions.  Messages might mention "cannot connect to server," "network-related or instance-specific error," or similar phrasing.
* **Authentication failures:** Incorrect login credentials, disabled SQL Server Authentication mode, or issues with the SQL Server login account itself will prevent `sqlcmd` from connecting.  Errors will usually indicate a login failure or an incorrect password.
* **Permission-related errors:** If the user running `sqlcmd` lacks the necessary permissions to connect to the SQL Server instance, the initialization will fail. This may manifest as a general access denied message or a more specific error indicating the user's insufficient rights.
* **Service-related problems:** If the SQL Server service is not running, or is running with errors, `sqlcmd` will inevitably fail to initialize.  Checking the SQL Server service status using the Services application is crucial in such cases.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential troubleshooting steps using PowerShell, focusing on verifying SQL Server's network configuration and checking service status.  These examples assume a basic understanding of PowerShell and familiarity with the SQL Server environment.  Adapt them to your specific situation.

**Example 1: Verifying SQL Server Network Configuration (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Get the SQL Server instance name
$InstanceName = "YOUR_SQL_SERVER_INSTANCE_NAME"

# Check TCP/IP protocol status
$TCPIPStatus = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service -Filter "Name='SQLSERVERAGENT' AND Started = 'True'" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name

if ($TCPIPStatus -ne $null) {
    Write-Host "SQL Server Agent service is running."
} else {
    Write-Host "SQL Server Agent service is not running."
}

# Get SQL Server network configuration
$NetworkConfig = Get-WmiObject -Namespace root\Microsoft\SqlServer\Configuration\Instance -Class SQLSERVER_NetworkProtocols -Filter "InstanceName='$InstanceName'"

# Check TCP/IP enabled status
$TCPIPEnabled = $NetworkConfig | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "Tcp"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty IsEnabled
if ($TCPIPEnabled) {
    Write-Host "TCP/IP is enabled for instance '$InstanceName'."
} else {
    Write-Host "TCP/IP is disabled for instance '$InstanceName'."
}

#Check Named Pipes enabled status
$NamedPipesEnabled = $NetworkConfig | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "Named Pipes"} | Select-Object -ExpandProperty IsEnabled
if ($NamedPipesEnabled) {
    Write-Host "Named Pipes is enabled for instance '$InstanceName'."
} else {
    Write-Host "Named Pipes is disabled for instance '$InstanceName'."
}
```

This script retrieves the status of the SQL Server Agent service and checks if TCP/IP and Named Pipes protocols are enabled for the specified instance.  Remember to replace `"YOUR_SQL_SERVER_INSTANCE_NAME"` with your actual instance name.  This provides a foundational check for network connectivity.

**Example 2: Checking SQL Server Service Status (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Get the SQL Server service status
$ServiceStatus = Get-Service "MSSQLSERVER"

# Check if the service is running
if ($ServiceStatus.Status -eq "Running") {
    Write-Host "SQL Server service is running."
} else {
    Write-Host "SQL Server service is not running. Status: $($ServiceStatus.Status)"
    # Attempt to start the service (use caution!)
    # Start-Service "MSSQLSERVER"
}
```

This script checks the status of the MSSQLSERVER service.  If it's not running, it provides the status reason.  Uncommenting the `Start-Service` line will attempt to start the service; however, exercise caution as this should only be done if you are certain of the root cause and have the necessary permissions.


**Example 3:  Testing Connectivity with sqlcmd (Command Prompt):**

```sqlcmd
sqlcmd -S YOUR_SERVER_NAME\YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME -U YOUR_USERNAME -P YOUR_PASSWORD
```

This command attempts to connect to the SQL Server instance using `sqlcmd`.  Replace `YOUR_SERVER_NAME`, `YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME`, `YOUR_USERNAME`, and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with the appropriate values.  Successful execution indicates a working connection; failure will present specific error messages that provide further clues.  Note that if you use Windows Authentication, omit `-U` and `-P`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, consult the official SQL Server documentation, specifically focusing on the `sqlcmd` utility, network configuration, and troubleshooting connectivity issues.  Review the SQL Server Books Online for detailed explanations of error messages. The Microsoft SQL Server documentation provides comprehensive guides on service management and security configurations relevant to `sqlcmd` initialization problems.  Examine the event logs for detailed error messages and timestamps that might pinpoint the source of the failure.  Furthermore, utilizing a network monitoring tool can assist in identifying network connectivity problems.  Finally, searching through various SQL Server forums and communities can uncover solutions to similar issues encountered by others.
