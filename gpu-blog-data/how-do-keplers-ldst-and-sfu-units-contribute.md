Kepler's performance hinges critically on the interplay between its Light Dependent (LD) and Storage (ST) units, coupled with the sophisticated Streaming Functional Units (SFUs).  My experience optimizing Kepler-based GPU computations for high-performance computing applications has highlighted the nuanced relationship between these components.  Understanding their individual contributions and their synergistic effects is key to maximizing computational throughput.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The LD units constitute the core compute elements of a Kepler GPU.  These are essentially the processing units responsible for executing instructions on the data residing in the GPU's memory.  Their performance is limited by several factors: the clock speed, the number of LD units available in the specific Kepler architecture (varying across models like GK104, GK110, etc.), and the efficiency of data access from memory.  The latter is significantly impacted by memory bandwidth and latency, as well as the effectiveness of caching mechanisms.  In short, LD units perform the primary arithmetic and logic operations.

The ST units are crucial for mitigating the performance bottlenecks introduced by memory access.  Kepler's ST units act as high-bandwidth, low-latency memory buffers, caching frequently accessed data closer to the LD units.  This dramatically reduces the time spent waiting for data from the main GPU memory.  The effectiveness of the ST units depends on several factors, including their size (again, varying across Kepler architectures), the coherence of memory access patterns (spatial and temporal locality), and the efficiency of the memory management unit in prioritizing data transfer to and from the ST units.  Poorly optimized memory access patterns can completely negate the benefits of even the most capacious ST units.

SFUs represent a specialized hardware component introduced in Kepler, offering significant performance acceleration for specific types of computation.  Unlike the general-purpose LD units, SFUs are optimized for highly parallel operations involving special functions, including transcendental functions (sine, cosine, exponential, logarithmic, etc.) and various mathematical operations crucial for many scientific simulations and graphics algorithms.  Offloading these specialized calculations to SFUs frees up the LD units to focus on other tasks, thereby improving overall throughput.  However, the utilization of SFUs requires careful code restructuring to exploit their specific capabilities.  Inefficient use of SFUs might even lead to performance degradation due to additional overhead.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating the impact of ST unit optimization.**

This example demonstrates the performance difference between naive memory access and optimized access leveraging ST units through appropriate memory access patterns.  Assume we're performing a large matrix multiplication.

```c++
//Naive Implementation
for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i){
    for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j){
        for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k){
            C[i*N + j] += A[i*N + k] * B[k*N + j];
        }
    }
}

//Optimized Implementation - Improved spatial locality
for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i){
    for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j){
        float temp = 0.0f;
        for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k){
            temp += A[i*N + k] * B[k*N + j];
        }
        C[i*N + j] = temp;
    }
}

```

The optimized version exhibits better spatial locality, allowing the ST units to cache consecutive elements of A and B more effectively, thereby reducing memory access latency.  The difference becomes more pronounced with larger matrix sizes (N).

**Example 2:  Leveraging SFUs for transcendental function computations.**

This example highlights the performance gain achievable by utilizing SFUs for calculating sine values within a physics simulation.

```c++
//Using standard LD units
for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i){
    angles[i] = sinf(angles[i]);
}

//Using SFUs (assuming a hypothetical CUDA-like API)
__global__ void calculateSines(float* angles, int N){
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < N) {
        angles[i] = __sinf(angles[i]); //Hypothetical SFU-optimized sin function
    }
}
```

The second approach, leveraging a hypothetical SFU-optimized `__sinf` function, will significantly outperform the first, especially with a large number of angles (N).  The crucial detail is the use of a kernel function and parallel processing, allowing efficient utilization of the SFUs.  Note that the specifics would vary depending on the actual CUDA library or similar GPU programming framework.

**Example 3:  Combined LD/ST/SFU optimization for a ray tracing algorithm.**

This example showcases the combined optimization of LD, ST, and SFU units in a simplified ray tracing kernel.

```c++
__global__ void rayTrace(Ray* rays, int N, float3* scene, int sceneSize){
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N){
    //Optimized memory access using shared memory (ST unit simulation)
    __shared__ float3 sharedScene[SHARED_MEMORY_SIZE];
    int sceneIndex = i % sceneSize;  //Simplified index calculation
    sharedScene[threadIdx.x] = scene[sceneIndex];
    __syncthreads();

    //Ray-scene intersection calculations (LD unit intensive)
    float3 intersectionPoint;
    // ...Ray-scene intersection logic...

    //Color calculation using transcendental functions (SFU optimized)
    float3 color = make_float3(__sinf(intersectionPoint.x), __cosf(intersectionPoint.y), __expf(intersectionPoint.z));
  }
}
```

This kernel utilizes shared memory to simulate ST unit usage, improving data access for the ray-scene interaction calculations.  The color calculation utilizes hypothetical SFU-optimized transcendental functions (`__sinf`, `__cosf`, `__expf`).  This demonstrates how a real-world algorithm can leverage all three components for optimal performance. The shared memory would need to be carefully managed based on its size and the dimensions of the problem.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To further delve into this topic, I recommend consulting the official NVIDIA Kepler architecture documentation.  Detailed performance analysis papers focusing on Kepler-based GPU implementations for various applications provide valuable insights.  Furthermore, textbooks on parallel computing and GPU programming offer a solid theoretical foundation.  Finally, specialized literature on GPU memory management and optimization techniques is highly beneficial for effectively utilizing ST units and understanding their limitations.  These resources, when studied comprehensively, will grant a much deeper understanding of Kepler's architecture and its performance characteristics.
