Automated testing of binaries originating from Subversion (SVN) on High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems presents a unique set of challenges primarily rooted in the divergence of development environments and the often-complex resource management of HPC clusters. My experience developing simulation software for climate modeling has exposed me to these issues directly; managing code from a version control system designed for more conventional workflows, and then deploying to diverse HPC architectures, requires a careful combination of established software engineering and HPC-specific techniques.

The core problem is that SVN repositories typically contain source code, not the compiled binaries that execute on HPC nodes. We need a pipeline that automatically retrieves the code, builds the binary for a target HPC environment, and then executes tests to ensure correctness and stability. This automated workflow must be reliable, reproducible, and adaptable to changes in both the codebase and the HPC system. Central to this is recognizing the distinction between SVN, which focuses on version control of source code, and the disparate architectures found in HPC environments that require bespoke build procedures. We therefore need an intermediary system that bridges this gap.

To tackle this, the first essential step is to implement a build environment that mirrors the target HPC system. This is often achieved through containerization, using technologies like Docker or Singularity, which allows us to capture dependencies and configuration. We then integrate this build process with a Continuous Integration (CI) system like Jenkins, Gitlab CI, or similar. This CI system monitors the SVN repository for changes, and upon detecting a new commit, retrieves the relevant code. Subsequently, it instantiates a container representing the HPC environment and executes the necessary build commands. These build commands typically include compiling the code using the appropriate compilers (e.g., Intel, GCC, PGI) and linking with any required libraries available within that environment.

The second essential component is a robust testing framework. Given the nature of HPC applications, unit testing alone often does not suffice; we require integration tests and potentially performance tests that more accurately simulate the intended HPC use case. These tests should not only verify functional correctness but also assess performance metrics like execution time and memory usage, as these become critical factors for large-scale simulations. The framework must be easily adaptable, allowing tests to be added, modified, or removed without significant disruption of the overall process. Critically, test execution should be automated on the target HPC cluster, leveraging resource management systems like Slurm, PBS, or LSF for scheduling tests onto the relevant resources.

Here are three code examples demonstrating core steps in the automation process, along with detailed explanations:

**Example 1: Dockerfile for an HPC Build Environment**

This Dockerfile sets up a basic environment suitable for compiling code that will eventually run on an HPC system. Note that this is a simplified example; real-world Dockerfiles may contain numerous specific dependencies and configurations depending on the application.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    gfortran \
    cmake \
    subversion

WORKDIR /app

# Example: Install a fictional dependency
RUN apt-get install -y libnetcdf-dev

# Optional: Add specific compiler modules
#RUN echo "module load intel/2021" >> /etc/bash.bashrc

# Example: Create a basic cmake build
COPY ./source /app/source

RUN mkdir build && cd build && \
    cmake ../source && \
    make -j $(nproc)

CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

*   **`FROM ubuntu:20.04`**: Specifies the base operating system for the container.
*   **`RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ...`**: Updates the package list and installs essential build tools (compilers, CMake, SVN) and dependencies.
*   **`WORKDIR /app`**: Sets the working directory inside the container.
*   **`COPY ./source /app/source`**: Copies the source code into the container.
*   **`RUN mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../source && make -j $(nproc)`**: Builds the software using CMake; note that this is simplified and would need to be tailored to the specific build requirements of the SVN repository.
*   **`CMD ["/bin/bash"]`**:  Sets the entry point to start a Bash shell which allows for manual interaction if required during testing.

**Example 2: Jenkins Pipeline (Groovy syntax) for automated builds**

This example showcases a pipeline that would automatically build the code from the SVN repository using the container described above and then execute a simple test. This is a simplified pipeline for illustration purposes.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout SVN') {
            steps {
                svn 'https://path/to/svn/repository'
            }
        }
        stage('Build Image') {
            steps {
              script {
                    dockerImage = docker.build("hpc-build-image")
               }
            }
        }
        stage('Build Software') {
            steps {
              script {
                  docker.image("hpc-build-image").inside {
                         sh 'cd build && make'
                    }
                 }
            }
        }
        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                script {
                  docker.image("hpc-build-image").inside {
                       sh './build/test_executable'
                     }
               }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

*   **`pipeline { ... }`**: Defines a Jenkins pipeline, indicating a sequence of steps to be executed.
*   **`agent any`**: Specifies the agent node where the pipeline will run.
*   **`stage('Checkout SVN')`**: A stage for retrieving the code from the SVN repository, using a Jenkins SVN plugin.
*  **`stage('Build Image')`**: Builds the docker image of the HPC environment.
*  **`stage('Build Software')`**:  Runs the build command within the created Docker container.
*   **`stage('Run Tests')`**:  Executes tests within the container environment.  The test program, `test_executable`, would need to exist in the repository and built by the `Build Software` stage. This stage would be adjusted to whatever tests are appropriate for the code.

**Example 3: Python script for simple job submission to SLURM**

This script demonstrates a basic approach to submitting a job to a SLURM cluster that executes the compiled executable. Note that this script assumes you already have the binaries built within the Docker container.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import time

def submit_slurm_job(executable_path, num_nodes=1, num_tasks_per_node=1, time_limit="00:10:00"):

    job_script = f"""#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=automated_test
#SBATCH --nodes={num_nodes}
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node={num_tasks_per_node}
#SBATCH --time={time_limit}
#SBATCH --output=slurm-%j.out

srun {executable_path}
"""
    script_filename = "slurm_job.sh"
    with open(script_filename, "w") as f:
        f.write(job_script)

    try:
        result = subprocess.run(["sbatch", script_filename], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        print(f"Job submitted: {result.stdout.strip()}")
        job_id = result.stdout.split()[-1]
        os.remove(script_filename)
        return job_id
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error submitting job: {e.stderr}")
        os.remove(script_filename)
        return None

def check_job_status(job_id):
    while True:
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(["squeue", "-j", job_id], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
            if not result.stdout:
                return True # Job has finished
            time.sleep(10)
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            return True # Assume job is complete due to absence in queue
def main():
    executable_path = "/path/to/test/executable" # Path to the executable inside the HPC environment.
    job_id = submit_slurm_job(executable_path)
    if job_id:
        print(f"Job id: {job_id}. Waiting for it to finish")
        if check_job_status(job_id):
          print("Job Complete")
    else:
        print ("Error in job submission")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

*   **`submit_slurm_job`**: This function creates a SLURM job submission script, using the provided values, writes it to file, and submits it using `sbatch`. It captures the job ID from the standard output and removes the temporary file.
*   **`check_job_status`**: Periodically queries the status of the job, returning `True` when the job is no longer listed in the queue.
*   **`main`**: Demonstrates how to use the functions, including setting path for the executable.

For resource recommendations, I would suggest investigating "Continuous Delivery" by Jez Humble and David Farley, which offers detailed insights into general CI/CD practices that are beneficial for HPC. For containerization, books and online resources on Docker and Singularity are excellent starting points, depending on your HPC system's requirements. Finally, the documentation for your HPC system's job scheduler (Slurm, PBS, LSF) and parallel programming models (MPI, OpenMP) should be consulted for specific details related to job submission and execution.

Implementing automated testing for SVN-based HPC applications requires a combination of version control best practices, containerization techniques, CI/CD pipelines, and job submission knowledge for HPC environments. Each part of the solution presented here contributes to a more robust and reliable workflow. Adapting each component to your specific needs will yield a more optimized development pipeline.
