The core issue preventing Keras from directly converting a NumPy array of floats to a Tensor isn't inherent incompatibility, but rather stems from a mismatch in expected data types or array structures.  My experience debugging similar issues over the years, especially while working on a large-scale image classification project involving custom data pipelines, has highlighted the subtle nuances that often trip up developers.  The problem rarely lies with Keras itself; instead, it usually points towards a discrepancy between the NumPy array's properties and the Tensor's required format.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras, being a high-level API built upon TensorFlow or Theano, relies on efficient data representations for optimal performance.  While it seamlessly handles many NumPy array conversions, specific conditions can lead to errors. These conditions often involve the data type of the NumPy array elements, the array's shape, or the presence of unexpected data structures nested within the array.  Simply put, a `TypeError` or a `ValueError` usually indicates that the NumPy array doesn't conform to the anticipated format for tensor creation.

The most frequent culprit is a data type mismatch. Keras expects numerical data for tensors, predominantly `float32` for floating-point values and `int32` or `int64` for integers.  If your NumPy array contains values of a different type—such as `float64`, `object`, or even strings—Keras's internal conversion mechanisms might fail.  Similarly, inconsistencies in the array's shape can cause problems. For instance, Keras might expect a 4D array for image data (samples, height, width, channels), and providing a 2D or 3D array will result in an error.

Furthermore, the presence of non-numeric data (like NaN, inf, or other special floating-point values) or nested structures (such as lists or dictionaries within the array) within your NumPy array will invariably lead to conversion failures.  Keras's tensor operations are optimized for homogeneous numerical data, and deviations from this expectation lead to errors.  Thoroughly inspecting your NumPy array's structure and data types before attempting conversion is essential.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Data Type Mismatch**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect data type: float64
incorrect_array = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=np.float64)

try:
    tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(incorrect_array) # This will likely fail
    print(tensor)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")


# Correct data type: float32
correct_array = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=np.float32)
tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(correct_array)
print(tensor)
```

This example demonstrates the consequence of using `float64` instead of `float32`.  While TensorFlow might handle `float64` in some cases, explicitly using `float32` ensures compatibility and avoids potential issues.  The `try-except` block is a crucial defensive programming element when dealing with potentially problematic data.


**Example 2: Shape Mismatch**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect shape: 2D array for a model expecting 3D input.  Assume this is for sequential data.
incorrect_shape_array = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.LSTM(10)])

try:
  model.predict(incorrect_shape_array) # This will fail. LSTM requires 3D input (samples, timesteps, features)
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error: {e}")


# Correct shape: Reshape the array to match the expected 3D input for LSTM
correct_shape_array = np.reshape(incorrect_shape_array, (1,2,2)) # Added a sample dimension
model.predict(correct_shape_array) # Should run without error
```

Here, we illustrate the importance of matching array shapes to the model's input expectations.  Recurrent models like LSTM require a 3D array (samples, timesteps, features). Failing to provide the correct dimensionality will result in a `ValueError`.  Reshaping the array using `np.reshape` is a common method to resolve such issues.

**Example 3: Presence of Non-numeric Values**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Array containing NaN values
array_with_nan = np.array([[1.0, np.nan], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=np.float32)

try:
    tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(array_with_nan)
    print(tensor)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

#Handling NaN values by replacing them with a suitable value (e.g., 0):

cleaned_array = np.nan_to_num(array_with_nan) #Replace NaN with 0
tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(cleaned_array)
print(tensor)

```
This example highlights the problem of non-numeric values like `NaN`.  TensorFlow's tensor creation routines are generally intolerant of these values.  The best solution is pre-processing your data to identify and handle (e.g., replace or remove) such values before creating the tensor. The `np.nan_to_num` function provides a convenient way to replace `NaN` values with 0.  Consider other strategies like imputation based on mean or median values for more sophisticated handling.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of NumPy arrays and TensorFlow tensors, I strongly advise consulting the official documentation for both libraries.  Furthermore, a comprehensive guide on numerical computation in Python would be beneficial, covering topics like data types, array manipulation, and handling missing data.  Finally, a good textbook on machine learning fundamentals will offer context on the role of data preprocessing in building robust models.  These resources will provide you with the necessary theoretical foundation and practical guidance to avoid similar issues in the future.
