Keras Tunerâ€™s default behavior halts the hyperparameter search when a model fails to build, a situation that can arise frequently during experimentation. Rather than interrupting the entire search process, it is generally more effective to configure Keras Tuner to gracefully handle these build failures and proceed to the next hyperparameter combination. This resilience is vital for efficiently exploring the hyperparameter space, especially when dealing with complex model architectures or resource constraints.

The core issue stems from Keras Tuner's error handling; by default, it propagates exceptions raised during the `build_model` function, causing the search to terminate prematurely. The solution involves modifying the `objective` function passed to the `Tuner` instance. Specifically, we encapsulate the model build process within a `try-except` block. Should a `build_model` call fail, instead of throwing the error, we return a very low, non-competitive metric value (e.g., a large negative number for minimization problems or a tiny number near zero for maximization problems), signaling to the tuner that this specific hyperparameter set is unsuitable. This allows the tuner to continue its search process, moving on to promising hyperparameter configurations.

Implementing this requires a custom `objective` function. This function will accept the `hp` (HyperParameters) object and be responsible for building, training, and evaluating the model based on the current set of hyperparameters. The vital step is wrapping the model construction logic within the try-except block. The `try` block contains our standard code for building and running the model, while the `except` block intercepts any model construction failures. Returning the low metric value from this `except` block allows us to signal the model build failure without halting the hyperparameter search. This technique ensures that the tuner explores the search space completely instead of aborting at the first sign of trouble during model creation.

Here's how this can be incorporated into a typical Keras Tuner workflow.

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def build_model(hp):
    #  Simulating potential build issues by introducing a conditional failure.
    # This conditional logic can be replaced with real cases of failure.
    if hp.Boolean('introduce_failure'):
        raise ValueError("Simulated build failure!")
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units_1', min_value=32, max_value=512, step=32), activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units_2', min_value=32, max_value=512, step=32), activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

def objective(hp):
    try:
        model = build_model(hp)
        # Generate some dummy training data.
        X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
        y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
        X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=0, validation_data=(X_val,y_val)) # Short training for demo.
        _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_val,y_val, verbose = 0)
        return accuracy
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Model build failure: {e}")
        return -1000  # Return a large negative value on build error.

# Generate some dummy training data.
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)


# Initiate the tuner.
tuner = kt.RandomSearch(
    objective = objective,
    max_trials = 10,
    overwrite = True,
    directory='test_dir',
    project_name='test_project'
    )
tuner.search()
```

In this example, the `build_model` function now contains conditional logic which, controlled by a hyperparameter, simulates a model build failure, allowing to reliably demonstrate the functionality within this code snippet. The key change is in the `objective` function. We've wrapped the `build_model`, training, and evaluation in a try-except block. Upon failure, it prints an informative message and returns a significantly negative value (-1000). The RandomSearch tuner will effectively ignore this result and continue to the next hyperparameter combination.

Here's a second, more complex implementation incorporating a separate validation split. It also directly shows how to pass data within the `objective` function.

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def build_model(hp):
   if hp.Boolean('introduce_failure'):
      raise ValueError("Simulated build failure!")
   model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units_1', min_value=64, max_value=256, step=32), activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(hp.Float('dropout', min_value=0.0, max_value=0.5, step=0.1)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units_2', min_value=64, max_value=256, step=32), activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
   return model

def objective(hp, train_data, val_data):
  try:
    X_train, y_train = train_data
    X_val, y_val = val_data

    model = build_model(hp)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=0, validation_data=(X_val,y_val))
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_val,y_val, verbose = 0)

    return accuracy
  except Exception as e:
    print(f"Model build failure: {e}")
    return -1000

# Generate dummy data, split it.
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
train_data = (X_train, y_train)
val_data = (X_test, y_test)


# Initiate the tuner with training data in the objective
tuner = kt.RandomSearch(
    objective=lambda hp: objective(hp, train_data, val_data),  # Pass data into the function
    max_trials=10,
    overwrite=True,
    directory='test_dir2',
    project_name='test_project2'
)

tuner.search()
```
In this second example, a dropout layer has been added, along with a dropout hyperparameter. The training and evaluation logic, and the failure handling remain within the `objective` function. The key change here is that the objective function is now taking additional arguments, containing the training and validation data. These data arguments are passed in via a lambda function defined when instantiating the Tuner class. This makes the objective function more flexible for cases where the data preprocessing should be independent of the `objective` function.

Here's a final implementation showing an alternative failure handling method which uses a value close to 0 for maximization, and demonstrates a `Hyperband` tuner.

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def build_model(hp):
    if hp.Boolean('introduce_failure'):
      raise ValueError("Simulated build failure!")
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units_1', min_value=16, max_value=128, step=16), activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units_2', min_value=16, max_value=128, step=16), activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

def objective(hp, train_data, val_data):
    try:
        X_train, y_train = train_data
        X_val, y_val = val_data
        model = build_model(hp)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, verbose=0, validation_data=(X_val,y_val))
        _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_val,y_val, verbose=0)
        return accuracy
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Model build failure: {e}")
        return 0.00001  # Returns a small value for maximization

# Generate dummy data, split it
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
train_data = (X_train, y_train)
val_data = (X_test, y_test)

tuner = kt.Hyperband(
    objective=lambda hp: objective(hp, train_data, val_data),
    max_epochs=5,
    directory='test_dir3',
    project_name='test_project3',
    factor=3
)

tuner.search()
```

This final example implements the same failure handling as before, but this time we use a small value close to 0.00001 to signal a failure. This is because accuracy is a maximization metric. As it is attempting to find the maximum accuracy value from the parameter space, a small return value here signals the tuner that this parameter space is not a viable space. This shows the method of dealing with build failures when using a maximization metric. Additionally, this example uses a `Hyperband` tuner to highlight that this approach applies to different Tuner classes within Keras Tuner. The key elements here are the consistent use of a `try`-`except` block and the return of a non-competitive value in case of build failure, regardless of the tuner type.

For further exploration, refer to the Keras Tuner documentation, which contains detailed explanations of customization and API usage. The scikit-learn documentation can help with data manipulation using train/test splitting. Textbooks on Deep Learning often include chapters dedicated to hyperparameter optimization which provide theoretical understanding of the underlying optimization algorithms. I have found reading code examples in open source projects a great way to understand implementation details and get some insight into the practical nuances.
