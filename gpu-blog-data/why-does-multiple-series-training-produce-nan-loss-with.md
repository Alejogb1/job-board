The phenomenon of NaN (Not a Number) loss emerging during multiple-series training while absent in single-series training with identical data stems fundamentally from the instability introduced by combining gradients from disparate series with potentially vastly different scales or distributions.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous LSTM and transformer-based models, this instability often manifests when the series lack proper normalization or exhibit significant differences in variance.  Failing to address these issues leads to exploding gradients, eventually culminating in NaN values propagating through the loss calculation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue revolves around the gradient calculation and update process during backpropagation.  In single-series training, the gradients are computed based on a single data stream.  The magnitude of these gradients, while potentially large or small depending on the model's architecture and the data itself, remains relatively consistent within a single training iteration.  However, when multiple series are trained simultaneously, gradients from each series are summed or otherwise aggregated before the model's weights are updated.  If these series have drastically different scales – for example, one series representing daily stock prices (range: 100-200) and another representing hourly sensor readings (range: 0.001-0.002) – the gradients from the stock price series will dominate the update process.  The smaller gradients from the sensor readings become effectively insignificant, and the model effectively ignores them.  Worse still, if these disparate series have high variance, the accumulation of large positive and negative gradients can lead to numerical overflow, resulting in NaN values.

This effect is exacerbated by the choice of optimizer and its learning rate.  Optimizers like Adam, while generally robust, can still struggle with wildly varying gradient magnitudes. A learning rate that is appropriate for one series might be far too large or small for another, leading to oscillations and ultimately NaN values.  The learning rate's role here is critical; a poorly tuned learning rate can amplify the instability arising from differing series scales.  Furthermore, the activation functions within the model contribute.  Activation functions like sigmoid or tanh can saturate with extremely large or small input values, hindering gradient flow and again leading to numerical instability.

In summary, the problem isn't inherently tied to the data itself but rather to the incompatibility of gradient updates arising from drastically different series scales and distributions.  Proper preprocessing and careful consideration of the training parameters are vital to mitigate this issue.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating Scale Differences**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Two series with vastly different scales
series1 = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 100  # Stock Prices
series2 = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 0.001 # Sensor Readings

# Concatenate and convert to PyTorch tensors
data = torch.tensor(np.concatenate((series1, series2), axis=1), dtype=torch.float32)

# Simple linear model
model = nn.Linear(2, 1)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

# Training loop (simplified for illustration)
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = loss_fn(output, torch.zeros_like(output)) # Placeholder target
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This example directly demonstrates how differing scales can cause instability.  `series1` and `series2` have significantly different ranges, leading to potential gradient dominance from `series1`.  The placeholder target is used for simplicity; in a real-world scenario, this would be the actual target values.


**Example 2:  Normalization and improved Stability**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Data as before
series1 = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 100
series2 = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 0.001

# Normalize using StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
data = scaler.fit_transform(np.concatenate((series1, series2), axis=1))
data = torch.tensor(data, dtype=torch.float32)

# Model, optimizer and loss as before
model = nn.Linear(2, 1)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

#Training loop (simplified)
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = loss_fn(output, torch.zeros_like(output))
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This example introduces `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to normalize the data before training.  Normalization ensures that both series have a similar scale, preventing the dominance of one series' gradients over the other.


**Example 3:  Handling Gradient Explosions with Gradient Clipping**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

#Data (un-normalized for demonstration)
series1 = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 100
series2 = np.random.rand(100, 1) * 0.001
data = torch.tensor(np.concatenate((series1, series2), axis=1), dtype=torch.float32)

# Model, optimizer, loss
model = nn.Linear(2,1)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

#Training loop with gradient clipping
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = loss_fn(output, torch.zeros_like(output))
    loss.backward()
    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1) #Gradient Clipping
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This example showcases gradient clipping, a technique to prevent gradient explosions.  `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_` limits the magnitude of gradients, preventing them from becoming excessively large and causing NaN values.

*   Research papers on recurrent neural networks and transformers:  Focus on papers addressing stability issues in these architectures, particularly when dealing with multiple time series.  Pay close attention to papers focusing on gradient normalization and optimization strategies.  Examining the impact of activation functions is also beneficial.


These resources will provide a more detailed understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts and practical strategies for addressing the NaN loss issue in multiple-series training. Remember that proper data preprocessing and careful consideration of optimization parameters are crucial for robust training, particularly when dealing with multiple time series with varying scales and distributions.
