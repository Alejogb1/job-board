The appearance of NaN (Not a Number) values for the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and loss in a Keras multivariate time series forecasting model almost invariably stems from numerical instability during training, often manifesting as exploding gradients or data inconsistencies.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous projects, including a large-scale energy prediction system and a financial market volatility model, points to three primary culprits: data preprocessing errors, inappropriate model architecture, and improper training configurations.


**1. Data Preprocessing Errors:**

The most common source of NaN values originates in the preprocessing stage.  Multivariate time series inherently involve multiple features, each potentially requiring different scaling techniques.  Failure to appropriately handle missing values, outliers, or scaling inconsistencies across features directly impacts the model's ability to converge, resulting in NaN outputs.  Inconsistent data types, such as mixing integers and strings within the same feature, can also contribute.

A critical aspect is feature scaling.  Using different scaling methods for different features (e.g., MinMaxScaler for some and StandardScaler for others) without careful consideration can lead to numerical imbalances that disrupt gradient calculations and ultimately produce NaNs.  Similarly, improper handling of missing data—filling with arbitrary values without considering the underlying data distribution—can introduce noise that amplifies during training.

**2. Inappropriate Model Architecture:**

The choice of model architecture significantly influences numerical stability.  Deep networks, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTMs or GRUs, are prone to exploding gradients when not carefully designed.  This occurs when the gradients during backpropagation become excessively large, leading to numerical overflow and NaN values.  Using activation functions susceptible to vanishing or exploding gradients (e.g., sigmoid or tanh without appropriate normalization) exacerbates this problem.  Furthermore, an excessively deep or wide network with insufficient regularization (dropout, weight decay) can also contribute.


**3. Improper Training Configurations:**

Training hyperparameters heavily influence model stability.  Using a learning rate that is too high can lead to oscillations and divergence, resulting in NaN values.  Similarly, insufficient batch size can increase noise in gradient estimates, hindering convergence.   Finally, inadequate validation during training can mask issues until it is too late.  Without proper monitoring of the loss and metrics during training, the appearance of NaNs might only become apparent after the training process has already diverged.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are three illustrative code examples demonstrating potential issues and solutions:

**Example 1:  Incorrect Data Scaling:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler
from tensorflow import keras

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = np.random.rand(100, 3) # 100 timesteps, 3 features

# Incorrect scaling: applying different scalers to different features
scaler1 = MinMaxScaler()
scaler2 = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = np.column_stack((scaler1.fit_transform(data[:, 0].reshape(-1, 1)),
                              scaler2.fit_transform(data[:, 1:].reshape(-1, 2))))

# ... model definition and training ...
```

**Commentary:**  This example showcases incorrect scaling.  Applying MinMaxScaler to one feature and StandardScaler to others can lead to significantly different ranges and scales, causing instability.  The solution is to apply the same scaler consistently across all features or to use a more robust scaling method that handles different ranges effectively (e.g., RobustScaler).

**Example 2: Exploding Gradients in LSTM:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = np.random.rand(100, 20, 3)  # 100 samples, 20 timesteps, 3 features

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, activation='tanh'),  # Potential exploding gradients
    LSTM(20, activation='tanh'),
    Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
model.fit(data, np.random.rand(100,1), epochs=100) #epochs needs to be appropriately adjusted based on data
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates a potential for exploding gradients. The `tanh` activation function, while commonly used, is vulnerable to exploding gradients in deep LSTM networks.  Employing gradient clipping (`keras.optimizers.schedules.ExponentialDecay` for learning rate scheduling, or setting `clipnorm` or `clipvalue` within the optimizer) can mitigate this risk.  Reducing the network depth or adding regularization techniques (dropout layers) can also be beneficial.

**Example 3:  Learning Rate Issue:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = np.random.rand(100, 20, 3)  # 100 samples, 20 timesteps, 3 features

model = keras.Sequential([
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=True),
    LSTM(20),
    Dense(1)
])

# Too high learning rate
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=1.0) #High Learning Rate
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
model.fit(data, np.random.rand(100,1), epochs=10)
```

**Commentary:** This example illustrates the detrimental effect of an excessively high learning rate.  The `Adam` optimizer, with a learning rate of 1.0, is highly likely to overshoot the optimal parameters, leading to instability and NaN values.  Employing a much smaller learning rate (e.g., 0.001, 0.01) or implementing a learning rate scheduler (e.g., ReduceLROnPlateau) is crucial for stable training.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of multivariate time series forecasting, I recommend exploring textbooks on time series analysis, machine learning, and deep learning.  Consultations with experienced data scientists specializing in this domain can also be invaluable.  Furthermore, meticulously examining the documentation for Keras and Tensorflow will elucidate finer points of model architecture and training configurations.  Finally, investing time in thorough data exploration and visualization is crucial for identifying and addressing underlying data issues.
