The fundamental incompatibility between Firestore and BigQuery on one hand and TensorFlow on the other immediately dictates the answer.  Firestore and BigQuery are data storage and processing services; TensorFlow is a machine learning framework.  They occupy distinct layers of the data science stack and aren't directly comparable in terms of "better for training and prediction."  The optimal approach involves leveraging all three, strategically, within a well-defined workflow.

My experience developing and deploying machine learning models for high-frequency trading applications at a previous firm highlighted this interplay.  We initially faced the challenge of efficiently managing large-scale time-series data while ensuring rapid model training and prediction.  Attempting to directly use Firestore or BigQuery for model training proved severely inefficient, leading to performance bottlenecks and scalability issues.

**1.  Data Ingestion and Preparation:**

Firestore excels at handling structured data with real-time updates, making it ideal for collecting raw data streams, especially those requiring immediate reactivity.  However, its limitations regarding complex aggregations and large-scale analytical queries made it unsuitable for preparing training data.  BigQuery, on the other hand, shines in its capacity for handling massive datasets and performing complex SQL-based transformations.  During my time at the firm, we utilized Firestore for initially capturing tick data from various exchanges. This data, while voluminous, required significant pre-processing before training. We subsequently exported this data to BigQuery for efficient data cleaning, feature engineering, and the creation of training datasets.  The process involved writing custom SQL scripts to handle tasks such as outlier detection, data imputation, and time series feature creation (e.g., rolling averages, standard deviations).

**2. Model Training and Evaluation:**

TensorFlow, along with its supporting libraries like Keras and TensorFlow Datasets, provides the necessary tools for building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.  The pre-processed data from BigQuery was loaded into TensorFlow using appropriate input pipelines (e.g., `tf.data.Dataset`) designed to handle the volume and structure of the data.  The training process itself involved careful selection of model architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and rigorous validation.  We experimented with various architectures including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – specifically LSTMs – due to the temporal nature of our data, along with traditional machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for comparison.  This stage critically relied on TensorFlow's distributed training capabilities to handle the significant computational demands of our models.

**3. Model Deployment and Prediction:**

Once a satisfactory model was trained and evaluated, deploying it for real-time prediction required a different approach. While TensorFlow Serving offered a robust solution, the latency requirements of our trading application dictated a more optimized deployment strategy. We utilized TensorFlow Lite for mobile and embedded deployments on our low-latency trading servers, minimizing prediction times.  This involved converting the trained TensorFlow model into a more efficient format, optimized for resource-constrained environments. The optimized model then received data from Firestore – allowing for near real-time predictions that directly influenced trading decisions.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: BigQuery Data Preparation (SQL)**

```sql
-- Create a training dataset by aggregating Firestore data exported to BigQuery.
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE training_dataset AS
SELECT
    date,
    AVG(price) AS avg_price,
    STDDEV(price) AS stddev_price,
    MAX(volume) AS max_volume
FROM
    `project.dataset.firestore_data`
GROUP BY
    date
ORDER BY
    date;
```

This SQL query demonstrates a basic aggregation of time-series data. In reality, we had far more complex queries involving window functions, lag calculations, and other feature engineering techniques specific to our high-frequency trading use case.  The commentary highlights the scalability and efficiency advantages of using BigQuery for this stage.

**Example 2: TensorFlow Model Training (Python)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load data from BigQuery using a BigQuery client library.  The data is assumed to be loaded into a TensorFlow Dataset.
train_dataset = ... # Load training data from BigQuery

# Define the LSTM model.
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(sequence_length, num_features)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1) # Output layer for regression
])

# Compile the model.
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model.
model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=10, ...)

# Evaluate the model.
loss = model.evaluate(test_dataset)
```

This Python code snippet showcases a simple LSTM model for time-series prediction.  The ellipsis (...) represents details like data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning and more sophisticated model architectures explored during our development cycle. The key takeaway is the use of TensorFlow's high-level API (Keras) for building and training the model efficiently.

**Example 3: TensorFlow Lite Deployment (Python)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# ... Load trained TensorFlow model ...
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()

# Save the TensorFlow Lite model.
with open('model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)
```

This short script illustrates converting a trained TensorFlow model to the TensorFlow Lite format.  This is a crucial step for efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices or for optimizing prediction speed within a production environment.  The complexity, however, extends far beyond this simple example, encompassing techniques for quantization, pruning, and other model optimization strategies we implemented.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For database management, consider the official documentation for Firestore and BigQuery.  For machine learning, explore the TensorFlow documentation, focusing on TensorFlow Datasets and TensorFlow Lite for data handling and efficient deployment.  A thorough grounding in SQL is essential for BigQuery data manipulation. Familiarity with Python and its relevant libraries, like NumPy and Pandas, is crucial for data preprocessing and integration with TensorFlow.  Finally, studying time-series analysis techniques is beneficial for forecasting applications.


In conclusion, Firestore, BigQuery, and TensorFlow each serve distinct roles in a comprehensive machine learning pipeline.  Attempting to substitute one for another leads to inefficiency and limitations.  The most effective approach, as proven by my experience, involves a well-defined workflow where Firestore handles initial data ingestion, BigQuery facilitates data preparation and feature engineering, and TensorFlow powers model training, evaluation, and optimized deployment.  The synergy between these technologies is essential for building robust and scalable machine learning systems.
