Deploying a TensorFlow Serving model incorporating custom Keras functions requires careful consideration of serialization and function registration.  My experience working on high-throughput recommendation systems highlighted the critical need for a robust approach to ensure these custom functions are correctly loaded and executed within the serving environment.  Failure to do so results in runtime errors, rendering the model unusable.  The key lies in leveraging TensorFlow's SavedModel format and ensuring the custom functions are included within the saved model's assets.


**1.  Explanation of the Deployment Process**

The standard TensorFlow Serving workflow involves saving a model as a SavedModel, then loading this model within the TensorFlow Serving server.  However, when custom Keras functions are present, these functions are not automatically serialized with the model's weights and architecture.  Therefore, we must explicitly include them in the SavedModel's assets.  This is accomplished by creating a custom `tf.saved_model.save` function that handles the serialization of these functions. This often involves creating a custom serialization function that converts the custom Keras function into a format that TensorFlow Serving can understand and reconstruct. This usually involves representing the function's code in a serializable way (e.g., using a string representation of the Python code). 

Furthermore, the custom functions must be importable within the TensorFlow Serving environment. This might necessitate packaging them into a separate Python module and including this module along with the SavedModel. The server then loads this module, making the custom functions available during model inference.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**


**Example 1: Simple Custom Activation Function**

This example demonstrates saving a model with a custom activation function.  This function, `custom_activation`, is serialized along with the model, ensuring it's available during deployment.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def custom_activation(x):
  return tf.nn.relu(x) * tf.math.sin(x)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation=custom_activation)
])

#Crucial step: Define the custom objects to save
custom_objects = {'custom_activation': custom_activation}

tf.saved_model.save(model, 'saved_model', signatures=tf.saved_model.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY,
                    options=tf.saved_model.SaveOptions(experimental_custom_objects=custom_objects))


```

The crucial part here is the use of `experimental_custom_objects` within `tf.saved_model.SaveOptions`. This dictionary maps the name of the custom function used in the model ("custom_activation") to the function itself.  This allows TensorFlow Serving to correctly reconstruct the model during loading.


**Example 2: Custom Layer with Dependencies**

This example extends the previous one by introducing a custom layer that relies on external libraries or modules. This scenario highlights the importance of appropriate packaging for deployment.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from my_custom_module import my_custom_function #Assume my_custom_module contains my_custom_function

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def call(self, inputs):
    return my_custom_function(inputs)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  CustomLayer()
])


#Define custom objects which are serializable
custom_objects = {'CustomLayer': CustomLayer, 'my_custom_function': my_custom_function}

tf.saved_model.save(model, 'saved_model_with_layer', signatures=tf.saved_model.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY,
                    options=tf.saved_model.SaveOptions(experimental_custom_objects=custom_objects))
```

In this example, the `CustomLayer` uses `my_custom_function` from `my_custom_module`. For successful deployment,  `my_custom_module` must be included in the deployment package alongside the SavedModel.  The `experimental_custom_objects` dictionary includes both the custom layer and function.



**Example 3:  Handling complex custom functions**

For very complex custom functions that may not serialize well directly, consider representing them using a textual representation, such as a string containing the Python code.  This requires a custom loading mechanism within the server.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
import inspect

def complex_function(x):
    #Complex logic here...
    return tf.math.sqrt(tf.reduce_sum(x**2))

model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation=complex_function)])

#Serialize the function's code as string
complex_function_code = inspect.getsource(complex_function)

custom_objects = {'complex_function': complex_function_code}

tf.saved_model.save(model, 'saved_model_complex', signatures=tf.saved_model.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY,
                    options=tf.saved_model.SaveOptions(experimental_custom_objects=custom_objects))

#Server-side code (pseudocode) to dynamically execute the function
#loaded_function_code = custom_objects['complex_function']
#exec(loaded_function_code) #Dynamic execution, requires appropriate safeguards.

```
This approach requires careful consideration of security and potential code injection vulnerabilities when using `exec` or `eval`.  Robust sanitization and validation of the loaded code are paramount.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

TensorFlow Serving documentation provides detailed explanations of model saving and loading procedures.  The TensorFlow documentation on custom objects and serialization is also invaluable.  Books focusing on advanced TensorFlow and deployment strategies offer insights into handling complex scenarios.  Consider reviewing resources on containerization and orchestration technologies like Docker and Kubernetes for effective deployment management.  Finally, consult resources on Python packaging to create deployable artifacts containing both the model and necessary dependencies.
