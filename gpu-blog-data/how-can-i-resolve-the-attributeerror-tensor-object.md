The core issue, as I’ve repeatedly observed when integrating custom loss functions with pre-trained Keras models, specifically a VGG model for perceptual loss, is that the gradient flow computation and tracking mechanisms, crucial for backpropagation, differ between the raw TensorFlow tensors produced by pre-trained models and the Keras layers typically used in end-to-end trainable models. This leads to the `AttributeError: 'Tensor' object has no attribute '_keras_history'` error. The error manifests because Keras, when constructing its computational graph, relies on the `_keras_history` attribute to understand how tensors are derived from layer outputs, enabling it to backpropagate through the network. Pre-trained models, when used in their raw, non-wrapped form, do not have this property.

The problem typically arises when you directly use the output of a pre-trained model as input to your custom loss function without wrapping it within a Keras layer that will properly maintain the history. The most direct example of this is extracting specific feature maps from the VGG network – perhaps, the outputs of `block3_conv2` and `block4_conv2` – and directly using them to compute a loss metric, without connecting these to Keras layers for gradient propagation purposes. The raw tensor from this model lacks the metadata Keras requires to trace gradients.

To illustrate, let's imagine I have built a super-resolution model where I use a perceptual loss, utilizing features extracted from a VGG19 network. The incorrect code might look like this.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG19
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

def perceptual_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  vgg = VGG19(include_top=False, weights='imagenet', input_shape=(256, 256, 3))
  vgg.trainable = False
  
  model_input = vgg.input
  layer_names = ['block3_conv2', 'block4_conv2']
  outputs = [vgg.get_layer(name).output for name in layer_names]
  feature_extraction_model = keras.Model(inputs=model_input, outputs=outputs)

  true_features = feature_extraction_model(y_true)
  pred_features = feature_extraction_model(y_pred)

  loss = 0
  for tf, pf in zip(true_features, pred_features):
    loss += K.mean(K.square(tf - pf))
  return loss

#Dummy images for demonstration
img_shape = (1, 256, 256, 3)
y_true_example = tf.random.normal(img_shape)
y_pred_example = tf.random.normal(img_shape)


# Error occurs when trying to calculate loss
loss_val = perceptual_loss(y_true_example, y_pred_example)
print(loss_val) # This will generate the AttributeError
```

This code is flawed because the tensors returned from the `feature_extraction_model` are TensorFlow tensors, not outputs of Keras layers. They lack the crucial `_keras_history` attribute required for gradient computation within the Keras framework. Attempting to use these in the loss calculation will inevitably trigger the described error. The `vgg` model here is treated as a static feature extractor, with no mechanism to propagate errors back to it.

To resolve this, the pre-trained model’s output must be converted into a format that Keras understands. This is usually done through custom Keras layers that re-package the raw output. Here’s a corrected approach using a `Lambda` layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG19
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Lambda

def feature_extraction_model():
    vgg = VGG19(include_top=False, weights='imagenet', input_shape=(256, 256, 3))
    vgg.trainable = False

    model_input = vgg.input
    layer_names = ['block3_conv2', 'block4_conv2']
    outputs = [vgg.get_layer(name).output for name in layer_names]
    feature_extraction_model = keras.Model(inputs=model_input, outputs=outputs)

    # Wrap output tensors with Lambda layers
    wrapped_outputs = [Lambda(lambda x: x)(output) for output in outputs]
    
    return keras.Model(inputs=model_input, outputs=wrapped_outputs)


def perceptual_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  feature_extractor = feature_extraction_model()

  true_features = feature_extractor(y_true)
  pred_features = feature_extractor(y_pred)


  loss = 0
  for tf, pf in zip(true_features, pred_features):
    loss += K.mean(K.square(tf - pf))
  return loss

#Dummy images for demonstration
img_shape = (1, 256, 256, 3)
y_true_example = tf.random.normal(img_shape)
y_pred_example = tf.random.normal(img_shape)


# Now loss computation will work
loss_val = perceptual_loss(y_true_example, y_pred_example)
print(loss_val)
```

In this revised example, I have encapsulated the VGG feature extraction logic within a separate function, `feature_extraction_model`, that creates an intermediate `keras.Model`.  The critical change is the wrapping of each feature map extracted from the VGG model with a `Lambda` layer using `wrapped_outputs = [Lambda(lambda x: x)(output) for output in outputs]`. The `Lambda` layer acts as an identity function but importantly provides that `_keras_history` to any tensor that passes through it. By wrapping the output tensors of the feature extraction model in `Lambda` layers, I am allowing these outputs to participate in the Keras computational graph. The loss function can now correctly calculate the gradients.

A more sophisticated alternative, especially in situations involving more complex feature extraction strategies or adjustments, involves constructing the entire feature extraction logic as a complete custom layer using the `tf.keras.layers.Layer` base class. This allows you greater control over the forward pass.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG19
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K

class FeatureExtractionLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, layer_names, **kwargs):
        super(FeatureExtractionLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.layer_names = layer_names
        self.vgg = None
        self.outputs = None


    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.vgg = VGG19(include_top=False, weights='imagenet', input_shape=input_shape[1:])
        self.vgg.trainable = False
        outputs = [self.vgg.get_layer(name).output for name in self.layer_names]
        self.outputs = outputs


    def call(self, inputs):
      intermediate_model = keras.Model(inputs=self.vgg.input, outputs=self.outputs)
      return intermediate_model(inputs)


def perceptual_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    feature_extractor = FeatureExtractionLayer(layer_names=['block3_conv2', 'block4_conv2'])

    true_features = feature_extractor(y_true)
    pred_features = feature_extractor(y_pred)


    loss = 0
    for tf, pf in zip(true_features, pred_features):
      loss += K.mean(K.square(tf - pf))
    return loss

#Dummy images for demonstration
img_shape = (1, 256, 256, 3)
y_true_example = tf.random.normal(img_shape)
y_pred_example = tf.random.normal(img_shape)


# Now loss computation will work
loss_val = perceptual_loss(y_true_example, y_pred_example)
print(loss_val)
```

In this third example, I defined a custom Keras layer called `FeatureExtractionLayer`. This encapsulates the VGG initialization and feature extraction logic. This approach is particularly beneficial for complex feature manipulation, model parameter handling, or whenever you need greater customisation beyond a basic wrapping function. The `build` function initializes the pre-trained VGG model, while the `call` method extracts and returns the desired feature maps.  The call to `intermediate_model(inputs)` ensures that the forward pass of the pre-trained model occurs within the context of a Keras layer.

These three different methods, while achieving the same goal, allow you to balance between code simplicity and control. For simple extraction of feature maps the `Lambda` solution will often suffice, but for more complex cases the custom layer is required.

For further understanding of the nuances of using pre-trained models and custom layers in Keras, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically focusing on the Keras API and custom layers documentation. The Keras documentation provides exhaustive insights into the functioning of its computational graph. In addition, studying examples of image super-resolution or style transfer models, available in numerous research articles and code repositories (GitHub etc), can solidify knowledge about the practical application of this method for perceptual loss. The source code of the Keras applications module can also be very beneficial for understanding how pretrained models are integrated in larger systems. Finally, reviewing research papers covering perceptual loss will present the topic in a theoretical and research context.
