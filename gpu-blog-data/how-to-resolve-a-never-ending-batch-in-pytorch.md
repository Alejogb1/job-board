Batches that never conclude during training in PyTorch, commonly referred to as "never-ending" or "stuck" batches, typically stem from issues within the data loading pipeline or unexpected interactions with the training loop itself. I've debugged this several times, and it almost always falls into a few distinct categories: data source problems, improper handling of multi-processing, or incorrect iterator behavior. This response details common causes and demonstrates effective resolution strategies.

The primary reason for a batch getting stuck arises from the `DataLoader` object and how it interacts with the underlying dataset. `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` is responsible for fetching and collating data samples into batches, and it does this by relying on an iterator derived from a `torch.utils.data.Dataset` instance. If the dataset’s iterator is faulty, returning an invalid state or becoming blocked, the `DataLoader` can become stalled. A stuck iterator could be caused by an infinite loop within the `__getitem__` method of the custom `Dataset` subclass, perhaps due to a failed I/O operation that's not properly handled, causing the fetching process to hang. Another common issue involves file locking, especially when working with shared resources accessed by multiple worker processes. If a worker process attempts to access a locked file, it might wait indefinitely, resulting in a stalled batch.

Improper multi-processing configurations within the `DataLoader` also cause stalls. When `num_workers` is set to a value greater than zero, PyTorch spawns subprocesses to load data in parallel. Improperly configured data loaders (e.g., insufficient shared memory) can lead to these workers getting stuck while trying to transfer data back to the main process. Sometimes, an incompatible system setup, such as shared memory limits or an inappropriate start method can lead to deadlock between workers. If data processing within a worker is not robust, a single failed sample can lead to the whole worker process crashing, stalling the entire pipeline if a catch or restart mechanism isn't in place.

Finally, and less commonly, issues can arise from unexpected interactions within the training loop itself. If model operations performed within the training loop inadvertently alter the state used by the data loading process, it can create a circular dependency and lock up a batch. This could occur when using in-place operations on tensors that affect data sampling.

Now let's illustrate this with code examples. The first example highlights a common problem within the `Dataset` itself – a poorly designed `__getitem__` function that has an internal loop never exiting, thereby causing the data fetching to block.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import time

class FaultyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size=100):
        self.size = size

    def __len__(self):
        return self.size

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        # Simulate a flawed data loading process
        i = 0
        while True: # Intentionally flawed infinite loop
            i+=1 # i never reaches the exit condition
            # Attempt to access an invalid file to simulate failure
            try:
                with open(f'non_existent_file_{i}.txt', 'r') as f:
                  data = f.read()
            except FileNotFoundError:
              break # Break out of the loop if the file doesn't exist - an actual solution, but not part of the error reproduction in code
        time.sleep(0.1) #Simulate heavy data access operation
        return torch.randn(10)

dataset = FaultyDataset()
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=False)


# Attempt training loop
for batch_idx, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
    print(f"Batch {batch_idx} processed")
```
In this example, the infinite while loop in `__getitem__`, simulating a failing data loading attempt, causes the data loader to hang indefinitely. The `print` statement in the training loop will never be reached. The remedy here involves replacing the while loop with a robust error handling implementation.

The second example showcases a problem related to multiprocessing, where an incorrectly configured `DataLoader` can become stuck when `num_workers` is greater than zero.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import os
import multiprocessing

class MockDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size=100):
        self.size = size
        self.data_lock = multiprocessing.Lock()

    def __len__(self):
        return self.size

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        # Simulate a heavy data loading process
        with self.data_lock:
          time.sleep(0.1)
          return torch.randn(10)

# Use 'spawn' to avoid shared memory conflict
multiprocessing.set_start_method('spawn')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    dataset = MockDataset()
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, num_workers=4, shuffle=False)

    for batch_idx, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
        print(f"Batch {batch_idx} processed")
```

Here, although the core loading within `__getitem__` is functional,  the shared lock might introduce delays or a potential lock if not managed properly, leading to stalls when worker processes try to access it. Incorrect multiprocessing can lead to issues with the `dataloader` causing a stall. The solution would involve removing the lock if it's not necessary, and ensuring a proper start method, which in this instance is the `spawn` method. Additionally, proper testing and monitoring of system resources such as shared memory usage, are vital.

The final example demonstrates an issue where an unintended modification within the training loop interacts poorly with the data loading process. This example is synthetic, as it's less frequent, but it demonstrates the potential for unintended effects.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class SampleDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, size=100):
      self.size = size
      self.data_store = [torch.randn(10) for _ in range(size)] # Store data to simulate access

    def __len__(self):
        return self.size

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data_store[idx]

dataset = SampleDataset()
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=False)

#Training Loop
for batch_idx, batch in enumerate(dataloader):
    # Attempting an in-place operation during batch processing
    # This example is intentionally flawed to demonstrate a potential cause
    batch[0].add_(torch.rand(10))
    print(f"Batch {batch_idx} processed")
```

Here, modifying a batch in place via `batch[0].add_(torch.rand(10))` , after it's been returned by the data loader, won't cause a hard crash, but is generally inadvisable as the change can effect other parts of the batch pipeline especially if multi-processing is enabled, leading to hard-to-diagnose errors. The primary solution is to create copies of the data if modifications are necessary within the loop, keeping the original data immutable, preventing any unpredictable behavior.

In conclusion, resolving never-ending batches requires a systematic approach. Inspecting the `Dataset`'s `__getitem__` method, ensuring robust error handling for data loading, and paying close attention to multiprocessing configurations are essential. Monitoring resource usage and avoiding in-place tensor modifications within the training loop further mitigates potential pitfalls. Further reading on PyTorch data loading can be found in the official PyTorch documentation and resources covering data loading best practices. Look into tutorials on creating custom data loaders and general debuging strategies for deep learning pipelines to develop an intuitive handle on this area.
