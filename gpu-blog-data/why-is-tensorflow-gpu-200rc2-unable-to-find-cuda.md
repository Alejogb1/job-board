TensorFlow 2.0.0rc2's inability to locate CUDA 10.1 libraries, consequently skipping GPU acceleration, stems primarily from an incompatibility between the TensorFlow build and the CUDA toolkit's installation path or environment variables.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous projects, involving both custom-built deep learning models and pre-trained networks, points consistently to this core problem.  The runtime environment must explicitly provide TensorFlow with the necessary paths to locate the CUDA libraries, cuDNN libraries, and associated header files.  Failure to do so results in the reported behavior.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow-gpu, by design, attempts to automatically detect CUDA-capable devices at runtime.  This detection relies on a series of checks, primarily querying the system's environment variables (like `CUDA_HOME`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PATH`) for the presence of CUDA and cuDNN.  If these variables are improperly set or point to incorrect locations, TensorFlow's auto-detection mechanism fails.  The failure manifests as a warning message indicating that no compatible GPU devices were found, and the program defaults to CPU execution.  This is especially critical in 2.0.0rc2, as it had stricter requirements compared to later releases regarding the exact version compatibility between CUDA, cuDNN, and the TensorFlow build itself.  Inconsistencies, even minor ones in version numbering, will often lead to this failure.  Additionally, issues can arise from incorrect installation procedures, permissions conflicts, or interference from other CUDA-based applications on the system.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate this with three scenarios: the problematic default, a corrected approach using environment variables, and a solution leveraging a virtual environment.

**Example 1: The Problematic Default (Likely the Initial State):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# Output: Num GPUs Available:  0
```

This simple script attempts to list available GPUs.  If TensorFlow fails to locate the CUDA libraries, it will report zero GPUs, even if a compatible GPU and CUDA toolkit are installed on the system. This is the symptomatic behavior outlined in the question. The crucial point is that this does not indicate a problem with the installation of CUDA or the GPU; the problem is the lack of linking between TensorFlow and the CUDA installation.

**Example 2: Correcting with Environment Variables:**

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf

os.environ['CUDA_HOME'] = '/usr/local/cuda-10.1' # Adjust path to your CUDA installation
os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH'] += ':/usr/local/cuda-10.1/lib64' # Append to existing LD_LIBRARY_PATH
os.environ['PATH'] += ':/usr/local/cuda-10.1/bin' # Append to existing PATH

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# Potential Output: Num GPUs Available:  1
```

Here, we explicitly set the necessary environment variables.  `CUDA_HOME` points to the root directory of the CUDA 10.1 installation.  Crucially, we *append* to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PATH` rather than overwriting them, preserving existing entries. This is important to avoid conflicts with other software. This method directly addresses the core issue: providing TensorFlow with the correct location of the CUDA libraries.  The path `/usr/local/cuda-10.1` needs to be adjusted to reflect your specific CUDA 10.1 installation directory.  Note that the success depends entirely on the accuracy of this path.

**Example 3: Utilizing a Virtual Environment:**

```bash
python3 -m venv tf_env
source tf_env/bin/activate
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.0.0rc2
# Install CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN separately
# Ensure CUDA_HOME and other relevant environment variables are set correctly within the virtual environment before running.
python your_script.py
```

This approach uses a virtual environment, creating an isolated environment for TensorFlow and its dependencies.  This isolates TensorFlow from potential conflicts with other CUDA-using applications.  The key here is the need to install CUDA and cuDNN *outside* the virtual environment but to ensure that the environment variables (`CUDA_HOME`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PATH`) are correctly set *within* the virtual environment before running your TensorFlow code.  This prevents conflicts and ensures that TensorFlow is using the specified CUDA version.  Remember to activate the virtual environment before running any TensorFlow code.  The crucial distinction lies in managing environment variables within a separate context.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official CUDA Toolkit documentation. Carefully review the installation instructions and environment variable settings.
*   The official cuDNN documentation.  Pay close attention to compatibility requirements with specific CUDA versions.
*   The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on GPU support and installation.  Scrutinize the prerequisites and troubleshooting sections.  Compare the version of TensorFlow with the versions of CUDA and cuDNN carefully.
*   A comprehensive guide on managing Linux environment variables. Understanding how environment variables are inherited and managed is crucial.

In conclusion, the failure of TensorFlow-gpu 2.0.0rc2 to find CUDA 10.1 libraries originates from a failure in establishing the necessary link between the TensorFlow runtime and the CUDA toolkit.  Precisely setting the environment variables, or more robustly, using a virtual environment to manage dependencies and environment variables are the primary solutions.  Remember meticulous attention to detail in both paths and version compatibility is critical.  Carefully examining your system's CUDA installation and verifying environment variables will rectify this issue in most cases.  Remember always to consult the official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
