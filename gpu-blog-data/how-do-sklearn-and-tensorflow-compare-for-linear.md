The core difference between scikit-learn (sklearn) and TensorFlow/Keras for linear regression with dummy variables lies in their architectural approach and inherent capabilities.  Sklearn excels in its simplicity and efficiency for standard statistical modeling tasks, offering a concise, readily interpretable solution. TensorFlow, on the other hand, is a powerful deep learning framework better suited for complex models and large datasets, requiring more setup but allowing for greater scalability and integration with more sophisticated techniques.  My experience working on predictive modeling projects for financial institutions, involving datasets with millions of rows and numerous categorical features, has highlighted this distinction.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Both libraries can effectively handle linear regression with dummy variables, which represent categorical features in a numerical format suitable for regression algorithms.  The process involves one-hot encoding or other similar techniques to transform categorical variables into multiple binary columns.  Sklearn provides built-in functions for this preprocessing step, neatly integrated within its linear model functionalities.  TensorFlow, while lacking such direct integration, offers flexibility through its preprocessing layers or external libraries like Pandas.

In sklearn, the entire process—preprocessing, model training, and evaluation—occurs within a streamlined, object-oriented pipeline.  This facilitates reproducibility and maintainability.  Conversely, TensorFlow requires a more explicit definition of the computational graph, encompassing data input, preprocessing, model construction, training loops, and evaluation metrics.  This added complexity provides flexibility for customization but necessitates a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's API.

The choice between the two ultimately hinges on project-specific needs.  For straightforward linear regression tasks with relatively small to medium-sized datasets and a strong emphasis on interpretability, sklearn is generally preferred for its ease of use and concise code.  For larger datasets, complex model architectures (potentially incorporating regularization or other advanced techniques), and situations demanding distributed training or GPU acceleration, TensorFlow's scalability and flexibility become critical advantages.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Sklearn Linear Regression with One-Hot Encoding**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Sample data with a categorical feature
data = {'feature1': np.random.rand(100),
        'category': ['A', 'B', 'C'] * 33 + ['A'],
        'target': np.random.rand(100)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a preprocessing pipeline
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(), ['category'])
    ],
    remainder='passthrough'
)

# Create the full pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('regressor', LinearRegression())
])

# Split data
X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
y = df['target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train and evaluate the model
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
score = pipeline.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"R-squared score: {score}")
```

This example demonstrates the elegant integration of preprocessing and modeling within sklearn. The `ColumnTransformer` handles one-hot encoding of the 'category' column, and the `Pipeline` neatly chains this with the linear regression model.  The resulting code is concise and readable.


**Example 2: TensorFlow/Keras Linear Regression with One-Hot Encoding (using tf.keras)**


```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Sample data (same as above)
data = {'feature1': np.random.rand(100),
        'category': ['A', 'B', 'C'] * 33 + ['A'],
        'target': np.random.rand(100)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# One-hot encoding using pandas
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['category'], prefix=['category'])

# Separate features and target
X = df.drop('target', axis=1).values
y = df['target'].values

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(X.shape[1],))
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mse')

# Split data (same as above)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {loss}")
```

This TensorFlow example uses `pd.get_dummies` for one-hot encoding, a simpler approach for this specific case. The model is defined as a simple dense layer. The increased verbosity compared to sklearn reflects TensorFlow's more explicit model definition.  Note that model evaluation uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) which is consistent with the underlying linear regression approach.


**Example 3: TensorFlow/Keras with Embedding Layer (for high-cardinality categorical features)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Sample data with a high-cardinality categorical feature
data = {'feature1': np.random.rand(1000),
        'high_card_category': np.random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J'], size=1000),
        'target': np.random.rand(1000)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Encode the categorical feature using LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
df['high_card_category'] = le.fit_transform(df['high_card_category'])

# Split data
X = df.drop('target', axis=1).values
y = df['target'].values
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the model with an embedding layer
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=10, output_dim=5, input_length=1),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Reshape input to be compatible with Embedding layer
X_train = X_train[:,1].reshape(-1, 1)
X_test = X_test[:,1].reshape(-1, 1)


# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train and evaluate the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)
loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {loss}")

```
This demonstrates how TensorFlow's flexibility handles high-cardinality categorical features more efficiently than a one-hot encoding approach, which would be extremely memory-intensive. The embedding layer learns a lower-dimensional representation of the categorical feature.  Note that this requires reshaping the input data to fit the embedding layer.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For sklearn, consult the official documentation and explore resources on statistical modeling techniques. For TensorFlow, delve into the official TensorFlow documentation, and seek out guides on deep learning fundamentals and practical applications.  Consider books focusing on machine learning with Python; many cover both libraries.  Familiarizing yourself with linear algebra and probability/statistics will greatly enhance your understanding.
