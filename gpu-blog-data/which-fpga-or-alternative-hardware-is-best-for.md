My focus when selecting a hardware platform for accelerated computation invariably gravitates towards achieving a balance between performance, power consumption, cost, and development effort. The ideal choice, in my experience, isn't a single 'best' but rather a solution tailored to specific project constraints and objectives. The question of FPGA versus alternative hardware hinges heavily on the inherent trade-offs involved.

Firstly, we must dissect the broad landscape of ‘alternative hardware’ being considered. This typically includes general-purpose processors (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Each presents its own set of advantages and disadvantages relative to Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). CPUs, while ubiquitous and extremely flexible, struggle when facing inherently parallel workloads that require high throughput. GPUs, designed for parallel graphics processing, excel in data-parallel computations but can be limited by memory access patterns and require specialized programming models. ASICs offer the highest performance and energy efficiency for specific tasks but lack the flexibility of FPGAs and incur significant upfront costs associated with design and fabrication.

FPGAs sit between these extremes, providing a reconfigurable hardware fabric that can be customized to accelerate specific computational kernels. The hardware description languages (HDLs) used to program FPGAs, such as VHDL and Verilog, allow for the implementation of custom data paths, memory interfaces, and arithmetic units. This allows an application-specific level of optimization unavailable on other hardware platforms. However, programming at this level of abstraction requires a significant engineering effort and specialized skillsets.

Let’s consider a practical scenario. I once worked on a real-time image processing application which needed to execute a complex convolution operation on high-resolution video frames in less than 10 milliseconds. A CPU-based solution was immediately dismissed as it was not capable of meeting the latency constraint. Attempting to parallelize this on a GPU proved difficult, requiring complex data transfers between CPU and GPU memory spaces and still falling slightly short of the target. Implementing a custom pipeline for the convolution operation on an FPGA, however, allowed us to achieve the necessary performance while keeping power consumption in check. This project demonstrated that FPGAs are particularly adept at handling data streaming applications requiring deterministic timing behaviour.

Another experience involved designing a custom cryptographic accelerator. This required specific bit-level manipulations and high throughput data processing. A CPU was wholly inadequate for this type of task, and while a GPU could accelerate certain cryptographic operations, the degree of control I required over the algorithm's dataflow was unavailable. Implementing the entire algorithm within an FPGA's fabric offered a significant performance boost as well as enabling integration with other peripheral functions in the system using dedicated hardware interfaces.

While I've emphasized the strengths of FPGAs, they aren't a panacea. For many applications, the development effort associated with FPGA design is prohibitive. The required learning curve associated with mastering HDL and the intricacies of synthesis, place-and-route, and timing closure should not be underestimated. Furthermore, debugging complex FPGA designs can be challenging compared to software environments.

Now, let’s transition to concrete code examples, although it should be noted that describing complex FPGA designs in a few lines is impossible. These will be illustrative snippets in Verilog, a prevalent HDL for FPGA designs.

**Example 1: A simple adder**

```verilog
module adder(
  input  logic [7:0] a,
  input  logic [7:0] b,
  output logic [7:0] sum
);
  assign sum = a + b;
endmodule
```

This basic module defines an 8-bit adder. The inputs 'a' and 'b' are added, and the result is assigned to the 'sum' output. The beauty of this design when it's realized in hardware is its low latency. The addition operation is implemented in hardware using combinational logic, resulting in a near instantaneous calculation. This level of parallelism is what offers an advantage to FPGAs over CPUs or GPUs for similar operations.

**Example 2: A basic FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer:**

```verilog
module fifo #(parameter DEPTH = 16, parameter WIDTH = 8)(
  input logic        clk,
  input logic        wr_en,
  input logic [WIDTH-1:0]  wr_data,
  input logic        rd_en,
  output logic [WIDTH-1:0] rd_data,
  output logic       empty,
  output logic       full
);
  logic [WIDTH-1:0] mem [0:DEPTH-1];
  logic [4:0] wr_ptr, rd_ptr;
  logic [4:0] count;

  assign empty = (count == 0);
  assign full = (count == DEPTH);
  assign rd_data = mem[rd_ptr];

  always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
   if (wr_en && !full) begin
     mem[wr_ptr] <= wr_data;
     wr_ptr <= wr_ptr + 1;
     count <= count + 1;
    end
    if (rd_en && !empty) begin
     rd_ptr <= rd_ptr + 1;
     count <= count - 1;
   end
  end
endmodule
```

This module describes a FIFO buffer, a fundamental element in many data processing pipelines. It accepts write data ('wr_data') if ‘wr_en’ is asserted and the FIFO is not full. Similarly, it outputs read data ('rd_data') if ‘rd_en’ is asserted and it is not empty. Crucially, this is a hardware implementation. Data can be written and read concurrently with minimal latency, which is significantly different from a software implementation on a CPU. The speed and deterministic nature of the data flow are key advantages.

**Example 3: A multiplier and accumulator:**

```verilog
module multiplier_accumulator (
    input   logic clk,
    input   logic [7:0] a,
    input   logic [7:0] b,
    input   logic reset,
    output  logic [15:0] acc_out
);

    logic [15:0] product;
    logic [15:0] accumulator;

    assign product = a * b;

    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
        if (reset) begin
          accumulator <= 16'd0;
        end
        else begin
            accumulator <= accumulator + product;
        end
    end
    assign acc_out = accumulator;
endmodule
```

This module showcases a simple multiplier followed by an accumulator. Every clock cycle the inputs 'a' and 'b' are multiplied, and the result is added to the accumulator register, unless reset is asserted. Again, this entire operation happens concurrently within the FPGA fabric. This demonstrates how FPGAs can implement complex mathematical operations in hardware, making them efficient for digital signal processing.

Finally, regarding resource recommendations, I would emphasize the importance of the following:

1.  **Hardware-Specific Documentation:** Access the official datasheets and user guides from the manufacturers such as Xilinx, Intel, or Lattice. They contain crucial information about the device architecture, capabilities, and limitations. These should be your primary reference point.
2.  **HDL Textbooks and Courses:** Invest in learning Verilog or VHDL from reputable sources. A strong foundation in HDL is paramount to successful FPGA design. Look for books that provide extensive examples and practical exercises. Online course providers offer comprehensive materials.
3.  **Application Notes:** Device manufacturers often release detailed application notes. These are incredibly valuable for tackling common challenges, such as implementing specific communication interfaces or utilizing onboard peripherals.
4.  **Community Forums:** Engage with other engineers in online communities. Platforms dedicated to FPGAs often host discussions on best practices, design patterns, and debugging techniques.

In conclusion, the selection of an FPGA or alternative hardware is a nuanced decision based upon performance requirements, power consumption constraints, development time, and budget. For applications needing highly parallel processing with deterministic timing, where fine-grained hardware control is important, FPGAs provide distinct advantages. However, the steep learning curve and development effort associated with FPGAs should be carefully considered against alternatives for less demanding or more general-purpose applications.
