The core challenge when working with `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` and needing intermediate LSTM cell states lies in understanding that by default, it only returns the final state and the output sequence. Accessing the intermediate states requires explicitly configuring the function to retain and return these values. My experience with building sequence-to-sequence models for time-series anomaly detection highlighted the need for these intermediate states, particularly when diagnosing model behavior across long sequences.

Specifically, `dynamic_rnn` by design unfolds a recurrent neural network over a time series, and the state of the RNN cell evolves with each time step. An LSTM cell, the typical cell employed, maintains two key state tensors: the cell state (denoted as `c`) and the hidden state (denoted as `h`). The hidden state serves as the primary output at each time step, while the cell state encapsulates the long-term memory of the LSTM. Usually, `dynamic_rnn` outputs a sequence of the hidden states across all time steps along with the final `h` and `c` values.

To extract the intermediate states, you must leverage the `time_major` and `swap_memory` parameters, as well as consider implementing your own custom loop in cases where further control is needed, although such control would come at the cost of having to manually process things. The default is `time_major=False`, which means that the input and output tensors have the shape `[batch_size, time_steps, features]`. If you set `time_major=True`, then the shape becomes `[time_steps, batch_size, features]`. While `time_major=False` is usually easier to interpret and work with, sometimes youâ€™ll find that `time_major=True` can be faster on GPU. Setting `swap_memory=True` can save GPU memory, if that is needed.

The crucial change, however, is how you configure your LSTM cell and how you access returned tensors. Specifically, instead of directly constructing an LSTM cell using, say, `tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell`, you must consider using `tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMStateTuple`, an object which holds the `c` and `h` values. You'll pass in an initial state constructed using `LSTMStateTuple` and retrieve not just the output, but also the intermediate states within the outputs tensor, which then needs to be handled correctly.

Here are a couple of examples illustrating different approaches.

**Example 1: Basic Intermediate State Extraction**

In this example, I demonstrate how to extract intermediate states when the inputs are in the conventional batch-major format, assuming a basic LSTM cell, setting `time_major` as `False`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define hyperparameters
batch_size = 32
time_steps = 10
features = 64
lstm_units = 128

# Input placeholder
inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [batch_size, time_steps, features])

# LSTM cell
lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(lstm_units)

# Initial state
initial_state = lstm_cell.zero_state(batch_size, dtype=tf.float32)

# dynamic_rnn call
outputs, final_state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(lstm_cell, inputs, initial_state=initial_state, dtype=tf.float32)

# Accessing outputs and states
intermediate_outputs = outputs # shape: [batch_size, time_steps, lstm_units]
intermediate_states = outputs # shape: same as outputs

# The final state is a tuple and it must be unpacked to obtain the individual final cell and hidden states.
final_c, final_h = final_state

# To explicitly obtain intermediate cell states, we would need to access them.
# However, by default, dynamic_rnn does not explicitly return intermediate cell states.
# Here is a hack to access hidden states, and it shows that we do get intermediate outputs:
# However, to get intermediate cell states, it requires more manual loops which will be shown in other examples.
# The intermediate hidden states are exactly the "outputs" returned from dynamic_rnn.
# I am only showing them to make sure readers understand what values are actually being outputed,
#   and how they need to be obtained.
# We would also need to access cell states through a custom loop using tf.while_loop.

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    random_input = tf.random_normal([batch_size, time_steps, features]).eval()
    interm_outputs, final_c_val, final_h_val = sess.run(
        [intermediate_outputs, final_c, final_h], feed_dict={inputs: random_input}
    )
    print("Intermediate outputs shape:", interm_outputs.shape)
    print("Final cell state shape:", final_c_val.shape)
    print("Final hidden state shape:", final_h_val.shape)
```

In this first example, I initialized a basic LSTM cell and passed it to `dynamic_rnn`. While I did unpack the final `c` and `h`, note that the "intermediate states" I accessed are not actually the cell states, but rather the hidden states at every time step, which are exactly the same as the output tensor returned by `dynamic_rnn`, as highlighted in the comments. To access true intermediate cell states, one needs a more custom approach.

**Example 2: Custom Loop with `tf.while_loop` for Intermediate Cell States**

The most effective way to extract intermediate cell states is to construct a custom loop using `tf.while_loop` and iterate through the time steps manually, passing the states from each iteration to the next. This is how I often approached more complex use-cases that required very fine control over the LSTM computations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define hyperparameters
batch_size = 32
time_steps = 10
features = 64
lstm_units = 128

# Input placeholder
inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [batch_size, time_steps, features])

# LSTM cell
lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(lstm_units)

# Initial state
initial_state = lstm_cell.zero_state(batch_size, dtype=tf.float32)

# Manually unrolling the loop
def loop_fn(time, cell_state, outputs_ta, states_ta):
    current_input = tf.gather(inputs, time, axis=1) # Extract input for current time step
    current_output, new_cell_state = lstm_cell(current_input, cell_state)
    outputs_ta = outputs_ta.write(time, current_output) # Store the output
    states_ta = states_ta.write(time, new_cell_state)
    return time+1, new_cell_state, outputs_ta, states_ta

# Initialize loop parameters
initial_time = tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.int32)
initial_outputs_ta = tf.TensorArray(dtype=tf.float32, size=time_steps)
initial_states_ta = tf.TensorArray(dtype=tf.float32, size=time_steps)

# while_loop, note that states_ta holds *both* cell and hidden states.
_, _, final_outputs_ta, final_states_ta = tf.while_loop(
    cond = lambda time, *_: time < time_steps,
    body = loop_fn,
    loop_vars = (initial_time, initial_state, initial_outputs_ta, initial_states_ta)
)

# Read the outputs and states
intermediate_outputs = final_outputs_ta.stack() # [time_steps, batch_size, lstm_units]
intermediate_states = final_states_ta.stack()  # [time_steps, batch_size, 2*lstm_units], combined cell and hidden states

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    random_input = tf.random_normal([batch_size, time_steps, features]).eval()
    interm_outputs, interm_states = sess.run(
        [intermediate_outputs, intermediate_states], feed_dict={inputs: random_input}
    )

    print("Intermediate outputs shape:", interm_outputs.shape)
    print("Intermediate states shape:", interm_states.shape)
```

In this example, I used `tf.while_loop` to manually iterate through the time steps, accessing both the hidden states and *true* cell states at each time step.  Note the shape of the `interm_states` output.  It is not just the hidden state, as is the output from `dynamic_rnn`, but it is the combined cell and hidden state.

**Example 3: Intermediate State Extraction with `time_major=True`**

When working with `time_major=True`, as mentioned earlier, we'll have to swap the tensor dimensions of inputs and outputs. This example illustrates the proper handling of these tensors when utilizing the standard `dynamic_rnn` rather than a custom loop.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define hyperparameters
batch_size = 32
time_steps = 10
features = 64
lstm_units = 128

# Input placeholder
inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [time_steps, batch_size, features]) # time_major=True

# LSTM cell
lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(lstm_units)

# Initial state
initial_state = lstm_cell.zero_state(batch_size, dtype=tf.float32)

# dynamic_rnn call
outputs, final_state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(
    lstm_cell, inputs, initial_state=initial_state, dtype=tf.float32, time_major=True
)

# Accessing outputs and states
intermediate_outputs = outputs  # shape: [time_steps, batch_size, lstm_units]
# Same as Example 1, the "states" returned by dynamic_rnn are not the true states, but rather the hidden outputs.
# The final state must be unpacked to obtain individual cell and hidden states.
final_c, final_h = final_state

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    random_input = tf.random_normal([time_steps, batch_size, features]).eval()
    interm_outputs, final_c_val, final_h_val  = sess.run(
        [intermediate_outputs, final_c, final_h], feed_dict={inputs: random_input}
    )
    print("Intermediate outputs shape:", interm_outputs.shape)
    print("Final cell state shape:", final_c_val.shape)
    print("Final hidden state shape:", final_h_val.shape)
```
In this third example, I highlighted that to extract the cell states in the `time_major=True` scenario, we should not change the state access logic compared to what is done in Example 1. We simply must account for the different shapes of the input and output tensors. As in Example 1, to obtain intermediate cell states, a custom `while_loop` approach, similar to Example 2, is required.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding and exploration of RNNs, specifically LSTMs, and TensorFlow functionalities, I recommend consulting these resources:

1.  The official TensorFlow documentation provides detailed explanations of `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn`, `tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell`, and related functions.
2.  Research papers on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), focusing on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures.
3.  Online courses which focus on sequence modelling and neural network architectures.
4.  Examples in the official TensorFlow repository, especially those related to sequence modeling tasks.

Understanding the nuances of `dynamic_rnn` and extracting intermediate states is key to tackling advanced sequence modeling tasks. The approaches outlined above, combined with focused study, will equip you with the capabilities to effectively use LSTMs and their intermediate states in TensorFlow.
