The behavior of MATLAB's `fmincon` terminating at an upper bound constraint is frequently attributable to the interplay between the algorithm's chosen search direction and the nature of the objective function's gradient near the boundary.  In my experience optimizing complex nonlinear systems, particularly those involving highly constrained parameter spaces, this phenomenon arises more often than one might initially expect.  It's not necessarily indicative of a bug in `fmincon`, but rather a reflection of the limitations inherent in numerical optimization routines.  The algorithm may interpret the constrained boundary as a local minimum, even if a superior solution exists outside the feasible region that is inaccessible due to constraint limitations.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

`fmincon`, in its default settings, utilizes a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method. SQP algorithms iteratively construct quadratic approximations of the objective function and linear approximations of the constraints.  The search direction at each iteration is determined by solving a quadratic programming subproblem. This subproblem considers both the descent direction for minimizing the objective function and the requirement to remain within the feasible region defined by the constraints.

If the algorithm's search direction consistently leads to the upper bound, this suggests a few possibilities:

* **Steepest Descent Dominance:** The negative gradient of the objective function may point directly towards the upper bound. This is particularly prevalent if the gradient magnitude near the boundary is significantly larger than the gradient elsewhere in the feasible region. In such scenarios, the algorithm prioritizes minimizing the objective function along the gradient's direction, inevitably leading to the upper bound.  The algorithm may lack the momentum or the appropriate step size to escape this trajectory and explore other feasible regions.

* **Constraint Tightness:** The upper bound constraint may be excessively restrictive, effectively cutting off the search space before a true minimum is found.  A poorly defined constraint can artificially limit the optimization process.  It's crucial to assess if the chosen upper bounds are genuinely necessary or if they represent an overly conservative constraint.

* **Inadequate Step Size Control:**  `fmincon`'s internal mechanisms for adjusting the step size, particularly the trust region radius in SQP methods, could be limiting the algorithm's ability to explore the feasible region effectively. A smaller-than-optimal step size may prevent the algorithm from moving sufficiently far away from the boundary to locate a superior solution.

* **Ill-Conditioning:** The objective function or constraints might be ill-conditioned, meaning small changes in the parameters lead to disproportionately large changes in the objective function or constraint values. This ill-conditioning can cause numerical instabilities, pushing the algorithm towards the constraint boundary prematurely.

It is important to note that the termination at a bound doesn't automatically imply the global minimum has been found. It only signifies that the algorithm has reached a point where it cannot improve the objective function further while respecting the constraints within the algorithm's tolerance and its numerical capabilities.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Steepest Descent Dominance**

```matlab
% Objective function with a steep gradient near the upper bound
fun = @(x) x^2 - 10*x;  

% Upper bound constraint
ub = 5;

% Initial guess
x0 = 3;

% Optimization using fmincon
options = optimoptions('fmincon','Display','iter');
[x,fval] = fmincon(fun,x0,[],[],[],[],[],ub,[],options);

disp(['Optimal x: ', num2str(x)]);
disp(['Optimal fval: ', num2str(fval)]);
```

This example demonstrates a simple quadratic function where the negative gradient is substantial near the upper bound.  `fmincon` might stop at `x = 5`, even though the global minimum lies outside this constrained area. The `optimoptions` function provides control over `fmincon`'s display, showing the iterations, allowing for diagnostics on the convergence process.


**Example 2:  Impact of Constraint Tightness**

```matlab
% Objective function
fun = @(x) (x-3)^2;

% Varying upper bounds to illustrate impact
ub1 = 4;
ub2 = 8;

% Initial guess
x0 = 1;

% Optimization with different upper bounds
options = optimoptions('fmincon','Display','iter');
[x1,fval1] = fmincon(fun,x0,[],[],[],[],[],ub1,[],options);
[x2,fval2] = fmincon(fun,x0,[],[],[],[],[],ub2,[],options);

disp(['Optimal x (ub1): ', num2str(x1)]);
disp(['Optimal fval (ub1): ', num2str(fval1)]);
disp(['Optimal x (ub2): ', num2str(x2)]);
disp(['Optimal fval (ub2): ', num2str(fval2)]);
```

This example highlights how a more relaxed upper bound (`ub2`) allows `fmincon` to reach a solution closer to the true minimum.  Tightening the constraint (`ub1`) prematurely stops the optimization.


**Example 3:  Addressing Ill-Conditioning (Illustrative)**

```matlab
% Ill-conditioned objective function (example)
fun = @(x) 1e6*x(1)^2 + x(2)^2;

% Bounds (Illustrative)
lb = [-10,-10];
ub = [10, 10];

% Initial guess
x0 = [1,1];

% Optimization with increased tolerance
options = optimoptions('fmincon','Display','iter', 'TolFun', 1e-2, 'TolX', 1e-2);
[x,fval] = fmincon(fun,x0,[],[],[],[],lb,ub,[],options);

disp(['Optimal x: ', num2str(x)]);
disp(['Optimal fval: ', num2str(fval)]);
```

This illustrates a scenario where the objective function is ill-conditioned.  Adjusting the `TolFun` and `TolX` parameters within `optimoptions` might help alleviate premature termination but might also compromise the accuracy of the result. Increasing the tolerance for function and parameter values might help mitigate the effects of ill-conditioning.  However, careful consideration is crucial as excessively high tolerance may affect the accuracy and convergence behavior of the algorithm.  More advanced techniques, like scaling the variables, might be necessary for severely ill-conditioned problems.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The MATLAB documentation on `fmincon`, specifically the sections detailing algorithm options and troubleshooting, is invaluable.  Furthermore, a comprehensive numerical optimization textbook focusing on constrained optimization methods provides a theoretical foundation to better understand the underlying mechanisms of `fmincon` and interpret its behavior.  Finally, exploring advanced optimization techniques like interior-point methods and their implementation in MATLAB can provide alternative strategies for handling scenarios where `fmincon` terminates at a constraint boundary.  Careful study of these resources will provide the understanding necessary to address these issues effectively.
