TensorFlow’s implementation of the tiny YOLOv4 object detection model presents a unique scenario regarding GPU memory utilization, primarily due to its architecture, which aims for speed and efficiency at the expense of accuracy when compared to the full-sized YOLOv4. As a developer who has worked extensively with both versions on embedded systems and edge devices, I've observed that tiny YOLOv4 achieves its low latency primarily through a reduction in convolutional layers and filter count, thereby significantly impacting the memory footprint on the GPU. This reduction in complexity results in drastically lower memory requirements for model weights, activations, and gradients during training and inference.

The key mechanism at play here is the reduction in the computational graph’s size. A smaller network means fewer parameters to store (both weights and biases), and more importantly, fewer intermediate feature maps generated during the forward pass and backpropagation. These feature maps, often referred to as activations, can consume significant amounts of GPU memory, especially in deep learning models. The tiny YOLOv4 sacrifices depth and width to reduce these activation sizes. Moreover, fewer gradient calculations occur during backpropagation, leading to lower memory demands for storing these gradients as well. This allows for deployments on GPUs with limited memory, something frequently encountered in embedded systems or entry-level compute devices.

The impact is not simply linear with respect to the parameter count; it also affects the memory allocation strategy within TensorFlow. Smaller models frequently result in reduced overhead in terms of memory manager bookkeeping. The framework handles smaller tensors and allocates smaller memory blocks, leading to more efficient utilization and, consequently, less memory wasted on fragmenting allocations. Additionally, smaller batch sizes, often used in conjunction with tiny models for inference speed, also reduce memory usage, even if not directly related to model architecture itself, although this practice is often necessary to leverage the performance capabilities of the smaller architecture.

Let's examine some code examples to demonstrate these concepts. First, I will create a placeholder model mimicking the structure of tiny YOLOv4. This is not a functional model, but an example for memory footprint comparison.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_tiny_yolov4_placeholder(input_shape=(1, 416, 416, 3)):
    input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape[1:])
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, 3, padding='same')(input_tensor) #reduced filters
    x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D(2)(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, padding='same')(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D(2)(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, padding='same')(x)
    # Removed several layers compared to full YOLOv4 for simplicity
    x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
    output_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(x) #dummy output
    model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)
    return model

if __name__ == '__main__':
    model = create_tiny_yolov4_placeholder()
    model.summary()
```

This code demonstrates the creation of a simplified model that mimics the reduced convolutional structure of tiny YOLOv4. The significantly lower number of filters (e.g., 16, 32, 64) in the convolutional layers compared to a full YOLOv4 variant will lead to lower parameter counts and reduced feature map sizes during computation. This architectural choice is crucial in decreasing the model's memory footprint on the GPU. The layer counts are less as well, further reducing computational needs.  Executing `model.summary()` will reveal the reduced parameter count, an indirect indicator of lower memory usage.

Now, let's contrast this with a placeholder model that is much deeper, to demonstrate the contrast.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_deeper_placeholder_model(input_shape=(1, 416, 416, 3)):
    input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape[1:])
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, padding='same')(input_tensor) #increased filters and depth
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, padding='same')(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D(2)(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(128, 3, padding='same')(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(128, 3, padding='same')(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D(2)(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(256, 3, padding='same')(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(256, 3, padding='same')(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(256, 3, padding='same')(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPool2D(2)(x)
    x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
    output_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)(x) #dummy output
    model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)
    return model


if __name__ == '__main__':
    model = create_deeper_placeholder_model()
    model.summary()
```

Comparing the parameter count output by `model.summary()` for this model, with larger filters and multiple convolutions in the same level compared to the previous tiny variant,  demonstrates the difference in parameter count and therefore the potential impact on GPU memory, though this summary does not display the activation memory requirements.  The larger filter counts of this second network and increased layer depth are significantly more computationally expensive and will demand much greater GPU memory.

The final code example will briefly showcase how to monitor GPU memory usage for TensorFlow models using TensorFlow's API and demonstrates how batch size affects memory use during training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"]="0" # Ensure GPU is used

def train_model(model, batch_size=32):
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
    loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
    train_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(1000, 416, 416, 3))
    labels = tf.random.uniform(shape=(1000,10), minval=0, maxval=1, dtype=tf.float32)
    train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_data,labels)).batch(batch_size)
    
    @tf.function
    def train_step(images, labels):
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(images)
        loss = loss_fn(labels, predictions)
      gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
      optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
      return loss

    for epoch in range(2):
      for images,labels in train_dataset:
        loss_value = train_step(images, labels)
        tf.print("Training loss at epoch ",epoch, " and loss:", loss_value)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    model = create_tiny_yolov4_placeholder()
    train_model(model, batch_size=16)
    train_model(model, batch_size=32)  #Higher batch size
```

Here, we are training the simplified tiny model. Observing GPU memory consumption (using tools like `nvidia-smi` during the execution) with batch size set to 16 and then 32, one will observe that the model with larger batch size consumes more memory, even with the same architecture. This is due to the storage of activations and gradients for more examples simultaneously in the batch. In my experience, I've consistently found that reducing the batch size can be an effective (albeit impacting training time) way to reduce GPU memory pressure, though the model's architecture itself is the biggest factor.

To further enhance understanding of this topic, I would recommend consulting the following resources:

1.  **The TensorFlow documentation on memory management:** This provides insights into how TensorFlow allocates and manages memory, which is crucial in understanding the effect of model size on memory consumption. Particular focus should be placed on the concept of "tensors" and how they consume memory on the GPU.
2.  **General literature on convolutional neural network architectures:** Examining papers on model compression techniques or the design choices for reduced-size models will provide theoretical background regarding why smaller models require less memory. Specifically, research into models optimized for edge or mobile deployment could be beneficial.
3.  **Papers focusing on YOLOv4 and tiny YOLOv4 specifically:** Detailed explanations of the architectural differences will clarify the specific reasons for the lower memory footprint. Focusing on the changes in feature pyramid networks and anchor boxes in the tiny versions will be helpful.
4. **GPU usage monitoring tools for your system:** Familiarize yourself with the system tools used to monitor GPU memory usage to actively observe the impact of architectural or batch size changes on your machine while testing.

In summary, tiny YOLOv4's impact on GPU memory usage in TensorFlow is driven by a smaller network architecture, resulting in fewer parameters, smaller feature map sizes, and reduced computational demands.  The provided examples and the resource recommendations should provide a solid foundation for further exploration into this topic.
