The core challenge in retrieving and saving a GPU-based model as a string in Python lies not in the string representation itself, but in the efficient serialization and deserialization of the model's internal state, particularly the weights and biases that reside in GPU memory.  Directly converting the model's in-memory representation to a string is impractical due to the complexity and size of the underlying data structures.  Instead, we must leverage serialization libraries designed to handle the intricacies of deep learning frameworks and optimize for efficient storage and retrieval.  My experience working on large-scale NLP projects at a major tech firm has highlighted the importance of this process for model deployment and version control.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves three key steps:

* **Exporting the Model:**  This step involves converting the model's internal representation within a deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) into a serialized format suitable for storage.  Popular formats include ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange), TensorFlow SavedModel, and PyTorch's own state_dict.  These formats are framework-agnostic (ONNX) or framework-specific (SavedModel, state_dict).  Choosing the right format depends on the framework used and downstream compatibility requirements.

* **Serialization to String:** The serialized model (e.g., an ONNX file, a SavedModel directory) must then be converted to a string representation.  This is typically achieved using file I/O operations to read the serialized data into memory as bytes, and then encoding those bytes into a string using a suitable encoding scheme such as Base64.  Base64 is preferred because it's universally supported and produces a string that's reasonably compact.

* **Deserialization and Import:**  To recover the model, the Base64-encoded string is first decoded back into bytes, and then written to a temporary file.  The chosen framework's loading mechanisms can then be used to restore the model from the temporary file.  This process involves reconstructing the model architecture and loading the weights and biases from the serialized data.

This entire process requires careful handling of file paths, potential exceptions during file operations, and efficient memory management, especially when dealing with large models.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: PyTorch Model with ONNX Intermediate**

This example showcases exporting a PyTorch model to ONNX, converting the ONNX file to a Base64 string, and then reconstructing the model.

```python
import torch
import torch.onnx
import base64
import onnxruntime as ort
import io

# Assume 'model' is a pre-trained PyTorch model
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)  # Replace with your model's input shape

# Export to ONNX
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model.onnx", opset_version=11)

# Convert ONNX to Base64 string
with open("model.onnx", "rb") as f:
    onnx_bytes = f.read()
onnx_string = base64.b64encode(onnx_bytes).decode("utf-8")

# ... (Model Usage and Storage of onnx_string) ...


# Deserialization
onnx_bytes = base64.b64decode(onnx_string.encode("utf-8"))
with open("temp_model.onnx", "wb") as f:
    f.write(onnx_bytes)

# Load ONNX model using onnxruntime
ort_session = ort.InferenceSession("temp_model.onnx")

# ... (Use the loaded model) ...
```


**Example 2: TensorFlow SavedModel**

This example demonstrates saving a TensorFlow model as a SavedModel, converting it to a Base64 string, and subsequently loading it.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import base64

# Assume 'model' is a pre-trained TensorFlow model

# Save the model
tf.saved_model.save(model, "saved_model")

# Convert SavedModel to Base64 string
with open("saved_model/saved_model.pb", "rb") as f: # Adapt based on file structure of SavedModel
    saved_model_bytes = f.read()
saved_model_string = base64.b64encode(saved_model_bytes).decode("utf-8")

# ... (Model Usage and Storage of saved_model_string) ...

# Deserialization
saved_model_bytes = base64.b64decode(saved_model_string.encode("utf-8"))
with open("temp_model.pb", "wb") as f:
    f.write(saved_model_bytes)
# Recreate the SavedModel directory structure and place temp_model.pb in appropriate location

# Load the model (using tf.saved_model.load)
reloaded_model = tf.saved_model.load("temp_model_path") # Adapt to your directory structure

# ... (Use the reloaded model) ...
```


**Example 3: PyTorch state_dict**

This example shows saving only the model's parameters (state_dict) as a Base64 string, which is often more efficient than saving the entire model architecture. Note that the model architecture must be separately defined and loaded.

```python
import torch
import base64
import io

# Assuming 'model' is a PyTorch model

# Save the state_dict
state_dict = model.state_dict()
buffer = io.BytesIO()
torch.save(state_dict, buffer)
state_dict_bytes = buffer.getvalue()
state_dict_string = base64.b64encode(state_dict_bytes).decode("utf-8")

# ... (Model Usage and Storage of state_dict_string) ...

# Deserialization
state_dict_bytes = base64.b64decode(state_dict_string.encode("utf-8"))
buffer = io.BytesIO(state_dict_bytes)
loaded_state_dict = torch.load(buffer)

# Define your model architecture again.  This is crucial and must match the original model.
new_model = YourModelArchitecture() # Replace with your model definition

new_model.load_state_dict(loaded_state_dict)
new_model.eval()

# ... (Use the reloaded model) ...
```

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of model serialization and deserialization, consult the official documentation for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ONNX.  Thoroughly review the tutorials and examples provided by these frameworks for best practices in handling model I/O. Pay close attention to error handling and resource management to build robust and efficient solutions.  Understanding Base64 encoding and its implications for data size is also beneficial.  Finally, exploring advanced serialization libraries beyond the standard ones offered by the deep learning frameworks might offer performance gains for extremely large models.
