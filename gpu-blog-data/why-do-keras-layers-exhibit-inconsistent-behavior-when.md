The root cause of inconsistent behavior in duplicated Keras layers often stems from the shared weights and the layer's statefulness, particularly when dealing with layers that maintain internal memory, such as recurrent layers (LSTMs, GRUs) or layers with batch normalization.  This isn't a simple copy-paste issue; it's about understanding how Keras manages layer instances and their associated parameters.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous deep learning projects, I've encountered this problem primarily due to a misunderstanding of Keras's layer instantiation and weight initialization processes.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Keras layers aren't merely functional blocks of code; they are objects containing parameters (weights and biases) that are initialized upon creation.  When you copy and paste a layer definition in your script, you're creating a *new* object with *newly initialized* weights.  This is critically different from creating a *single* layer object and then reusing it multiple times.  The seemingly identical layers are, in fact, separate entities, each with its own independent set of weights that are initialized randomly or according to a specified initializer.  This is particularly relevant for sequential models where the output of one layer forms the input of the next. The different weight initializations lead to differing activation patterns at each layer, propagating variations through the network and causing the inconsistencies observed in your output.

This issue is amplified in layers exhibiting statefulness.  Recurrent layers, for example, maintain internal cell states.  If you duplicate a recurrent layer, each instance will have its own independent cell state, initialized differently.  Consequently, the network's hidden state evolution diverges across these duplicated layers, resulting in inconsistent outputs.  Batch Normalization layers also exhibit similar behavior; each instance maintains its own moving averages of batch statistics. Thus, even with identical inputs, duplicated Batch Normalization layers will produce different normalized activations because they operate on independent statistics.

Furthermore, custom layers can introduce additional subtleties. If a custom layer relies on external variables or mutable state outside its immediate definition, copying and pasting will lead to unpredictable results as multiple layer instances attempt to concurrently modify or access shared resources.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Illustrating Weight Initialization Differences:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple dense layer
dense_layer = keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='uniform')

# Create two separate instances of the same layer
dense_layer_1 = keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='uniform')
dense_layer_2 = keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='uniform')

# Check if the weights are identical
print(tf.reduce_all(tf.equal(dense_layer_1.get_weights()[0], dense_layer_2.get_weights()[0]))) # Expected: False

# Create a model with both layers for comparison
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(5,))
x = dense_layer_1(input_layer)
x = dense_layer_2(x)
model_separate = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=x)

# Use the same instance twice within a model
input_layer_2 = keras.Input(shape=(5,))
x2 = dense_layer(input_layer_2)
x2 = dense_layer(x2)
model_same_instance = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer_2, outputs=x2)

# Confirm that the models exhibit different behavior.
# This will require input data for testing.
```

**Commentary:**  This example showcases that even with identical layer specifications and the same initializer, different instances will have different weights, leading to different model behavior.  The Boolean output of the comparison is likely `False`, highlighting the non-identical weight matrices.  The difference in behaviour between `model_separate` and `model_same_instance` will be evident when tested against a set of inputs.


**Example 2: Demonstrating Inconsistent Behavior with a Recurrent Layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define an LSTM layer
lstm_layer = keras.layers.LSTM(units=32, return_sequences=True, stateful=False)

# Create two separate LSTM layers
lstm_layer_1 = keras.layers.LSTM(units=32, return_sequences=True, stateful=False)
lstm_layer_2 = keras.layers.LSTM(units=32, return_sequences=True, stateful=False)

# Create sequential models to compare outputs of separate and same instances.
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,5))
x = lstm_layer_1(input_layer)
x = lstm_layer_2(x)
model_separate = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=x)

x2 = lstm_layer(input_layer)
x2 = lstm_layer(x2)
model_same_instance = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=x2)

# Again, these models will produce different outputs even with same input data.

```

**Commentary:** This example, using LSTMs, further emphasizes the issue.  Even with `stateful=False`, the internal gates and hidden states will be initialized independently for each LSTM instance.  The resulting hidden representations will differ, making the output inconsistent.


**Example 3:  Highlighting the problem with Batch Normalization:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a Batch Normalization layer.
batchnorm_layer = keras.layers.BatchNormalization()

# Create two instances.
batchnorm_1 = keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
batchnorm_2 = keras.layers.BatchNormalization()

# Create models for comparison.
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = batchnorm_1(input_layer)
x = batchnorm_2(x)
model_separate_bn = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=x)

x2 = batchnorm_layer(input_layer)
x2 = batchnorm_layer(x2)
model_same_bn = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=x2)

# Using the same input data, the outputs will differ slightly.  The differences
# become more evident with larger datasets during training.
```

**Commentary:** This example illustrates that duplicated Batch Normalization layers learn and use separate moving means and variances, leading to inconsistent normalization across the duplicated layers.  The discrepancy may seem minor initially but will become more pronounced as training progresses.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation itself offers comprehensive details on layer instantiation, weight initialization, and the internal workings of various layer types.  Consult the official TensorFlow documentation on Keras for specific details on custom layers and advanced usage.  Familiarize yourself with the concepts of weight initialization strategies and the impact of different initializers on model training.  Finally, understanding the mathematical underpinnings of different layer types, especially recurrent and normalization layers, is crucial for troubleshooting these inconsistencies effectively.  Thorough testing and examining the weights and activations at different layers during training are essential debugging techniques.
