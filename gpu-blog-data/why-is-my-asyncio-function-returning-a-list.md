My experience indicates that an `asyncio` function returning a list of empty lists usually stems from misunderstanding how concurrent operations and their results are managed within the asynchronous context. Specifically, it points to a common pitfall: failing to correctly await the results of asynchronous tasks before attempting to gather or aggregate them. I've encountered this scenario in projects ranging from web scraping to real-time data processing, always tracing it back to this fundamental issue.

The core problem lies in the non-blocking nature of `asyncio`. When you initiate an asynchronous task using `asyncio.create_task()` or a similar method, the function returns immediately, not waiting for the task's completion. If you then try to directly access the result of the task before it has finished execution, particularly in a loop or within a collection, you will get either incomplete data or, in the case of lists, an empty list if it hasn’t been populated yet. Consider a scenario where you're trying to fetch data from multiple URLs concurrently. If you don't properly await each of these fetch operations, your result will likely be a list containing empty lists, or if it is a list of dictionaries, an empty dictionary. This is because the collection is populated before the tasks are finished, not with their returned values.

Let's delve into the typical execution flow that causes this:

1.  **Task Creation:** Asynchronous tasks, or coroutines, are initiated using `asyncio.create_task()`, or are launched through an asynchronous function. This step only initiates the task, placing it on the event loop to be executed when it has the opportunity.

2.  **Immediate Collection:** After the task is started, the code moves to collect these tasks, usually within a loop or similar construct. Critically, this occurs without waiting for the tasks to complete. Therefore, when the collection process accesses the result of a given task, the task has most likely not produced a result.

3. **Incorrect Result Handling:** Consequently, when the code tries to retrieve the output of each task within that collection before they are complete, it ends up with an empty or default-initialized value. If, for example, your task is designed to populate a list, the list will be empty during this phase. The result, therefore, becomes a collection of these default results (e.g., empty lists) instead of the intended values returned after the tasks finish.

To illustrate, let's examine a few code examples.

**Example 1: Incorrect Await Placement**

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(url):
    await asyncio.sleep(1) # Simulate network delay
    return [f"Data from {url}"]

async def main():
    urls = ["url1", "url2", "url3"]
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
    
    results = []
    for task in tasks:
      results.append(task)
    
    print(results)  # Prints list of coroutine objects, not results
    
    results = []
    for task in tasks:
        result = await task  
        results.append(result)
        
    print(results) #Prints expected output

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, the first block initializes asynchronous tasks but immediately tries to collect them without awaiting them. Because of this, the first print will show a list of coroutine objects. The coroutines, at that time, have not executed, and no values have been collected. Only when explicitly using `await` to collect the results of each coroutine in a loop will the result be as expected.

**Example 2: Incorrect Result Aggregation**

```python
import asyncio

async def process_item(item):
    await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate some processing
    return [item*2]

async def main():
  items = [1,2,3,4,5]
  tasks = []
  for item in items:
      tasks.append(process_item(item))

  results = []
  for task in tasks:
     results.append(await task)
  
  print(results) # Correct result: [[2], [4], [6], [8], [10]]

  tasks = [process_item(item) for item in items]
  results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
  print(results) #Correct result: [[2], [4], [6], [8], [10]]
  
  tasks = [process_item(item) for item in items]
  results = []
  for task in tasks:
     results.append(task) #Problem occurs here
     
  print(results) #Incorrect result: list of coroutine objects

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Here, the first `for` loop block illustrates the correct use of `await` to collect the results after the tasks are executed. This demonstrates the expected output. The second block shows the same result when using `asyncio.gather`. However, the last block shows where an error occurs if you attempt to append the coroutine objects and not the results of those coroutines to the `results` list.

**Example 3: Misusing `asyncio.wait`**

```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_and_process(url):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return [f"Processed data from {url}"]

async def main():
    urls = ["url1", "url2", "url3"]
    tasks = [fetch_and_process(url) for url in urls]

    done, pending = await asyncio.wait(tasks)
    results = [task.result() for task in done]
    
    print(results) # Correctly collects results

    results = [task.result() for task in tasks] #Incorrect, task results are not ready
    print(results) #Raises error. 
    
    results = [task.result() for task in done]
    print(results) # Correct result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In the above example, the usage of `asyncio.wait` returns two sets of tasks: `done` and `pending`. `done` contains the completed tasks, and thus you can safely access their `.result()` values. However, the `pending` tasks have not yet completed. If you try to access their values you will get an error. The first print statement shows how to correctly gather the completed results, and the second and third statements show where errors occur with incorrect usage.

Several techniques can be employed to rectify the described issue:

1.  **Explicit Awaiting:** The primary method is to `await` each task’s execution. This ensures that you are gathering the result of a task only after it has been completed. You can iterate over a collection of tasks and `await` each one sequentially, or `await` a group of tasks using `asyncio.gather()`.

2.  **`asyncio.gather()`:** This is a highly effective function for concurrently awaiting multiple asynchronous tasks. It aggregates results into a single list, making handling the return values straightforward and less error-prone.

3.  **`asyncio.wait()`:** For more fine-grained control, `asyncio.wait()` allows you to receive results as they become available. This method is useful when you are not waiting for all tasks to complete before processing some results. You should, however, carefully access the results only from the `done` set.

4.  **Using List Comprehensions Correctly:** When using list comprehensions to construct a list of `asyncio.create_task()` results, you must ensure the tasks themselves are awaited. If you directly append or use them, it will add the coroutines rather than the result of them. The correct way is to utilize `asyncio.gather()`.

In summary, encountering empty lists as the output of `asyncio` functions usually signifies insufficient or misplaced `await` calls. By carefully awaiting each task either via iteration, or more efficiently through `asyncio.gather()` or judiciously through `asyncio.wait()`, one can ensure that asynchronous tasks return their completed results, which can then be aggregated into the correct overall result.

For further understanding, I would recommend reviewing the official Python documentation for the `asyncio` module and the `async` and `await` keywords. Also explore resources that discuss event loops and concurrent programming paradigms in Python. Examining open-source projects that utilize `asyncio` for similar operations can also be beneficial. Finally, several comprehensive tutorials on asynchronous programming with Python can provide additional insight.
