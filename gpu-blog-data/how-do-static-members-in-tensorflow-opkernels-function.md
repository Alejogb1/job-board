Within TensorFlow's custom OpKernel implementation, static members serve a critical role in optimizing performance and managing shared resources, particularly when dealing with computationally intensive operations or situations where setup costs are significant. My own experience developing specialized kernels for image processing and numerical simulation has highlighted their importance in avoiding unnecessary memory allocation and redundant computations across multiple invocations of the same operation. Unlike instance members, which are unique to each OpKernel object, static members are associated with the OpKernel *class* itself. This means that all instances of a particular OpKernel type share access to the same static members, making them ideal for storing configuration information, lookup tables, or any pre-calculated data that remains constant for all executions of that specific operation within a TensorFlow graph.

The fundamental distinction lies in the lifetime and scope of these members. Instance members are created and destroyed alongside each OpKernel object, typically during a node execution in a TensorFlow graph. By contrast, static members are initialized once when the OpKernel class is loaded and persist throughout the lifespan of the TensorFlow session. This persistence allows for one-time cost to be amortized over numerous calls, resulting in more efficient execution of the custom operation. The static nature also permits them to be accessed and modified by any instance of the kernel, introducing the need for careful synchronization in multithreaded scenarios. Failure to do so can lead to race conditions and corrupted state.

Let's illustrate with examples. Consider an image processing OpKernel that requires a pre-computed Gaussian kernel for blurring. Calculating this kernel every time the operation is executed is inefficient. Instead, it can be computed once and stored in a static member. The following code outlines how this can be achieved:

```cpp
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"
#include <vector>

using namespace tensorflow;

class GaussianBlurOp : public OpKernel {
public:
    explicit GaussianBlurOp(OpKernelConstruction* context) : OpKernel(context) {
        // Static initialization happens only once
        if (!gaussian_kernel_initialized) {
            int kernel_size = 5; //Example size, can be read from attributes
            double sigma = 1.5; //Example sigma, can be read from attributes
            // Compute gaussian kernel values and store in static member
             gaussian_kernel.resize(kernel_size * kernel_size);
            for(int y = 0; y < kernel_size; ++y){
              for(int x = 0; x < kernel_size; ++x){
                int center = kernel_size / 2;
                double exponent = -((x - center) * (x - center) + (y - center) * (y - center)) / (2 * sigma * sigma);
                 gaussian_kernel[y * kernel_size + x] = std::exp(exponent);
              }
            }
           gaussian_kernel_initialized = true;
        }
    }

    void Compute(OpKernelContext* context) override {
        // Retrieve input tensor
        const Tensor& input_tensor = context->input(0);
        // Perform blurring using the pre-computed kernel
        // ... Implementation logic using gaussian_kernel ...
        Tensor* output_tensor = nullptr;
        OP_REQUIRES_OK(context, context->allocate_output(0, input_tensor.shape(), &output_tensor));

        auto input_flat = input_tensor.flat<float>();
        auto output_flat = output_tensor->flat<float>();

        // Example: copying input to output just for demonstration
        for (int i = 0; i < input_flat.size(); i++) {
          output_flat(i) = input_flat(i);
        }
    }
private:
  static std::vector<double> gaussian_kernel;
  static bool gaussian_kernel_initialized;
};


std::vector<double> GaussianBlurOp::gaussian_kernel;
bool GaussianBlurOp::gaussian_kernel_initialized = false;

REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("GaussianBlur").Device(DEVICE_CPU), GaussianBlurOp);

```

In this example, `gaussian_kernel` and `gaussian_kernel_initialized` are static members. The `gaussian_kernel` stores the pre-computed kernel, and `gaussian_kernel_initialized` acts as a flag to ensure the kernel is computed only once during the first instantiation of the `GaussianBlurOp` within the TensorFlow session. Subsequent calls to the same operation use the pre-computed kernel, significantly reducing computational overhead. The static members are declared outside of the class definition, a necessary step for linking purposes, and also the `gaussian_kernel_initialized` static member needs initialization outside the class definition.  The core part where the static member is being used in the `Compute` method.  This approach ensures that the expensive computation is done only once. The `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER` macro makes the operation available within a TensorFlow graph with a name "GaussianBlur" that can be used during TensorFlow python graph definition.

Here's another example involving a frequently used lookup table for a custom activation function. This is common in research situations involving new models where you might need to define your own special non-linear activation.

```cpp
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace tensorflow;

class CustomActivationOp : public OpKernel {
public:
    explicit CustomActivationOp(OpKernelConstruction* context) : OpKernel(context) {
       if (!lookup_table_initialized) {
         // Build the custom activation lookup table
           for(int i = 0; i<1000; i++){
               float x = -5 + i * (10.0/1000.0);
                lookup_table[i] = 1/(1+ std::exp(-x));
           }
          lookup_table_initialized = true;
       }
    }

    void Compute(OpKernelContext* context) override {
        const Tensor& input_tensor = context->input(0);
         Tensor* output_tensor = nullptr;
        OP_REQUIRES_OK(context, context->allocate_output(0, input_tensor.shape(), &output_tensor));
        auto input_flat = input_tensor.flat<float>();
        auto output_flat = output_tensor->flat<float>();

        for (int i = 0; i < input_flat.size(); i++) {
           float val = input_flat(i);
            //use the lookup table to compute the result
            int idx = static_cast<int>((val+5) * 100);
            if(idx < 0){
               output_flat(i) = lookup_table[0];
            } else if( idx >= 1000){
                output_flat(i) = lookup_table[999];
            } else{
             output_flat(i) = lookup_table[idx];
            }

        }

    }
private:
  static float lookup_table[1000];
  static bool lookup_table_initialized;
};
float CustomActivationOp::lookup_table[1000];
bool CustomActivationOp::lookup_table_initialized = false;

REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("CustomActivation").Device(DEVICE_CPU), CustomActivationOp);
```

Here, `lookup_table` and `lookup_table_initialized` are static. The `lookup_table` stores pre-calculated output values for a custom activation function, avoiding expensive calculations in the `Compute` method. This is particularly beneficial when implementing complex, non-linear functions or functions which involves external access. Again the static initialization is performed within the constructor using the flag and subsequent use of this static member is in the compute method.

Lastly, consider a scenario where you need to initialize a complex numerical solver. The static member can store the initialized solver object.

```cpp
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"
#include <iostream>

using namespace tensorflow;

class NumericalSolverOp : public OpKernel {
public:
    explicit NumericalSolverOp(OpKernelConstruction* context) : OpKernel(context) {
     if(!solver_initialized){
          solver = std::make_unique<Solver>();
          solver_initialized = true;
      }

    }
    void Compute(OpKernelContext* context) override {

       const Tensor& input_tensor = context->input(0);
         Tensor* output_tensor = nullptr;
        OP_REQUIRES_OK(context, context->allocate_output(0, input_tensor.shape(), &output_tensor));
        auto input_flat = input_tensor.flat<float>();
        auto output_flat = output_tensor->flat<float>();

        for(int i = 0; i<input_flat.size(); i++){
            //uses the solver for result
            output_flat(i) = solver->Solve(input_flat(i));
        }
    }
private:
    class Solver {
        public:
            float Solve(float value){
               return value + 1.0f;
            }
    };

    static std::unique_ptr<Solver> solver;
    static bool solver_initialized;
};

std::unique_ptr<NumericalSolverOp::Solver> NumericalSolverOp::solver;
bool NumericalSolverOp::solver_initialized = false;


REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("NumericalSolver").Device(DEVICE_CPU), NumericalSolverOp);
```

In this case `solver` and `solver_initialized` are static and the initialization of the solver instance is done once, and subsequent calls within the same TF session uses this same static instance.

When using static members, caution should be taken regarding thread safety. If static members are modified during the `Compute` method, which can execute in multiple threads, appropriate synchronization mechanisms like mutexes or atomic operations must be implemented to prevent race conditions. It should be noted that the initialization itself is normally performed once, so the race conditions are mostly an issue when the static members are changed in the `Compute` method. These examples demonstrate the power and practical applications of static members in TensorFlow OpKernels to enhance performance through resource management.

For deeper understanding of these concepts, it is advisable to study the TensorFlow codebase, specifically `tensorflow/core/framework/op_kernel.h`. Further information regarding kernel development can be found in guides focusing on custom operation creation.  Additionally, exploring resources related to concurrent programming in C++, particularly regarding thread synchronization primitives, is helpful for managing static members in multithreaded environments.
