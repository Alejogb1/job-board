The APOPT solver's susceptibility to inconsistent results stems primarily from its inherent sensitivity to the problem formulation, specifically the interplay between initial guesses, constraints, and the chosen algorithmic parameters.  My experience optimizing complex chemical process models using APOPT has repeatedly highlighted this issue.  Inconsistencies aren't random; they're often traceable to poorly defined problem characteristics that the solver struggles to navigate effectively.  This sensitivity is particularly pronounced in non-convex optimization problems, where multiple local optima can exist.

**1.  Clear Explanation of Inconsistent Results**

APOPT, being a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) solver, iteratively improves its solution by approximating the objective function and constraints with quadratic models.  The accuracy of these approximations significantly impacts the convergence behavior. Poorly scaled variables, for instance, can lead to ill-conditioned Hessian matrices, hindering the quadratic approximation's effectiveness.  The solver might then converge to a suboptimal solution, or worse, fail to converge altogether.

Another critical factor is the initial guess. A poorly chosen initial guess can trap the solver in a local optimum far from the global optimum. This is especially problematic in non-convex optimization landscapes where numerous local minima may exist.  The iterative nature of SQP algorithms means that the solver essentially "walks downhill" from the initial point, and a bad starting point can lead to a poor solution.

Furthermore, the constraint formulation plays a pivotal role.  Inconsistent results can arise from poorly defined or conflicting constraints.  For example, redundant constraints can slow down the solver and increase computational cost, while inconsistent or infeasible constraints can lead to premature termination or convergence to an invalid solution.  The solver's internal mechanisms for handling constraint violations, such as penalty functions, can also significantly impact the final results, occasionally leading to unexpected behaviors.  Finally,  the chosen solver tolerances and other algorithmic parameters directly influence the convergence criteria. Relaxing tolerances might speed up computation but compromise solution accuracy, contributing to perceived inconsistency.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate how different problem formulations can lead to inconsistent results within APOPT.  I will use a simplified example involving nonlinear least-squares optimization.


**Example 1: Poorly Scaled Variables**

```python
import pyomo.environ as pyo

model = pyo.ConcreteModel()
model.x = pyo.Var(bounds=(0, 1000000)) # Poorly scaled variable
model.y = pyo.Var(bounds=(0,1))       # Well-scaled variable

def obj_rule(model):
    return (model.x - 100000)**2 + (model.y - 0.5)**2
model.obj = pyo.Objective(rule=obj_rule, sense=pyo.minimize)

solver = pyo.SolverFactory('ipopt') # or APOPT
results = solver.solve(model)
model.display()
```

In this example, the variable `x` has a vastly different scale compared to `y`. This can lead to numerical instability during the quadratic approximation process within APOPT, potentially resulting in inaccurate or inconsistent solutions across different runs or solver parameters. Rescaling the variables is crucial here for robust performance.


**Example 2:  Impact of Initial Guess**

```python
import pyomo.environ as pyo
import numpy as np

model = pyo.ConcreteModel()
model.x = pyo.Var(bounds=(-10, 10))

def obj_rule(model):
    return model.x**4 - 4*model.x**2 + 5
model.obj = pyo.Objective(rule=obj_rule, sense=pyo.minimize)

# Different initial guesses
initial_guesses = [-2, 0, 2]

for guess in initial_guesses:
    model.x.set_value(guess)
    solver = pyo.SolverFactory('ipopt') # or APOPT
    results = solver.solve(model)
    print(f"Initial guess: {guess}, Solution: {pyo.value(model.x)}")
```

This example demonstrates the influence of the initial guess on the final solution. The objective function is non-convex, exhibiting multiple local minima.  Depending on the initial guess, APOPT may converge to a different local minimum, highlighting the importance of informed initial guess selection in challenging optimization problems. A thorough understanding of the problem's characteristics is needed for effective guess selection.  Strategies like employing multiple initial guesses and comparing the results are often necessary.


**Example 3:  Constraint Effects**

```python
import pyomo.environ as pyo

model = pyo.ConcreteModel()
model.x = pyo.Var(bounds=(0,10))
model.y = pyo.Var(bounds=(0,10))

model.c1 = pyo.Constraint(expr=model.x + model.y <= 5)
model.c2 = pyo.Constraint(expr=model.x >= 2) #Potentially conflicting

def obj_rule(model):
    return (model.x - 1)**2 + (model.y - 2)**2

model.obj = pyo.Objective(rule=obj_rule, sense=pyo.minimize)

solver = pyo.SolverFactory('ipopt') # or APOPT
results = solver.solve(model)
model.display()
```

This showcases how constraints influence the solution.  Constraint `c2` might conflict with the objective function and constraint `c1`, depending on the solver's handling of infeasible regions.  Tightly constrained problems can lead to inconsistent results if the constraints are poorly defined or lead to infeasible regions within the search space.  Carefully analyzing constraint interactions is essential for avoiding such issues.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

To further understand and mitigate the inconsistencies in APOPT, I recommend consulting the following:

* **APOPT Documentation:** The official documentation provides detailed explanations of the algorithm and its parameters, which are crucial for understanding the solver's behavior.  Pay close attention to sections addressing tolerances and convergence criteria.
* **Nonlinear Optimization Textbooks:**  A comprehensive text on nonlinear optimization will provide theoretical grounding on SQP methods and their limitations.  This will help you understand the underlying reasons for inconsistencies.
* **Pyomo's Solver Manuals:** The Pyomo documentation and its solver interfaces can provide important details on configuring the solver for specific problem characteristics. This is especially important for setting tolerances and options.
* **Advanced Optimization Techniques:** Explore advanced optimization techniques for handling non-convex problems, such as global optimization methods or multi-start strategies,  to overcome the limitations of local optimization solvers like APOPT.


Addressing inconsistencies in APOPT necessitates a methodical approach involving careful problem formulation, appropriate scaling of variables, informed initial guess selection, thorough constraint analysis, and an understanding of the solver's algorithmic parameters.  By systematically addressing these factors, one can significantly improve the reliability and consistency of the results obtained from APOPT.
