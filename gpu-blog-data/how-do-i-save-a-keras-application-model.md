The crucial consideration when saving a Keras model incorporating regularizers isn't simply saving the model's weights; it's ensuring the regularizer's configuration is also preserved for later use, particularly during inference or further training.  My experience developing large-scale recommendation systems highlighted this, where forgetting to account for L1/L2 regularization led to significant performance discrepancies between training and deployment.  The regularizer is integral to the model's architecture and its learned parameters; its omission leads to an incomplete model representation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras models, at their core, are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) representing the computation.  When using regularizers (like L1, L2, or custom functions), these regularizers become part of the model's loss function, influencing the optimization process.  The regularizer itself doesn't have weights that are directly saved during a standard `model.save()` call; instead, its definition (the type of regularizer and its hyperparameters) is implicitly encoded within the layers to which it's applied.  Therefore, to properly save a model with regularizers, one must ensure that the model's architecture, including the specified regularizers within each layer, is saved and loaded correctly.  This is usually achieved through the standard Keras serialization mechanisms, provided you constructed the model programmatically using the Keras functional API or the sequential API with explicit layer creation.  Saving the weights alone is insufficient; the model's *entire* definition must be preserved.

The `model.save()` method, when using the HDF5 format, saves both the architecture and weights.  Custom objects, such as custom regularizers, need to be registered within a custom `CustomObjects` dictionary during loading to ensure correct reconstruction.  However, for standard L1 and L2 regularizers provided by Keras, this registration is usually handled automatically.  Problems arise predominantly with custom regularizers or when using model loading mechanisms that only restore weights, neglecting the architectural definition.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Sequential Model with L2 Regularization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.regularizers import l2

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.01), input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#Training (omitted for brevity)

model.save('model_l2.h5')

# Loading the model:
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('model_l2.h5')

#Verify architecture and regularizers are loaded correctly
print(loaded_model.summary())
```

This example demonstrates saving a simple sequential model with an L2 regularizer applied to the first dense layer.  The `model.save()` method automatically saves the entire architecture, including the `l2(0.01)` specification.  Loading the model with `keras.models.load_model()` restores the complete model, including the regularizer.  The `model.summary()` call post-loading verifies the architecture and regularization parameters are intact.

**Example 2: Functional API Model with Custom Regularizer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def my_custom_regularizer(weight_matrix):
    return tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(weight_matrix)) * 0.001

input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=my_custom_regularizer)(input_layer)
dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(dense1)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=dense2)

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#Training (omitted for brevity)

model.save('model_custom.h5')

# Loading the model with custom object registration
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('model_custom.h5', custom_objects={'my_custom_regularizer': my_custom_regularizer})

#Verify architecture and regularizers are loaded correctly
print(loaded_model.summary())

```

This utilizes the functional API and a custom regularizer.  Crucially, when loading, `custom_objects` is provided to map the custom regularizer's name to its definition.  Omitting this step would result in a runtime error during model loading.  Again, `model.summary()` verifies proper reconstruction.

**Example 3:  Handling potential issues with older saved models**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import json

#Assume an older model was saved without explicit regularizer definition in the architecture.  This is unlikely with modern Keras, but demonstrates a recovery technique.

try:
    loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('old_model.h5')
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
    #Attempt to load architecture separately if available
    with open("old_model_architecture.json","r") as f:
      json_config = json.load(f)
    loaded_model = keras.models.model_from_json(json_config)
    #Load weights separately.  This assumes the weights file is named 'old_model_weights.h5'
    loaded_model.load_weights('old_model_weights.h5')


#Attempt to compile - may require additional configuration
#Add appropriate loss, metrics, and optimizer
loaded_model.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
print(loaded_model.summary())
```

This example addresses potential issues with older Keras models saved without the explicit inclusion of the regularizers in the model's architecture (though such saving is generally discouraged).  This scenario might arise if one used custom saving routines prior to the robust serialization capabilities of newer Keras versions. The code attempts loading the model directly; if a `ValueError` occurs, it tries to rebuild the model from a separate architecture JSON file (assuming it exists) and load the weights separately. This requires additional care in recompiling the model, adjusting the optimizer, loss, and metrics as needed.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation, particularly sections detailing model saving and loading, and the functional API, provide essential information.  Furthermore, the TensorFlow documentation offers valuable insights into custom layers and objects.  Finally, a solid understanding of serialization and deserialization principles is beneficial in comprehending the underlying mechanics of model persistence.  Reviewing relevant sections of a comprehensive deep learning textbook will also greatly enhance your understanding.
