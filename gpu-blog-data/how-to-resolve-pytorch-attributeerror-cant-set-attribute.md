The `AttributeError: can't set attribute` in PyTorch typically stems from attempting to modify an attribute of a tensor or module that's been detached from the computation graph or is otherwise immutable within its current context.  My experience debugging this error over several years, particularly when working with complex neural network architectures and distributed training, has shown that the root cause often lies in misunderstanding PyTorch's computational graph mechanisms and the lifecycle of tensors within it.

**1.  Explanation:**

PyTorch's dynamic computation graph is built as operations are executed.  Each operation creates a node in the graph, representing a tensor transformation.  Attempting to modify an attribute of a tensor after it's been used in a computation that's already been detached from the graph (e.g., via `.detach()`) will raise this error.  Similarly, attempting to set attributes on immutable objects, like certain pre-trained model weights, will also trigger this issue.  The error isn't limited to tensors; it can occur with modules as well, particularly if you're trying to modify internal parameters after they've been frozen or optimized.  The key is to trace the tensor or module's origin and its operations within the computational graph.  Incorrectly using in-place operations (like `+=`) on detached tensors is another common culprit.

Furthermore, the error manifests differently depending on whether it involves a tensor or a module. With tensors, the problem arises when trying to modify a tensor that the graph no longer tracks.  With modules, it frequently arises from attempting to modify parameters (weights and biases) that are marked as `requires_grad=False` or are part of a module that's not part of the optimizer's parameter list.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Detached Tensor Modification**

```python
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)

# Perform a calculation
y = x * 2

# Detach y from the computation graph
y_detached = y.detach()

# Attempting to modify y_detached will raise the AttributeError
try:
    y_detached.data[0] = 10.0  # This line will cause the error
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Correct approach: Create a new tensor
z = torch.tensor([10.0, 2.0, 3.0])
```

This example demonstrates the core issue. Modifying `y_detached` directly fails because it’s detached from the graph;  PyTorch doesn’t track changes to detached tensors. The correct approach is to create a new tensor with the desired modification.


**Example 2:  Incorrect Module Parameter Modification**

```python
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple linear model
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)

# Freeze model parameters
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Attempting to modify weights directly will raise the AttributeError
try:
    model.weight.data[0][0] = 0.5 # This line will cause the error
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Correct approach:  Either create a new model or unfreeze parameters before modification.
# Unfreezing:
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True
model.weight.data[0][0] = 0.5
```

Here, the error occurs because parameters are frozen (`requires_grad=False`).  Direct modification is blocked. The solution involves unfreezing parameters before attempting to modify them or creating a new model instance with modifiable parameters.

**Example 3:  In-place Operation on a Detached Tensor**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
y_detached = y.detach()

# Incorrect in-place operation
try:
    y_detached[:] = torch.tensor([10.0, 20.0, 30.0]) #This will cause an error
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Correct approach: Use tensor assignment, creating a new tensor
y_detached = torch.tensor([10.0, 20.0, 30.0])
```

This showcases that even seemingly benign in-place operations (`[:]`) fail on detached tensors. The graph doesn’t track these changes.  Creating a new tensor using assignment remains the correct methodology.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I strongly recommend carefully reviewing the PyTorch documentation on automatic differentiation and the computational graph.  Understanding tensor lifecycle and the implications of `.detach()` is crucial.  Familiarize yourself with the inner workings of modules and how parameter management impacts their modifiability.  Thoroughly examine tutorials focusing on building and training neural networks;  many demonstrate correct parameter manipulation within the training loop context.  Finally, utilizing PyTorch's debugging tools and carefully examining stack traces can be immensely helpful in pinpointing the exact location and cause of the error within your code.  These resources collectively offer a deep understanding of the underlying mechanics, preventing future occurrences of this common PyTorch error.
