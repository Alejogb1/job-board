The core challenge in efficiently processing large datasets with CPUs and GPUs lies in optimizing data movement and computation parallelism.  My experience working on high-throughput genomic sequence alignment pipelines taught me that neglecting this fundamental principle leads to significant performance bottlenecks, regardless of hardware capabilities.  Effective solutions necessitate a deep understanding of both hardware architectures and algorithm design.

**1.  Explanation:**

CPUs excel at complex, sequential computations and have sophisticated instruction sets ideal for managing program flow and handling irregular data access patterns.  GPUs, conversely, are massively parallel processors optimized for processing large arrays of data using simpler instructions concurrently. Their strength lies in SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations, performing the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously.  To leverage both effectively, a hybrid approach is often necessary.

Efficient processing begins with data partitioning and distribution.  Large datasets must be divided into smaller chunks that can be processed individually by either the CPU or GPU, minimizing inter-processor communication overhead.  For CPU-bound tasks, this might involve multi-threading or multiprocessing using libraries like OpenMP or multiprocessing in Python.  For GPU-bound tasks, it requires transferring data to the GPU's memory (VRAM) and employing parallel algorithms executed using libraries like CUDA (for NVIDIA GPUs) or OpenCL (for various platforms).  The choice between CPU and GPU processing depends on the nature of the task:  CPU is better suited for complex logic and irregular data access; GPU excels in highly parallelizable numerical computations.

Furthermore, memory management plays a crucial role.  Data transfer between CPU and GPU memory is comparatively slow.  Minimizing data transfers involves techniques like asynchronous data transfers, zero-copy mechanisms (where data remains in the same memory location throughout the process), and careful memory allocation strategies.  On the GPU side, minimizing memory access latency is key; algorithms designed with memory coalescing in mind—accessing contiguous memory locations—can significantly improve performance.

Algorithmic design also profoundly impacts efficiency.  Algorithms inherently suited for parallelism, such as matrix operations, convolutions, and reductions, see significant speedups on GPUs.  However, even algorithms not directly parallelizable can benefit from careful restructuring to extract parallel sections.  Profiling tools are invaluable for identifying performance bottlenecks and guiding optimization efforts.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: CPU-bound task using multiprocessing in Python:**

```python
import multiprocessing
import numpy as np

def process_chunk(chunk):
    # Perform CPU-bound computation on a chunk of data
    result = np.sum(chunk**2)  # Example computation
    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    data = np.random.rand(10000000)  # Large dataset
    chunk_size = 1000000
    chunks = np.array_split(data, int(len(data) / chunk_size))

    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=multiprocessing.cpu_count()) as pool:
        results = pool.map(process_chunk, chunks)

    total_result = np.sum(results)
    print(f"Total result: {total_result}")
```

This example demonstrates how to leverage multiprocessing to distribute a computationally intensive task across multiple CPU cores.  The `np.array_split` function divides the dataset into smaller chunks, each processed independently by a separate process.


**Example 2: GPU-accelerated matrix multiplication using CUDA:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void matrixMultiplyKernel(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int width) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < width && col < width) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int k = 0; k < width; ++k) {
            sum += A[row * width + k] * B[k * width + col];
        }
        C[row * width + col] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    // ... (Memory allocation, data transfer to GPU, kernel launch, data transfer back to CPU) ...
    return 0;
}
```

This CUDA kernel demonstrates a parallel implementation of matrix multiplication.  Each thread calculates a single element of the resulting matrix, leveraging the GPU's massive parallelism. The example omits details of memory management for brevity, but efficient handling of this is paramount for performance.


**Example 3: Hybrid approach using Dask:**

```python
import dask.array as da
import numpy as np

# Create a large Dask array
x = da.random.random((10000, 10000), chunks=(1000, 1000))

# Perform a computation (e.g., matrix multiplication) on the Dask array
y = da.dot(x, x.T)

# Compute the result, potentially leveraging both CPU and GPU resources depending on Dask's configuration
result = y.compute()
```

Dask provides a high-level interface to parallelize computations, automatically distributing the work across multiple cores or even clusters.  While the core computation can utilize optimized libraries (including GPU-accelerated ones), Dask handles the data management and task scheduling efficiently, making it suitable for hybrid CPU/GPU solutions.  Underlying execution is determined through configuration options.
