TensorFlow's expectation of a 2-dimensional input while receiving a 3-dimensional array stems fundamentally from a mismatch between the model's architecture and the data preprocessing pipeline.  This is a common error I've encountered repeatedly during my years developing and deploying machine learning models, particularly in image processing and time series analysis.  The core issue lies in understanding how TensorFlow interprets the dimensions and how the model's layers are designed to handle those dimensions.  The third dimension, unexpectedly present, typically represents a feature the model wasn't explicitly designed to ingest at that stage.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

The most likely scenario is that your input data represents a batch of samples, where each sample itself is already a vector (1-dimensional array).  TensorFlow, however, expects each input to be a vector, thus requiring a 2D array: the first dimension representing the batch size, and the second representing the features within each sample. A 3D array introduces a third dimension, often implying an additional feature level â€“ perhaps multiple channels in an image (RGB, for instance), or multiple time steps in a time-series sequence.  The model's layer, specifically the input layer, is not configured to handle this extra dimension. This leads to a shape mismatch error, as the layer's weight matrix isn't compatible with the incoming 3D tensor.

To resolve this, you need to carefully examine your data preprocessing and the model's input layer definition.  The solution lies in either reshaping your input data to match the model's expectation or adjusting the model architecture to accommodate the additional dimension.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Reshaping the Input Data**

This example demonstrates reshaping a 3D array representing a batch of images (batch_size x height x width) into a 2D array suitable for a model expecting only image vectors.  This approach assumes the model is designed to handle flattened image data.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample 3D array (batch_size, height, width)
data_3d = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28) # 100 images, 28x28 pixels

# Reshape to 2D array (batch_size, height * width)
data_2d = data_3d.reshape(data_3d.shape[0], -1)

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(data_2d.shape[1],)), # Input shape is now the flattened image size.
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model (replace with your actual data and parameters)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(data_2d, np.random.rand(100,10), epochs=1)  # Placeholder for target variable
```

This code flattens the image data, removing the height and width dimensions. The `input_shape` parameter in the `Dense` layer now correctly reflects the flattened input size.  Remember to replace placeholder data with your actual data and labels.

**Example 2: Modifying the Model Architecture**

This example illustrates adapting the model architecture to accept the additional dimension, assuming the third dimension represents a feature, like channels in an image.  This uses a convolutional layer which naturally handles the extra dimension.


```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample 3D array (batch_size, height, width, channels)
data_3d = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28, 3)  # 100 images, 28x28 pixels, 3 channels (RGB)

# Define a convolutional model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 3)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(data_3d, np.random.rand(100,10), epochs=1) # Placeholder for target variable
```

Here, a `Conv2D` layer is used to process the 3D input directly.  The `input_shape` now includes the channel dimension. The model explicitly handles the spatial information (height and width) and the channel information within a single layer, eliminating the need for preprocessing to flatten the data.

**Example 3:  Handling Time Series Data**

This example focuses on a scenario where the 3D array represents a time series dataset.  Here, the third dimension represents time steps.  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are suitable for handling sequential data.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample 3D array (batch_size, timesteps, features)
data_3d = np.random.rand(100, 20, 5)  # 100 sequences, 20 timesteps, 5 features

# Define an LSTM model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(data_3d.shape[1], data_3d.shape[2])),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1) # Assuming a regression task
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') # Mean Squared Error for regression
model.fit(data_3d, np.random.rand(100,1), epochs=1) # Placeholder for target variable

```

This model utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer, a type of RNN specifically designed to handle sequential data.  The `input_shape` is specified to accommodate the time steps and features dimensions.  The output layer is adjusted depending on whether you are performing regression or classification.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I would suggest reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on model building and data preprocessing.  Furthermore, carefully examine the documentation for the specific layers you are using (e.g., `Dense`, `Conv2D`, `LSTM`). Understanding the expected input shapes for each layer is crucial.  Finally, consider exploring introductory materials on neural network architectures to gain a clearer understanding of how different layers handle multi-dimensional data. Thoroughly inspect your data using tools like NumPy to visualize its shape and contents.  This debugging step is often overlooked but can save significant time.
