The `SyntaxError: only named arguments may follow *expression` within PyTorch's `nn.Sequential` arises specifically from the interaction between the unpacking operator (`*`) and positional arguments in Python 3.8 and later.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image classification models taught me that this error stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how Python's argument unpacking works, particularly when combined with the keyword-only arguments present in many PyTorch modules.  This error doesn't signify a problem *within* PyTorch's `nn.Sequential` itself, but rather in how the user is constructing the input to the `nn.Sequential`'s constructor.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core of the problem lies in the order of arguments passed to `nn.Sequential`.  `nn.Sequential` accepts a variable number of modules as input.  These modules can have their own parameters and initialization methods.  When using the unpacking operator (`*`) with a list or tuple of modules,  you are essentially providing positional arguments. Python 3.8 introduced stricter rules on argument ordering: positional arguments must precede keyword arguments.  If you attempt to follow the `*expression` (representing unpacked arguments) with positional arguments, you violate this rule, triggering the SyntaxError.  This often occurs when attempting to combine unpacked modules with additional modules specified by name after the unpacked list.

Let's assume you have a list of modules `my_modules` and want to add a final `nn.Linear` layer. Incorrect usage would look like:

```python
# Incorrect usage leading to SyntaxError
my_modules = [nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3), nn.ReLU(), nn.MaxPool2d(2)]
model = nn.Sequential(*my_modules, nn.Linear(16, 10))  #Error occurs here
```

The error arises because `nn.Linear(16, 10)` is treated as a positional argument following the unpacking of `my_modules`, violating Python's argument ordering rules.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct usage with explicit keyword arguments:**

```python
import torch.nn as nn

my_modules = [nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3), nn.ReLU(), nn.MaxPool2d(2)]
model = nn.Sequential(*my_modules, linear=nn.Linear(16, 10))
print(model)
```
This code corrects the error.  By explicitly naming the `nn.Linear` layer using the `linear` keyword, we bypass the positional argument restriction. This strategy is robust and clearly communicates the intent.


**Example 2: Correct usage by appending to the list before unpacking:**

```python
import torch.nn as nn

my_modules = [nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3), nn.ReLU(), nn.MaxPool2d(2)]
my_modules.append(nn.Linear(16,10)) #Add linear layer to the list
model = nn.Sequential(*my_modules)
print(model)
```
Here, we directly append the final layer to the list before unpacking. This avoids the problem entirely by ensuring all arguments provided to `nn.Sequential` are positional and occur *before* any keyword-only arguments. This approach is concise and avoids explicit keyword naming.


**Example 3:  Handling a more complex scenario with multiple modules and keyword arguments:**

```python
import torch.nn as nn

initial_layers = [nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3), nn.ReLU(), nn.MaxPool2d(2)]
final_layers = [nn.Flatten(), nn.Linear(16*8*8, 100), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(100, 10)] #Example assuming 16 input channels, 8x8 output after pooling

model = nn.Sequential(*initial_layers, *final_layers)
print(model)
```
In this scenario we have two sets of layers.  By simply unpacking both lists sequentially using `*`, we ensure that all arguments are processed positionally and the SyntaxError is avoided.  This emphasizes that the problem isn't inherent to `nn.Sequential` but rather to the incorrect interaction of unpacking with argument ordering rules in the broader Python context.  Note the assumption of input size after pooling; in a real application, careful attention should be paid to layer dimensions.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend reviewing the official Python documentation on function arguments and argument unpacking.   Furthermore, consult the PyTorch documentation regarding the `nn.Sequential` module and the specific parameters accepted by its constructor.  A strong understanding of Python's argument passing mechanisms is crucial for effective use of PyTorch.  Understanding keyword-only arguments in the context of Python 3.8+ will prove particularly valuable in resolving similar errors that could arise in other PyTorch modules or custom classes.  Finally, carefully study PyTorch's example codebases on GitHub and explore various model architectures to observe best practices for module construction and parameter handling.  Thorough familiarity with these resources will significantly improve your ability to avoid and effectively debug such errors in your own code.
