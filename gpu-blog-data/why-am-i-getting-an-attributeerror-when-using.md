The core reason you encounter an `AttributeError` when using the `import ... as ...` syntax, despite the import itself seemingly succeeding, stems from a mismatch between the aliased name you're using and the actual attributes or functions provided by the imported module. This commonly occurs when you try to access a member of the module through the alias that doesn't exist, or where the original module name was assumed where the alias is now defined. This can manifest in various ways, each pointing back to fundamental principles of Python's module system.

My experience, accumulated over years maintaining large Python codebases, reveals this as a frequent point of confusion, particularly for developers newer to module aliasing. The `as` keyword doesn't change what's *inside* the module; it only provides a new *name* through which to access the module itself. It's crucial to understand this distinction. The core misunderstanding usually involves confusing the alias with the members of the original module or misinterpreting the scope that the alias applies to.

Let’s break this down further. In Python, the `import` statement loads a module and makes it available. When you use `import module_name as alias_name`, you’re essentially saying: "load the module named `module_name`, but, for the purposes of this current scope, refer to it as `alias_name`". All functions, classes, and variables within that loaded module are accessed *through* the `alias_name`, not the original `module_name`. Therefore, if you subsequently attempt to call a method or access an attribute using `module_name` (or a mistyped alias), Python throws the aforementioned `AttributeError` because it cannot resolve the name within the designated context of the alias or original module name as applicable.

Now, let's consider three concrete code examples to illustrate this.

**Example 1: Incorrect Alias Usage**

```python
# Assume a file named 'my_module.py' exists with a function 'calculate_sum'
# and 'calculate_average'
# my_module.py contents:
# def calculate_sum(a, b):
#     return a + b
#
# def calculate_average(a,b):
#     return (a + b) / 2
import my_module as mm

result = mm.calculate_sum(5, 10)  # This works fine
print(result)

average = my_module.calculate_average(5, 10) # This will produce AttributeError
print(average)
```

*Commentary:* In this first example, we correctly import `my_module` using the alias `mm`. When we call `mm.calculate_sum()`, it works perfectly since we're referencing the function through the defined alias. However, trying to call `my_module.calculate_average()` leads to an `AttributeError`.  This happens because once you have established an alias, the original module name becomes inaccessible *within the current scope*, and thus the program cannot locate the function within the defined scope of the alias. Python is looking in the original module context, where the alias has been defined.

**Example 2: Mistyped Alias**

```python
import datetime as date

current_date = date.date.today()
print(current_date)

current_date_wrong_alias = daet.date.today() # Produces an AttributeError
print(current_date_wrong_alias)
```

*Commentary:* This example is about typos in alias names, an extremely common occurrence in real code. The `datetime` module is correctly imported as `date`. The call to `date.date.today()` works without issue as the alias `date` is being used. The subsequent call, however, uses `daet` instead of `date` (a simple transposition error), and thus this generates an `AttributeError`. Python cannot find the `daet` module or an attribute called `date` in the existing context.

**Example 3: Incorrect Access of Nested Objects**

```python
import json as js

# Assuming a dictionary named data in JSON format is in my_data.json
# data = {"employee": {"name": "John Doe", "id": 123}}

with open("my_data.json", "r") as f:
  json_data = f.read()

data = js.loads(json_data)
print(data["employee"]["name"])  # This works fine

print(js["employee"]["name"]) # This will produce AttributeError
```

*Commentary:* This final example demonstrates the error of misinterpreting the scope of the alias. We correctly use the `json` module as `js` to load JSON data into a Python dictionary. The call to `data["employee"]["name"]` correctly navigates the nested structure in the loaded dictionary. However, trying to access the dictionary elements using the alias `js["employee"]["name"]` throws an `AttributeError`, because `js` refers to the imported `json` module itself, and that module, while containing the `loads` function, has no attribute called `employee` and so cannot access a dictionary through the alias.

To avoid these `AttributeError`s when using `import ... as ...`, consider these key points. First, use consistent and meaningful aliases. Avoid using single-character or highly ambiguous alias names. Second, double-check for typographical errors in your alias names. Third, remember that the alias represents the *module object*, not its contents. Thus, you must access functions, classes, and variables within the aliased module using `alias.member`, not the original module name or the alias directly. Fourth, use an IDE with robust code completion features, as these features can often catch these errors early, as well as help you explore the contents of imported modules and their aliases.

To deepen your understanding of module imports and avoid such errors in the future, I recommend exploring several resources.  Start by reviewing the official Python documentation on modules, imports, and packages. This will provide a solid theoretical foundation. Next, investigate resources that illustrate the difference between names and objects in Python's namespace. Additionally, working through small exercises where you frequently use module aliasing will provide practical experience and help reinforce understanding. Finally, consult a comprehensive style guide, as it will also provide recommendations on best practices for imports in Python, including when and how to apply aliasing.
