TensorFlow offers several approaches to function minimization, the choice depending heavily on the function's characteristics and the desired level of control.  My experience optimizing complex neural networks and physics simulations has highlighted the importance of understanding these differences.  Crucially, the "function" in question might represent a loss function within a machine learning model, a complex energy landscape in a physics simulation, or simply a general mathematical function requiring minimization.  This directly impacts the appropriate TensorFlow technique.

**1. Gradient Descent Methods:**  This forms the bedrock of many minimization strategies in TensorFlow.  Gradient descent algorithms iteratively adjust the input variables of the function to move towards a minimum by following the negative of the gradient.  The gradient, representing the direction of the steepest ascent, is computed automatically by TensorFlow using automatic differentiation.  The efficiency and stability of the process are influenced by the choice of specific gradient descent variant, learning rate, and momentum parameters.

**Example 1: Basic Gradient Descent**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the function to minimize
def my_function(x):
  return x**2 + 2*x + 1

# Create a TensorFlow variable for the input
x = tf.Variable(initial_value=5.0, dtype=tf.float32) # Initialize x away from minimum

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = tf.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1) # Stochastic Gradient Descent

# Optimization loop
for i in range(1000):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = my_function(x)
  grad = tape.gradient(y, x)
  optimizer.apply_gradients([(grad, x)])

print(f"Minimized x: {x.numpy()}, Minimum value: {my_function(x).numpy()}")
```

This example showcases a simple quadratic function minimized using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).  The `tf.GradientTape()` context manager automatically computes the gradient of `y` with respect to `x`. The optimizer then updates `x` based on this gradient and the learning rate.  Note that for more complex functions, the convergence speed and the final minimum achieved might be improved with more sophisticated optimizers.

**Example 2: Adam Optimizer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the function to minimize (a more complex example)
def complex_function(x, y):
  return tf.sin(x) + tf.cos(y) + x**2 + y**2

# Create TensorFlow variables for the inputs
x = tf.Variable(initial_value=1.0, dtype=tf.float32)
y = tf.Variable(initial_value=-1.0, dtype=tf.float32)

# Define the Adam optimizer
optimizer = tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Optimization loop
for i in range(5000):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    z = complex_function(x, y)
  grads = tape.gradient(z, [x, y])
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, [x, y]))

print(f"Minimized x: {x.numpy()}, Minimized y: {y.numpy()}, Minimum value: {complex_function(x, y).numpy()}")
```

Here, the Adam optimizer is employed, known for its adaptive learning rates, often leading to faster convergence than basic SGD, especially in high-dimensional spaces or with noisy gradients. The example uses a more intricate function, demonstrating the versatility of TensorFlow optimizers.

**Example 3: Minimizing a Loss Function in a Neural Network**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simple linear regression model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])
])

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]], dtype=float)
y = np.array([[2], [4], [5], [4], [5]], dtype=float)

# Compile the model with MSE loss and Adam optimizer
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=1000, verbose=0)

# The model's weights represent the minimized function parameters
print(f"Minimized weights: {model.get_weights()}")
```

This illustrates minimizing a loss function within a neural network.  The `model.fit()` method implicitly performs gradient descent (using Adam by default) to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) loss function. The learned weights represent the parameters that minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual data.  This is a very common application of function minimization in TensorFlow.

**2. Beyond Gradient Descent:**  For functions with non-smooth characteristics or when gradients are unavailable, alternative techniques may be more suitable.  These are less frequently used in my work but are important to consider:

* **Nelder-Mead Simplex Method:**  A derivative-free method applicable to non-differentiable functions.  TensorFlow doesn't have a built-in implementation, requiring the use of external libraries like SciPy.

* **Simulated Annealing:** A probabilistic metaheuristic used for global optimization problems, suitable for complex, multimodal functions where gradient-based methods might get trapped in local minima.  Again, external libraries are typically required for implementation.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, including tutorials and API references, is an invaluable resource.  Consider supplementing this with a textbook focusing on numerical optimization and machine learning algorithms. A solid grasp of linear algebra and calculus will also greatly enhance your ability to understand and apply these techniques effectively.  Additionally, exploring advanced optimizer papers can provide insights into specific algorithms and their strengths.  Finally, reviewing the source code of existing TensorFlow models can provide valuable practical examples.
