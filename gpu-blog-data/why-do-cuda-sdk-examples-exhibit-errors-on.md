CUDA SDK examples frequently fail on multi-GPU systems due to implicit assumptions about device selection and resource allocation.  My experience debugging these issues over the past decade, particularly while developing high-performance computing solutions for geophysical simulations, reveals a consistent pattern:  the examples often assume a single, default GPU is available, neglecting the complexities of multi-GPU configurations and inter-device communication.  This leads to errors ranging from silent failures to explicit runtime exceptions.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core problem stems from the CUDA runtime's default behavior.  When a CUDA program initializes, it selects a default GPU based on a variety of factors, including the order in which GPUs are detected by the driver and the system's power management settings.  If the SDK example hasn't explicitly specified a target GPU, it will operate on this default device. In a multi-GPU system, this default device might not be the intended device, or even a suitable device for the task.  Further, many examples assume that all necessary data resides on the selected GPU's memory. When multiple GPUs are involved, data transfer between devices, a process known as peer-to-peer communication or data copying through the host, is crucial but often overlooked in basic examples.  Failure to manage this explicitly can result in memory access violations, incorrect computations, or outright crashes. The examples rarely address the synchronization needed for multi-GPU operations, leading to race conditions and unpredictable results. Finally, the absence of explicit error checking in these examples magnifies the problems, masking the root causes behind cryptic error messages.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Implicit Device Selection Leading to Errors:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int *h_a, *d_a;
  int size = 1024;

  cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_a, size * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, size * sizeof(int));

  // ... (some computations using d_a) ...

  cudaMemcpy(h_a, d_a, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
  cudaFree(d_a);
  cudaFreeHost(h_a);

  return 0;
}
```

This simple example lacks explicit device selection.  If the system has multiple GPUs, it might run on a device with insufficient memory or compute capabilities, silently failing or crashing due to out-of-memory conditions.  To correct this, one must specify the device using `cudaSetDevice()`.


**Example 2:  Ignoring Peer-to-Peer Communication:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int devCount;
  cudaGetDeviceCount(&devCount);

  if (devCount > 1) {
    int *d_a[2], *d_b[2];
    // ... (Allocate d_a[0] and d_b[0] on device 0, d_a[1] and d_b[1] on device 1) ...
    // ... (Compute on both devices independently) ...
    // This example lacks the critical step of data transfer between devices
    // Leading to data isolation and incorrect results.
  }
  // ... (rest of the code) ...

  return 0;
}
```

This illustrative snippet demonstrates a multi-GPU scenario. However, it omits the crucial step of data transfer between `d_a[0]` and `d_a[1]` (and similarly `d_b[0]` and `d_b[1]`) before and/or after the computation on each device.  This leads to data isolation, generating incorrect or incomplete results.  Proper peer-to-peer communication or host-mediated data transfer using `cudaMemcpyPeer` or `cudaMemcpy` needs to be explicitly implemented.  Checking for peer-to-peer access capability using `cudaDeviceCanAccessPeer` is also essential before attempting peer-to-peer transfers.

**Example 3:  Lack of Synchronization:**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>

void *kernel_launcher(void *arg) {
  int devID = *(int*)arg;
  cudaSetDevice(devID);
  // ... (perform some computation) ...
  return NULL;
}

int main() {
  int devCount;
  cudaGetDeviceCount(&devCount);

  pthread_t threads[devCount];
  int devIDs[devCount];
  for (int i = 0; i < devCount; i++) {
    devIDs[i] = i;
    pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, kernel_launcher, &devIDs[i]);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < devCount; i++) {
    pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This illustrates a multi-threaded approach to launch kernels on multiple GPUs.  However, this code lacks proper synchronization mechanisms.  The kernels launched on different devices might race for resources, leading to unpredictable outputs and data corruption.  CUDA provides synchronization primitives like `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to enforce ordering and ensure data consistency across devices.  Failing to utilize them will invariably lead to inconsistencies in results.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA C Programming Guide, the CUDA Best Practices Guide, and the CUDA Toolkit documentation are fundamental resources.  Additionally, consulting advanced CUDA programming texts focusing on parallel algorithms and multi-GPU programming will significantly improve your understanding.  Thorough study of these materials, combined with diligent debugging practices, will prove invaluable in successfully implementing multi-GPU applications.  Understanding asynchronous programming techniques within the CUDA framework is also critical for performance optimization and error prevention.  Finally, using debugging tools like CUDA-gdb can offer crucial insights into the execution flow and memory management of your code, enabling the pinpointing of issues that might otherwise remain hidden.
