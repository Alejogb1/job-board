Ensuring comparable performance across different neural network runs hinges critically on the reproducibility of the entire training pipeline, extending far beyond simply using the same hyperparameters. My experience debugging inconsistent model performance across research projects and production deployments highlights this.  Inconsistent performance isn't solely a matter of random initialization; it stems from a confluence of factors affecting the training process itself, including data preprocessing, model architecture instantiation, and the randomness inherent in optimization algorithms.

1. **The Importance of Seed Setting and Deterministic Operations:**

A common misconception is that merely setting the random seed for weight initialization guarantees consistent results. While crucial, this is insufficient.  Many libraries and hardware components introduce non-determinism in seemingly innocuous operations like data shuffling, cuDNN kernel selection (in CUDA-based implementations), and even the order of operations within a computational graph.  To achieve true reproducibility, every step influencing the model's behavior must be explicitly controlled. This includes:

* **Random Number Generators (RNGs):** Setting the seed for the primary RNG is the first step, but ensuring all RNGs within the library (NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) are seeded consistently is critical.  Different libraries often use distinct RNGs, requiring explicit seeding for each.  Furthermore, operations like data shuffling, which often rely on internal RNGs, need to be deterministic.

* **Hardware and Software Environments:**  The underlying hardware and software stack can influence performance.  Variations in CPU/GPU architectures, driver versions, and operating system configurations can lead to subtle but measurable differences. Using Docker containers with pre-defined environments mitigates this significantly.

* **Data Preprocessing:**  Inconsistent data preprocessing is a major source of irreproducibility.   Data loading, normalization, augmentation, and other preprocessing steps should be carefully documented and implemented consistently. Any form of randomness in these steps, such as random cropping or data augmentation, needs to be seeded consistently as well.

2. **Code Examples Illustrating Reproducibility Techniques:**

Here are three examples illustrating different aspects of ensuring comparable neural network performance using Python and common deep learning libraries:

**Example 1:  Seeding Randomness in PyTorch**

```python
import torch
import random
import numpy as np

# Set seeds for all RNGs
seed = 42
torch.manual_seed(seed)
torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)  # For CUDA devices
random.seed(seed)
np.random.seed(seed)

# Ensure deterministic CuDNN behavior (PyTorch 1.10 and later)
torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False # Optional: can speed up training, but sacrifices reproducibility

# ... rest of your PyTorch code ...
```

This example demonstrates comprehensively seeding PyTorch and its dependencies.  The `cudnn.deterministic` flag is essential for CUDA users; however, note that it may slightly reduce training speed.

**Example 2: Deterministic Data Loading and Augmentation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... Data loading and preprocessing ...

# Create a tf.data.Dataset
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)  # Replace 'data' with your data

# Use tf.random.set_seed to control randomness within the Dataset pipeline
tf.random.set_seed(42)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=len(data), seed=42, reshuffle_each_iteration=False) \
                 .map(preprocess_function, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE) \
                 .batch(batch_size)

# ... model training ...

def preprocess_function(image):
  # Deterministic image augmentation. Note the seed-based augmentation!
  image = tf.image.random_crop(image, size=[224, 224, 3], seed=42) # Example augmentation
  # ... more augmentations with consistent seeding ...
  return image

```

This illustrates consistent data shuffling and deterministic image augmentation within TensorFlow using `tf.random.set_seed`.  The `reshuffle_each_iteration=False` argument is crucial for reproducibility across epochs.  Augmentations are explicitly seeded for deterministic behavior.

**Example 3:  Model Architecture Instantiation and Weight Initialization**

```python
import keras

# ... define your model architecture using Keras ...

# Set the random seed for weight initialization in Keras
np.random.seed(42)

# Instantiate the model.  Ensuring same architecture instantiation every time.
model = your_model_architecture(input_shape=(image_height, image_width, channels), ...)

# Compile the model with the desired optimizer, loss, and metrics
model.compile(optimizer=..., loss=..., metrics=...)
```


This focuses on architecture definition and consistent weight initialization using Keras. Note how the random seed is set *before* the model is instantiated to control initial weights.  The use of a predefined architecture avoids potential variations from library updates or inadvertent code modifications.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

To deepen your understanding, consult the official documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras) concerning random seed management and deterministic operations.  Furthermore, review publications and tutorials focusing on reproducible machine learning.  Explore materials on best practices for reproducible research in general; these often overlap with the requirements for reproducible deep learning models.  Study in-depth articles and guides on Docker for creating reproducible environments.  Finally, consider the literature on testing and validation methodologies in machine learning for comprehensively assessing model consistency.
