Visualizing data within a Keras model requires a nuanced approach, going beyond simple input/output inspection.  My experience debugging complex sequential and convolutional networks taught me the criticality of understanding internal representations – not just the final predictions.  Effective visualization necessitates choosing appropriate techniques based on the model architecture and the specific data being analyzed. This response outlines several methods and their applications.

**1. Clear Explanation: Strategies for Intra-Model Data Visualization**

The challenge lies in accessing the intermediate activations within the Keras model.  Keras, being a high-level API, abstracts away much of the underlying computational graph.  However, we can leverage its functionalities, along with external visualization libraries, to achieve our goal.  Three primary strategies are:

* **Layer Output Extraction:** This involves accessing the output tensor of each layer during the model's forward pass.  This allows direct inspection of the activations at different processing stages. We can then utilize libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to plot these activations. This is particularly useful for understanding feature extraction in convolutional layers or the evolution of representations through sequential layers.

* **Gradient-based Visualization:**  For deeper insight into feature importance, we can examine the gradients flowing back through the network during training.  These gradients highlight which input features most strongly influence the output. This approach, commonly employed in techniques like saliency maps, allows us to identify the regions or features that are crucial for specific predictions.  Libraries like TensorFlow’s `tf.GradientTape` are instrumental here.

* **Activation Maximization:** This technique aims to find inputs that maximize the activation of a specific neuron or layer. This offers a view into the receptive field of a neuron, unveiling what input patterns trigger strong responses.  This method often involves iterative optimization techniques to find the optimal input that maximizes the target activation.

The choice of visualization method depends heavily on the model's architecture and the research question.  For instance, visualizing layer outputs is effective for understanding feature hierarchies in CNNs, while gradient-based methods are better suited for assessing feature importance in image classification. Activation maximization is best for understanding individual neuron selectivity.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Visualizing Layer Outputs in a Sequential Model**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Define a simple sequential model
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Generate some sample data
x_input = np.random.rand(1, 10)

# Access layer outputs using Keras functional API
layer_outputs = [layer.output for layer in model.layers]
activation_model = keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=layer_outputs)
activations = activation_model.predict(x_input)

# Plot the activations of the first layer
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.imshow(activations[0][0, :].reshape(8, 8), cmap='viridis')  # Reshape for visualization
plt.colorbar()
plt.title('Activations of the First Dense Layer')
plt.show()
```

This code demonstrates how to extract and visualize the activations of a dense layer in a sequential model using Keras’ functional API. The activations are reshaped for easier visualization using Matplotlib.  This approach is readily adaptable to different layer types by modifying the reshaping and plotting accordingly.  Note that the reshaping might need to be adjusted based on the layer's output dimensions.


**Example 2: Generating Saliency Maps using Gradients**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume 'model' is a pre-trained Keras model
# and 'image' is a sample input image

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(image)
    predictions = model(image)
    loss = predictions[:, 1]  # Assuming binary classification, focusing on class 1

grads = tape.gradient(loss, image)
grads = tf.reduce_mean(grads, axis=-1) # Averaging gradients across color channels
grads = tf.abs(grads) # Taking absolute value for magnitude

saliency_map = grads.numpy()
plt.imshow(saliency_map, cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar()
plt.title('Saliency Map')
plt.show()
```

This example uses TensorFlow's `GradientTape` to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the input image.  The average absolute gradient across color channels is used to generate the saliency map. This visualizes the regions of the image that most influence the model’s prediction.  The specific loss function might need modification depending on the task (e.g., categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification).


**Example 3: Activation Maximization using Gradient Ascent**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Assume 'model' is a pre-trained Keras model
# and 'layer_index' specifies the target layer

layer_output = model.layers[layer_index].output
activation_model = keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs=layer_output)

input_img = tf.Variable(np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)) # Example input shape
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

for i in range(100):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    activations = activation_model(input_img)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(activations) # Maximize average activation
  grads = tape.gradient(loss, input_img)
  optimizer.apply_gradients([(grads, input_img)])

maximized_activation = input_img.numpy()
plt.imshow(maximized_activation[0, :, :, 0], cmap='gray')
plt.title('Maximized Activation')
plt.show()
```

This code performs gradient ascent to find an input that maximizes the average activation of a specific layer.  The Adam optimizer iteratively updates the input image to increase the target layer's activation. The resulting image represents the pattern that strongly excites the chosen layer's neurons. This requires careful selection of the learning rate and number of iterations for optimal results.  Error handling (e.g., checking for NaN values) might be needed in production environments.
