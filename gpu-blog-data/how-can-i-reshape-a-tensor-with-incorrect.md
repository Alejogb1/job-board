Tensor reshaping, particularly when faced with incorrect input dimensions, is a frequent challenge encountered in deep learning and numerical computation. The core issue stems from the need to align the data's layout with the operations intended, especially when migrating between different frameworks or during data preprocessing stages. Incorrect dimensions invariably lead to errors, but careful manipulation often allows us to rectify these discrepancies. The underlying principle is that the total number of elements must remain consistent throughout the reshaping process.

One commonly encountered scenario is where a tensor’s shape doesn't conform to the expected structure for a particular operation. This might be due to a mistake during data loading, a misunderstanding of input expectations of a layer in a neural network, or inconsistencies arising from operations performed earlier in a workflow. The process of reshaping a tensor involves altering the dimensions while preserving the underlying data. To effectively reshape a tensor with incorrect input dimensions, several key considerations need to be taken into account.

First, understand the original, potentially incorrect shape. This step is crucial as it dictates how you approach the reshaping. Printing the tensor shape using the built-in methods within your framework (`.shape` in TensorFlow or PyTorch, for instance) is a vital first step. The goal is to arrive at a desired shape that satisfies the next operation’s requirement. It is not merely a matter of haphazardly changing numbers, but also of strategically reorganizing the stored data.

Second, the most critical principle is the conservation of the total number of elements. In simple terms, if you start with a 3x4 tensor containing 12 elements, any reshaping you do must still result in a tensor with 12 elements. Reshaping into a 2x6 or 6x2 tensor would be valid since 2*6=12, and 6*2=12, but reshaping to a 3x5, or 4x4 would be an incorrect attempt and will most likely lead to errors.

Third, consider the implicit ordering of the elements in the original tensor. When reshaping, the underlying data is rearranged. A basic reshape simply reorganizes the data in a row-major or column-major fashion (depending on the framework's implementation). However, a more complex reshape might require transposing or other operations to reorganize the data more intelligently, especially when dealing with image or sequence data where the ordering of dimensions represents different spatial or temporal aspects.

Now, let’s illustrate this with examples, using Pythonic pseudocode to demonstrate the process, keeping the key principles in mind. The first example tackles the case where a 1D tensor is loaded as a batch of size 1 when we really intend to use it as a flat array.

```python
# Example 1: Removing an extraneous batch dimension

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial tensor with an unwanted batch dimension (shape 1, 10)
original_tensor = tf.constant(np.arange(10).reshape(1, 10))
print(f"Original shape: {original_tensor.shape}")

# Remove the first dimension (batch size) to get a simple 1D array
reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(original_tensor, [10])  # Correct way to remove a batch dimension
print(f"Reshaped shape: {reshaped_tensor.shape}")
```

In this instance, I'm using Tensorflow and NumPy to demonstrate a very simple reshape. The original tensor is a (1,10) shape which means it has one batch of ten elements. The goal is to remove the extra dimension to reshape into a flat array of size ten. We achieve this by using tf.reshape with the target shape as \[10]. It's a simple yet prevalent case.

Next, let’s consider a situation where a flattened image is loaded. Assume that a square image, which is represented as a 2D array, has been loaded as a single vector.

```python
# Example 2: Reshaping a flattened image into a 2D array
import tensorflow as tf

# Flattened image as a 1D tensor (assumed 64 = 8x8)
flattened_image = tf.constant(tf.range(64))
print(f"Original shape: {flattened_image.shape}")

# Reshape into a 2D square image 8x8.
reshaped_image = tf.reshape(flattened_image, [8, 8])
print(f"Reshaped shape: {reshaped_image.shape}")
```

Here, the original tensor is 1D, containing 64 elements, and representing a flattened image. Knowing that the image was originally square, we can reshape it back to a 2D array using tf.reshape again, indicating the dimensions \[8,8]. If the dimensions of the image were different, then we could reshape it accordingly. What’s key is that we maintain the same overall number of elements.

Finally, let’s deal with a more complex example where dimensions are transposed as well, and also make use of placeholder dimensions. Assume you are dealing with a 3D tensor representing an image, but the color channels are the last dimension and the framework requires it to be the first, along with an extra batch dimension.

```python
# Example 3: Reshaping and transposing a 3D tensor and inserting batch dimension

import tensorflow as tf
# Assume this is some image data with channel last ordering.
original_image_tensor = tf.constant(tf.range(24).reshape(2,3,4), dtype=tf.float32)
print(f"Original shape: {original_image_tensor.shape}")

# Add a batch dimension, and transpose channels from last position to first.
reshaped_tensor = tf.transpose(original_image_tensor, [2,0,1])
reshaped_tensor = tf.expand_dims(reshaped_tensor, axis=0)

print(f"Reshaped shape: {reshaped_tensor.shape}")

```

This example shows that reshaping can be combined with transposing, which swaps the ordering of dimensions. The original tensor has the shape \[2, 3, 4], representing a data that is two images, with the 3 rows and 4 color channels. The target requires a batch dimension, and the channels to be the first dimensions ( \[4, 2, 3] ). First, the transpose method transposes axes 0 and 2 so that channels are first, then `expand_dims` is used to add a new batch dimension in position zero. The new shape becomes \[1, 4, 2, 3]. The key difference here is that, while the number of elements remains the same, it also requires specific changes to data ordering based on the desired output, and this is achieved using `transpose`. Notice that in this case, we also make use of `expand_dims`, in addition to `transpose` to manipulate the dimensionality of the tensor.

From these examples, it should be clear that reshaping tensors when dimensions are mismatched or loaded incorrectly requires carefully defining the desired structure and ensuring that the total number of elements remains constant. The choice of `reshape`, `transpose`, `expand_dims` or other related methods depends greatly on the specific manipulation required, including the need to reorder data along different dimensions.

For further exploration of these concepts, I would recommend consulting the official documentation of your deep learning library of choice. If using TensorFlow, examine its API guide for the `tf.reshape`, `tf.transpose`, and `tf.expand_dims` operations and related functions. Also, make use of tutorials and examples provided with the library. Similarly, PyTorch users should refer to the `torch.reshape`, `torch.transpose`, `torch.unsqueeze` and the various view and permute methods provided, as they also provide great resources for learning tensor manipulations. Also, make sure to study the numpy library since most tensor frameworks are compatible with Numpy and its reshaping principles and methods. I’ve found that understanding the mathematical implications of these operations improves intuition greatly.
