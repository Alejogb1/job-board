CUDA 5's debugging capabilities, while improved over previous versions, still presented significant challenges compared to modern debuggers.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects using CUDA 5 involved extensive use of its tools, highlighting both their strengths and considerable limitations. The core issue was the inherent complexity of debugging parallel code executed on a heterogeneous architecture.  Effective debugging demanded a multi-pronged approach encompassing careful code design, strategic use of CUDA's debugging tools, and robust error handling.  

The primary debugging tool within CUDA 5 was the NVIDIA CUDA Debugger (NSight), a graphical debugger integrated within the NVIDIA Nsight Visual Studio Edition.  This allowed for source-level debugging of CUDA kernels, albeit with limitations.  Breakpoints could be set within the kernel code, and variables could be inspected. However,  the sheer volume of threads executing simultaneously made stepping through the code line-by-line impractical for large kernels.  Instead, effective use hinged on selective breakpoint placement within critical sections of the kernel, focusing on areas with a high probability of error.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Debugging CUDA applications differs considerably from debugging traditional serial code. The challenge lies in managing the parallelism inherent in CUDA.  A single kernel launch can involve thousands or even millions of threads executing concurrently. A subtle error in a single thread might only manifest under specific conditions, making it difficult to reproduce and identify.

CUDA 5 provided limited capabilities for inspecting the state of individual threads.  While you could inspect variables within a thread at a breakpoint, determining *which* thread was causing the issue frequently required painstakingly analyzing the data produced by the kernel.  This necessitated a deep understanding of the parallel algorithm's implementation and flow, and a well-structured approach to data organization within the kernel.  Moreover,  race conditions and deadlocks were notoriously difficult to debug in CUDA 5. The tools lacked the sophisticated features for analyzing thread synchronization and detecting these problems automatically.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the debugging approaches I employed in CUDA 5.  They highlight the limitations of the available tools and the strategic thinking necessary to isolate and address errors.

**Example 1:  Using `cuda-gdb` for Basic Debugging**

```c++
__global__ void vectorAdd(const int *a, const int *b, int *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i]; //Potential error: out-of-bounds access if n is incorrect
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation, data initialization) ...

  vectorAdd<<<blocks, threads>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

  // ... (Error checking, data transfer back to host) ...

  return 0;
}
```

In this example, a potential out-of-bounds access exists. Using `cuda-gdb`, a command-line debugger, I would set breakpoints within the kernel before and after the addition to inspect the value of `i` and the array indices.  However, this only addressed single thread behavior.  The challenge was to understand why a particular thread might experience the issue, which often involved meticulous analysis of the input data and kernel launch parameters.

**Example 2:  Error Handling and Assertions**

```c++
__global__ void matrixMultiply(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int width) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < width && col < width) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int k = 0; k < width; ++k) {
            sum += A[row * width + k] * B[k * width + col];
        }
        C[row * width + col] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation, data initialization) ...

  matrixMultiply<<<dim3(blocks, blocks), dim3(threads, threads)>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, width);

  cudaError_t err = cudaGetLastError();
  if(err != cudaSuccess){
    fprintf(stderr, "CUDA error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    return 1;
  }

  // ... (Error checking, data transfer back to host) ...
  return 0;
}

```

This example demonstrates the importance of robust error handling.  The inclusion of `cudaGetLastError()` after every CUDA API call is crucial in identifying errors.  CUDA 5 didn't offer a sophisticated means of automatically pinpointing the source of the error, but checking for errors after each call provided a much-needed diagnostic capability.  Assertions within the kernel, though not directly supported by the debugger, could have helped, but needed careful consideration due to the overhead.


**Example 3:  Printf Debugging (Limited Use)**

```c++
__global__ void kernel(int* data, int size){
  int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
  if (idx < size){
    if (data[idx] < 0){
      printf("Negative value detected at index: %d\n", idx);
    }
  }
}
```

`printf` statements within the kernel offered limited debugging capabilities in CUDA 5. The output would be channeled to the console, but only if the kernel was configured to allow it.   Furthermore,  the volume of output from many threads could be overwhelming and difficult to interpret.  This method was mainly suited for identifying macroscopic problems and not suitable for precise pinpointing of errors within specific threads.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA C Programming Guide, the CUDA Toolkit documentation, and the NVIDIA Nsight documentation were the essential resources.  Understanding the CUDA architecture and programming model is paramount for effective debugging.  Advanced topics such as memory management and synchronization primitives were key areas of focus during my debugging efforts.  Familiarity with tools like `nvprof` for performance profiling was also beneficial, as performance bottlenecks frequently mask underlying programming errors.  Finally,  a systematic approach to testing and unit testing was essential in isolating and resolving errors.  Thorough validation of edge cases and boundary conditions was crucial.
