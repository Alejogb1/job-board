CMake's failure to link a static CUDA library often stems from an incomplete or incorrect specification of the CUDA library's location and properties within the CMakeLists.txt file.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous high-performance computing projects has highlighted the critical role of precise target specification, particularly when dealing with static libraries that necessitate explicit linking against specific CUDA runtime components.  Ignoring the nuances of CUDA's linking requirements invariably leads to unresolved symbol errors during the build process.

The core problem lies in the distinction between the CUDA library itself (e.g., `libmycudastatic.a`) and the necessary CUDA runtime libraries.  While CMake might correctly locate your static library, it frequently fails to automatically link against the required CUDA runtime components (like `cudart_static.lib` or equivalent on your system) unless explicitly instructed. This omission results in linker errors indicating missing symbols from the CUDA runtime, even though the user-provided static library appears to be correctly included.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Successfully linking a static CUDA library within a CMake project requires a multi-step approach focusing on explicit target definition and linkage. The process involves:

* **Finding the CUDA Toolkit:** CMake needs to locate the CUDA installation directory. This is typically handled using the `find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)` command.  This command searches for the CUDA installation based on environment variables or system-specific paths.  If it fails, it's crucial to verify the CUDA toolkit installation and its visibility to the CMake build system.  Improper environment variable settings (like `CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR` or similar) are common culprits.

* **Defining a target that explicitly links against the static CUDA library and necessary runtime components:** This step is crucial.  Simply including the static library in the `target_link_libraries` command is often insufficient.  We must explicitly specify that we are linking against a *static* version of the CUDA runtime. This is generally done by using a naming convention specific to the CUDA version and build type (static vs. dynamic).  For instance,  `cudart_static` is common for the static CUDA runtime library.

* **Ensuring consistent build types:**  A mismatch between the build type of your project and the CUDA library can prevent successful linking. If your project is built in `Release` mode, the corresponding `Release` version of the CUDA static library must be used. Similarly, a `Debug` build requires the debug version of the static library.  Failure to maintain this consistency results in linker errors.

* **Handling potential path issues:**  Ensure the paths to both your static CUDA library and the CUDA toolkit are correctly specified and accessible to the CMake build system.  Relative paths are often problematic; absolute paths provide more reliability.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Linkage (Leads to linker errors):**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyCUDAProject)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

add_library(MyCUDALibrary STATIC mycudastatic.cu)
add_executable(MyCUDAExecutable main.cu)
target_link_libraries(MyCUDAExecutable MyCUDALibrary)
```

This example omits the crucial step of linking against the CUDA runtime.  The linker will fail because symbols defined in the CUDA runtime are missing.


**Example 2: Correct Linkage (Successful):**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyCUDAProject)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

add_library(MyCUDALibrary STATIC mycudastatic.cu)
add_executable(MyCUDAExecutable main.cu)
target_link_libraries(MyCUDAExecutable MyCUDALibrary ${CUDA_LIBRARIES})
```

This improves on the previous example by explicitly using `${CUDA_LIBRARIES}`, which usually includes the necessary runtime libraries if the `find_package(CUDA)` call is successful. However, this still relies on the assumption that the correct static runtime libraries are included in `CUDA_LIBRARIES`, which may not always be true, especially if you have multiple CUDA installations or non-standard configurations.


**Example 3: Explicit Static Linkage (Most Robust):**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyCUDAProject)

find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

add_library(MyCUDALibrary STATIC mycudastatic.cu)
add_executable(MyCUDAExecutable main.cu)
target_link_libraries(MyCUDAExecutable MyCUDALibrary cudart_static)
```

This version demonstrates the most robust approach.  By explicitly specifying `cudart_static`, we ensure that the static version of the CUDA runtime library is linked. This eliminates ambiguity and avoids potential issues arising from using the generic `${CUDA_LIBRARIES}` variable.  The name `cudart_static` might need adjustment based on your CUDA version and the exact naming convention used in your installation. Consult the CUDA documentation for precise naming if needed.  Remember to use the corresponding debug version (`cudart_static_debug`) if compiling in debug mode.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting the official CUDA Toolkit documentation, particularly the sections covering CMake integration and library linking.  Reviewing CMake's documentation on `find_package`, `add_library`, and `target_link_libraries` commands is also beneficial.  Finally, studying examples of CUDA projects using CMake within the CUDA samples directory will provide practical insights and illustrate best practices.  Careful examination of the build logs, especially linker error messages, often reveals the root cause of these linking problems.  Pay close attention to the unresolved symbols reported; they directly pinpoint the missing components from the CUDA runtime.  Thoroughly reviewing these resources, combined with systematic debugging, is crucial for resolving these CMake-related linking issues.
