TensorFlow's inherent flexibility allows for the creation of tensors with varying row dimensions, a capability crucial for handling irregularly shaped data common in real-world applications.  My experience working on large-scale natural language processing projects, specifically those involving variable-length sequences, highlighted the importance of understanding this feature.  Directly manipulating tensor shapes at the creation stage is far more efficient than attempting post-hoc reshaping, especially with substantial datasets.  This response details how to achieve this, focusing on fundamental approaches.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core concept revolves around leveraging TensorFlow's dynamic shape capabilities.  Static shape definition, while convenient, limits the ability to handle tensors where the number of rows is not known beforehand or varies across examples.  To create tensors with varying row dimensions, we must utilize placeholder mechanisms that accommodate these variations.  This is achieved primarily through two approaches:  1) using `tf.RaggedTensor`, designed specifically for handling ragged, i.e., variable-length, data, and 2) creating a dynamically shaped tensor using `tf.Tensor` with a shape specification that includes a dimension of unknown size, represented by `None`.  The optimal method depends on the specific application and the nature of the variability in row dimensions.  If the variations are solely due to missing data points, padding might be a more practical solution before tensor creation. However, for inherently variable-length data, `tf.RaggedTensor` provides a more elegant and computationally efficient solution.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: Utilizing `tf.RaggedTensor`**

This example demonstrates the creation of a `tf.RaggedTensor` from a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row with a potentially different length:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

ragged_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]
ragged_tensor = tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_splits(
    values=tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]),
    row_splits=[0, 3, 5, 9]
)

print(ragged_tensor)
# Output: <tf.RaggedTensor [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]>

# Accessing elements:
print(ragged_tensor[0]) # Output: tf.Tensor([1 2 3], shape=(3,), dtype=int32)
print(ragged_tensor[1]) # Output: tf.Tensor([4 5], shape=(2,), dtype=int32)

#Further processing using tf.ragged.map_fn
processed_tensor = tf.ragged.map_fn(lambda x: tf.reduce_sum(x), ragged_tensor)
print(processed_tensor) # Output: <tf.RaggedTensor [[6], [9], [30]]>

```

This code clearly illustrates the creation of a `tf.RaggedTensor` from a list of lists, showcasing how `row_splits` defines the boundaries between rows.  The subsequent access and processing demonstrate the capability to seamlessly handle the variable row lengths.  `tf.ragged.map_fn` is particularly useful for applying element-wise operations to ragged tensors.  This avoids the performance overhead associated with padding and the complexity of managing masked values.


**Example 2:  Dynamically Shaped `tf.Tensor` using `None`**

This approach creates a tensor with a partially defined shape, using `None` to represent the unknown row dimension.  This is suitable when the number of rows is determined during runtime or when dealing with data streams where the number of rows is not fixed in advance.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Placeholder for a dataset with unknown number of rows but 3 columns.
dynamic_tensor = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 3])

#Simulate data acquisition:
dataset = [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]]
feed_dict = {dynamic_tensor: dataset}

#Performing operations on the dynamic tensor requires a session.
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(tf.reduce_sum(dynamic_tensor, axis=0), feed_dict=feed_dict)
    print(result) #Output: [12. 15. 18.]

```

This example showcases the creation of a placeholder tensor with an undefined number of rows.  The placeholder is subsequently fed data in a `feed_dict` within a TensorFlow session.  This approach maintains flexibility, allowing the tensor to adapt to datasets of varying row sizes. Note the use of `tf.compat.v1.Session()` which is necessary because `tf.placeholder` is deprecated in TensorFlow 2.x.  The equivalent approach in 2.x would involve using `tf.function` or `tf.data.Dataset` for more dynamic data handling.


**Example 3: Combining RaggedTensors and standard Tensor operations**

This example demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate `tf.RaggedTensor` with standard TensorFlow operations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

ragged_tensor = tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_splits(values=tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), row_splits=[0, 2, 5])
dense_tensor = tf.constant([[6, 7], [8, 9], [10, 11]])

#Concatenate with tf.concat. Requires ragged_tensor to be converted to a tensor with padding.
padded_tensor = ragged_tensor.to_tensor(default_value=0)
combined_tensor = tf.concat([padded_tensor, dense_tensor], axis=0)

print(combined_tensor)
#Output: tf.Tensor(
#[[ 1  2  0]
# [ 3  4  0]
# [ 5  0  0]
# [ 6  7]
# [ 8  9]
# [10 11]], shape=(6, 2), dtype=int32)

```

This illustrates the ability to convert a `tf.RaggedTensor` into a standard tensor with padding using `.to_tensor()`. This allows for seamless integration with functions that require dense tensors, demonstrating the practical flexibility offered by TensorFlow's handling of varying row dimensions.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is invaluable.  Supplement this with a well-regarded textbook on deep learning focusing on TensorFlow's practical applications.  A deep understanding of linear algebra and matrix operations is fundamental.  Consider consulting advanced programming guides focused on TensorFlow's API for more nuanced operations and performance optimization techniques relevant to handling large-scale datasets.  Finally, explore articles and tutorials focusing specifically on handling variable-length sequences in deep learning models; this will help contextualize the application of the techniques described above.
