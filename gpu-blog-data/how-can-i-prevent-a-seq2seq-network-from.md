The core issue of repetitive word generation in Seq2Seq models stems from the inherent limitations of the softmax layer during decoding.  The probability distribution over the vocabulary, generated at each timestep, often assigns disproportionately high probabilities to previously generated words, leading to repetitive sequences. This isn't a bug; it's a direct consequence of the model's training process and the architecture's biases.  My experience working on large-scale machine translation tasks has shown that addressing this requires a multifaceted approach beyond simply adjusting hyperparameters.

**1. Explanation: Addressing Repetitive Word Generation in Seq2Seq Models**

Repetitive outputs in Seq2Seq models are primarily attributed to two intertwined phenomena:  exposure bias and the lack of sufficient diversity in the probability distribution during decoding. Exposure bias arises because the model is trained on teacher-forcing, where the ground truth sequence is fed as input during training.  This creates a discrepancy between training and inference. During inference, the model receives its own predictions as input, leading to error propagation and increased likelihood of repeating words since the network hasn't encountered this scenario extensively during training.

Furthermore, the softmax layer, responsible for generating the probability distribution over the vocabulary, can get stuck in local optima, assigning excessively high probability to a limited subset of words, including those already generated.  This lack of diversity in the probability distribution exacerbates the repetition problem.

Effectively mitigating this necessitates strategies that address both exposure bias and probability distribution diversity.  These strategies typically fall into three categories:  training adjustments, decoding strategies, and architectural modifications.

Training adjustments focus on reducing exposure bias.  Techniques like scheduled sampling, which gradually transitions from teacher-forcing to using model predictions as input, can help.  Similarly, reinforcement learning approaches can fine-tune the model to directly optimize for fluency and avoid repetitions.

Decoding strategies directly modify how the model generates the output sequence.  Beam search, with its capacity to explore multiple hypotheses simultaneously, often offers improved fluency compared to greedy decoding.  Furthermore, techniques like temperature scaling (controlling the sharpness of the probability distribution), and top-k sampling (restricting the sampling to the k most probable words) can enhance diversity and prevent repetition.

Finally, architectural modifications, such as incorporating attention mechanisms that focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, can provide more context for the decoder, thus mitigating the tendency to rely on previously generated words.  Furthermore, exploring alternative architectures beyond the basic encoder-decoder design, such as Transformer-based models, often demonstrates superior performance in handling repetition.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate some of these strategies within a TensorFlow/Keras context.  Note that these snippets focus on the core principles and may require adjustments for specific dataset and model configurations.

**Example 1: Scheduled Sampling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def scheduled_sampling(decoder_inputs, targets, training, sampling_probability):
  """Implements scheduled sampling during training.

  Args:
    decoder_inputs: Input tensor for the decoder.
    targets: Target tensor for the decoder.
    training: Boolean tensor indicating training mode.
    sampling_probability: Probability of using model predictions instead of targets.

  Returns:
    Sampled decoder inputs.
  """
  sampled_inputs = tf.cond(training,
                          lambda: tf.where(tf.random.uniform(tf.shape(targets)) < sampling_probability,
                                           decoder_inputs, targets),
                          lambda: decoder_inputs) # Inference: always use decoder_inputs
  return sampled_inputs

# ... within your training loop ...
sampling_probability = tf.cast(tf.maximum(0.0, 1.0 - epoch / total_epochs), dtype=tf.float32) # Example schedule
sampled_inputs = scheduled_sampling(decoder_inputs, targets, training=True, sampling_probability=sampling_probability)
# ...rest of your training loop...
```

This code snippet demonstrates scheduled sampling, gradually shifting from teacher forcing to self-prediction. The `sampling_probability` controls the transition rate.


**Example 2: Temperature Scaling during Decoding**

```python
import numpy as np

def temperature_scaling(logits, temperature):
  """Applies temperature scaling to logits.

  Args:
    logits: Logits tensor from the decoder.
    temperature: Scaling temperature (higher values increase diversity).

  Returns:
    Scaled logits.
  """
  scaled_logits = logits / temperature
  return scaled_logits

# ... during inference ...
logits = model.predict(input_sequence)
scaled_logits = temperature_scaling(logits, temperature=0.8) # Example temperature
predictions = tf.argmax(scaled_logits, axis=-1) #Adjust as needed for sampling strategy
```

This snippet incorporates temperature scaling to control the sharpness of the probability distribution. A lower temperature makes the prediction more confident (less diverse), while a higher temperature increases diversity.


**Example 3: Top-k Sampling**

```python
import numpy as np

def top_k_sampling(logits, k):
  """Performs top-k sampling.

  Args:
    logits: Logits tensor from the decoder.
    k: Number of top words to consider.

  Returns:
    Sampled word indices.
  """
  values, indices = tf.math.top_k(logits, k=k)
  probabilities = tf.nn.softmax(values)
  sampled_index = tf.random.categorical(tf.math.log(probabilities), num_samples=1)
  return tf.gather(indices, sampled_index, axis=-1)


# ... during inference ...
logits = model.predict(input_sequence)
sampled_indices = top_k_sampling(logits, k=10) # Example k value
```

Top-k sampling restricts the sampling process to the k most likely words, effectively limiting the model's choices and potentially preventing repetitive word generation.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting research papers on Seq2Seq models, specifically those addressing the issue of repetitive outputs.  Look for publications focusing on scheduled sampling, reinforcement learning for Seq2Seq, attention mechanisms in Seq2Seq, and different decoding strategies like beam search and diverse sampling techniques.  Textbooks on deep learning and natural language processing often cover these concepts extensively.  Furthermore, exploring the source code of established Seq2Seq implementations can provide valuable insights into practical application of these techniques.  Studying the design choices made in these implementations offers valuable practical context.
