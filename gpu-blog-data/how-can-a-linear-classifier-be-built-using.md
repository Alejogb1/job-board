The core challenge in building a linear classifier with Keras lies in appropriately configuring the final layer to produce a single output representing the class probability, especially when dealing with multi-class problems.  My experience building recommendation systems for e-commerce platforms highlighted this point repeatedly:  incorrectly specifying the activation function and loss function frequently led to suboptimal performance.  Therefore, a precise understanding of these components is paramount.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

A linear classifier aims to find a linear decision boundary that optimally separates data points into different classes.  In Keras, this is achieved through a neural network with a single layer of weights (excluding the bias term which is implicitly handled within the layer).  The input data is multiplied by the weights, summed, and passed through an activation function to produce the class prediction. The choice of activation function and loss function is dictated by the nature of the classification problem (binary vs. multi-class).

For binary classification (two classes), the final layer typically uses a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function.  The sigmoid function outputs a probability between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of the input belonging to the positive class.  The binary cross-entropy loss function is then used to measure the difference between the predicted probability and the true label (0 or 1).

For multi-class classification (more than two classes), the final layer employs multiple neurons, one for each class. The number of neurons in the output layer equals the number of classes. A softmax activation function is applied to these outputs, transforming them into probabilities that sum to 1. Each probability represents the likelihood of the input belonging to a particular class.  Categorical cross-entropy is the appropriate loss function for multi-class problems.  Note that the output layer's dimension should explicitly match the number of classes; using a dense layer with incorrect dimensionality will lead to errors.

Optimization is typically handled using gradient descent-based optimizers like Adam or SGD, implemented within Keras's `compile` function.  These optimizers iteratively adjust the weights to minimize the chosen loss function, improving the classifier's accuracy.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Binary Classification**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])
y = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(2,))) # Single neuron, sigmoid activation

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.01),
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0) # Train the model

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X, y, verbose=0)
print(f"Loss: {loss:.4f}, Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

This example demonstrates a binary classifier. The `Dense` layer has one neuron (`units=1`) with a sigmoid activation function. The input shape is specified as `(2,)` for two features. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. The training process and evaluation are then executed.


**Example 2: Multi-class Classification (One-hot encoding)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9,10], [11,12]])
y = np.array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])
y = to_categorical(y, num_classes=3) # One-hot encode the labels

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax', input_shape=(2,))) # Three neurons, softmax activation

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.01),
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, verbose=0)

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X, y, verbose=0)
print(f"Loss: {loss:.4f}, Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

This builds a multi-class classifier.  Crucially, `to_categorical` converts the integer labels into a one-hot encoded representation, which is required for categorical cross-entropy.  The output layer has three neurons, one for each class, and uses the softmax activation.


**Example 3: Multi-class Classification (Label Encoding)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9,10], [11,12]])
y = np.array(['red', 'green', 'blue', 'red', 'green', 'blue'])

label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
y_encoded = label_encoder.fit_transform(y) # Label encode the classes

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax', input_shape=(2,)))

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.01),
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X, y_encoded, epochs=100, verbose=0)

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X, y_encoded, verbose=0)
print(f"Loss: {loss:.4f}, Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

```

This demonstrates multi-class classification using label encoding.  `LabelEncoder` converts string labels into numerical representations.  `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` is used as the loss function, avoiding the need for one-hot encoding.  This approach is computationally less expensive than one-hot encoding for large datasets with many classes.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The Keras documentation, specifically the sections on sequential models, layers, and activation functions.
*   A comprehensive textbook on machine learning, focusing on linear classifiers and neural networks.
*   Practical guides on data preprocessing techniques, particularly for handling categorical features.


This detailed explanation, along with the provided examples and resource suggestions, should comprehensively address the construction of linear classifiers using Keras.  Remember to always carefully consider your data's characteristics and choose the appropriate activation and loss functions to ensure optimal model performance.  Proper data preprocessing, including scaling and handling missing values, is also crucial for achieving satisfactory results.
