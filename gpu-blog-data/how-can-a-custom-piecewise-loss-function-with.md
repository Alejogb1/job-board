Implementing a custom piecewise loss function with three variables in TensorFlow Keras requires a deep understanding of Keras's custom loss function capabilities and a careful consideration of numerical stability.  My experience optimizing loss functions for large-scale image recognition models has highlighted the importance of vectorization and efficient gradient computation in this context.  The core challenge lies in defining the piecewise function accurately and ensuring its differentiability for effective backpropagation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A piecewise loss function is defined by different mathematical expressions across various intervals or regions of its input space.  In this case, we have three variables, let's denote them as `x`, `y`, and `z`. The function's output will depend on the values of these variables.  The critical step is to define these intervals and the corresponding loss expressions within each interval.  Once these are determined, the function can be implemented in Keras using the `tf.where` conditional operator for efficient piecewise evaluation.  The gradients are then automatically computed using TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities.  However, care must be taken to ensure the function is differentiable at the boundaries of the intervals to avoid numerical instability during training. This might necessitate smoothing techniques around these boundaries, depending on the nature of the piecewise function.

The process generally involves:

1. **Defining the Piecewise Function:** Specify the intervals and corresponding expressions for `x`, `y`, and `z`.  Each expression should be mathematically sound and differentiable (or at least subdifferentiable) everywhere.
2. **Implementing in TensorFlow:** Use `tf.where` or similar conditional statements within a custom Keras loss function to evaluate the correct expression based on the input variables.  TensorFlow's automatic differentiation will handle gradient calculations.
3. **Testing and Validation:** Thoroughly test the custom loss function with sample inputs and gradients to ensure its correctness and numerical stability.  Monitoring gradients during training can reveal potential issues.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Piecewise Function**

This example demonstrates a piecewise function where the loss depends on the value of `x`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def piecewise_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    x = y_pred[:, 0]  # Assuming x is the first element in y_pred
    y = y_pred[:, 1]
    z = y_pred[:, 2]

    loss1 = tf.abs(x - y_true) # Loss when x < 5
    loss2 = tf.square(x - y_true) # Loss when 5 <= x < 10
    loss3 = tf.multiply(5, tf.abs(x - y_true)) # Loss when x >= 10

    loss = tf.where(x < 5, loss1, tf.where(x < 10, loss2, loss3))
    return loss

# Example usage (replace with your actual data)
y_true = np.array([[1], [6], [11]])
y_pred = np.array([[2, 0, 0], [7, 0, 0], [12, 0, 0]])
loss = piecewise_loss(y_true, y_pred)
print(loss)

model.compile(loss=piecewise_loss, optimizer='adam')
```

This code defines three loss expressions based on thresholds for `x`.  `tf.where` selects the appropriate expression.  Note that `y` and `z` are currently unused, demonstrating the flexibility to expand the function's complexity.  The example usage shows how to integrate this loss into a Keras model's compilation.


**Example 2:  Function with Multiple Variable Dependencies**

This example introduces dependence on `y` and `z`, making the function more intricate.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def multi_variable_piecewise_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    x = y_pred[:, 0]
    y = y_pred[:, 1]
    z = y_pred[:, 2]

    condition1 = tf.logical_and(x < 5, y > 2)
    condition2 = tf.logical_and(x >= 5, z < 1)
    condition3 = tf.logical_not(tf.logical_or(condition1, condition2))

    loss1 = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(y_true - x*y))
    loss2 = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_true - z))
    loss3 = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_true - (x + y + z)))

    loss = tf.where(condition1, loss1, tf.where(condition2, loss2, loss3))
    return loss


```

This illustrates a more complex scenario where the loss selection depends on multiple conditions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`.  Logical operations (`tf.logical_and`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.logical_not`) are employed to define the regions.  The example also shows different aggregation methods (`tf.reduce_sum`, `tf.reduce_mean`) within each region, providing flexibility in how the individual losses are combined.


**Example 3: Smooth Piecewise Function**

This addresses potential differentiability issues at interval boundaries using a sigmoid-based smoothing function.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def smooth_piecewise_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    x = y_pred[:, 0]
    y = y_pred[:, 1]
    z = y_pred[:, 2]

    # Smooth transition using sigmoid
    transition1 = tf.sigmoid((x - 5) * 10) # Adjust 10 for steepness
    transition2 = tf.sigmoid((x - 10) * 10)

    loss1 = tf.abs(x - y_true)
    loss2 = tf.square(x - y_true)
    loss3 = tf.multiply(5, tf.abs(x - y_true))

    loss = (1 - transition1) * loss1 + transition1 * (1 - transition2) * loss2 + transition2 * loss3
    return loss
```


In this improved example, sigmoid functions are introduced to create a smooth transition between the different loss expressions.  The parameter multiplying the difference (`(x - 5) * 10`) controls the sharpness of the transition. A sharper transition approximates the original piecewise function closely, while a gentler transition provides better differentiability. This helps mitigate potential gradient instability, particularly crucial when training complex models.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   **TensorFlow Documentation:** The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on custom loss functions, automatic differentiation, and tensor operations.  Study the sections on custom layers and models for a thorough understanding.
*   **Advanced Topics in Machine Learning:** Look for texts covering advanced optimization techniques, including those related to loss function design and gradient-based optimization.  These often contain valuable insights into numerical stability and efficient computation.
*   **Numerical Optimization Texts:**  A solid grasp of numerical optimization techniques is vital for creating well-behaved loss functions.  These resources can provide a theoretical background, useful for troubleshooting training difficulties.


Remember to always rigorously test your custom loss function.  Visualizing the loss surface (if feasible for your dimensionality) can be incredibly valuable in identifying potential issues.  Careful consideration of numerical stability and differentiability is critical for successful training with custom loss functions in Keras.
