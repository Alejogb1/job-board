The core challenge when facing TensorFlow summary issues typically stems from a disconnect between the intended scope of data collection and the actual computational graph within which summaries are being generated. Over several projects involving complex neural network architectures and distributed training, I’ve observed this manifestation most often as either no summaries being written at all, or summaries containing nonsensical values. This almost always boils down to incorrect placement of the summary operations within the graph, their association with specific computational nodes, and the context within which the summary writer operates.

Let's consider the foundational concepts. TensorFlow’s summary system relies on `tf.summary.*` operations. These operations are, fundamentally, computational nodes that emit summary data. This data, which may be scalar values, histograms, images, or audio clips, is recorded when the operation is *executed*. Critically, this execution only happens during a `sess.run()` call, not when they are merely *defined* within the TensorFlow graph. Thus, the presence of a `tf.summary.*` node in your model architecture is insufficient to guarantee that the summary data will be written to disk. Furthermore, the `tf.summary.FileWriter` instance is responsible for taking that generated summary data and writing it to the specified log directory, which allows it to be visualized by TensorBoard. The association between summary operations and the file writer is usually established through `tf.summary.merge_all()` or manually merging specific summary operations. If these associations are not correctly formed, the summaries simply won't be written.

I’ve seen three major categories of issues causing summary writing failures: 1) incorrect merging and execution, 2) improper scopes in distributed training, and 3) inconsistencies in the summary writer's setup. Let's explore these, alongside concrete examples of how I’ve addressed them.

First, consider a scenario where I had meticulously defined several scalar summaries, intending to track the loss and accuracy during training of a small convolutional network. The initial code, in its simplified form, looked something like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume placeholders x and y, and network definition (model) are in place
def model(x):
  # Simplified convnet model here
  W1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([5, 5, 3, 16]))
  b1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([16]))
  conv1 = tf.nn.conv2d(x, W1, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME') + b1
  relu1 = tf.nn.relu(conv1)
  flat = tf.reshape(relu1, [-1, 7 * 7 * 16])
  W2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([7 * 7 * 16, 10]))
  b2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([10]))
  output = tf.matmul(flat, W2) + b2
  return output
# placeholder definitions
x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 28, 28, 3])
y = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.int32, [None])
# model
logits = model(x)

# Simplified loss and accuracy
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y, logits=logits))
accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.equal(tf.argmax(logits, axis=1), tf.cast(y, tf.int64)), tf.float32))

# Define summaries
tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar('loss', loss)
tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar('accuracy', accuracy)

# Optimizer definition
optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.AdamOptimizer(0.001).minimize(loss)

# FileWriter setup
summary_writer = tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter('./logs', tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph())

# Assume the session and training loop are in place but with no summary merge or execution
```
While this code defined the `tf.summary.scalar` operations, it failed to actually collect and write any data. The problem was the absence of merging the summaries and the corresponding `sess.run()` call to execute them. The code, after fixing this problem, should resemble this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume placeholders x and y, and network definition (model) are in place
def model(x):
  # Simplified convnet model here
  W1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([5, 5, 3, 16]))
  b1 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([16]))
  conv1 = tf.nn.conv2d(x, W1, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME') + b1
  relu1 = tf.nn.relu(conv1)
  flat = tf.reshape(relu1, [-1, 7 * 7 * 16])
  W2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([7 * 7 * 16, 10]))
  b2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([10]))
  output = tf.matmul(flat, W2) + b2
  return output
# placeholder definitions
x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 28, 28, 3])
y = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.int32, [None])
# model
logits = model(x)

# Simplified loss and accuracy
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y, logits=logits))
accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.equal(tf.argmax(logits, axis=1), tf.cast(y, tf.int64)), tf.float32))

# Define summaries
tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar('loss', loss)
tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar('accuracy', accuracy)
# Merge all summaries
merged_summaries = tf.compat.v1.summary.merge_all()

# Optimizer definition
optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.AdamOptimizer(0.001).minimize(loss)

# FileWriter setup
summary_writer = tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter('./logs', tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph())
# Assume session and training loop are place, within which the following lines are included
# summary_str = sess.run(merged_summaries, feed_dict={x: batch_x, y: batch_y})
# summary_writer.add_summary(summary_str, i)
# optimizer.run(feed_dict={x:batch_x, y: batch_y})

```

The fix is straightforward: I merged all summaries using `tf.compat.v1.summary.merge_all()` into `merged_summaries`, and during training, the summaries were executed via `sess.run(merged_summaries, feed_dict=feed_dict)` and the output was written via `summary_writer.add_summary(summary_str, i)` within the training loop.  This ensures that summaries are generated during the computational process.

Secondly, in a distributed training environment, such as when using `tf.distribute.Strategy`, I often encountered issues with summaries if they weren't carefully scoped. Consider a scenario where different workers were creating their own summary writers, leading to conflicts and incomplete logs. The faulty code structure often looked like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# Assume strategies and other setup are defined

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
    # Assume model, loss, and other setup within the strategy scope are present
    # Model (a function called model) is defined above
    x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 28, 28, 3])
    y = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.int32, [None])
    logits = model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y, logits=logits))
    accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.equal(tf.argmax(logits, axis=1), tf.cast(y, tf.int64)), tf.float32))
    #Incorrect summary writer placement
    summary_writer = tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter('./logs')
    tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar('loss', loss)
    tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar('accuracy', accuracy)
    merged_summaries = tf.compat.v1.summary.merge_all()
    optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.AdamOptimizer(0.001).minimize(loss)

# Training loop execution assumed
```

The root problem here is that, each worker within the distributed strategy scope would create an independent `FileWriter` instance in the same log directory, often overwriting each other's data. The fix is to create the summary writer instance *outside* the strategy's scope, allowing a single writer to collect summaries from all replicas:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# Assume strategies and other setup are defined

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
#Correct summary writer placement
summary_writer = tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter('./logs')


with strategy.scope():
    # Assume model, loss, and other setup within the strategy scope are present
    # Model (a function called model) is defined above
    x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 28, 28, 3])
    y = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.int32, [None])
    logits = model(x)
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y, logits=logits))
    accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(tf.equal(tf.argmax(logits, axis=1), tf.cast(y, tf.int64)), tf.float32))
    tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar('loss', loss)
    tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar('accuracy', accuracy)
    merged_summaries = tf.compat.v1.summary.merge_all()
    optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.AdamOptimizer(0.001).minimize(loss)
# Training loop execution assumed, including summary_str = sess.run(merged_summaries, feed_dict={x: batch_x, y: batch_y}); summary_writer.add_summary(summary_str, i)
```

Moving the `FileWriter` creation outside the strategy scope guarantees there's only one summary writer handling all data coming from the synchronized training step. This approach prevents data corruption.

Finally, another frequent issue I’ve addressed is the incorrect configuration of the `FileWriter` itself. I've seen scenarios where either the log directory was not created, or the file writing permissions were not sufficient, leading to silent failures. Sometimes, the `FileWriter` instance was created but the actual flush or close methods were missing from the training loop, resulting in buffered data not being written to disk. This is generally a straightforward error to fix but can be easily overlooked.

In essence, resolving TensorFlow summary issues requires a thorough understanding of the computational graph’s execution, how to appropriately merge summary operations, and the correct scope when working with distributed strategies. The setup of the `FileWriter` itself is also crucial. For additional learning, I recommend exploring TensorFlow's official documentation on summaries and TensorBoard. Furthermore, the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" offers a thorough practical guide. Finally, research papers concerning distributed training with TensorFlow, especially those utilizing `tf.distribute`, may prove useful. Careful debugging and experimentation are key to establishing consistent summary generation.
