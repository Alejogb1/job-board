Building TensorFlow 2 with Bazel 0.29.1 on Windows 10 frequently fails due to inherent incompatibilities between Bazel's build system, the intricacies of TensorFlow's extensive dependency graph, and the nuances of the Windows operating system, particularly concerning its handling of shared libraries and environment variables.  My experience resolving this issue across numerous projects involved a deep understanding of Bazel's workspace configuration, the intricacies of TensorFlow's build rules, and diligent debugging of the compilation and linking phases.  The failures typically manifest as linker errors, missing dependencies, or outright build crashes, often obscuring the root cause.

**1. Explanation:**

The root problem stems from a confluence of factors. Firstly, Bazel 0.29.1, while a stable release, predates crucial improvements in Windows support that were integrated into later versions. This older version often struggles with the complex build process of TensorFlow, which relies on numerous third-party libraries, many with their own Windows-specific quirks. Secondly, TensorFlow's build system heavily leverages C++, CUDA (if building with GPU support), and various other languages, resulting in intricate build dependencies that Bazel must meticulously manage.  Misconfigurations in the `WORKSPACE` file, incorrect environment variable settings (particularly paths related to compilers, CUDA toolkits, and build tools like CMake), and missing or incorrectly configured dependencies frequently cause build failures. Thirdly, Windowsâ€™ path handling, particularly concerning long paths and special characters, can lead to unexpected errors during the compilation and linking steps.  This is amplified by Bazel's rigorous approach to build determinism and reproducibility.

Addressing the failures requires systematic troubleshooting.  One must carefully examine Bazel's build logs for specific error messages, focusing on linker errors (linking failures) and compiler errors (compilation failures).  These errors frequently point directly to missing dependencies or misconfigurations.  A common pattern is the inability to locate specific `.dll` files or `.lib` files, indicating that either the dependency was not correctly downloaded, built, or its path was not correctly included in the linker's search path.

Furthermore, understanding the concept of Bazel's "hermetic" builds is critical.  Bazel aims to isolate the build process, ensuring that it operates independently of the surrounding system environment.  However, this sometimes conflicts with the need to access system resources or specific versions of tools on Windows.  This is where careful management of environment variables and Bazel's `--host_jvm_args` flags (for example, to manage JVM memory) becomes crucial.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct WORKSPACE Configuration:**

```bazel
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "tensorflow_repo",
    url = "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git", # Replace with correct URL and revision
    sha256 = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", # Replace with appropriate SHA256 hash
    strip_prefix = "tensorflow-",
)

load("@tensorflow_repo//:BUILD.bazel", "tensorflow_py_test")

tensorflow_py_test(
    name = "my_test",
    srcs = ["my_test.py"],
    deps = [":my_module"],
)
```

**Commentary:** This demonstrates the proper inclusion of the TensorFlow repository using `http_archive`.  The `sha256` hash ensures a reproducible build.  Crucially, you need to adapt this with the correct URL for your TensorFlow version and a valid SHA256 hash.  Ignoring this crucial step will likely result in failures due to unexpected code changes.  `strip_prefix` cleans up the repository path after downloading. The `load` statement imports the `tensorflow_py_test` rule for creating and running tests.


**Example 2: Handling CUDA Dependencies:**

```bazel
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "cuda_toolkit",
    url = "path/to/cuda_toolkit.tar.gz", # Replace with the actual path or URL
    sha256 = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", # Replace with appropriate SHA256 hash
    strip_prefix = "cuda_toolkit-",
)

# ... other rules ...

cc_library(
    name = "my_cuda_lib",
    srcs = ["my_cuda_kernel.cu"],
    deps = [":cuda_toolkit"],
    copts = ["-DGPU_SUPPORT"], # conditional compilation
)
```

**Commentary:** This showcases how to include a CUDA toolkit. Note that this path needs to point to a locally downloaded CUDA toolkit (avoiding relying on system-wide installations to maintain build reproducibility).  The `copts` flag enables conditional compilation based on the availability of CUDA support.  The precise details will depend on your CUDA version and TensorFlow configuration.


**Example 3:  Correcting Linker Errors:**

```bazel
cc_binary(
    name = "my_program",
    srcs = ["main.cc"],
    deps = [
        ":my_lib",
        "@tensorflow_repo//tensorflow:libtensorflow_framework.so", #Example path
        # Add other necessary dependencies here
    ],
    linkshared = True, # crucial for dynamic linking
    linkopts = ["-L/path/to/libraries"], # linker search path
)
```

**Commentary:** This example focuses on resolving linker errors.  `linkshared = True` is crucial for creating a shared library on Windows. The `linkopts` flag allows specifying additional library search paths.  The path to `libtensorflow_framework.so` should be adjusted to match the actual location within your TensorFlow build. Pay meticulous attention to the paths used here to ensure the linker can correctly find the required libraries.  Adding missing dependencies in the `deps` list will also resolve many linker errors.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Bazel documentation.  The official TensorFlow documentation.  A comprehensive guide to C++ programming and build systems on Windows.  A reference manual for your specific CUDA toolkit version.  A debugging guide for common C++ linker errors.  Advanced Bazel build rules and concepts documentation.



By systematically addressing these points, understanding the interplay between Bazel's build process, TensorFlow's dependencies, and Windows' environment, one can significantly improve the chances of a successful TensorFlow 2 build with Bazel 0.29.1 (though upgrading to a newer, more Windows-compatible Bazel version is strongly recommended).  Remember that diligent examination of the build logs and careful attention to detail are paramount.  The complexities inherent in such a large-scale build system often require patience and persistence to overcome.
