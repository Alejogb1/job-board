In PyTorch, modifying a tensor directly, instead of creating a new tensor from an operation, can introduce complications during backpropagation, leading to errors or incorrect gradient calculations. This arises because PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine (autograd) relies on a computational graph to track operations and their dependencies to calculate gradients. In-place operations disrupt this graph, causing issues when gradients are backpropagated from later parts of the graph.

The autograd engine operates by recording operations performed on tensors that have `requires_grad=True`. These tensors become nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). When a function is executed, information about that function and the input tensors is added to the graph as a new node and edges from the inputs to this new node, so it can be later used during the backward pass. When backpropagation is initiated (by calling `.backward()`), autograd traverses this graph from the output tensor(s) back to the input tensors with `requires_grad=True`, applying the chain rule to compute gradients. Crucially, autograd assumes that tensors are immutable, or at least they will not be modified until their corresponding gradients are calculated. In-place operations break this immutability assumption.

Specifically, in-place operations modify the data contained within a tensor, overwriting prior values. If an in-place operation is performed on a tensor that is part of the computational graph, autograd's saved information of the forward pass is invalidated, meaning the recorded intermediary values needed for backward pass are overwritten. If autograd then tries to compute gradients based on these now-modified tensors and the outdated graph, it can produce incorrect gradient results or, in some cases, trigger errors. These errors usually involve an attempt to access a tensor value that has been overwritten, often manifesting as a "RuntimeError: one of the variables needed for gradient computation has been modified by an inplace operation".

Let’s consider some specific examples. The first involves simple addition.

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x + 2  # Operation, creates a new tensor.
y.sum().backward()
print(x.grad) # Correct gradient output of [1., 1.]

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=True)
x += 2   # In-place addition
y = x  
y.sum().backward() # Runtime Error thrown because the original x is modified in-place
# Attempting gradient computation throws a RuntimeError
```

In the first scenario, a new tensor `y` is created by adding 2 to `x`. Autograd correctly tracks this and calculates the gradient of `y.sum()` with respect to `x` during backpropagation. In the second scenario, `x += 2` modifies the tensor `x` in-place. When `y = x` is defined, `y` points to the modified tensor. When `y.sum().backward()` is called, autograd attempts to recompute the chain rule using recorded values of x in the forward pass, these values are no longer correct, and thus results in a run-time error. The in-place operation breaks the dependency graph.

Another common example where this issue arises is with functions that have an in-place variant. Many PyTorch operations have equivalent functions ending in an underscore, such as `.add_()` instead of `.add()`. These underscore variants perform the operation in-place.

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x.add(2) # Out-of-place addition
y.sum().backward() # Correct gradient computed
print(x.grad) # Correct gradient output of [1., 1.]

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=True)
x.add_(2)  # In-place addition
y = x
y.sum().backward() # RuntimeError because we have modified the input tensor x in-place, affecting the dependency graph
```
Here, `x.add(2)` creates a new tensor, preserving the computational graph. Conversely, `x.add_(2)` modifies x in-place, leading to the same issues seen earlier when the gradients are computed.

A third, slightly more complex, example often occurs within a loop, or in a sequence of operations, or as an accumulation within a function. Consider the following illustrative loop, where an in-place operation is performed:

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(2, 2, requires_grad=True)
total = torch.zeros_like(x)

for i in range(5):
  total.add_(x * i)

loss = total.sum()
loss.backward() # Runtime Error when computing the gradients, the original 'x' has been modified in-place
```

In the provided code snippet, the tensor `total` is initialized as a zero-tensor, and then updated using the in-place function `add_`. Because we are updating the `total` tensor in-place at each iteration, each `total` is not a new tensor but instead the same underlying memory space, overwritten repeatedly. This invalidates any graph that the autograd engine has kept track of. The backpropagation will thus produce an error when gradients are computed with `loss.backward()`.

To resolve these issues, it is essential to avoid in-place operations on tensors that are part of the computational graph, specifically when tensors have `requires_grad = True`. Instead, create new tensors from operations. For example, instead of `x += 2`, use `x = x + 2`. Or, replace `x.add_(2)` with `x = x.add(2)`. Likewise, we can avoid the in-place accumulation by creating a new accumulation within the loop.

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(2, 2, requires_grad=True)
total = torch.zeros_like(x)

for i in range(5):
  total = total + (x * i) # Corrected accumulation with out-of-place operation

loss = total.sum()
loss.backward() # Gradients are computed successfully
print(x.grad) # Gradients are now correctly computed.
```

By creating new tensor at each step, each `total` tensor is a distinct value derived from the input `x` and the loop variable `i`, which allows the autograd engine to correctly compute and backpropagate the gradient. Note that there are occasions where in-place operations are unavoidable for performance reasons, especially when memory constraints are a concern, but in those cases, one will have to carefully manage and disable the autograd context.

In summary, while in-place operations can offer advantages, especially in terms of memory efficiency, they can disrupt PyTorch’s autograd mechanism by modifying tensor data that autograd relies on, resulting in incorrect gradient calculations or run-time errors. When using PyTorch, the best practice to avoid such issues is to always prefer out-of-place operations unless explicit control of the gradient calculation is needed using context management. For further understanding of this topic, I recommend reviewing PyTorch's official documentation on automatic differentiation, as well as resources that discuss computational graph concepts. Also beneficial is reviewing resources related to tensor immutability and the mechanics of backpropagation. The principles discussed here are fundamental to correctly training neural networks in PyTorch and understanding these details prevents hard to debug errors.
