The root cause of the "no such module 'TensorFlowLite'" error in Swift projects typically stems from an incomplete or incorrectly configured project setup, specifically concerning bridging Objective-C and Swift, and the proper inclusion of the TensorFlow Lite framework.  My experience resolving this, spanning numerous iOS and macOS projects involving on-device machine learning, consistently points to issues in the build settings and project structure.  The solution isn't simply adding a framework; it requires meticulous attention to dependency management and build phases.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The TensorFlow Lite framework, while written in C++, is accessed from Swift through an Objective-C bridging header. This header acts as an intermediary, allowing Swift to interact with the C++ code via Objective-C APIs.  The error manifests when the compiler cannot locate this bridging header or the TensorFlow Lite framework itself within your project's search paths.  This failure can be due to several factors:

* **Incorrect Framework Installation:** The TensorFlow Lite framework might not be correctly added to your Xcode project.  A simple drag-and-drop might appear successful but fail to properly integrate the framework's files into the build process.
* **Missing or Incorrect Bridging Header:** The bridging header, typically named `YourProjectName-Bridging-Header.h`, must be correctly configured in your project settings and must include the necessary Objective-C headers for TensorFlow Lite.  Omitting crucial import statements within this header is a common pitfall.
* **Build Settings Misconfiguration:**  The Xcode project's build settings, specifically the header search paths, library search paths, and framework search paths, must correctly point to the locations of the TensorFlow Lite framework and its associated header files. Incorrect paths prevent the compiler from finding the necessary components.
* **Cocoapods or Swift Package Manager Issues:** If you are using Cocoapods or Swift Package Manager (SPM) to manage dependencies, ensure that the TensorFlow Lite pod or package is correctly specified in your Podfile or Package.swift file and that you've run the appropriate commands to install and integrate the dependencies.  Inconsistent versions or conflicting dependencies can lead to this error.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Bridging Header and Framework Inclusion (Using CocoaPods)**

Assuming you've successfully integrated TensorFlow Lite using CocoaPods, your bridging header (`YourProjectName-Bridging-Header.h`) should contain:

```objectivec
#import <TensorFlowLite/TensorFlowLite.h>
```

This line imports the necessary headers from the TensorFlow Lite framework, making its classes and functions available to your Objective-C and subsequently Swift code.  Crucially, ensure that the `TensorFlowLite` framework is included in your project’s “General” settings under “Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content.”  Double-check that the `Copy items if needed` checkbox is selected for the framework file.

**Example 2:  Direct Framework Integration (Without CocoaPods or SPM)**

If you're manually adding the TensorFlow Lite framework, you need to explicitly set the search paths in your project's build settings.  Locate the “Build Settings” tab, search for “Header Search Paths” and “Framework Search Paths,” and add the paths to the TensorFlow Lite header files and framework files respectively.  These paths should be relative to your project or absolute. For instance:

```
Header Search Paths: $(SRCROOT)/Frameworks/TensorFlowLite/include
Framework Search Paths: $(SRCROOT)/Frameworks/TensorFlowLite
```

Remember to replace `$(SRCROOT)/Frameworks/TensorFlowLite` with the actual path to your TensorFlow Lite framework.  Again, verify the framework is correctly embedded in the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section.


**Example 3:  Swift Code Utilizing TensorFlow Lite (Post-Setup)**

Once the setup is complete, accessing TensorFlow Lite functions in Swift becomes straightforward:

```swift
import TensorFlowLite

// ... other code ...

let interpreter = try Interpreter(modelPath: "path/to/your/model.tflite")
try interpreter.allocateTensors()

// ... further TensorFlow Lite operations ...
```

This Swift code snippet demonstrates the basic usage of the TensorFlow Lite interpreter after the correct configuration.  The `modelPath` should be an accurate path to your TensorFlow Lite model file.  Error handling, using `try-catch` blocks, is crucial for robust application development.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest reviewing the official TensorFlow Lite documentation for iOS and macOS development.  Pay close attention to the sections detailing framework integration, build settings, and examples for Swift.  Additionally, consulting the Xcode documentation regarding project settings, bridging headers, and dependency management would prove invaluable.  A deep understanding of Objective-C and Swift interoperability is also essential.  Furthermore, searching for similar error messages and solutions on developer forums, keeping in mind specific framework versions and Xcode versions, can often reveal helpful insights from other developers who have faced similar hurdles. Thoroughly examine your project's build log;  the compiler usually provides hints about the specific file or path it cannot find.
