TensorFlow and Keras, while often used together, represent distinct layers in the deep learning stack.  My experience building and deploying CNNs for image classification and object detection tasks over the last five years has highlighted a key difference: Keras provides a higher-level, more user-friendly API, while TensorFlow offers a lower-level, more customizable framework.  This distinction significantly impacts the development process, particularly for CNNs which often require intricate architecture and optimization.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow is a comprehensive, open-source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning.  It offers a flexible, low-level approach to building and training models, providing fine-grained control over every aspect of the process.  This flexibility comes at the cost of increased complexity; building even a simple CNN requires a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's underlying mechanics, including graph construction, session management, and tensor manipulations.

Keras, on the other hand, is a high-level API designed for building and training neural networks in a more intuitive and concise manner.  While it can run on top of TensorFlow (as well as other backends like Theano and CNTK), it abstracts away much of the low-level complexity of TensorFlow, allowing developers to focus on the model architecture and hyperparameters.  This simplifies the development process, particularly for beginners and for projects where rapid prototyping is prioritized.

The relationship can be visualized as follows: Keras offers a simplified interface, a set of pre-built blocks, to interact with the powerful, yet more complex engine provided by TensorFlow. The user can opt for the simpler, more abstract interface of Keras or delve into the intricacies of TensorFlow for more customized control.  For CNNs, this translates to a choice between ease of development versus fine-grained control over the computation graph and optimization process.  My experience shows that selecting the right tool depends heavily on the project's scope, complexity, and the developer's familiarity with each library.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple CNN in Keras**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)
```

This Keras example demonstrates the simplicity of defining a CNN.  The model is built sequentially using pre-defined layers.  The `compile` and `fit` methods handle the training process efficiently.  This approach is ideal for rapid prototyping and educational purposes. The reliance on pre-built functions abstracts away the underlying tensor operations managed by the TensorFlow backend.  During my work on a quick-prototype image classifier, this concise syntax proved invaluable.

**Example 2:  CNN in TensorFlow (Low-level)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model using tf.keras.layers but with explicit graph creation
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Define training loop explicitly
for epoch in range(5):
    for x_batch, y_batch in train_dataset:
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            logits = model(x_batch)
            loss = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(y_batch, logits)

        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

This example uses TensorFlow more directly, illustrating manual gradient calculation and application.  While functionally similar to the Keras example, it requires a more thorough understanding of TensorFlow's mechanics.  This is significantly more verbose and requires handling of the gradient calculation explicitly. I've employed this approach in projects requiring custom training loops or advanced optimization techniques not readily available through the Keras API, such as implementing specialized optimizers or incorporating custom loss functions.

**Example 3:  Custom Layer in TensorFlow**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='zeros', trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MyCustomLayer(64), # Inserting custom layer
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

Here, a custom layer is defined, extending the functionality beyond the standard Keras layers.  This demonstrates the flexibility offered by TensorFlow, allowing for greater control over individual layer operations.  During my work on a project involving specialized attention mechanisms, I leveraged this capability to integrate custom layers directly into the TensorFlow graph, a feature inaccessible through the purely Keras approach.  This example highlights TensorFlow's strength in allowing deep customization.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation and tutorials.  For Keras, the Keras documentation is a valuable resource.  Supplementing these with a comprehensive textbook on deep learning principles is also highly beneficial.  Finally, reviewing relevant research papers on CNN architectures and optimization techniques will enhance your skillset significantly.  Practicing with various datasets and tackling diverse problems is crucial for building practical experience.
