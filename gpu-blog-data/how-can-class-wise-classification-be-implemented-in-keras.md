Class-wise classification, in the context of multi-class problems, refers to the need to not only predict the overall class label but also obtain per-class probabilities or confidence scores.  This contrasts with simply assigning a single class label, offering a richer understanding of the model's prediction certainty for each potential class.  My experience working on image recognition projects for medical diagnosis highlighted the critical importance of this granular insight; misclassifying a benign lesion as malignant carries vastly different consequences than simply misclassifying one type of benign lesion for another.  Thus, accessing individual class probabilities is crucial for effective decision-making.  Keras, with its TensorFlow backend, provides several methods to achieve this.

**1. Explanation:**

The core mechanism involves modifying the output layer of the Keras model.  Instead of using a single output neuron with a softmax activation for direct class prediction, we utilize multiple output neurons, one for each class, each employing a sigmoid activation function. This design allows each neuron to independently predict the probability of its corresponding class, without the constraint of summing to one imposed by softmax.  The sigmoid activation confines the output to a range of 0 to 1, representing the probability of that specific class being present.  Post-processing may be necessary to calibrate these individual probabilities, accounting for potential class imbalances or correlations between classes.

This approach differs significantly from the standard multi-class classification setup with a softmax output layer, which directly provides the probability distribution over all classes.  While the softmax provides a single class prediction based on the highest probability, our class-wise approach offers a separate probability for each class.  This granularity is essential when nuanced decision support is required, allowing for the identification of potential ambiguities or the application of thresholds for each class independently.

Furthermore, this method accommodates situations where an instance might belong to multiple classes simultaneously.  For instance, in image tagging, an image might simultaneously contain "cat" and "indoors". The softmax layer would assign a single label, whereas our class-wise method allows both classes to have high probabilities.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Simple Binary Classification with Class-Wise Output:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Single neuron for a single class
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... training ...

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
# predictions will contain probabilities of class 1 (0-1)

# Class-wise probability handling is straightforward here, as there's only one class

```

This example demonstrates the simplest scenario. Even though it's binary, it sets the foundation for understanding sigmoid activation's role in independent class probability generation.


**Example 2: Multi-Class Classification with Class-Wise Output:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

num_classes = 3

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(num_classes, activation='sigmoid') # Multiple neurons, one for each class
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... training ...

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
# predictions will be a matrix of shape (number_of_samples, num_classes)
# each column representing probability for a given class

# Post-processing might be required.  For instance:
for i in range(predictions.shape[0]):
    class_probabilities = predictions[i]
    # You can process individual class probabilities here (e.g., thresholding)

```

This expands upon the binary example.  The `num_classes` variable controls the number of output neurons, each producing a probability for a specific class. Note the use of binary crossentropy; this is crucial as each output neuron represents an independent binary classification problem (class present/absent).


**Example 3: Handling Class Imbalance:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.utils import class_weight

# ... data loading and preprocessing (assuming class weights are calculated) ...

class_weights = class_weight.compute_class_weight(
    class_weight='balanced',
    classes=np.unique(y_train),
    y=y_train
)

num_classes = 3

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(num_classes, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'],
              loss_weights=class_weights) # Apply class weights to the loss function

# ... training ...

# Post-processing remains crucial.  Threshold adjustment might be necessary 
# based on the class weights and observed probabilities


```

This example incorporates class weights to mitigate issues stemming from imbalanced datasets.  This is particularly relevant in class-wise classification since class imbalances significantly impact individual class probability estimations.  The `class_weight` parameter in `model.compile` adjusts the contribution of each class to the overall loss function.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections detailing Keras model building and compilation, are invaluable resources.  Furthermore, dedicated texts on deep learning and neural network architectures provide a comprehensive theoretical grounding.   Exploring research papers focusing on multi-label classification and probability calibration techniques will enhance your understanding of more advanced approaches.  Finally,  reviewing open-source code repositories hosting projects with similar classification needs provides practical insights into implementation strategies.
