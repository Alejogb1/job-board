Unexpected bus conflicts when accessing a 2D array of `std_logic_vector`s in VHDL stem primarily from the inherent nature of concurrent signal assignments and the potential for race conditions within the VHDL simulation environment.  My experience debugging similar issues in high-speed FPGA designs for telecom applications has highlighted this repeatedly.  The problem isn't necessarily with the 2D array itself, but rather how its elements are read and written concurrently, leading to unpredictable signal values.

The core issue lies in the fact that VHDL is a hardware description language, and its concurrency model is quite different from procedural languages like C or Python.  When multiple processes or concurrent signal assignments attempt to drive the same signal simultaneously, a race condition arises.  The simulator's resolution of this race condition is not always deterministic, resulting in seemingly unpredictable behaviour, particularly when dealing with aggregated data structures like 2D arrays. This is especially true when the array elements are themselves `std_logic_vector`s, which represent potentially large busses.  A single unexpected value on a single bit within an element can cascade into significant errors.

Consider a simplified scenario: a process reading data from one part of the 2D array while another process writes to a different, potentially overlapping, region.  Even if the read and write operations appear spatially distinct in the code, the underlying hardware implementation might have signal contention. The simulator's delta-cycle mechanism, which schedules signal updates, can result in different final values depending on the simulator and its settings.

Let's illustrate this with examples.  Iâ€™ll use a simplified 2x2 array of 8-bit vectors for clarity:

**Example 1: Potential Race Condition**

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity array_access is
  port (
    clk : in std_logic;
    data_in : in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    data_out : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    enable_read : in std_logic;
    enable_write : in std_logic
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of array_access is
  type array_type is array (0 to 1, 0 to 1) of std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
  signal my_array : array_type;
begin

  read_process: process (clk)
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      if enable_read = '1' then
        data_out <= my_array(0, 0);
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;

  write_process: process (clk)
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      if enable_write = '1' then
        my_array(0, 0) <= data_in;
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;

end architecture;
```

In this example, `read_process` and `write_process` both access `my_array(0, 0)`.  If `enable_read` and `enable_write` are both high on the same clock cycle, a race condition exists.  The final value of `data_out` will depend on the simulator's resolution of the simultaneous assignments.  This is highly undesirable and leads to non-deterministic behaviour.


**Example 2:  Improved Design with Explicit Synchronization**

To mitigate this, we introduce explicit synchronization using a shared signal:

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity array_access_sync is
  port (
    clk : in std_logic;
    data_in : in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    data_out : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    write_request : in std_logic;
    read_request : in std_logic
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of array_access_sync is
  type array_type is array (0 to 1, 0 to 1) of std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
  signal my_array : array_type;
  signal write_enable : std_logic := '0';
  signal read_enable : std_logic := '0';

begin

  write_control: process (clk)
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      if write_request = '1' then
        write_enable <= '1';
      else
        write_enable <= '0';
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;

  read_control: process (clk)
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      if read_request = '1' then
        read_enable <= '1';
      else
        read_enable <= '0';
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;

  write_process: process (clk)
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      if write_enable = '1' then
        my_array(0, 0) <= data_in;
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;

  read_process: process (clk)
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      if read_enable = '1' then
        data_out <= my_array(0, 0);
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;
end architecture;
```

Here, `write_request` and `read_request` control separate enable signals (`write_enable`, `read_enable`). This prevents simultaneous access to `my_array(0, 0)`.  Proper sequencing ensures only one operation occurs at a time.

**Example 3: Using a Single Process for Sequential Access**

A more robust approach is to consolidate read and write operations into a single process, eliminating the possibility of concurrent access altogether:

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity array_access_single_process is
  port (
    clk : in std_logic;
    data_in : in std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    data_out : out std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    write_request : in std_logic;
    read_request : in std_logic;
    address : in std_logic_vector(1 downto 0); --Address for 2x2 array
    write_data_valid : in std_logic
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of array_access_single_process is
  type array_type is array (0 to 1, 0 to 1) of std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
  signal my_array : array_type;
begin

  process (clk)
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      if write_request = '1' and write_data_valid = '1' then
        my_array(to_integer(unsigned(address(1 downto 1))), to_integer(unsigned(address(0 downto 0)))) <= data_in;
      elsif read_request = '1' then
        data_out <= my_array(to_integer(unsigned(address(1 downto 1))), to_integer(unsigned(address(0 downto 0))));
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;
end architecture;
```

This example uses a single process to handle both reading and writing.  The `address` input selects the specific array element to access, ensuring exclusive access.


**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of VHDL concurrency and signal assignments, I recommend consulting the VHDL LRM (Language Reference Manual) and a reputable VHDL textbook focusing on design and synthesis aspects. Pay particular attention to sections describing concurrent signal assignment, process statements, and delta-cycle simulation.  A good book covering FPGA architecture and design will also be beneficial in understanding how VHDL code translates to hardware.  Understanding the implications of concurrent signal assignments and how to use proper synchronization mechanisms will be crucial in preventing these bus conflict issues.  Focusing on synthesis tools and their reports can also aid in identifying potential issues before they manifest as simulation problems.
