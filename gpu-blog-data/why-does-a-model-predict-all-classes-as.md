The discrepancy between binary cross-entropy (BCE) consistently predicting one class and categorical cross-entropy (CCE) yielding accurate multi-class predictions in the same model architecture strongly suggests an issue with output layer activation or label encoding misaligned with the loss function. Specifically, the probability interpretation enforced by BCE requires a single sigmoid output and binary labels. Conversely, CCE expects a softmax activation across multiple outputs alongside one-hot encoded labels.

In my experience optimizing machine learning models for image classification, I encountered this exact scenario. Initially, I used a standard convolutional neural network designed for multi-class classification with a final fully connected layer intended to produce class probabilities. I initially configured my model with a sigmoid activation function in the output layer and binary labels (0 and 1) expecting it to perform binary classification for a set of images with overlapping objects. All predictions were consistently near 1. Later, during debugging and when I shifted the problem to one with distinct class labeling, I encountered accurate predictions by replacing the sigmoid with softmax in my output layer, and one-hot encoded the labels while using categorical cross entropy. The root cause wasn't the network architecture itself, but rather its incompatibility with the specified loss function and label/activation format.

Binary cross-entropy assumes a single output node, whose activation, after passing through a sigmoid, represents the probability of the positive class (conventionally class '1'). The loss function is explicitly constructed to compare this single probability against a binary label (either 0 or 1). When all the output activations are pushed toward the extremes (either 0 or 1), and especially if pushed towards 1, the model has effectively learned to classify everything into the positive class. This occurs because, during optimization, if the positive label corresponds to a relatively strong model output signal and if the gradient updates are always to increase the probability of this positive class, the sigmoid output will gravitate to higher values, resulting in a 1 prediction for all instances. It is also crucial to check if the labels were inadvertently not properly binarized. This means the labels, should they not be binary, may push the outputs toward one singular value, usually in the case of positive label values that may be considerably larger than 1. The model interprets these labels as having to push the positive probability towards its maximum, resulting in all predictions being 1, especially if the sigmoid output is used.

Conversely, categorical cross-entropy assumes multiple output nodes, one for each class, and that these nodes must sum up to 1 representing probability across all classes. Thus, if there are three classes, CCE will produce three output nodes with probabilities between 0 and 1 that must sum up to 1. The softmax function transforms the raw model output into such probability distributions and the cross-entropy loss is computed against one-hot encoded labels (e.g., class 1: [1, 0, 0], class 2: [0, 1, 0], class 3: [0, 0, 1]). In this scenario, the model learns to distribute probabilities among classes, not to simply favor a single positive class.

Letâ€™s illustrate this with three code examples using Python and a hypothetical model implementation. The example uses `tensorflow`, but the same logic will be applicable in `pytorch` and other libraries.

**Example 1: Binary Classification (Incorrect Setup)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume model is a convolutional neural network
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Sigmoid for binary output
])

loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Assume 'X_train' are input features, and 'y_train' are binary labels (0 or 1)
# And y_train is not properly binarized and has other values, e.g., [1,2,3,0,1,2,0,0,0,...]

def train_step(X, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(X)
        loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

# Hypothetical training loop (omitting data loading)
X_train = tf.random.normal((100, 100))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((100, ), minval=0, maxval=4, dtype=tf.int32)
epochs = 10

for i in range(epochs):
    loss = train_step(X_train, y_train)
    print(f"Epoch {i+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
    # After training, model will likely predict a value close to 1 for all inputs
```

In this first example, using the *sigmoid* output with the `BinaryCrossentropy` loss function and labels that are not correctly binarized to 0 or 1 pushes all predictions towards 1. This means the loss will be driven to push towards high output probabilities due to the nature of the loss and the activation function, resulting in all predictions becoming almost one. The use of non-binary labels exacerbates this issue.

**Example 2: Multi-Class Classification (Correct Setup)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax') # Softmax for multi-class output (3 classes)
])

loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Assume 'X_train' are input features, 'y_train_onehot' are one-hot encoded labels (e.g., [1,0,0], [0,1,0], [0,0,1])
def train_step(X, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(X)
        loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

# Hypothetical training loop (omitting data loading)
X_train = tf.random.normal((100, 100))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0, maxval=3, dtype=tf.int32)
y_train_onehot = tf.one_hot(y_train, depth=3) # One-hot encode labels
epochs = 10

for i in range(epochs):
    loss = train_step(X_train, y_train_onehot)
    print(f"Epoch {i+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")

    # Model will predict each of the 3 classes, not all 1.
```

In the second example, we correctly configure for multi-class classification with softmax activation for the final layer and one-hot encoded labels. Because of the nature of the cross entropy function, it drives the output probabilities toward the actual target output, ensuring the model does not merely predict 1 for all inputs. This demonstrates a proper use case of `CategoricalCrossentropy`.

**Example 3: Demonstrating Sigmoid with Binary Labels (Corrected)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Sigmoid for binary output
])

loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Assume 'X_train' are input features, 'y_train' are binary labels (0 or 1)
def train_step(X, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(X)
        loss = loss_fn(y, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

# Hypothetical training loop (omitting data loading)
X_train = tf.random.normal((100, 100))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)
y_train = tf.cast(y_train, tf.float32)
epochs = 10

for i in range(epochs):
    loss = train_step(X_train, y_train)
    print(f"Epoch {i+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")

# Now, model will not predict 1 for all inputs, assuming a balanced dataset and appropriate training.

```

In example three, we correct the setup from example 1 by ensuring that the target labels *y_train* are binary and are of type `float32`, as required by the loss function. This setup would properly classify inputs if there were distinct patterns between the 0 and 1 labeled inputs. This helps illustrate that it is not sufficient to merely change the loss function and activation, the appropriate label formats must also be provided.

In summary, the observed behavior stems from an inappropriate combination of output layer activation, loss function, and label representation.  BCE enforces a single probability score against binary labels, whereas CCE operates with softmax-activated multiple outputs and one-hot encoded labels. Mismatches will lead the model to a trivial solution, often predicting all inputs as the most prevalent class. To avoid this, ensure that the chosen loss function is aligned with both the output activation and label formatting. When dealing with multi-class classification, using a `softmax` activation with one-hot encoded labels and `CategoricalCrossentropy` is the standard approach. For binary labels, use a `sigmoid` activation and `BinaryCrossentropy` loss.

For further resources on deep learning and classification, explore the documentation for your deep learning library (TensorFlow, PyTorch). Consider resources covering fundamentals of neural networks, loss functions, and optimization algorithms. Textbooks and reputable online courses often provide a deeper dive into these topics. Researching practical deep learning architectures would also prove useful.
