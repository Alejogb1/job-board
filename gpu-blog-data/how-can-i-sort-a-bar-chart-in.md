Sorting a bar chart in Altair necessitates an understanding of how the library encodes data into visual properties, specifically focusing on the interaction between data fields and the `x` and `y` encodings. The core principle is that Altair, unlike some other plotting libraries, doesn't sort based on the visual appearance of the bars directly. Instead, you manipulate the underlying data or specify a sorting order as part of the encoding definition. I’ve encountered scenarios where this caused initial confusion, particularly when migrating from chart types where sorting seemed more intuitive.

The most direct approach to sorting a bar chart in Altair is by controlling the order of the discrete values assigned to the `x` or `y` channels, depending on the chart’s orientation. Typically, one of these channels represents categorical data. The default behavior of Altair, without explicit sorting instructions, often results in an order based on the sequence of unique values as they first appear within the provided data, which can be inconsistent.  To achieve a different sort, you must either pre-sort the underlying dataframe, or, more efficiently, specify the sort within the encoding specification itself using a `sort` parameter.

Sorting is achieved by manipulating the `sort` parameter within the encoding. The `sort` parameter can take on several types of values depending on what kind of order you need. The most common scenarios involve sorting by value within the data itself, for example sorting bars by the magnitude of the values they represent. You could also sort by alphabetic order, or even define an arbitrary order if necessary.

Let's examine three examples to clarify the implementation. The following examples assume a pandas DataFrame named `df` exists, which I've often found to be the most common data format in my use cases. Assume this DataFrame has columns 'category' and 'value'.

**Example 1: Sorting by Bar Height (Ascending)**

The first example involves sorting a vertical bar chart by the numerical `value` column in ascending order. It will arrange the bars with the shortest bar on the left, increasing gradually to the right.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

# Assume 'df' is a pandas DataFrame with 'category' and 'value' columns
data = {'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
        'value': [30, 10, 45, 20, 5]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)


chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('category:N', sort=alt.EncodingSortField(field='value', order='ascending')),
    y='value:Q'
)

chart.show()
```

Here, `alt.X('category:N', ...)` defines the x-axis encoding as a nominal type and introduces the sorting criteria. `alt.EncodingSortField(field='value', order='ascending')` directs Altair to sort the categories along the x-axis based on the 'value' column, in ascending order. Notice I have explicitly used `alt.EncodingSortField` to declare I wish to sort on a field. I have found this to be the most explicit and less error-prone way of declaring sort criteria. If I just used the field name as a string, it could accidentally be sorted alphabetically, which is usually not the desired behavior. The y-axis simply maps the quantitative 'value' column. The `show()` function displays the constructed chart and is used for local development in a jupyter notebook environment. This method results in an increasing order from left to right.

**Example 2: Sorting by Bar Height (Descending)**

This example demonstrates sorting the same bar chart, but in descending order based on the 'value' column, which places the tallest bar on the left and descends. This is more commonly used to quickly identify the largest values.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

# Assume 'df' is a pandas DataFrame with 'category' and 'value' columns
data = {'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
        'value': [30, 10, 45, 20, 5]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('category:N', sort=alt.EncodingSortField(field='value', order='descending')),
    y='value:Q'
)

chart.show()
```

This is very similar to the first example, except for the argument `order='descending'` in the `sort` parameter. I prefer using explicitly setting `order` to ensure clarity and avoid accidental reverse alphabetical sorting, particularly if your field names could be interpreted as text.

**Example 3: Sorting by Custom Order (Arbitrary Category Order)**

In this final scenario, we will demonstrate using a custom sort order. For example, if the order of categories should follow a specific sequence which doesn't conform to a default alphabetic or numerical rule.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

# Assume 'df' is a pandas DataFrame with 'category' and 'value' columns
data = {'category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
        'value': [30, 10, 45, 20, 5]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)


custom_order = ['E', 'A', 'C', 'B', 'D']
chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('category:N', sort=custom_order),
    y='value:Q'
)

chart.show()
```
Here, the `sort` parameter within the x-axis encoding accepts a list directly. This list defines the explicit order in which the categories will be displayed on the x-axis. For this, I've provided the `custom_order` list, which is used in the sort parameter without any additional modifiers. Altair will then render the bars in that exact order. In real applications, I've found this to be extremely helpful when presenting data where an established or custom order is preferred for contextual reasons.

In all three examples, I have used '`category:N`' for the x encoding, which designates it as a Nominal, i.e., categorical type. If you used dates, for example, you would have to ensure that the type was set to ‘T’ for temporal. The sort logic stays consistent across these type differences, i.e., providing a string name, an alt.EncodingSortField object, or a list. For the `y` encoding I have used '`value:Q`', indicating a quantitative type.

When working with more complex visualizations, I’ve encountered cases where it’s beneficial to perform data pre-processing within pandas before sending the data to Altair.  While Altair's built-in sorting capabilities are powerful, they are primarily focused on the encoding itself and may not accommodate very complex, data-driven transformations. The best course of action will depend on the specifics of the data, and the precise visual outcome desired.

To further your knowledge with sorting, I would recommend studying the following resources. Firstly, thoroughly examine the official Altair documentation; this is indispensable. Look for the ‘Encoding’ section in particular to better understand how parameters like `sort` influence visual properties. Also, consider working through tutorials and examples which explain the difference between different axis types such as quantitative, temporal, and nominal data and how these data types interact with encoding options. There are good examples within the Altair documentation, but also within academic papers which describe the Vega-Lite grammar, which Altair utilizes internally. Finally, experiment. The best way to truly internalize the logic of Altair is to build visualizations yourself. Start with simple use-cases, and gradually try to add more complexity by manipulating the parameters such as sort.
