The absence of evaluation metrics and export artifacts following TensorFlow model training on AI Platform frequently stems from misconfigurations within the training job's specification, specifically concerning the `trainingInput` section of the `Job` object.  In my experience troubleshooting numerous production deployments, I've consistently found that overlooking crucial parameters related to export and evaluation within this section is the root cause.  This isn't necessarily indicative of a TensorFlow flaw, but rather a frequent oversight in the job definition.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The AI Platform training service relies on a structured input configuration to understand how to execute the training script and handle post-training actions. This configuration, provided in the `trainingInput` field, dictates various aspects of the job, including:

* **The training script itself:**  The path to your training script (typically a Python file) is specified here.  Crucially, this script must contain the logic for both calculating evaluation metrics and exporting the trained model. The AI Platform doesn't automatically perform these operations; it merely executes the provided script.

* **Region and machine type:**  These determine the computational resources allocated to the training job. While not directly related to the problem at hand, insufficient resources can indirectly affect the successful completion of evaluation and export steps within your script.  Memory exhaustion, for instance, can prematurely halt the process before these phases are reached.

* **Hyperparameters:**  These are passed to your training script as command-line arguments, enabling you to control aspects of the model training process.  They are not directly involved in the export or evaluation, but their appropriate configuration significantly influences the model's performance and thus the validity of the metrics.

* **Packaging:**  AI Platform supports various packaging methods for your training script and dependencies.  Incorrect packaging can lead to runtime errors, preventing the execution of evaluation and export routines.  Using the correct container image and ensuring all dependencies are properly installed are essential.

* **Output Directories:**  The `trainingInput` section must define an output directory (`jobDir`).  This directory is where your training logs, evaluation metrics, and exported model artifacts will reside. Failure to explicitly specify this location results in missing artifacts after job completion.  The AI Platform does not implicitly create a default output location.

The core issue, therefore, is that AI Platform acts as an execution environment. It doesn't inherently generate evaluation metrics or export models; it relies on your training script to perform these actions.  If your script lacks the necessary code, or if the job specification fails to properly direct the output to a designated directory, the expected artifacts will be absent.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Here are three code examples demonstrating different aspects of the process, focusing on common pitfalls and best practices:

**Example 1: Incomplete Training Script**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... Model building and training code ...

# Missing evaluation and export code
# The AI Platform will complete training but not generate metrics or exports

```

**Commentary:** This script demonstrates the most basic error.  The model training might complete successfully, but without explicit evaluation and export commands, the AI Platform will not produce the desired output.  The model is trained, but the results are not collected or packaged for later use.


**Example 2: Correct Implementation with tf.saved_model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... Model building and training code ...

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data, verbose=2)
print(f"Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Export the model using tf.saved_model
tf.saved_model.save(model, export_dir="./exported_model")

```

**Commentary:** This improved script incorporates both evaluation and export using TensorFlow's `saved_model` functionality. The `evaluate` method computes metrics (here, loss and accuracy), and `saved_model.save` generates a deployable model artifact.  Note the explicit specification of the `export_dir`. This directory will be accessible via the AI Platform's job directory.


**Example 3: Handling Multiple Metrics and Custom Exports**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... Model building and training code ...

# Evaluate the model and store metrics in a dictionary
metrics = {}
metrics["loss"] = model.evaluate(test_data, verbose=0)[0]
metrics["precision"] = np.mean(np.array([0.8,0.9,0.7])) # Example custom metric

# Save metrics to a file for later retrieval
np.save("metrics.npy", metrics)

# Export the model using tf.saved_model
tf.saved_model.save(model, export_dir="./exported_model")

#Optionally include a custom logging function to handle additional data
def log_metrics(metrics):
    with open('training_metrics.txt', 'w') as f:
      for metric_name, metric_value in metrics.items():
        f.write(f"{metric_name}:{metric_value}\n")
log_metrics(metrics)

```


**Commentary:** This example demonstrates how to manage multiple evaluation metrics and handle them in a structured way for later analysis.  A dictionary stores the metrics, and NumPy's `save` function persists them to a file.  This approach is more robust than simply printing metrics to the console, which are often lost in the AI Platform logs. The addition of a logging function provides a more persistent record, which can be crucial for debugging or analysis.  The exported model remains consistent with the previous example.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation on SavedModel and the AI Platform training service are essential resources.  The official TensorFlow tutorials offer practical examples covering model training, evaluation, and export. Studying best practices for managing experiment data and logging within TensorFlow workflows will significantly aid in troubleshooting and preventing these issues.  Reviewing the AI Platform's logging and monitoring capabilities will help in identifying and diagnosing problems during and after training. Finally,  familiarize yourself with the nuances of containerization for deploying TensorFlow models for both training and serving.
