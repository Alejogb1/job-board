The core advantage of TensorFlow in implementing residual learning lies in its inherent flexibility and scalability, enabling efficient handling of deep neural networks crucial for leveraging the benefits of residual connections. My experience building and optimizing large-scale image recognition models underscores this point.  I've consistently found TensorFlow's computational graph model, particularly its optimized operations for matrix multiplication and gradient calculations, essential for training deep residual networks (ResNets) effectively. The ability to distribute computations across multiple GPUs further enhances this advantage, allowing for the training of models far exceeding the capacity of single-machine setups.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Residual learning, introduced in the seminal paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition," addresses the vanishing gradient problem prevalent in training extremely deep neural networks.  The problem arises because gradients propagate backward through numerous layers during backpropagation, often diminishing significantly as they reach earlier layers. This limits the network's ability to learn effectively.

Residual connections, also known as skip connections, mitigate this issue by adding the input of a layer to its output.  This allows gradients to flow more directly backward, facilitating training even with considerably increased depth.  Mathematically, instead of learning a mapping  `H(x) = x`, a residual block learns a residual mapping `F(x) = H(x) - x`.  The network then learns `H(x) = F(x) + x`.  If `F(x)` is close to zero, the network essentially learns the identity mapping, allowing for easier optimization. The benefit is that even if the residual mapping is difficult to learn, the identity mapping serves as a simple baseline that doesn't hinder training.  TensorFlow's optimized backpropagation implementation is particularly suited for efficiently calculating gradients in these complex architectures.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  A Simple Residual Block using Keras Sequential API**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def residual_block(filters, kernel_size=3):
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, activation='relu', padding='same'),
        keras.layers.BatchNormalization(),
        keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, activation='relu', padding='same'),
        keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
    ])
    return model

# Example usage
input_shape = (28, 28, 1) # Example input shape for MNIST
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
x = residual_block(64)(input_tensor)
x = keras.layers.add([x, input_tensor]) #Add residual connection
x = keras.layers.Activation('relu')(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=x)
model.summary()
```

This example showcases a basic residual block implemented using the Keras sequential API, which is a high-level API built on TensorFlow.  The `residual_block` function defines two convolutional layers with batch normalization, a standard component in ResNet architecture for improved stability during training.  The `keras.layers.add()` function implements the skip connection by element-wise adding the input and the output of the residual block.  The resulting model is then summarized, showing the architecture.  Note the 'same' padding used to maintain the spatial dimensions.


**Example 2: Implementing a ResNet using the Functional API**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def residual_block(x, filters):
    shortcut = x
    x = keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, (3, 3), padding='same')(x)
    x = keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = keras.layers.Activation('relu')(x)
    x = keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, (3, 3), padding='same')(x)
    x = keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = keras.layers.add([x, shortcut])
    x = keras.layers.Activation('relu')(x)
    return x

# Example usage:
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(28,28,1))
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same')(input_tensor)
x = keras.layers.BatchNormalization()(x)
x = keras.layers.Activation('relu')(x)
for _ in range(3): # Stacking residual blocks
  x = residual_block(x, 64)

x = keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x) # Example classification
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=x)
model.summary()
```

This example demonstrates the use of TensorFlow's Keras functional API to build a deeper ResNet.  The functional API allows for more complex and flexible network architectures.  Here, several residual blocks are stacked, creating a deeper network.  Global Average Pooling is then used before the final dense layer for classification.  The functional API provides greater control over data flow within the model compared to the sequential API.

**Example 3:  Custom Gradient Calculation (Illustrative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    #Example custom loss for demonstration
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_true-y_pred))
    return loss

# ... (Rest of the model definition using Keras or low-level TensorFlow) ...

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss, metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

While not directly related to the residual block structure, this example showcases TensorFlow's flexibility in handling custom loss functions.  In complex ResNet architectures, fine-tuning the loss function may be necessary for optimal performance.  TensorFlow supports defining and using custom gradients, allowing for adjustments beyond pre-defined loss functions like cross-entropy or MSE. This allows more tailored optimization strategies for the specific problem.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I recommend consulting the original ResNet paper, the TensorFlow documentation, and a comprehensive textbook on deep learning.  Focusing on sections detailing convolutional neural networks, backpropagation, and optimization algorithms will be particularly beneficial.  Additionally, reviewing examples of pre-trained ResNet models available in TensorFlow Hub can provide valuable insights into practical implementations and architectural choices.  Working through tutorials focusing on building and training deep neural networks with TensorFlow will solidify understanding of the concepts presented.
