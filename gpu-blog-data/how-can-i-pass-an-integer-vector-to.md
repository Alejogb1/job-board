Passing a vector of integers to a CUDA global function requires careful consideration of memory management and data transfer between the host (CPU) and the device (GPU). The core challenge lies in the fact that host memory is not directly accessible by device code. Therefore, we need to allocate memory on the GPU, copy the data from the host to the device, perform the computation, and then potentially copy the results back to the host. This is not a simple argument passing mechanism like one would find with CPU-based functions; explicit memory allocation and data transfer is necessary for GPU execution.

Let's break this down into a practical approach. First, on the host side, we need to prepare our integer vector and allocate corresponding memory on the device. We’ll then copy our data to the GPU, launch the CUDA kernel, and subsequently copy any necessary results back to the host.

Here’s a specific breakdown, along with example code:

**1. Host-Side Data Preparation and Device Memory Allocation:**

On the host, I typically use `std::vector` to store the integer data. Before passing this data to the kernel, I need to allocate GPU memory and copy the vector’s contents into this allocated space. This is achieved using CUDA’s runtime API. `cudaMalloc` is used to allocate raw memory on the GPU, while `cudaMemcpy` performs the host-to-device and device-to-host data transfer. The `cudaMemcpyKind` argument, `cudaMemcpyHostToDevice` in this case, directs the transfer.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> hostVector = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
  int* deviceVector;
  size_t vectorSize = hostVector.size() * sizeof(int);

  // Allocate memory on the device.
  cudaError_t cudaStatus = cudaMalloc((void**)&deviceVector, vectorSize);
  if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
      std::cerr << "cudaMalloc failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(cudaStatus) << std::endl;
      return 1;
  }

  // Copy data from host to device.
  cudaStatus = cudaMemcpy(deviceVector, hostVector.data(), vectorSize, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
      std::cerr << "cudaMemcpy failed (HostToDevice): " << cudaGetErrorString(cudaStatus) << std::endl;
      cudaFree(deviceVector);
      return 1;
  }
 // ... Kernel Launch and further processing follows ...
```

In this snippet, I've used `cudaMalloc` to acquire device memory, casting the result to `int*` as I'm transferring integer data. The `cudaMemcpy` call then moves the contents of `hostVector` to the newly allocated `deviceVector`. Error handling is included to check the validity of each CUDA call; a common practice when developing CUDA programs. Crucially, the size of the allocation and transfer are computed correctly using `sizeof(int)` to avoid size mismatches. The next important step is launching our kernel.

**2. Defining and Launching the CUDA Kernel:**

The CUDA kernel is a function executed on the GPU. This kernel must accept the device pointer (`int* deviceVector` in this case) as an argument. I will also need to pass the number of elements as an argument, since the kernel will need to know the length of the array it is working on. Within the kernel, individual threads will access elements of the vector.

```cpp
__global__ void myKernel(int* data, int size) {
    int index = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (index < size) {
       data[index] += 10; // Example operation: add 10 to each element.
    }
}
```

In this simplified example, each thread within the grid checks if its calculated index is within the bounds of the vector. If so, it performs a simple operation, adding 10 to the element pointed to by `data[index]`. The `blockIdx.x`, `blockDim.x`, and `threadIdx.x` parameters are built-in variables available within CUDA kernels, allowing the kernel to assign a unique index to each thread so each thread only modifies a single array entry.

Now, the kernel can be launched from our host code:

```cpp
    int blockSize = 256;
    int gridSize = (hostVector.size() + blockSize - 1) / blockSize; // Compute grid size

    myKernel<<<gridSize, blockSize>>>(deviceVector, hostVector.size());

    cudaStatus = cudaGetLastError();
    if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "Kernel launch failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(cudaStatus) << std::endl;
        cudaFree(deviceVector);
        return 1;
    }
    
     cudaDeviceSynchronize(); // Wait for the kernel to finish
```

The kernel launch syntax `myKernel<<<gridSize, blockSize>>>` specifies the grid and block dimensions. The `gridSize` calculates the number of thread blocks required to cover the entire vector. The `blockSize` represents the number of threads per block. Error checking for the kernel launch is crucial. A device synchronisation call is also needed, `cudaDeviceSynchronize`, this will block the host thread until the kernel has completely finished, which is necessary to ensure that the data has been modified on the GPU before we read it back.

**3. Device-to-Host Data Transfer and Cleanup:**

After kernel execution is complete, we may want to transfer the modified results back to the host. This is done with another call to `cudaMemcpy`, but this time with `cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost` as the transfer direction, after which we also need to free the device memory.

```cpp
    // Copy data from device to host.
    cudaStatus = cudaMemcpy(hostVector.data(), deviceVector, vectorSize, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaMemcpy failed (DeviceToHost): " << cudaGetErrorString(cudaStatus) << std::endl;
        cudaFree(deviceVector);
        return 1;
    }

    // Free the device memory.
    cudaStatus = cudaFree(deviceVector);
    if (cudaStatus != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "cudaFree failed: " << cudaGetErrorString(cudaStatus) << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    std::cout << "Processed array: ";
    for (int val : hostVector) {
        std::cout << val << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The final `cudaMemcpy` call transfers the updated data back to the `hostVector`. The allocated device memory is then freed using `cudaFree`. The host-side vector is finally printed, displaying the updated values. Error handling is included for the device-to-host transfer and for the `cudaFree` call.

**Additional Considerations:**

The above example directly transfers the entire array. In some situations, you might only need a subset of results or the original input is too large to fit in device memory. In such situations, techniques like data streaming, where the input is broken down into smaller chunks and processed serially, are often necessary. Managing resources such as allocated device memory is also paramount for avoiding memory leaks, especially in complex applications.

**Recommended Resources:**

I strongly recommend delving into the official CUDA documentation for a complete understanding of memory management, kernel execution, and the runtime API. The CUDA programming guide and reference manuals offer detailed explanations and examples. In addition, numerous books on parallel programming with CUDA provide a more structured and comprehensive approach. Online forums and communities dedicated to CUDA development are invaluable for addressing specific challenges. Lastly, studying examples within the CUDA SDK will offer additional insights into practical usage patterns.
