TensorFlow/Keras's image handling capabilities aren't intrinsically tied to specific file formats; rather, they depend on the backend libraries used for image loading and preprocessing.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects at a previous employer highlighted this crucial distinction. We initially faced performance bottlenecks due to inefficient image loading, ultimately resolving the issue by optimizing our choice of libraries and preprocessing strategies.  Therefore, understanding the interaction between Keras and underlying libraries is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow/Keras itself doesn't directly support image file formats.  The framework relies on external libraries, most commonly OpenCV (cv2), Pillow (PIL), and Scikit-image, to handle image input and output. These libraries provide the functionalities to read and write diverse image formats.  The choice of which library to use influences the range of supported formats and the overall efficiency of your image processing pipeline.

OpenCV, known for its speed and robust image processing capabilities, supports a very broad range of formats, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, and many more specialized formats.  Pillow, while offering a more Pythonic interface, also boasts extensive format support, though potentially with slightly lower performance compared to OpenCV for very large datasets. Scikit-image provides a strong emphasis on scientific image analysis and offers support for a selection of common formats, often emphasizing capabilities beyond simple loading and writing, such as image segmentation and filtering.

Therefore, the "supported" image formats aren't a fixed list inherent to Keras. Instead, it's determined by the capabilities of the chosen image processing library, which then seamlessly integrates with the Keras model.  This indirect relationship necessitates careful library selection based on project requirementsâ€”considering both the breadth of format support and the desired performance characteristics.  The lack of direct format support within Keras is a design choice, promoting flexibility and avoiding unnecessary dependencies within the core framework.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how to load images using different libraries within a Keras workflow.  Note that error handling and more sophisticated preprocessing steps are omitted for brevity.

**Example 1: Using OpenCV (cv2)**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Load an image using OpenCV
image = cv2.imread("my_image.jpg") # Supports .jpg, .png, .tiff and many more

# Convert to RGB if necessary (OpenCV loads in BGR by default)
image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Resize the image to match the input shape of your model
image = cv2.resize(image, (224, 224))

# Normalize pixel values to the range [0,1]
image = image.astype(np.float32) / 255.0

# Reshape to match Keras input shape (add batch dimension)
image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)

# Now the 'image' array is ready to be fed to your Keras model.
predictions = model.predict(image)
```

This example leverages OpenCV's efficiency for image loading and preprocessing.  The conversion to RGB and normalization steps are crucial for compatibility with most Keras models.  The `np.expand_dims` function adds the batch dimension required by Keras.  OpenCV's broad format support makes it a highly versatile option.


**Example 2: Using Pillow (PIL)**

```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Load an image using Pillow
image = Image.open("my_image.png") # Supports .png, .jpg, .bmp, and many more

# Convert to RGB if necessary (Pillow handles this automatically for most formats)
image = image.convert("RGB")

# Resize the image to match the input shape of your model
image = image.resize((224, 224))

# Convert to numpy array and normalize
image = np.array(image)
image = image.astype(np.float32) / 255.0

# Reshape to match Keras input shape
image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)

# Feed to the Keras model
predictions = model.predict(image)
```

Pillow offers a simpler, more Pythonic API. Automatic handling of RGB conversion in many cases simplifies the code.  However, for extremely large datasets, OpenCV might provide a performance advantage.

**Example 3: Using Scikit-image**

```python
from skimage import io, transform
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Load an image using scikit-image
image = io.imread("my_image.tif") # Supports .tif, .png, .jpg, among others

# Resize the image
image = transform.resize(image, (224, 224))

# Normalize pixel values
image = image.astype(np.float32)

# Reshape to match Keras input shape
image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)

# Feed to Keras model
predictions = model.predict(image)
```

Scikit-image is best suited when image processing tasks beyond simple loading and resizing are required. The example shows straightforward loading and resizing, showcasing its ease of integration with Keras.  However, its format support might be slightly less extensive than OpenCV or Pillow for some less common formats.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of image processing in Python, I recommend consulting the official documentation for OpenCV, Pillow, and Scikit-image.  Thorough familiarity with NumPy is also crucial for efficient image manipulation within the Keras workflow.  Exploring tutorials and examples specifically focusing on image preprocessing for deep learning models will enhance your ability to handle diverse image formats and optimize your image loading pipeline.  A comprehensive textbook on digital image processing can offer valuable insights into the underlying principles.  Finally, reviewing the TensorFlow/Keras documentation concerning input data preprocessing techniques will be extremely beneficial for practical implementation.
