TensorFlow 2 datasets, particularly when constructed from sources like pandas DataFrames, often require splitting into subsets for tasks such as training and validation. The key to achieving this division based on column names lies in carefully manipulating the dataset’s structure before converting it into a `tf.data.Dataset` object. Directly operating on `tf.data.Dataset` with column names isn’t supported because datasets are fundamentally sequences of tensors, not named data structures. I've found that a common and effective strategy involves preprocessing the data using pandas, a prerequisite for creating the initial dataset in many cases, before dataset conversion. This approach provides greater flexibility and clarity over attempting such operations directly on the TensorFlow dataset.

Here's how I approach this, based on my experience:

**1. Preprocessing with Pandas**

The core principle is to use pandas to define the columns you want to separate, then convert these resulting pandas DataFrames into two distinct `tf.data.Dataset` instances. This avoids complex lambda functions or direct manipulation within TensorFlow's dataset API, simplifying the process.

*   **Identifying Target Columns:** First, determine the names of the columns needed for each dataset. These names should accurately reflect your specific needs, for instance, 'feature_1', 'feature_2' for the first dataset and 'target_variable' for the second.
*   **Creating Sub-DataFrames:** Leverage pandas' indexing capabilities to extract two new DataFrames, each containing only the specified columns. This allows for independent management of each dataset before their conversion to TensorFlow Datasets.
*   **Conversion to `tf.data.Dataset`:** After extracting data subsets, each DataFrame is converted to a corresponding `tf.data.Dataset` using the `.from_tensor_slices()` method. This function efficiently transforms each row into a tensor, thereby allowing it to become a part of TensorFlow's dataset API.

**2. Code Examples**

Below are three examples demonstrating different use cases and complexities you might encounter:

**Example 1: Simple Feature and Target Split**

This example demonstrates the basic splitting of a DataFrame into a feature dataset and a target dataset.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd

# Fictional training data
data = {'feature_1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        'feature_2': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        'target_variable': [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define column names for features and target
feature_cols = ['feature_1', 'feature_2']
target_col = ['target_variable']

# Create separate DataFrames
feature_df = df[feature_cols]
target_df = df[target_col]

# Convert to TensorFlow Datasets
feature_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(feature_df.to_dict('list'))
target_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(target_df.to_dict('list'))

# Print the shapes to verify
print("Feature dataset element_spec:", feature_dataset.element_spec)
print("Target dataset element_spec:", target_dataset.element_spec)
```

*Commentary:* In this case, I first create a pandas DataFrame.  I then explicitly define lists holding feature column names and the single target column name. After creating the sub-DataFrames, I convert each to a `tf.data.Dataset` using `from_tensor_slices`, and finally print out the shapes of the datasets to confirm the splitting.  The `.to_dict('list')` method is used to create a dictionary where keys are column names and values are lists of elements; this is crucial for `from_tensor_slices` as it expects data to be in this format.

**Example 2: Multiple Feature Splits**

This scenario illustrates splitting into several feature sets, a common requirement in complex modeling.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd

# Fictional data with more features
data = {'feature_1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        'feature_2': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        'feature_3': [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
        'feature_4': [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
        'target_variable': [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define multiple sets of feature columns
feature_set_1_cols = ['feature_1', 'feature_2']
feature_set_2_cols = ['feature_3', 'feature_4']
target_col = ['target_variable']

# Create separate DataFrames
feature_set_1_df = df[feature_set_1_cols]
feature_set_2_df = df[feature_set_2_cols]
target_df = df[target_col]

# Convert to TensorFlow Datasets
feature_set_1_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(feature_set_1_df.to_dict('list'))
feature_set_2_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(feature_set_2_df.to_dict('list'))
target_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(target_df.to_dict('list'))

# Print dataset info
print("Feature set 1 dataset element_spec:", feature_set_1_dataset.element_spec)
print("Feature set 2 dataset element_spec:", feature_set_2_dataset.element_spec)
print("Target dataset element_spec:", target_dataset.element_spec)
```

*Commentary:* This example expands on the first by splitting the DataFrame into two distinct feature sets in addition to the target set. This approach is extremely useful for scenarios involving different feature types or when implementing branching model architectures. By managing each feature set in its own dataset, we retain control and clarity, simplifying later operations such as concatenation in TensorFlow.

**Example 3: Handling Mixed Data Types**

This example illustrates how to handle mixed data types, such as categorical and numerical, which are common in real-world datasets.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd

# Fictional data with mixed types
data = {'numerical_feature': [1.0, 2.5, 3.7, 4.2, 5.1],
        'categorical_feature': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'B'],
        'target_variable': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define column names
numerical_cols = ['numerical_feature']
categorical_cols = ['categorical_feature']
target_col = ['target_variable']

# Convert categorical to numerical using one-hot encoding
categorical_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df[categorical_cols], prefix='cat')
df = pd.concat([df, categorical_encoded], axis=1)
df.drop(columns=categorical_cols, inplace=True)

# Create separate DataFrames
numerical_df = df[numerical_cols]
categorical_encoded_df = df[categorical_encoded.columns]
target_df = df[target_col]

# Convert to TensorFlow Datasets
numerical_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(numerical_df.to_dict('list'))
categorical_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(categorical_encoded_df.to_dict('list'))
target_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(target_df.to_dict('list'))


# Print dataset info
print("Numerical feature dataset element_spec:", numerical_dataset.element_spec)
print("Categorical feature dataset element_spec:", categorical_dataset.element_spec)
print("Target dataset element_spec:", target_dataset.element_spec)

```

*Commentary:* This example adds a common complexity—mixed data types. Before dataset creation, I perform one-hot encoding on the categorical features using pandas, converting them to numerical data. The numerical data and the encoded categorical data are then separated into two datasets respectively, alongside the target dataset. This preprocessing step ensures that TensorFlow can process all features effectively, regardless of their initial type.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

To further enhance understanding of TensorFlow datasets and data manipulation, I suggest referring to these resources:

*   **Official TensorFlow Documentation:** The most comprehensive and accurate information about using the `tf.data` API is available on the official TensorFlow website. It covers all aspects of dataset creation, transformation, and usage. Specifically focusing on the `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` method would be beneficial.
*   **Pandas Documentation:** The pandas library is crucial for preparing data for machine learning. The official pandas documentation provides detailed information about DataFrame indexing, column selection, and other critical data manipulation operations. Familiarizing yourself with methods like `.loc[]`, `[[]]`, and `get_dummies()` is essential.
*   **Machine Learning Books:** Several introductory machine learning books cover dataset preprocessing and preparation. These books frequently include chapters dedicated to using tools like pandas for this purpose. Pay particular attention to sections related to data cleaning, encoding, and splitting into training/validation sets.

By combining effective pandas preprocessing techniques with the flexibility of the `tf.data.Dataset` API, datasets can be partitioned efficiently by column names, enabling complex modeling scenarios with relative ease and clarity. The key, based on my experience, is to understand the format each function operates on and leverage the strengths of both pandas and TensorFlow’s dataset pipeline.
