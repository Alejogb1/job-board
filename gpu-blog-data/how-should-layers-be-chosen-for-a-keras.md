The optimal number of layers and neurons within each layer for a Keras neural network isn't dictated by a single formula; rather, it's a nuanced decision driven by the specific characteristics of the dataset and the complexity of the problem.  My experience across numerous projects, from image classification with tens of thousands of samples to time-series forecasting with highly correlated features, has highlighted the crucial role of iterative experimentation guided by performance metrics.  There is no "one-size-fits-all" approach.

**1. Understanding the Trade-Offs:**

A deeper network, possessing more layers, theoretically offers the capacity to learn more complex relationships within data.  This increased representational power comes at a cost.  Overly deep networks are prone to overfitting, where the model memorizes the training data rather than generalizing to unseen data.  Furthermore, deeper networks require significantly more computational resources for training and are more susceptible to vanishing or exploding gradients, hindering the learning process. Conversely, shallow networks with fewer layers may lack the capacity to model intricate patterns, resulting in underfitting and poor generalization.  The optimal architecture lies in finding the balance between representational power and generalization ability.  This balance is often found through a systematic approach of experimentation, incorporating techniques like regularization and cross-validation.

**2. Data-Driven Layer Selection:**

The nature of the dataset plays a decisive role.  High-dimensional datasets, such as those encountered in image processing or natural language processing, often necessitate deeper architectures to capture the intricate features.  Conversely, datasets with fewer features and simpler relationships might be adequately modeled by shallower networks.  The complexity of the task also influences the choice.  Simple binary classification problems may be effectively solved with a relatively shallow network, while intricate multi-class problems or complex regression tasks might require a deeper architecture.


**3.  Code Examples and Commentary:**

Below are three Keras examples demonstrating different network architectures.  Each example focuses on a distinct problem and showcases different approaches to layer selection.  Note that these are simplified examples intended for illustrative purposes; real-world applications often necessitate more sophisticated architectures and hyperparameter tuning.

**Example 1: Simple Binary Classification (Shallow Network)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), #Input Layer with 10 features
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') #Output Layer for Binary Classification
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example utilizes a shallow network for a binary classification problem.  The input layer has 10 features, a single hidden layer with 16 neurons using the ReLU activation function, followed by an output layer with a sigmoid activation for binary classification.  The simplicity reflects the assumption of a relatively straightforward relationship between inputs and output.  The `adam` optimizer and `binary_crossentropy` loss function are standard choices for binary classification.


**Example 2: Multi-Class Image Classification (Deep Convolutional Network)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates a deeper convolutional neural network (CNN) suitable for image classification.  The architecture employs convolutional layers (`Conv2D`) for feature extraction, followed by max-pooling layers (`MaxPooling2D`) for dimensionality reduction.  The `Flatten` layer converts the multi-dimensional output of the convolutional layers into a one-dimensional vector for the fully connected dense layer.  The final layer has 10 neurons with a softmax activation for multi-class classification.  The depth of this network is justified by the complexity inherent in image data.


**Example 3: Time Series Forecasting (Recurrent Network with LSTM)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    keras.layers.LSTM(32),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example illustrates a recurrent neural network (RNN) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units for time-series forecasting.  The input shape specifies the number of timesteps and features in the time-series data.  The use of stacked LSTMs (`return_sequences=True` for the first layer) allows the network to capture long-range dependencies within the time series. The output layer has a single neuron for regression. The architecture reflects the temporal nature of the data and the potential for long-range dependencies.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For a more in-depth understanding of neural network architectures and the process of layer selection, I recommend consulting "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville;  "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron; and the Keras documentation itself.  Careful study of these resources, combined with practical experimentation, will provide a robust foundation for making informed decisions about network architecture.  Remember that careful monitoring of training and validation metrics, along with techniques like regularization and early stopping, is critical to avoid overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.  Systematic hyperparameter tuning using tools such as grid search or randomized search are also highly beneficial.  The process is iterative and requires both theoretical understanding and practical experimentation.
