The Keras Functional API inherently requires an input tensor specification, rendering the direct creation of a model without explicit input definition impossible. However, the *perception* of a model existing without an explicit `Input` layer is often the result of specific architectural patterns or implicit input handling during the model's functional construction.

My work frequently involves constructing complex deep learning models for image segmentation and natural language processing. I've encountered situations where the explicit `Input` layer might seem to disappear within the model's architecture, but a thorough analysis always revealed that it’s being handled, albeit sometimes in less obvious ways. This isn't magic; it's simply how Keras is designed and implemented. The Functional API centers on the idea of layers as callable objects taking a tensor as input, eventually producing another tensor. To initiate this process, we need a starting tensor, the symbolic representation of the data that will feed into the model.

The absence of a visibly defined `Input` layer most often stems from cases where a preceding layer’s output serves as the implicit input. Consider a scenario where you have a custom layer or model that outputs a tensor. When you use this output to build another model using the Functional API, you may be led to believe that you haven't specified an input. However, the initial layer (or model) itself *has* an input specification, and the tensor generated by its output acts as a starting point for the second model. The Functional API demands that each layer receiving input is connected, directly or indirectly, to such a symbolic tensor.

A key element to remember is that Keras operates on symbolic tensors, not actual data, during the model building phase. Therefore, even if an input layer is not explicitly named or defined using `keras.layers.Input`, the model will trace back its connections to the originating tensor source that was created at some point. The `keras.Model` object encapsulates all these connections and understands the data flow and model structure only when it has a path back to the start (the initial input tensor, directly or indirectly from a layer that was designed with an explicit input).

Let’s examine some code snippets to illustrate these concepts.

**Example 1: Direct Input Layer Usage**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Explicit Input layer defined
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1)) # Symbolic input for 28x28 grayscale image
x = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_tensor)
x = layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Flatten()(x)
output_tensor = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)
model.summary()
```
This is the canonical method of creating a Functional API model. An `Input` layer is explicitly created, its output fed into subsequent layers, and the resulting output is linked back to the input layer in the construction of the model. The `model.summary()` reveals the presence of an "input\_1" layer.

**Example 2: Implicit Input via Preceding Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define a custom layer
class CustomLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
      super(CustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
      self.units = units
      self.dense = layers.Dense(units, activation="relu")

    def call(self, inputs):
      return self.dense(inputs)

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.dense.build(input_shape)


# Create a custom input source via the custom layer and its build method
custom_input = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
custom_out = CustomLayer()(custom_input)

# Model using the previous custom layer as its input source
x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(custom_out)
output_tensor = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

model = keras.Model(inputs=custom_input, outputs=output_tensor)
model.summary()
```

Here, I've defined a custom `CustomLayer`. While there is no visible `keras.layers.Input` directly used as input to the *second model*, the custom layer's output is feeding that model. The crucial detail is that within `CustomLayer`, during its `build` method (implicit during layer instantiation), the layer’s own `dense` layer has an explicit input layer defined. The second model still uses the output from CustomLayer as its implicit input, and traces back during model construction. The model's summary shows that it understands how to receive input from the "input\_2" layer (implicitly from `CustomLayer`).

**Example 3: Input via a Sub-Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers


# Define a sub-model
input_sub = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x_sub = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_sub)
output_sub = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(x_sub)

sub_model = keras.Model(inputs=input_sub, outputs=output_sub)

# Second model taking output of sub-model as input source
input_model = keras.Input(shape=(10,)) # Original input
sub_model_out = sub_model(input_model)
x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(sub_model_out)
output_tensor = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_model, outputs=output_tensor)
model.summary()
```

In this example, I create a complete sub-model which itself has an explicit input layer, `input_sub`. When using this sub-model as part of a larger model, the input is fed *through* it. While the larger model does not directly receive an initial input that triggers model behavior by creating `layers.Input`, the sub-model already had such an input defined, and during the second models construction it traces back through that sub-model’s `input_sub`. The `input_model` in the main model serves as the final input to that model.

These examples reveal that while a Functional API model needs an input tensor somewhere in its graph, it does not necessarily need an explicit `keras.layers.Input` layer *at the start of its own definition*. When there’s no explicit `keras.layers.Input` at the model’s definition, it is because a preceding layer or model has already provided that initial symbolic tensor. In all cases, the Keras model is always constructed with the understanding of where the input is sourced and the flow of data from that tensor.

To further understand and deepen expertise on this topic, I recommend reviewing:

*   The official Keras documentation, which contains detailed sections on the Functional API and custom layers. Carefully examining examples will illuminate these concepts further.
*   Textbooks on Deep Learning, which often discuss architectural design patterns using Keras, which might inadvertently mask how Keras uses its `Input` layer.
*   TensorFlow tutorials and official examples related to the Functional API and Model subclassing, both of which will highlight the interplay between `Input` definition and model composition.

In conclusion, a Keras Functional API model fundamentally cannot exist without an input tensor. The illusion of a model without an input layer is often the result of using preceding layers that implicitly define their own input through either an explicit Input, the `build` method in a custom layer, or within a sub-model. Understanding how Keras traces back these connections clarifies the necessity and existence of inputs even when they're not immediately visible.
