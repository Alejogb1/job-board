A common cause of a Keras model consistently predicting only one label, regardless of the input, arises from a flawed loss function configuration in conjunction with imbalanced training data. I've encountered this situation multiple times during my machine learning projects, particularly when dealing with highly skewed datasets, such as those found in anomaly detection or rare event classification tasks. The model essentially learns to minimize its loss by simply predicting the majority class. This issue reveals a deeper problem than just a coding error; it highlights a deficiency in how the model is being trained and evaluated.

The underlying issue is that the model optimizes towards minimizing the loss function. When data is imbalanced, a naive loss function like categorical cross-entropy applied to imbalanced classes will reward the model for correctly predicting the majority class and punish it more lightly for misclassifying the minority class. The model can achieve a seemingly decent loss by mostly predicting the predominant label, as it has numerous examples of that class, and comparatively few of the others. The gradients calculated during backpropagation will therefore be primarily affected by the majority class, further pushing the model in that direction, regardless of the input data. It is not a failure of the model’s architecture per se, but rather a deficiency in the learning process.

Let's look at a few code examples illustrating this problem and how to address it.

**Example 1: Demonstrating the Issue with Imbalanced Data**

Here, we create a highly imbalanced binary classification dataset. One class has 900 samples, while the other has only 100. We will use a simple dense network with standard categorical cross-entropy.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate imbalanced dataset
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.concatenate([np.zeros(900), np.ones(100)])
y = keras.utils.to_categorical(y, num_classes=2)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_pred_classes = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)
print(f"Predicted Classes: {np.unique(y_pred_classes)}")
```

In this example, the `Predicted Classes` output will most likely display `[0]`, demonstrating that the model has learned to predominantly, if not exclusively, predict the majority class (class `0`). The seemingly high accuracy will not be meaningful. It is clear the loss function, when used directly with unbalanced data, directs the model to a degenerate solution.

**Example 2: Addressing Imbalance with Class Weights**

One common technique to mitigate this is using class weights. By assigning larger weights to the minority class during loss calculation, the model is penalized more severely for misclassifying it. This forces the model to pay attention to those samples.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.utils import class_weight


# Generate imbalanced dataset (same as before)
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.concatenate([np.zeros(900), np.ones(100)])
y = keras.utils.to_categorical(y, num_classes=2)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Calculate class weights
y_train_labels = np.argmax(y_train, axis=1)
class_weights = class_weight.compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(y_train_labels), y=y_train_labels)
class_weights_dict = dict(enumerate(class_weights))


# Define the model (same as before)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0, class_weight=class_weights_dict)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_pred_classes = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)
print(f"Predicted Classes: {np.unique(y_pred_classes)}")
```

Here, the `class_weight` argument in `model.fit()` tells the model to consider class imbalance when computing loss. We calculate class weights using scikit-learn's `class_weight.compute_class_weight` using the `'balanced'` argument to have inverse weighting proportional to class frequency. The printed output is now far more likely to show a broader range of predicted classes, such as `[0, 1]`, indicating the model has learned to distinguish between the two classes to some degree.

**Example 3: Alternative Loss Function: Focal Loss**

Another powerful technique to address imbalanced data is to use an alternative loss function such as Focal Loss. Focal Loss down-weights the loss contribution of easily classified samples and focuses on harder-to-classify ones. I have found that focal loss often works well on highly imbalanced data. While Keras does not have a built-in implementation, it is straightforward to create. Note this simplified implementation is for binary classification; further modifications are necessary for multiclass problems.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split


# Generate imbalanced dataset (same as before)
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.concatenate([np.zeros(900), np.ones(100)])
y = keras.utils.to_categorical(y, num_classes=2)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


def focal_loss(gamma=2., alpha=.25):
    def focal_loss_fixed(y_true, y_pred):
        pt_1 = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true, 1), y_pred, tf.ones_like(y_pred))
        pt_0 = tf.where(tf.equal(y_true, 0), y_pred, tf.zeros_like(y_pred))
        epsilon = 1e-7
        pt_1 = tf.clip_by_value(pt_1, epsilon, 1. - epsilon)
        pt_0 = tf.clip_by_value(pt_0, epsilon, 1. - epsilon)
        return -tf.reduce_sum(alpha * tf.pow(1. - pt_1, gamma) * tf.math.log(pt_1))-tf.reduce_sum((1-alpha) * tf.pow( pt_0, gamma) * tf.math.log(1 - pt_0))

    return focal_loss_fixed

# Define the model (same as before)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])


model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=focal_loss(), metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_pred_classes = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)
print(f"Predicted Classes: {np.unique(y_pred_classes)}")
```

Here, the `focal_loss` function defines a custom loss that penalizes misclassifications of the minority class more and correctly classifying the majority class less. The parameter `gamma` controls the focusing effect, and `alpha` weights the classes. With the focal loss, the model should achieve better class separation and predict a more diverse set of labels. I recommend experimentation to determine suitable values for these hyperparameters.

Beyond these specific examples, several other tactics might be necessary to fully address the issue. Data augmentation techniques can be used to increase the number of minority class samples. Over-sampling the minority class by duplicating samples, or generating synthetic samples using methods like SMOTE can also be beneficial. It’s crucial to evaluate performance using metrics other than overall accuracy when dealing with imbalanced data. Precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) will provide a more complete view of performance.

In summary, a model predicting only one label often suggests a problem with the training data imbalance and the choice of the loss function. Addressing this imbalance using methods such as class weights, alternative loss functions, or data augmentation will improve your model’s learning capacity and its ability to predict a broader set of classes. I suggest exploring tutorials and guides on imbalanced classification found in machine learning textbooks and documentation related to scikit-learn and TensorFlow for a deeper understanding. Consulting scholarly articles on specialized loss functions would be useful as well. I also recommend working through the examples given here on your machine, observing the differences in results, and gradually varying parameters to gain intuition on how these techniques behave.
