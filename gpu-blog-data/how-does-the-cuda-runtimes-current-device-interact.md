The CUDA runtime’s manipulation of the current device, and how this interacts with the driver context stack, forms a crucial, yet sometimes opaque, aspect of efficient GPU programming. From experience developing high-performance computing applications, understanding this interaction is fundamental to avoiding both performance bottlenecks and outright errors. The runtime and the driver operate at different levels of abstraction, each managing resources and execution in a distinct manner. The runtime, provided through libraries like `libcudart.so` or `cudart64_xx.dll`, exposes a high-level API to application developers, while the driver, a lower-level kernel component, directly interfaces with the GPU hardware. This separation dictates the structure of the driver context stack.

At the driver level, each GPU’s resources are associated with a *driver context*. Think of this context as a self-contained environment encompassing all necessary information for an application to execute on a particular device, including memory allocations, kernel launch queues, and device attributes. Multiple applications, even within the same process, can utilize the same GPU concurrently, each operating within its unique driver context.

The CUDA runtime manages which of these driver contexts is the "current" one for the executing thread. This concept of a current device and its associated context is implicit in most CUDA API calls, though often abstracted away. When a CUDA application calls functions like `cudaMalloc`, `cudaMemcpy`, or `cudaLaunchKernel`, these operations operate implicitly within the current driver context associated with the current device. The runtime ensures this context is active for the calling thread. Failure to manage the current device correctly can lead to errors or corruption due to operating on the wrong resources.

The CUDA runtime uses a thread-local mechanism to track the current device. Specifically, when a CUDA application is launched, there is no default current device. Calling `cudaSetDevice()` or implicitly selecting a device with some functions (like `cudaGetDeviceProperties()`) will set this thread-local variable. Further CUDA operations within the same thread will then be tied to the selected device. The runtime maintains a pool of these driver contexts, one for each device and potentially more if context sharing is enabled (though this is less common).

The driver context stack is LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) in its logical behavior, managed by a combination of the runtime and driver. Although explicit stack manipulation isn't exposed directly to the application developer, context switching occurs when the current device is changed via the `cudaSetDevice()` function. When a context is switched, the current thread’s operations on CUDA resources are redirected to the new device's context.

Here's how the context switching process works: When `cudaSetDevice(newDevice)` is called, the runtime first checks if the new device has a driver context associated with the current application. If not, it will request that the driver create it, then pushes the current thread's existing context onto an internal stack, making the new device's context the current. Subsequent CUDA operations are then executed within the context for `newDevice`. When `cudaSetDevice(oldDevice)` is called again, the new current context, which was already on the stack, is popped, and made the new context. This mechanism ensures that multiple devices can be utilized within a single application.

Below are some code examples demonstrating how this system operates:

**Example 1: Basic Device Selection and Memory Allocation**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        std::cerr << "No CUDA devices found." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    for (int device = 0; device < deviceCount; ++device) {
        cudaSetDevice(device);
        cudaDeviceProp prop;
        cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device);
        std::cout << "Device " << device << ": " << prop.name << std::endl;

        float *d_data;
        size_t size = 1024 * sizeof(float);
        cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, size);

        if (d_data == nullptr){
            std::cerr << "Memory allocation failed for device " << device << std::endl;
            return 1;
         }
        cudaFree(d_data);
        std::cout << "Memory allocated and freed successfully on device " << device << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code iterates through available devices. Inside the loop, `cudaSetDevice()` selects the current device and, behind the scenes, makes its associated driver context the current context. `cudaMalloc` and `cudaFree` operate within this device's context; each call to `cudaMalloc` reserves memory *specifically on that device*. If a context did not exist, a new one would be created by the driver, as explained. The program also checks for successful memory allocation to exemplify some of the error handling considerations related to contexts.

**Example 2: Multi-threaded Device Usage (illustrative, does not fully guarantee parallel execution)**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>

void deviceTask(int device) {
    cudaSetDevice(device);
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device);
    std::cout << "Thread on device " << device << ": " << prop.name << std::endl;

    float *d_data;
    size_t size = 512 * sizeof(float);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, size);

    if(d_data == nullptr){
       std::cerr << "Memory allocation failed for device " << device << std::endl;
       return;
    }

    // Simulate device work
    for (int i=0; i<1000000; i++) {}

    cudaFree(d_data);
    std::cout << "Thread on device " << device << ": memory freed." << std::endl;

}

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        std::cerr << "No CUDA devices found." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    std::vector<std::thread> threads;
    for (int device = 0; device < deviceCount; ++device) {
       threads.emplace_back(deviceTask, device);
    }

    for (auto& thread : threads) {
       thread.join();
    }


    return 0;
}
```

In this example, each thread selects a unique CUDA device using `cudaSetDevice()`. Importantly, each thread has its *own* current device, managed thread-locally by the runtime. This highlights that the driver context and device are specific to each thread. Memory allocation in `cudaMalloc` again occurs within the current context specific to the executing thread and the selected device. Each thread's context is essentially pushed to the stack when it sets the device, and then freed when the thread finishes running. It is also worth noting that for parallel execution you would also need to use multiple CUDA streams.

**Example 3: Incorrect Device Management (showing errors)**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (deviceCount < 2) {
        std::cerr << "Need at least 2 CUDA devices." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    float *d_data1, *d_data2;
    size_t size = 1024 * sizeof(float);
    cudaSetDevice(0);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data1, size);

    cudaSetDevice(1);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data2, size);


    cudaSetDevice(0);
    //Note:  d_data2 was allocated on device 1, and is being freed in device 0's context
    //     This is incorrect behavior and will likely result in a CUDA error
    cudaFree(d_data2);
    cudaFree(d_data1);


    return 0;
}
```

This example highlights a critical error. `d_data1` is allocated on device 0, and `d_data2` on device 1. Then the current device is set back to 0 using `cudaSetDevice()`. However, `cudaFree(d_data2)` is now being called within the context of device 0, while the memory was allocated in the context of device 1. This causes a CUDA runtime error since attempting to free memory allocated under a different device context violates the resource management rules. This demonstrates the importance of tracking and respecting the current device and its corresponding context. The program highlights that resource operations like free, copy, and kernel launch must be within the correct context.

For further exploration, consider exploring resources on CUDA programming, focusing on multi-GPU concepts and the implications of thread-local state. Understanding the mechanics of thread affinity when working with multiple GPUs is also critical. Books on GPU Computing and the NVIDIA CUDA Programming Guide are good starting points. These references provide in-depth explanations of the CUDA architecture, memory management, and the nuances of multi-device programming that expand on the context stack concepts presented here.
