TensorFlow 2's Quantization Aware Training (QAT) can indeed be implemented using `tf.GradientTape`, though it requires a careful and somewhat manual construction of the quantization process within the training loop. The framework's built-in QAT API, while more convenient, often abstracts away the precise control some researchers or practitioners might need. I've found that this manual approach offers a deeper understanding and greater flexibility when exploring customized quantization schemes.

The core principle of QAT, when implemented via `tf.GradientTape`, is that the gradient calculations must be performed on quantized values, while the weights are updated using standard floating-point arithmetic. This distinction is key to ensuring that the model learns to adapt to the limitations imposed by quantization during the training process, not after. The process I've generally followed involves three main stages within each training step: forward pass with simulated quantization, gradient calculation, and weight update using the original floating-point parameters.

First, during the forward pass, the network's outputs must be calculated using quantized activations and weights. It's essential to understand that you're not *actually* converting your weights to, say, INT8 values in-place. Instead, during the forward pass, you are *simulating* the quantization by applying a quantization and dequantization operator to the weights and activations before performing the multiplication and subsequent layer operations. This requires keeping a separate, floating-point copy of all trainable variables.

Second, when calculating the gradients using `tf.GradientTape`, it is crucial to compute these gradients against the *quantized* computations done within the `tf.GradientTape` context. If you were to compute the loss using floating point operations, the model wouldn't learn to be more resilient to quantization errors. The gradients computed in this way will also be floating-point values.

Third, the weight update needs to occur using the *original* floating-point weights. This update step is then performed using the computed gradients from the second step. We then simply replace the floating-point weights with the newly updated values. This maintains the high precision of the parameter updates while still ensuring the loss is computed against quantized outputs.

Below are three examples to help illustrate this process:

**Example 1: Basic Quantization of a Dense Layer**

This example showcases quantization applied to the weights of a simple dense layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class QuantizedDense(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(QuantizedDense, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w_fp = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                   initializer="glorot_uniform",
                                   trainable=True,
                                   name='weight_fp')
        self.b_fp = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                   initializer="zeros",
                                   trainable=True,
                                   name='bias_fp')


    def call(self, inputs):
        scale_w = 0.1 # Example scale, needs calibration in a real setting
        zero_point_w = 0 # Example zero point, needs calibration
        w_quant = tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars(self.w_fp,
                                                             min=-1.0*scale_w,
                                                             max=1.0*scale_w)
        b_quant = tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars(self.b_fp,
                                                             min=-1.0*scale_w,
                                                             max=1.0*scale_w)
        return tf.matmul(inputs, w_quant) + b_quant

def train_step(model, x, y, optimizer):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)(y, y_pred)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, [var for var in model.trainable_variables if 'fp' in var.name])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, [var for var in model.trainable_variables if 'fp' in var.name]))
    return loss

# Dummy data and setup for example purposes
x = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y = tf.one_hot(tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32), depth=2)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([QuantizedDense(2)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
for _ in range(100):
    loss = train_step(model, x, y, optimizer)
    print(f"Loss {loss.numpy():0.4f}", end='\r')
```

In this example, `QuantizedDense` keeps a floating-point copy of the weight and bias (`self.w_fp`, `self.b_fp`). Inside `call`, the weights and bias are "quantized" using `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars`. Crucially, `train_step` calculates gradients based on these quantized values. It's vital to note that the update occurs directly to the `w_fp`, and `b_fp`, maintaining high-precision parameters.

**Example 2: Quantization of Activations**

This example extends Example 1, including the simulated quantization of activations:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
class QuantizedLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(QuantizedLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w_fp = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                   initializer="glorot_uniform",
                                   trainable=True,
                                   name='weight_fp')
        self.b_fp = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                   initializer="zeros",
                                   trainable=True,
                                   name='bias_fp')
    def call(self, inputs):
        scale_w = 0.1  # Example, needs calibration
        zero_point_w = 0 # Example zero point, needs calibration
        scale_a = 1.0  # Example, needs calibration
        zero_point_a = 0 # Example zero point, needs calibration
        w_quant = tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars(self.w_fp,
                                                             min=-1.0*scale_w,
                                                             max=1.0*scale_w)
        b_quant = tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars(self.b_fp,
                                                             min=-1.0*scale_w,
                                                             max=1.0*scale_w)
        output = tf.matmul(inputs, w_quant) + b_quant
        output_quant = tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars(output,
                                                             min=-1.0*scale_a,
                                                             max=1.0*scale_a)
        return output_quant

def train_step(model, x, y, optimizer):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)(y, y_pred)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, [var for var in model.trainable_variables if 'fp' in var.name])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, [var for var in model.trainable_variables if 'fp' in var.name]))
    return loss

# Dummy data and setup
x = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y = tf.one_hot(tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32), depth=2)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([QuantizedLayer(2)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

for _ in range(100):
    loss = train_step(model, x, y, optimizer)
    print(f"Loss {loss.numpy():0.4f}", end='\r')
```

In `QuantizedLayer`, the activation `output` is also quantized before being returned. Both weight and activation quantization is simulated using `fake_quant_with_min_max_vars`. This is a more complete example of a single layer with both weight and activation quantization. The training loop remains identical to that of Example 1, ensuring weight updates still happen in floating-point space.

**Example 3: More Complex Network with Multiple Layers**

This final example demonstrates how this could be applied to a more complex network.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class QuantizedModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(QuantizedModel, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = QuantizedLayer(32)
        self.layer2 = QuantizedLayer(10)

    def call(self, x):
      x = self.layer1(x)
      return self.layer2(x)

class QuantizedLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(QuantizedLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w_fp = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                   initializer="glorot_uniform",
                                   trainable=True,
                                   name='weight_fp')
        self.b_fp = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                   initializer="zeros",
                                   trainable=True,
                                   name='bias_fp')

    def call(self, inputs):
        scale_w = 0.1  # Example, needs calibration
        zero_point_w = 0 # Example zero point, needs calibration
        scale_a = 1.0  # Example, needs calibration
        zero_point_a = 0 # Example zero point, needs calibration
        w_quant = tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars(self.w_fp,
                                                             min=-1.0*scale_w,
                                                             max=1.0*scale_w)
        b_quant = tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars(self.b_fp,
                                                             min=-1.0*scale_w,
                                                             max=1.0*scale_w)
        output = tf.matmul(inputs, w_quant) + b_quant
        output_quant = tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars(output,
                                                             min=-1.0*scale_a,
                                                             max=1.0*scale_a)
        return output_quant

def train_step(model, x, y, optimizer):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)(y, y_pred)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, [var for var in model.trainable_variables if 'fp' in var.name])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, [var for var in model.trainable_variables if 'fp' in var.name]))
    return loss

# Dummy data and setup
x = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y = tf.one_hot(tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32), depth=10)

model = QuantizedModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

for _ in range(100):
    loss = train_step(model, x, y, optimizer)
    print(f"Loss {loss.numpy():0.4f}", end='\r')
```
Here, `QuantizedModel` now consists of two `QuantizedLayer` objects. This demonstrates how the described technique can be extended to larger networks. The core logic behind both the quantization and training process remains the same.

Regarding further learning, I would recommend consulting a range of resources. The official TensorFlow documentation on quantization is a good starting point for understanding the basic concepts. Research papers on quantization techniques can offer a deeper dive into different quantization schemes. Finally, experimenting with different quantization parameters, and even other quantization strategies is key to developing a strong understanding of the trade-offs involved. It is important to calibrate the quantization parameters based on the range of data encountered during training.

By taking control of the QAT process in this manner, it is possible to customize your method of quantization, and also gain a much deeper understanding of the nuances involved in successfully creating quantized models using TensorFlow. The key aspects are ensuring you use the quantized weights and activations for forward pass and gradients, and the high-precision weights for updates.
