TensorFlow models frequently output probabilities even when a binary classification is intended due to the activation function used in the final layer and the chosen loss function during training. The combination of these factors dictates the model's interpretative approach to the data it processes.

Let’s delve into the mechanics. A typical binary classification task aims to categorize data into one of two classes, often represented as 0 and 1. Internally, however, most neural networks don’t directly output these discrete values. Instead, they produce a continuous output that is then transformed into probabilities, generally ranging from 0 to 1. This transformation occurs via the application of an activation function on the final layer’s output. The most common activation function used for probability generation in binary classification is the sigmoid function. It compresses the range of any real number into a value between 0 and 1, effectively turning the network’s output into a probability that the input belongs to the “positive” class (class 1). This is distinct from the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), commonly employed in internal layers which does not possess this inherent probability-generating capability.

The loss function used during training further reinforces this. For binary classification, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss is predominantly favored. BCE is explicitly designed to minimize the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true binary labels. It penalizes the model more when the predicted probability is far from the actual class label. Consequently, the model is driven to output values that are meaningfully interpreted as probabilities. This combination ensures that the output from your network aligns with the probabilistic interpretation, rather than discrete labels.

To convert these predicted probabilities into binary labels, you typically apply a threshold. A common choice is 0.5. Any probability equal to or greater than 0.5 is considered a prediction for class 1, and any probability below 0.5 is assigned to class 0. This thresholding is not part of the model’s output itself, but rather a post-processing step that is crucial for making discrete classifications. Therefore, the model itself is not inherently predicting binary labels; it is predicting the probability of belonging to the positive class.

Now, let's look at some examples.

**Example 1: Basic Binary Classification Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Model definition
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), #10 input features
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') #Output with sigmoid
])

# Optimizer and loss function
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

# Example training data and labels
X_train = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32) # Convert y to int
y_train = tf.cast(y_train, tf.float32) #Convert y to float for binary cross entropy
y_train = tf.clip_by_value(y_train, 0.0, 1.0)  #Ensure labels are strictly 0 and 1


# Training
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)


# Prediction (outputs probabilities)
predictions_proba = model.predict(X_train)
print(predictions_proba[:5]) #Print the first five probabilities
```

In this example, the final dense layer has one neuron and uses the 'sigmoid' activation. The output, `predictions_proba`, is a set of values between 0 and 1, representing the predicted probabilities. The model itself doesn’t assign 0 or 1 labels. The BinaryCrossentropy loss function further pushes the model to learn probabilities instead of labels. Note the conversion of `y_train` to `float32`, required for the `BinaryCrossentropy` loss function, which accepts continuous values. Integer 0 and 1 are not valid.

**Example 2: Converting Probabilities to Binary Labels**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# (Assume 'model' is trained as in Example 1)

# Prediction (outputs probabilities)
predictions_proba = model.predict(X_train)

# Thresholding to obtain binary labels
threshold = 0.5
predictions_labels = np.where(predictions_proba >= threshold, 1, 0)

print(predictions_labels[:5]) #Print first five predicted labels
```

Here, we take the model's predicted probabilities and apply a threshold of 0.5. Using `np.where`, any probability greater than or equal to 0.5 is mapped to the class 1 label, and any probability below 0.5 is mapped to the class 0 label. `predictions_labels` now contains our intended binary labels. The model's output itself is not modified. Instead, the transformation occurs after the model’s prediction, as part of the inference process. This step highlights the distinction between probability outputs and binary classifications.

**Example 3: Using Different Activation Functions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Model definition
model_linear = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1) # No activation function for demonstration
])


# Prediction with linear output
predictions_linear = model_linear.predict(X_train)
print(predictions_linear[:5]) # Print the first 5 linear outputs
```

This example omits the 'sigmoid' activation in the last layer. The output `predictions_linear` will no longer be constrained to the range 0-1; hence, no probabilities are produced. These outputs are just the raw values from the network before an activation function is applied. They don't have the inherent characteristic of probabilities needed for binary classification, as these lack context and do not represent a meaningful interpretation of the output as belonging to class 1. Using no activation function like this will fail to train meaningfully using `BinaryCrossentropy`.

To summarize, the model outputs probabilities due to the use of the sigmoid activation in the final layer combined with the Binary Cross-Entropy loss function which enforces this probability behavior during training. This is essential for probabilistic interpretation. Post-processing, like the thresholding method demonstrated, is needed to obtain discrete binary labels for downstream applications such as decision making or evaluation. The model itself does not directly output the binary labels and it is crucial to understand that its output is a continuous representation of the probability.

For continued learning, I would recommend investigating materials that cover the fundamentals of neural networks, specifically focusing on activation functions like sigmoid and their role in probability estimation. Texts on machine learning concepts and applied statistics would provide valuable theoretical grounding. Additionally, documentation on TensorFlow specifically covering binary classification and custom models, along with tutorials and examples on the TensorFlow website, would offer helpful insights and practical skills. Delving into materials on loss functions, especially Binary Cross-Entropy, will further enhance understanding of the learning process and how it affects the model's output. Books focused on applied machine learning provide more hands-on tutorials, especially regarding practical challenges such as threshold selection.
