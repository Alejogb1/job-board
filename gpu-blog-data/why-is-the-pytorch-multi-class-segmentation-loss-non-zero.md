The phenomenon of non-zero loss in multi-class segmentation, even when predicting the ground truth, often arises from the way loss functions handle probabilistic outputs, especially when coupled with one-hot encoding of target data. It’s less about the prediction being incorrect, per se, and more about the inherent mathematical differences between the prediction and target representation within the specific loss function.

My experience, spanning several years developing deep learning systems for medical image analysis, reveals this isn't an uncommon pitfall. Initially, encountering a seemingly perfect prediction still yielding a loss confused me. We’d meticulously label CT scans, train our U-Net model, and then, to rigorously test it, predict on the very same labels, expecting zero loss – a naive but understandable assumption. That’s when I began diving deeper into the mechanics of the loss functions themselves.

The key is this: most PyTorch segmentation losses like `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss` or `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` expect the input to be *logits*, not probability distributions or one-hot encodings. Logits, in essence, are the raw, unnormalized scores produced by the neural network before applying softmax (or a similar transformation). The loss function *internally* performs the softmax transformation to convert those logits to probabilities, before comparing those probabilities against the target. If you directly input one-hot encoded target images as the prediction (or more accurately, pass them through your model without removing any final activation layers to output logits), you're bypassing this crucial internal softmax operation that the loss function is designed to handle.

Let’s break this down. Consider a scenario where you have three classes, and your target image pixel at location (x,y) belongs to class 2. The corresponding one-hot representation will be [0, 1, 0]. If this exact one-hot encoded representation, instead of logits, is passed as the prediction to `CrossEntropyLoss`, the loss function will treat [0, 1, 0] as raw, pre-softmax values. When softmax is applied internally by the loss function, it does not result in the intended probability vector [0, 1, 0]. The softmax converts pre-softmax values into probabilities, ensuring they sum up to one and have values between 0 and 1. A pre-softmax vector like [0,1,0] would become something like [0.26, 0.48, 0.26] with softmax. Subsequently, the cross entropy loss calculates the difference between [0.26, 0.48, 0.26] and the true probability [0, 1, 0], leading to a non-zero loss.

Crucially, the standard practice is for the final layer of a segmentation model to produce a tensor with the *number of channels equal to the number of classes*. The pixel values in these channels then represent the *logits*. We then pass *these logits* to the loss function, and the loss function internally does the required softmax calculation *before* comparing with the target.

Here are three concrete code examples to illustrate this point:

**Example 1: Incorrect Usage - One-Hot as Input to Loss**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

num_classes = 3
batch_size = 2
height, width = 10, 10

# Create a dummy one-hot encoded target image
target = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (batch_size, height, width))
target_onehot = F.one_hot(target, num_classes=num_classes).permute(0, 3, 1, 2).float()

# Simulate prediction directly as the one-hot
prediction = target_onehot #Incorrect!

# Calculate the loss
loss = F.cross_entropy(prediction, target)

print(f"Loss with one-hot directly as input: {loss.item():.4f}")

```

This code demonstrates the core of the problem. We are using one-hot encoded data directly as the prediction for cross_entropy, and therefore, we get a non-zero loss, despite the target and the ‘prediction’ being essentially the same.

**Example 2: Correct Usage – Logits as Input to Loss**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

num_classes = 3
batch_size = 2
height, width = 10, 10

# Create a dummy one-hot encoded target image
target = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (batch_size, height, width))
target_onehot = F.one_hot(target, num_classes=num_classes).permute(0, 3, 1, 2).long()


# Simulate the correct logit output format by adding a random offset
logits = torch.randn(batch_size, num_classes, height, width)

# Calculate the loss
loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, target)

print(f"Loss with logits as input: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

Here, we generate `logits` as normally done by the final layers of neural network, and then pass these `logits` to the loss function. This represents the correct use case when training a neural network, and the loss will reflect the disparity between the predictions and the ground truth.

**Example 3: Manual Softmax and Cross Entropy for Verification**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

num_classes = 3
batch_size = 2
height, width = 10, 10

# Create a dummy one-hot encoded target image
target = torch.randint(0, num_classes, (batch_size, height, width))
target_onehot = F.one_hot(target, num_classes=num_classes).permute(0, 3, 1, 2).float()


# Simulate a non-zero one hot prediction for illustration
prediction = target_onehot + 0.001

# Manually apply softmax
probs = F.softmax(prediction, dim=1)

# Manual cross entropy calculation (not standard PyTorch usage)
loss_manual = -torch.sum(target_onehot * torch.log(probs+1e-8), dim=1).mean()


# Calculate the loss
loss = F.cross_entropy(prediction, target)

print(f"Manual Cross Entropy Loss: {loss_manual.item():.4f}")
print(f"PyTorch Cross Entropy Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")


```

This example demonstrates that if we manually apply softmax before computing the cross-entropy, we do observe the same loss as the PyTorch version. The manual calculation allows us to inspect the internal workings of `cross_entropy` and the role of the softmax, further highlighting why passing the one-hot directly leads to a non-zero loss. We also add a small epsilon value to avoid errors from log(0).

In summary, the non-zero loss when using the target image as the prediction is not due to the prediction being actually different from the target data. Instead, the issue arises from incorrectly using one-hot encoded data directly as input to a loss function expecting logits, which causes a mathematical mismatch in how the internal softmax and cross-entropy calculations are performed.

For further learning, I recommend studying the mathematical definitions of softmax and cross-entropy loss, along with their implementations in PyTorch's documentation. Additionally, review the source code for these functions; such deep dives into the internals of libraries are invaluable. Furthermore, tutorials and articles on semantic segmentation workflows with PyTorch often detail the crucial distinction between logits and probabilities. Texts on deep learning theory, particularly those covering probabilistic interpretations, will further solidify the understanding of why these loss functions are designed to work with unnormalized logits. Practical experimentation, like manipulating the above code examples, will also be very beneficial.
