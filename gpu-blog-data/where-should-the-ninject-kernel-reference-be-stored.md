The proper storage of an NInject kernel reference is a critical, yet often overlooked aspect of dependency injection (DI) implementation, especially within larger applications. A single, poorly managed kernel instance can lead to pervasive coupling and hinder maintainability, effectively negating the benefits that DI seeks to provide. My experience, spanning multiple enterprise-level projects involving complex inter-service dependencies, has shown that the optimal approach is to limit the kernel's scope to the application's composition root, which is typically located within the executable's start-up project and not passed around to other assemblies.

The NInject kernel, at its core, is the engine responsible for managing object creation and resolving dependencies. It holds type mappings, lifecycle management rules, and the necessary mechanics to construct complex object graphs. Direct exposure of this central component throughout an application opens up possibilities for code that bypasses the design goals of DI. When any module can directly interact with the kernel, it becomes trivial to create dependencies outside of the established wiring patterns, undermining the principle of explicit dependency management. Direct kernel access effectively renders the benefits of DI meaningless.

Instead, an application should interact with the DI framework primarily through an abstraction—typically an interface—that exposes only the necessary services. This ensures loose coupling and facilitates testability. Instead of a raw `IKernel`, consuming classes should rely on a dedicated service interface which is registered and resolved by the kernel at the composition root. This adherence to the Dependency Inversion Principle allows for easy mocking and testing of consuming components. It is paramount that dependencies are requested not by their concrete types but rather through interfaces or abstract classes, and the kernel is only used to supply the concrete implementations to fulfill these requests.

Let’s consider some code examples to illustrate these points, using a fictitious application for managing a library. Firstly, consider the following inadequate approach of passing the kernel around:

```csharp
// Bad Practice: Directly passing the kernel
public class BookService
{
    private IKernel _kernel;

    public BookService(IKernel kernel)
    {
        _kernel = kernel;
    }

    public IBookRepository GetRepository()
    {
         return _kernel.Get<IBookRepository>(); // Direct Kernel resolution
    }

   // ... BookService methods...
}

// Somewhere else in the application
public class LibraryController
{
   private BookService _bookService;

   public LibraryController(IKernel kernel) {
        _bookService = new BookService(kernel); // Passing the kernel
   }
    //... Library Controller Methods
}
```

In this example, both `BookService` and `LibraryController` require an `IKernel` instance. This creates a dependency on the DI framework in multiple places, making it harder to replace or change the DI solution. Moreover, the `BookService` directly resolves dependencies using the kernel. It also tightly couples the concrete type `IBookRepository` with the concrete implementation chosen through kernel, making future changes challenging. This pattern proliferates throughout the application with the kernel passed down from the top level controller, making any attempt to change DI provider or refactor extremely risky and difficult.

A much better implementation of the library service and controller would be as follows:

```csharp
// Good Practice: Using constructor injection and service interface

public interface IBookService
{
    IEnumerable<Book> GetAllBooks();
    Book GetBook(int bookId);
    // other book service operations...
}

public class BookService : IBookService
{
    private readonly IBookRepository _bookRepository;

    public BookService(IBookRepository bookRepository)
    {
        _bookRepository = bookRepository;
    }

    public IEnumerable<Book> GetAllBooks()
    {
        return _bookRepository.GetAll();
    }

    public Book GetBook(int bookId)
    {
        return _bookRepository.GetById(bookId);
    }
}

public class LibraryController
{
   private readonly IBookService _bookService;

   public LibraryController(IBookService bookService) {
        _bookService = bookService;
   }
    //... Library Controller Methods, using _bookService.
}
```
In this improved example, `LibraryController` now takes an `IBookService` interface as a dependency. The responsibility of creating the concrete implementation of IBookService, BookService, is relegated to the DI framework at the composition root. This approach is preferred as `BookService` and `LibraryController` do not require knowledge of the DI container. The `BookService` itself relies on an `IBookRepository` interface, making it highly flexible and testable.

Let’s illustrate this at the composition root which would be responsible for all DI registrations. I might include a module for setting up the application. The following code shows a potential module being used by the kernel:

```csharp
// Composition Root (Startup Project)
using Ninject;
using Ninject.Modules;

public class LibraryModule : NinjectModule
{
    public override void Load()
    {
        Bind<IBookRepository>().To<SqlBookRepository>(); // Concrete binding in module
        Bind<IBookService>().To<BookService>();
    }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var kernel = new StandardKernel(new LibraryModule()); // Kernel creation in the composition root

        var libraryController = kernel.Get<LibraryController>();
        // The application now runs, retrieving fully resolved instances
    }
}
```
In this last example, the `StandardKernel` is created only within the `Program` class, which acts as the composition root. We configure all the mappings inside `LibraryModule` which is then loaded by the `StandardKernel` on initialization. This `kernel` is never passed anywhere else. This code avoids the aforementioned anti-pattern of passing the kernel directly.  Instead, the kernel resolves `LibraryController`, and through constructor injection, the controller receives its dependencies as interface instances. The kernel remains localized, and application components interact with their abstractions without any knowledge of NInject.

The key takeaway is that the kernel should be treated as a very localized component within the composition root. Once the application has been configured by the kernel and the root dependencies are resolved, the kernel becomes redundant for regular application operations. By limiting direct interaction with the kernel, we greatly improve maintainability, testability, and adherence to DI principles. This is not just preferred; it’s a crucial element of solid software architecture.

For more information about best practices in dependency injection and NInject specifically, I recommend consulting literature on design patterns and software architecture, paying particular attention to resources discussing the principles of dependency inversion, and SOLID design principles. Also, exploring the documentation for NInject (though be sure to avoid direct link here). Further investigation on the concept of the composition root would also be incredibly beneficial for understanding how DI containers are intended to be employed. Consulting the official documentation or blog posts by well-known DI framework authors and maintainers would provide further guidance for implementation best practice.
