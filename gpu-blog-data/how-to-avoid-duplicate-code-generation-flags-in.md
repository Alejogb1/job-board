Duplicate code generation in CMake-based CUDA/PTX projects often stems from insufficiently granular target definitions and the interplay between CMake's target dependency mechanism and the CUDA compiler's behavior.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous large-scale HPC projects highlights the crucial role of precisely specifying compiler flags at the appropriate scope.  The key is to avoid applying CUDA-specific flags at the project or even library level, instead focusing on individual executables or specific kernel compilation units.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The problem arises because CMake, by default, propagates compile options across targets.  When multiple executables share common CUDA libraries or source files, and these libraries/sources are compiled with CUDA flags, those flags are implicitly inherited by all dependents.  This results in redundant compilation of PTX code, leading to increased build times and potentially inconsistencies if flags inadvertently conflict.

For instance, imagine a project with two executables, `executableA` and `executableB`, both linking against a CUDA library `myCUDALib`. If `myCUDALib` is compiled with specific architecture flags (e.g., `-gencode arch=compute_75,code=sm_75`), both `executableA` and `executableB` will inherit these flags, even if they might require different architectures.  This redundant compilation is the source of the duplicate code generation flags.

The solution involves a shift in perspective.  Instead of applying CUDA architecture flags at the library level, they should be applied *only* when compiling the specific kernel files that will be used by each executable. This requires a more granular approach to target definition and dependency management within CMake.  This granular control ensures that PTX code is generated only once for each unique combination of kernel source, architecture, and other relevant compiler flags.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Approach (Duplicate Code Generation)**

```cmake
# Incorrect: Applying architecture flags to the library

add_library(myCUDALib SHARED myKernel.cu)
target_compile_options(myCUDALib PRIVATE -gencode arch=compute_75,code=sm_75)

add_executable(executableA main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(executableA myCUDALib)

add_executable(executableB main2.cpp)
target_link_libraries(executableB myCUDALib)
```

This approach leads to duplicate PTX code generation because `myKernel.cu` is compiled with `-gencode arch=compute_75,code=sm_75` twice â€“ once for `executableA` and again for `executableB`, even though the kernel itself remains unchanged.


**Example 2: Correct Approach (Single Code Generation per Architecture)**

```cmake
# Correct: Applying architecture flags at the executable level

add_library(myCUDALib SHARED myKernel.cu)

add_executable(executableA main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(executableA myCUDALib)
target_compile_options(executableA PRIVATE -gencode arch=compute_75,code=sm_75)

add_executable(executableB main2.cpp)
target_link_libraries(executableB myCUDALib)
target_compile_options(executableB PRIVATE -gencode arch=compute_80,code=sm_80)

```

Here, the `-gencode` flags are moved to the executable targets.  `myKernel.cu` is compiled only once for each architecture specified, thus avoiding redundancy.  Note the use of `PRIVATE` which ensures that these flags do not leak into other targets.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Kernels and Architectures (Advanced)**

```cmake
# Advanced:  Multiple kernels, multiple architectures

add_library(myCUDALib SHARED kernel1.cu kernel2.cu) # Multiple kernels

set(ARCHITECTURES compute_75 compute_80 compute_86)

foreach(ARCH ${ARCHITECTURES})
  string(REPLACE "compute_" "" ARCH_NUM ${ARCH})
  add_executable(executableA_${ARCH} main.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(executableA_${ARCH} myCUDALib)
  target_compile_options(executableA_${ARCH} PRIVATE -gencode arch=${ARCH},code=sm_${ARCH_NUM})
endforeach()

#Similar approach can be applied to executableB

```

This example demonstrates handling multiple kernels within a library and generating PTX for multiple architectures.  Each executable is explicitly built for a specific architecture, ensuring no redundant compilation.  This demonstrates a scalable strategy for managing complex projects.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend thoroughly reviewing the official CMake documentation, particularly the sections detailing target properties and compile options.  Familiarizing yourself with the CUDA compiler's flag options and their implications is also vital.  Finally, carefully examining the generated build system files (Makefiles or Ninja files) can often provide valuable insights into the compilation process and identify potential sources of redundancy.  Understanding the interplay between these three elements is critical for effective CMake CUDA project management.  Consider using a build system visualization tool to aid in understanding complex target dependencies.  Thorough testing after implementing these changes is also essential to ensure the code functions correctly across different target architectures.
