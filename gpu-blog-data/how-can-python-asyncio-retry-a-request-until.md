The core challenge in reliably retrying asynchronous requests until a specific condition is met lies not just in handling transient network errors, but also in elegantly integrating the desired result validation within the retry mechanism.  Over the years, I've found that a robust solution requires a careful combination of asyncio's `retry` functionality (or a custom implementation if finer control is needed), exception handling, and custom result parsing. Simply retrying on HTTP errors isn't sufficient; you need to inspect the response content.

My approach emphasizes clarity and extensibility.  I prefer building a custom retry function rather than relying on readily available libraries which may not always offer the precise control needed for complex scenarios.  This allows for granular customization based on specific requirements, such as varied retry delays, maximum attempts, and result validation logic.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The solution hinges on a function that encapsulates the asynchronous request and the retry logic. This function takes the request parameters, the desired result condition (a callable function),  and retry parameters (maximum attempts, backoff strategy) as input.  It then iteratively sends the request. If an exception occurs (like a connection error), it waits according to the backoff strategy before retrying. If the request succeeds with a 200 status code, the response content is passed to the result validation function.  If validation fails, the retry cycle continues. If the maximum number of attempts is exceeded without a successful validation, an exception is raised, signaling a failure.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Retry with Exponential Backoff**

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import random

async def retry_request(request_func, result_validator, max_attempts=3, base_delay=1):
    """
    Retries an asynchronous request until successful validation or max attempts reached.

    Args:
        request_func: Asynchronous function making the request (must return response).
        result_validator: Function validating the response (returns True if successful).
        max_attempts: Maximum retry attempts.
        base_delay: Base delay (seconds) between retries, exponentially increasing.
    Returns: Response data if successful, raises exception otherwise.

    """
    attempts = 0
    while attempts < max_attempts:
        try:
            response = await request_func()
            response.raise_for_status() # Raise HTTPError for bad responses
            if result_validator(response):
                return await response.json() # Assuming JSON response, adjust as needed
            else:
                print(f"Retry attempt {attempts+1}: Validation failed.")
        except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
            print(f"Retry attempt {attempts+1}: Network error: {e}")
        except Exception as e: # Handle other exceptions appropriately
            print(f"Retry attempt {attempts+1}: Error: {e}")
        
        delay = base_delay * (2**attempts) + random.uniform(0, 1) #Add jitter
        await asyncio.sleep(delay)
        attempts += 1
    raise Exception(f"Request failed after {max_attempts} attempts.")

async def my_request():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get('http://example.com/api/data') as resp:
            return resp

async def main():
    def validate_result(response):
        data = response.json()
        return data.get('status') == 'success' and data.get('value') == 123

    try:
        result = await retry_request(my_request, validate_result)
        print(f"Successful request: {result}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Final failure: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This example demonstrates a basic retry mechanism with exponential backoff and a custom validator. Note the inclusion of jitter in the delay to avoid synchronized retries.  The `response.raise_for_status()` method ensures that HTTP errors (4xx and 5xx) are raised, triggering retries.  The validation function is tailored to the specific response structure.  Error handling is essential, especially in asynchronous contexts.


**Example 2:  Customizable Retry Policy**

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def retry_request_custom(request_func, result_validator, retry_policy):
    """
    Retries an asynchronous request using a customizable retry policy.
    Args:
        request_func: Asynchronous function making the request.
        result_validator: Function validating the response.
        retry_policy: Dictionary defining the retry policy. 
                      e.g., {'max_attempts': 5, 'delay_function': lambda x: x*2}

    Returns: Response data if successful, raises exception otherwise.
    """
    attempts = 0
    while attempts < retry_policy['max_attempts']:
        try:
            response = await request_func()
            response.raise_for_status()
            if result_validator(response):
                return await response.json()
            else:
                print(f"Retry attempt {attempts + 1}: Validation failed.")
        except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
            print(f"Retry attempt {attempts + 1}: Network error: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Retry attempt {attempts + 1}: Error: {e}")

        delay = retry_policy['delay_function'](attempts)
        await asyncio.sleep(delay)
        attempts += 1

    raise Exception(f"Request failed after {retry_policy['max_attempts']} attempts.")

# Example usage with a linear delay:
retry_policy = {'max_attempts': 5, 'delay_function': lambda x: x + 1}


```

This enhances flexibility by allowing the caller to specify the retry policy, including the delay function. This example uses a linear delay, but it could easily be modified to use exponential backoff or other strategies.


**Example 3: Handling Specific HTTP Errors**

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def retry_request_specific(request_func, result_validator, max_attempts=3, retryable_codes={408, 500, 502, 503, 504}):
    """
    Retries only for specified HTTP error codes.

    Args:
        request_func: Asynchronous function making the request.
        result_validator: Function validating the response.
        max_attempts: Maximum retry attempts.
        retryable_codes: Set of HTTP status codes to retry on.

    Returns: Response data if successful, raises exception otherwise.

    """
    attempts = 0
    while attempts < max_attempts:
        try:
            response = await request_func()
            response.raise_for_status() #Handles all non-2xx responses
            if result_validator(response):
                return await response.json()
            else:
                print(f"Retry attempt {attempts + 1}: Validation failed.")
        except aiohttp.ClientResponseError as e:
            if e.status in retryable_codes:
                print(f"Retry attempt {attempts + 1}: Retrying on error code {e.status}")
            else:
                raise  # Re-raise non-retryable exceptions
        except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
            print(f"Retry attempt {attempts + 1}: Network error: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Retry attempt {attempts + 1}: Error: {e}")

        await asyncio.sleep(1) # Simple delay for demonstration
        attempts += 1

    raise Exception(f"Request failed after {max_attempts} attempts.")


```

This example demonstrates selective retrying based on specific HTTP status codes, a crucial consideration for handling different types of server-side errors. Only errors within the `retryable_codes` set will trigger a retry.  Non-retryable errors are propagated to the caller.
