The core issue in aligning 6x6x2 prediction logits with corresponding labels lies in understanding the dimensionality represents.  My experience working on similar semantic segmentation tasks for medical image analysis highlights that the final dimension (2 in this case) typically signifies a classification output at each spatial location.  Therefore, a direct element-wise comparison is inappropriate; instead, we need to match spatial locations before performing the classification comparison.

The 6x6 grid represents a spatial discretization of the input.  Each of the 36 cells (6x6) has an associated 2-dimensional logit vector, representing the model's prediction probability for two classes at that specific spatial point.  The labels must mirror this structure.  They should not be a single class label, but a 6x6 matrix where each cell contains a 2-dimensional one-hot encoded vector representing the ground truth class at the corresponding location.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The mismatch arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of the output format.  The model provides a *probability distribution* for each spatial location, not a single classification.  Directly comparing a 6x6x2 logit tensor to a single label or a differently structured label tensor will yield incorrect results. The labels must have the same dimensionality as the logits (6x6x2).  Each inner 2-dimensional vector in both the logits and labels represents the class probabilities (logits) or the one-hot encoding of the ground truth class (labels).  Therefore, the matching procedure needs to iterate through the 6x6 spatial grid, comparing the 2-dimensional vectors at each cell.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Here are three Python examples demonstrating different approaches to handle this problem.  All assume the use of NumPy for array manipulation.  I have encountered similar scenarios in object detection and instance segmentation,  adapting these methods consistently.

**Example 1: Using NumPy for direct comparison:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample logits (replace with your actual predictions)
logits = np.random.rand(6, 6, 2)

# Sample labels (replace with your ground truth labels.  Note the one-hot encoding)
labels = np.array([
    [[1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]],
    [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]],
    [[1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]],
    [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]],
    [[1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]],
    [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]]
]).reshape(6, 6, 2)

# Direct comparison, calculating the accuracy at each spatial location.
accuracy_per_cell = np.sum(np.argmax(logits, axis=2) == np.argmax(labels, axis=2), axis=(0, 1)) / 36

# Overall accuracy
overall_accuracy = accuracy_per_cell

print(f"Accuracy per cell: {accuracy_per_cell}")
print(f"Overall Accuracy: {overall_accuracy}")
```
This code directly compares the predicted class (obtained via `np.argmax`) with the ground truth class at each 6x6 location. It provides a per-cell accuracy and an overall accuracy. The assumption is that one-hot encoding is used for labels.


**Example 2: Calculating cross-entropy loss:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample logits (replace with your actual predictions)
logits = np.random.rand(6, 6, 2)

# Sample labels (replace with your ground truth labels)
labels = np.array([
    [[1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]],
    [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]],
    [[1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]],
    [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]],
    [[1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]],
    [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]]
]).reshape(6, 6, 2)


# Calculate cross-entropy loss (requires logits to be sufficiently processed)
#  e.g., softmax activation applied before this step.  This is crucial.
def softmax(x):
    e_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))
    return e_x / e_x.sum(axis=2, keepdims=True)

probabilities = softmax(logits)

loss = -np.sum(labels * np.log(probabilities + 1e-9)) #Adding a small value for numerical stability

print(f"Cross-entropy loss: {loss}")
```
This approach uses cross-entropy loss, a standard metric for evaluating classification models.  Note the crucial inclusion of a softmax function to transform logits into probabilities before the loss calculation and the addition of a small value to prevent taking the log of zero.

**Example 3:  Handling potential label inconsistencies:**

```python
import numpy as np

logits = np.random.rand(6, 6, 2)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(6, 6)) #Labels as single class values

#Convert Labels to one-hot encoding
labels_onehot = np.eye(2)[labels.reshape(-1)].reshape(6,6,2)

#Handle cases where label dimensionality differs.  This example converts to one-hot.
if labels.ndim == 2:
    labels_onehot = np.eye(2)[labels.reshape(-1)].reshape(6, 6, 2)
elif labels.ndim == 3 and labels.shape[2] != 2:
    raise ValueError("Incompatible label shape.  Labels must be 6x6x2 or 6x6.")
else:
    labels_onehot = labels # Already in correct format


# Now use labels_onehot for comparison or loss calculation (as in previous examples).
#  The rest of the comparison would be similar to examples 1 or 2.
```
This example demonstrates robustness by explicitly handling potential discrepancies in the label's format. It ensures the labels are converted into the required one-hot encoding format before proceeding with further calculations,  a situation I've often encountered in real-world datasets.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.  Specifically, chapters on convolutional neural networks and loss functions.
*  "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop.  Focus on the sections on classification and probabilistic models.
*  A comprehensive textbook on linear algebra and multivariate calculus, providing a strong mathematical foundation.


These examples and resources provide a solid foundation for understanding and solving the shape mismatch problem. Remember to always adapt these methods to the specifics of your data and evaluation metrics.  Rigorous error handling and validation of data shapes are crucial steps that often get overlooked but prevent significant headaches later on.
