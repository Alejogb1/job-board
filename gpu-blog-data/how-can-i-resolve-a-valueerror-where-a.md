The root cause of a ValueError indicating a Keras model expecting one input but receiving two almost invariably stems from a mismatch between the model's input layer configuration and the data being fed to it during prediction or training.  This often manifests when concatenating data sources, inadvertently passing multiple tensors, or misunderstanding the `fit()` or `predict()` method signatures.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work developing deep learning models for time series forecasting and image classification, particularly when integrating pre-trained models.  Let's examine the problem systematically and explore solutions.

**1.  Clear Explanation of the Error and its Sources:**

The Keras `ValueError` arises because the model's input layer is explicitly or implicitly defined to accept a single input tensor of a specific shape.  When you attempt to provide two tensors – either explicitly as separate arguments or implicitly through a data structure that Keras interprets as multiple inputs – the model's internal mechanisms fail to reconcile this discrepancy.  The model's `input_shape` parameter, defined during model construction, dictates the expected shape (number of dimensions and size of each dimension) of the input data.  If this expectation is not met, the error is raised.

Several scenarios contribute to this mismatch:

* **Incorrect Data Preprocessing:**  The most common source is improper data preparation.  For instance, if you intend to concatenate two features into a single input, you must perform the concatenation *before* feeding the data to the model.  Failing to do so results in two separate inputs, leading to the error.

* **Misunderstanding of `fit()` and `predict()` Arguments:**  The `fit()` method in Keras accepts `x` (input data) and `y` (target data) as separate arguments.  If you accidentally provide both features as part of `x`, treating them as distinct inputs instead of combining them beforehand, you'll trigger the error.  Similarly, the `predict()` method expects a single input tensor, not a tuple or list.

* **Incompatible Model Architecture:** You might have inadvertently created a model with multiple input branches – perhaps through the use of the `Input()` layer multiple times within a functional API model – without properly merging these branches before feeding data.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate the problem and its solutions with three scenarios, assuming a simple sequential model for brevity.  Note that these examples utilize NumPy for data manipulation.


**Example 1: Incorrect Data Handling**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Create a simple model expecting a single input of shape (10,)
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(1)
])

# Incorrect: Providing two separate NumPy arrays
feature1 = np.random.rand(100, 10)
feature2 = np.random.rand(100, 5)

try:
    model.predict([feature1, feature2])  # This will raise the ValueError
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected ValueError: {e}")

# Correct: Concatenate features before prediction
combined_features = np.concatenate((feature1, feature2), axis=1)
model.predict(combined_features)  # This will work correctly
```

Here, we demonstrate the error resulting from passing two separate arrays (`feature1` and `feature2`) to `model.predict()`.  The correct approach concatenates the features along the column axis (axis=1) before passing them to the model.


**Example 2:  Incorrect `fit()` usage**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(15,)),
    Dense(1)
])

feature1 = np.random.rand(100, 10)
feature2 = np.random.rand(100, 5)
labels = np.random.rand(100, 1)

try:
    model.fit([feature1, feature2], labels, epochs=1) #Incorrect - passes two inputs as x
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected ValueError: {e}")

combined_features = np.concatenate((feature1, feature2), axis=1)
model.fit(combined_features, labels, epochs=1) #Correct - combined features
```

This example highlights the improper use of `model.fit()`.  Providing `feature1` and `feature2` separately as the `x` argument leads to the error. The solution, again, involves pre-concatenating the features.


**Example 3:  Functional API Model with Multiple Inputs (Incorrect Handling)**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input, concatenate

# Define two input layers (incorrectly handled without merging)
input1 = Input(shape=(10,))
input2 = Input(shape=(5,))

dense1 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(input1)
dense2 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(input2)


try:
    # Attempt to predict without concatenating inputs - will fail.
    model = keras.Model(inputs=[input1, input2], outputs=dense1) #Incomplete and Incorrect
    feature1 = np.random.rand(100,10)
    feature2 = np.random.rand(100,5)
    model.predict([feature1,feature2])
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected ValueError: {e}")


#Correct Approach:
merged = concatenate([dense1, dense2])
output = Dense(1)(merged)
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input1, input2], outputs=output)
model.predict([feature1,feature2]) #This will execute correctly.
```

This demonstrates a more complex scenario using Keras's Functional API. While using multiple inputs is valid, it requires a proper merging mechanism (here, `concatenate`) to combine the outputs of different input branches before the final output layer.  The initial attempt demonstrates incorrect usage, leading to a ValueError. The corrected version properly merges the outputs before feeding them into the final layer.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To deepen your understanding of Keras model building and data handling, I recommend consulting the official Keras documentation, particularly the sections on model building with the Sequential and Functional APIs, and data preprocessing techniques.  Reviewing examples of different input and output shapes in the Keras tutorials will be invaluable.   Finally, working through a well-structured deep learning textbook covering TensorFlow/Keras will provide a comprehensive foundation.  Careful attention to data shapes and input/output dimensions during both model design and data handling is crucial to avoiding this common error.
