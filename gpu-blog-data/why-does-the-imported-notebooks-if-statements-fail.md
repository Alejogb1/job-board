Imported notebooks' `if` statements failing to convert to autographs stems primarily from the nature of TensorFlow's autograph functionality and its interactions with notebook execution environments. Autograph, at its core, transforms Python code into TensorFlow graph operations for enhanced performance, particularly when training models. However, this transformation isn't universally applicable and often encounters limitations when dealing with dynamic code execution, as commonly found in interactive notebook environments.

The crux of the issue lies in autograph's expectation of statically analyzable code. The process relies on tracing the execution of a function or method to build the corresponding TensorFlow graph. When an `if` statement's condition relies on a value not known at trace time—a value dependent on runtime behavior, or the specific state of the notebook—autograph cannot statically determine which branch to follow. Consequently, it cannot generate a single, coherent graph for the entire operation.

In my previous work on developing a custom reinforcement learning environment within a Jupyter notebook, I faced this problem directly. The environment's state transitions involved numerous `if` statements, each dependent on the specific actions of the agent and the stochastic elements of the environment, which were not known when the function was first invoked during tracing by autograph. This prevented the function from being converted and led to reduced performance.

Consider a basic example to illustrate the problem. Let's say you have a function meant to decide whether to perform a certain calculation based on an external input (e.g., the user toggling a notebook cell value):

```python
import tensorflow as tf

condition_value = False

@tf.function
def conditional_calculation(input_tensor):
  if condition_value:
      result = input_tensor * 2
  else:
      result = input_tensor / 2
  return result

tensor = tf.constant(5.0)
output = conditional_calculation(tensor)
print(output)

condition_value = True
output = conditional_calculation(tensor)
print(output)
```

In this code, the `condition_value` is a Python variable that is not a TensorFlow tensor. During the first invocation of `conditional_calculation`, autograph traces the function and generates a graph based on the current value of `condition_value` which is `False`. Consequently, the graph embodies only the `else` branch: `input_tensor / 2`. When `condition_value` changes to `True` and the function is called again, the old graph will be used, effectively ignoring the change in `condition_value`. The print outputs will be 2.5 and 2.5 instead of the expected 2.5 and 10, demonstrating that the graph is not capturing the change in the `if` condition.

The problem isn’t the `if` statement itself, but that its branch selection depends on a value unavailable to autograph during graph construction. In a static, non-notebook context, `condition_value` would likely be a TensorFlow tensor derived from the graph, which would solve this issue. But in the dynamic notebook, it is a Python variable existing outside of the TensorFlow graph's scope.

Here's another example demonstrating the issue arising from a variable defined outside the traced function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.threshold = 5.0

    @tf.function
    def process_tensor(self, input_tensor):
        if input_tensor.numpy() < self.threshold:
            return input_tensor * 2
        else:
            return input_tensor / 2

my_instance = MyClass()
tensor = tf.constant(3.0)
output = my_instance.process_tensor(tensor)
print(output)

my_instance.threshold = 8.0
tensor = tf.constant(7.0)
output = my_instance.process_tensor(tensor)
print(output)
```

Again, we see similar behavior. The `threshold` variable, residing as an attribute of `MyClass`, lives outside of the scope of the tracing process. The graph initially gets created for `threshold=5.0`. Consequently, the first function call produces a doubled value, and the subsequent call, even with a higher `threshold` and input tensor, still halves the output because the `if` condition is locked in to the static graph with the initial `threshold` value. The output will be 6.0, and 3.5 instead of the expected 6.0 and 3.5. Note here the explicit use of `input_tensor.numpy()`, which pulls the tensor value out of the graph to compare it with a non-graph `self.threshold` – a fundamental conflict with autograph.

To address this issue, all values influencing the `if` condition should be available as TensorFlow tensors within the graph. One way is to make the threshold itself a `tf.Variable` object, or to derive it from a graph-based computation.

Here is a revised version using `tf.Variable`, which would be the correct way:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyClassCorrected:
  def __init__(self, initial_threshold):
    self.threshold = tf.Variable(initial_threshold, dtype=tf.float32)

  @tf.function
  def process_tensor(self, input_tensor):
    if input_tensor < self.threshold:
      return input_tensor * 2
    else:
        return input_tensor / 2

my_instance = MyClassCorrected(5.0)
tensor = tf.constant(3.0)
output = my_instance.process_tensor(tensor)
print(output)

my_instance.threshold.assign(8.0) # Use the assign method to change values of variables
tensor = tf.constant(7.0)
output = my_instance.process_tensor(tensor)
print(output)
```
Here, `self.threshold` is a `tf.Variable` which is now part of the computational graph, not just a Python value outside of it. We use the `assign` method to change its value during the notebook’s runtime. Now the tracing of `process_tensor` correctly incorporates the `if` condition because the `threshold` value lives as a tensor in the graph and the condition is assessed each time `process_tensor` is called. This provides the correct output, 6.0 and 3.5.

In practical scenarios, where notebook environments are favored for experimentation, one should adopt a consistent strategy for graph construction. This involves ensuring all dynamic elements are either represented as tensors or fed as arguments at the function execution level, allowing autograph to dynamically create new graphs when necessary, but this comes with a potential performance hit. For instance, instead of relying on mutable Python variables, one could pass dynamic values as function arguments that, in turn, derive the condition, ensuring that the graph captures these variations.

Recommended resources for deepening your understanding include:

1.  The official TensorFlow documentation on autograph, where you can find comprehensive guides and explanations of the transformation process.
2.  TensorFlow tutorials, which provide practical examples of using autograph and illustrate common pitfalls and their resolutions.
3.  The TensorFlow API documentation for `tf.function` and `tf.Variable`, which provides detailed specifications for using these core components of the TensorFlow ecosystem.

By understanding the limitations of autograph in dynamic environments and embracing tensor-based representations of state variables, you can effectively construct TensorFlow graphs within notebook contexts, avoiding the conversion failures of `if` statements and leveraging the performance advantages offered by autograph.
