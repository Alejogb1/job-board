The core challenge in distributing large tensors across multiple GPUs with Keras lies not simply in data parallelism, but in efficient memory management and communication overhead minimization.  My experience working on high-resolution image classification projects highlighted the critical role of data sharding strategies and carefully chosen communication backends.  Naively distributing data without considering these factors can lead to significant performance bottlenecks, negating the potential speedup offered by multiple GPUs.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Effective distributed training with Keras and large tensors requires a multi-faceted approach.  First, the dataset itself must be partitioned – or *sharded* – across the available GPUs. This prevents any single GPU from needing to load the entire dataset into its memory. Each GPU then processes a subset of the data independently, computing gradients locally.  These local gradients are subsequently aggregated, typically using a parameter server architecture or all-reduce algorithms, to compute the global gradient update applied across all model weights.  The choice of aggregation method and communication backend (e.g., NCCL, Horovod) heavily influences the efficiency of this process.  Furthermore, the model architecture itself needs to be compatible with distributed training.  While Keras inherently supports data parallelism through `tf.distribute.Strategy`, careful consideration must be given to layer types and potential bottlenecks stemming from specific operations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate different strategies for distributing tensor processing across multiple GPUs using Keras and TensorFlow.  These examples assume a familiarity with TensorFlow's distributed strategies and assume a suitable GPU-enabled environment.  Error handling and detailed configuration options are omitted for brevity, focusing instead on core concepts.

**Example 1: Using MirroredStrategy for Data Parallelism**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
  ])
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Assuming 'x_train' and 'y_train' are your large datasets.  The .fit method will
# automatically distribute data across available GPUs.
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

**Commentary:**  This is the simplest approach, utilizing `MirroredStrategy`.  It replicates the model on each GPU and splits the dataset across them.  It's efficient for smaller models but may struggle with extremely large models that don't fit within individual GPU memory.  The `batch_size` parameter dictates the chunk size distributed per step.  Increasing it may improve throughput but increases memory demands on individual GPUs.


**Example 2:  Employing MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy for larger datasets and models**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

cluster_resolver = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver() # Or a custom resolver for GPUs
strategy = tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy(cluster_resolver)

with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

#  Dataset must be pre-sharded across multiple machines
#  Data loading will require more complex logic than in Example 1
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

```

**Commentary:** This example leverages `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, designed for clusters of machines, each containing multiple GPUs. It's crucial for handling extremely large datasets and models that exceed the capacity of a single machine. The `cluster_resolver` is essential for specifying the cluster configuration (typically specified through environment variables). Data loading and distribution become more sophisticated, necessitating mechanisms to ensure each worker gets its designated shard.


**Example 3:  Custom Data Sharding with `tf.data.Dataset` for fine-grained control:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

def data_shard(dataset, num_replicas):
    return dataset.shard(num_replicas, strategy.cluster_resolver.task_id)


with strategy.scope():
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([ ... ]) # Model definition as before
  model.compile(...)

# Assume 'dataset' is a large tf.data.Dataset object.
dist_dataset = strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset(data_shard(dataset, strategy.num_replicas_in_sync))

model.fit(dist_dataset, epochs=10)
```


**Commentary:** This example demonstrates fine-grained control over data sharding using `tf.data.Dataset` and `shard`.  This allows more sophisticated data preprocessing and augmentation strategies tailored to the distributed environment.  The `data_shard` function ensures each replica receives a unique portion of the data, enabling optimal utilization of available GPU resources.  This approach requires a deeper understanding of `tf.data` pipelines.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation on distributed training.  It provides in-depth explanations of various strategies and best practices.
*   Books and tutorials on high-performance computing and parallel programming.  These resources offer broader context on techniques relevant to distributed deep learning.
*   Research papers exploring advancements in distributed deep learning frameworks and optimization algorithms. These are crucial for staying updated on state-of-the-art techniques for scaling deep learning models.



These examples and resources provide a strong foundation for effectively distributing large tensor processing across multiple GPUs using Keras.  Remember that the optimal approach depends heavily on specific hardware constraints, dataset size, model complexity, and performance requirements.  Profiling and benchmarking are essential to identify and address bottlenecks in distributed training workflows.  Furthermore, careful consideration of communication overhead and the choice of communication backends are vital for maximizing efficiency in large-scale distributed training.
