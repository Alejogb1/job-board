Keras sequential models failing to load from JSON, despite seemingly valid serialization, frequently stems from inconsistencies between the saved model's structure and the environment in which it is being loaded. Specifically, custom layers or callbacks, if employed in the original model, must be explicitly registered and available in the loading environment, or the deserialization process will fail. I've encountered this problem numerous times across various deep learning projects, and resolution always involves a careful examination of the original architecture and dependency management.

The primary mechanism for saving a Keras Sequential model’s architecture is JSON serialization using `model.to_json()`. This method captures the configuration of the model, including layer types, hyper-parameters, and connectivity. Subsequently, `tf.keras.models.model_from_json()` is utilized to recreate the model instance. However, the JSON output only encodes the *structure* defined in Keras’s library. It does not inherently embed the code defining custom elements, such as layers or callbacks, nor does it include any model weights. These weights are saved separately, often using `model.save_weights()`.

The core issue appears when a model incorporates custom components that are not part of the standard Keras library. During model deserialization, the `model_from_json()` function encounters these unregistered elements and cannot instantiate them, leading to an error. This error typically manifests as a `ValueError`, frequently stating that an object could not be identified or a name cannot be resolved. This signifies that the specific custom class is not available in the Python namespace during the loading process, preventing the model architecture from being recreated accurately.

Let's illustrate this with a hypothetical example where a custom layer is involved.

**Example 1: Model with Custom Layer and Loading Failure**

First, we define a custom layer which applies a specific activation function.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras import models

class CustomActivationLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(CustomActivationLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.sin(inputs) #example activation

# Create and save a model with the custom layer
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(16, input_shape=(10,)),
    CustomActivationLayer(),
    layers.Dense(10)
])

model_json = model.to_json()
with open("custom_model.json", "w") as json_file:
    json_file.write(model_json)

```
Here, `CustomActivationLayer` is defined and subsequently integrated into a sequential model. The model structure, including this custom layer, is serialized to JSON. Now, let's attempt to load it back in a new execution context where the custom layer is not explicitly available:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import models

with open("custom_model.json", "r") as json_file:
    loaded_model_json = json_file.read()

try:
  loaded_model = models.model_from_json(loaded_model_json)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}") #prints ValueError: Unknown layer: CustomActivationLayer

```
This attempt will fail, resulting in a `ValueError` reporting an “Unknown layer: CustomActivationLayer”. This occurs because `model_from_json()` is attempting to create an object of the custom class without the class definition being explicitly known.

**Example 2: Correct Loading with Registered Custom Layer**

To successfully load the model, we need to register the custom class before invoking `model_from_json()`. This involves providing the custom layer class within the `custom_objects` parameter.
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras import models

class CustomActivationLayer(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(CustomActivationLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.sin(inputs)

with open("custom_model.json", "r") as json_file:
    loaded_model_json = json_file.read()

loaded_model = models.model_from_json(loaded_model_json, custom_objects={'CustomActivationLayer': CustomActivationLayer})

print("Model loaded successfully")

```
By explicitly providing `custom_objects` parameter with mapping of string name and the python class, `model_from_json()` can now correctly instantiate the `CustomActivationLayer`, thus resolving the failure.

**Example 3: Loading a model with a custom callback**

The situation is analogous with custom callbacks. Imagine we have a custom callback:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback

class CustomCallback(Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
    print(f'End of epoch: {epoch}, logs:{logs}')

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(5,)),
    layers.Dense(2)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

model.fit(tf.random.normal((100,5)), tf.random.normal((100,2)), epochs=2, callbacks=[CustomCallback()])
model_json = model.to_json()
with open("callback_model.json", "w") as json_file:
    json_file.write(model_json)
```

If we try to load this model without registering the custom callback, we won’t get an error during loading, but, the callback won’t execute, because `model_from_json` only deserializes the architecture. If the architecture requires that a callback be used to perform an action, it will be missing unless the callback implementation has been registered and is re-instantiated:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback

class CustomCallback(Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
    print(f'End of epoch: {epoch}, logs:{logs}')

with open("callback_model.json", "r") as json_file:
    loaded_model_json = json_file.read()

loaded_model = models.model_from_json(loaded_model_json)
loaded_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

#the callback won't execute unless we register it and explicitly add it to the fit function
loaded_model.fit(tf.random.normal((100,5)), tf.random.normal((100,2)), epochs=2, callbacks=[CustomCallback()])

```
Note that, as noted in this example, it is important to register not only the custom layers in `model_from_json`, but the custom callbacks when running fit operations on the loaded model.

In summary, the core issue when using `model_from_json` is the handling of custom elements. `model.to_json()` only captures the structure, not the code defining custom layers or callbacks. To load successfully, these must be registered using the `custom_objects` parameter, which requires the presence of the custom layer’s class definitions in the target environment. This often manifests as a `ValueError` indicating that a particular class or object cannot be identified. Failure to register custom elements will lead to a faulty, or in the case of callbacks, incomplete model instantiation.

Recommendations for further study and understanding include the TensorFlow Keras documentation, specifically the sections on model saving and loading, custom layers, and callbacks. I also found significant value in studying the source code for `model_from_json` within the TensorFlow project to fully grasp its deserialization mechanics. Books dedicated to Deep Learning, particularly those covering TensorFlow and Keras, provide deeper insight. Exploration of forums dedicated to deep learning will also reveal diverse challenges that can occur in model serialization and loading, along with solutions. Careful reading of associated error messages and precise dependency management are critical to avoiding this frequently occurring error in Keras.
