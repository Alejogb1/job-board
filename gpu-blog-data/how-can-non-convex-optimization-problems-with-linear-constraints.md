Non-convex optimization problems constrained by linear inequalities present a significant challenge, as the absence of a globally optimal solution guarantee necessitates careful algorithmic selection and interpretation of results. My experience working on robust control systems for autonomous vehicles has highlighted the critical role of tailored approaches in these scenarios.  The key lies in understanding that while global optimality is generally unattainable, we can aim for local optima that satisfy the linear constraints and offer practical utility. This typically involves iterative methods that exploit the structure of the linear constraints to navigate the complex non-convex landscape.

The most suitable methods for solving these problems fall under several categories, each with its strengths and weaknesses.  First, let’s discuss methods leveraging gradient information.  Gradient descent-based algorithms, while susceptible to becoming trapped in local minima, can be adapted for constrained optimization through techniques like projected gradient descent or penalty methods.  These methods use the gradient of the objective function to iteratively update the solution, ensuring it remains feasible with respect to the linear constraints.  The convergence rate and the quality of the final solution depend significantly on the problem's specifics and the algorithm's parameters, such as the step size or penalty coefficient.  Improper tuning can result in slow convergence or poor local optima.  I've observed this firsthand when tuning a model predictive control system for obstacle avoidance; careful parameter selection was essential for real-time performance.

Second, derivative-free methods are valuable when gradients are unavailable or computationally expensive to evaluate.  These methods often rely on sampling the objective function at various points within the feasible region, defined by the linear constraints.  Techniques like Nelder-Mead's simplex method or pattern search algorithms can be adapted to work within the constraint set by using projection or penalty functions.  Their convergence is generally slower than gradient-based methods, but they offer robustness to noisy objective functions or computational limitations.  During my work on optimizing energy consumption in a robotic arm, the complexity of the dynamic model prevented the efficient computation of gradients, prompting the effective use of a pattern search algorithm to find acceptable solutions.


Third, global optimization techniques can sometimes be applied, though their computational cost often becomes prohibitive for high-dimensional problems.  Methods such as branch-and-bound or simulated annealing can systematically explore the feasible region to identify better local optima or, in some cases, global solutions. However, these methods are generally computationally intensive and might not be practical for real-time applications or large-scale problems. I encountered their limitations when attempting to optimize a complex network configuration; the problem quickly became intractable even with parallel processing.


Let's now consider three concrete code examples illustrating these approaches.  For simplicity, I will use Python with the SciPy library.  Assume our problem is to minimize a non-convex function `f(x)` subject to linear constraints `Ax <= b`.

**Example 1: Projected Gradient Descent**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def f(x):
  # Non-convex objective function (example: Rosenbrock function)
  return 100*(x[1]-x[0]**2)**2 + (1-x[0])**2

def project(x, A, b):
  # Projection onto the feasible region
  from scipy.optimize import linprog
  res = linprog(c=np.zeros_like(x), A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=(None,None), x0=x)
  return res.x

A = np.array([[1, -1], [-1, 1]])
b = np.array([1, 1])
x0 = np.array([0, 0])

x = x0
for i in range(100):
  grad = #compute gradient of f(x) (numerically or analytically)
  x = x - 0.1*grad
  x = project(x, A, b)

print(f"Minimum found at: {x}, function value: {f(x)}")
```

This example uses a simple gradient descent step followed by a projection onto the feasible region using linear programming.  The projection ensures the iterates remain within the constraints.  Note that the gradient computation is omitted for brevity; it would involve either numerical differentiation or the analytical derivative of the function.


**Example 2: Nelder-Mead Simplex Method (derivative-free)**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def f(x):
  # Non-convex objective function
  return (x[0]**2 - x[1])**2 + (1 - x[0])**2

A = np.array([[1, -1], [-1, 1]])
b = np.array([1, 1])
constraints = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: b - np.dot(A, x)})
res = minimize(f, [0, 0], method='Nelder-Mead', constraints=constraints)
print(f"Minimum found at: {res.x}, function value: {res.fun}")
```

This employs SciPy's built-in Nelder-Mead implementation, directly handling the linear inequality constraints.  This avoids explicit projection but relies on the algorithm's ability to navigate the constrained space effectively.  Observe the direct use of SciPy's constraint definition within the `minimize` function.


**Example 3:  Simulated Annealing (global optimization – computationally expensive)**


```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import dual_annealing

def f(x):
  # Non-convex objective function
  return np.sin(x[0]) + np.cos(x[1])

A = np.array([[1, -1], [-1, 1]])
b = np.array([1, 1])
bounds = [(-10, 10), (-10, 10)]
constraints = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: b - np.dot(A, x)})
res = dual_annealing(f, bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)
print(f"Minimum found at: {res.x}, function value: {res.fun}")

```

Simulated annealing is employed here, attempting to escape local minima. Its probabilistic nature makes it computationally more demanding. The use of bounds is crucial to defining the initial search space, although they must encompass the feasible region as defined by the linear constraints.


For further study, I recommend consulting texts on nonlinear programming, focusing on constrained optimization.  In particular, a strong understanding of linear algebra, numerical methods, and convex analysis is crucial for comprehending and adapting these techniques. Examining specific algorithms like the interior-point method, which is commonly used for large-scale problems, can provide valuable insight into more sophisticated approaches.  Finally, exploring advanced optimization libraries beyond SciPy, particularly those tailored to specific problem structures or requiring parallel computing, can prove beneficial for complex scenarios.
