The fundamental difference between using ground truth probability distributions versus one-hot encoded vectors when computing cross-entropy loss lies in the representation of certainty and its impact on the loss function's behavior. I’ve observed this directly in various model training scenarios, particularly when dealing with classification problems exhibiting inherent uncertainty, such as noisy image data or ambiguous text interpretations.

A one-hot encoded vector, by definition, represents a single, absolute true class with a value of 1 at the correct class index and 0 everywhere else. This assumes the model should ideally predict one class with 100% probability. Cross-entropy, when used with a one-hot vector, penalizes the model heavily for any deviation from this absolute certainty. It effectively pushes the predicted probabilities towards a Dirac delta function (a spike at the correct class and zero elsewhere), regardless of whether such sharp prediction is genuinely warranted. The standard cross-entropy loss can be calculated as:

```
L = - sum(y_true * log(y_pred))
```

Where `y_true` represents the one-hot encoded vector and `y_pred` is the predicted probability vector from the model.

However, in many real-world scenarios, the ground truth isn't always an absolute, one-class scenario. There may be situations where the correct class is not perfectly defined or where multiple classes are plausibly valid based on the input data. Ground truth probabilities, on the other hand, express the degree of confidence or belief that a particular instance belongs to a particular class. For example, imagine trying to classify an image which appears to be ambiguously between a cat and a small dog. Rather than forcing the model to choose one, ground truth probability distributions might indicate an 80% chance of cat and a 20% chance of small dog. This directly impacts how cross-entropy penalizes the model.

When ground truth probabilities are used, the same cross-entropy function is applied, but with `y_true` now representing a probability distribution rather than a one-hot vector. Crucially, the model is not penalized for assigning probabilities to multiple classes if those classes are reflected in the ground truth distribution. Instead of pushing towards a Dirac delta function, the loss function seeks to align the predicted probability distribution with the ground truth probability distribution. This provides two benefits: (1) the model’s output distribution more accurately mirrors the level of inherent ambiguity in the task, and (2) the training process can become more robust because the model is not penalized heavily for making plausible predictions when the ground truth is ambiguous.

Let me illustrate with some code examples. In these examples, I am using Python and a NumPy-like library for simplified array manipulation.

**Example 1: One-Hot Encoding**

```python
import numpy as np

def cross_entropy_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    """Calculates cross-entropy loss. Assumes log(0) has been handled."""
    return -np.sum(y_true * np.log(y_pred))

# One-hot encoded ground truth, class 1 is true
y_true_one_hot = np.array([0, 1, 0])
# Model predicts class 1 with high probability, others close to zero
y_pred_1 = np.array([0.1, 0.8, 0.1])
loss_1 = cross_entropy_loss(y_true_one_hot, y_pred_1)
print(f"Loss with one-hot encoding (good prediction): {loss_1:.4f}")

# Model predicts incorrectly
y_pred_2 = np.array([0.8, 0.1, 0.1])
loss_2 = cross_entropy_loss(y_true_one_hot, y_pred_2)
print(f"Loss with one-hot encoding (poor prediction): {loss_2:.4f}")

# Model predicts another valid prediction but not correct
y_pred_3 = np.array([0.2, 0.2, 0.6])
loss_3 = cross_entropy_loss(y_true_one_hot, y_pred_3)
print(f"Loss with one-hot encoding (different poor prediction): {loss_3:.4f}")
```

In this example, with one-hot encoding, the loss is minimal when the model's prediction aligns closely with the single true class. Any deviation from the absolute correct class results in a substantial increase in loss.

**Example 2: Ground Truth Probabilities (Uncertainty)**

```python
# Ground truth with some uncertainty
y_true_probs = np.array([0.1, 0.8, 0.1])
# Model predicts close to ground truth
y_pred_4 = np.array([0.15, 0.7, 0.15])
loss_4 = cross_entropy_loss(y_true_probs, y_pred_4)
print(f"Loss with ground truth probabilities (good prediction): {loss_4:.4f}")

# Model predictions are poor
y_pred_5 = np.array([0.7, 0.1, 0.2])
loss_5 = cross_entropy_loss(y_true_probs, y_pred_5)
print(f"Loss with ground truth probabilities (poor prediction): {loss_5:.4f}")

# Model predicts a plausible prediction although not ideal
y_pred_6 = np.array([0.2, 0.5, 0.3])
loss_6 = cross_entropy_loss(y_true_probs, y_pred_6)
print(f"Loss with ground truth probabilities (different poor prediction): {loss_6:.4f}")
```

Here, even if the prediction does not perfectly match the ground truth probability distribution, the loss remains lower compared to the one-hot case when the predicted probabilities align partially with true probability, effectively guiding the model towards the overall true distribution. Note that both loss values are lower than their equivalent one-hot scenario.

**Example 3: Ground Truth Probabilities (Multiple Classes)**

```python
# Ground truth with multiple possible classes
y_true_multi_probs = np.array([0.3, 0.6, 0.1])

# Prediction matches the multi-class ground truth reasonably
y_pred_7 = np.array([0.2, 0.7, 0.1])
loss_7 = cross_entropy_loss(y_true_multi_probs, y_pred_7)
print(f"Loss with multi-class ground truth probabilities (good prediction): {loss_7:.4f}")

# Prediction predicts the wrong class
y_pred_8 = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.7])
loss_8 = cross_entropy_loss(y_true_multi_probs, y_pred_8)
print(f"Loss with multi-class ground truth probabilities (poor prediction): {loss_8:.4f}")

# Prediction only selects one valid class but omits another
y_pred_9 = np.array([0.8, 0.1, 0.1])
loss_9 = cross_entropy_loss(y_true_multi_probs, y_pred_9)
print(f"Loss with multi-class ground truth probabilities (different poor prediction): {loss_9:.4f}")

```

This example demonstrates a situation where two classes have significant probabilities in the ground truth. Notice the lower loss when the predicted distribution respects this distribution compared to when the distribution is ignored. This shows that the loss is a function of the total distribution alignment not simply predicting a single true class.

In conclusion, while both methods use the cross-entropy function, applying it with ground truth probability distributions is essential when absolute certainty about a single correct class is not present. It better reflects the realistic ambiguity often encountered in real world datasets and encourages the model to learn the underlying distribution of the data, not simply predict singular outcomes.

For further exploration, I recommend investigating the concept of label smoothing, a technique related to ground truth probability distributions. Also researching the topic of Bayesian deep learning, with specific attention to variational inference can provide additional context on model uncertainty and probability distribution based learning. Finally, studying different forms of classification tasks such as multi-label versus multi-class problems, will further enhance understanding of appropriate training data choices.
