Gradient clipping in TensorFlow 1.14, particularly the `tf.clip_by_norm` and `tf.clip_by_value` operations, can fail due to several interacting factors stemming primarily from numerical instability within the gradient computation process.  My experience debugging these issues across numerous large-scale neural network projects has highlighted three primary culprits: excessively large gradients, numerical overflow/underflow within the gradient calculation, and improper interaction with custom training loops.


**1. Excessively Large Gradients:** This is the most common cause.  During training, especially in deep networks or those employing activation functions susceptible to saturation (e.g., sigmoid, tanh), gradients can explode, reaching values far exceeding the floating-point representation capacity of the hardware.  This results in `NaN` (Not a Number) values propagating through the network, ultimately halting training.  The clipping operations attempt to mitigate this by limiting the magnitude of the gradients, but if the gradients are *already* `NaN` or `Inf` before the clipping operation, the clipping will not be able to correct the problem.  The clipping operation itself cannot repair an already corrupted gradient.  Instead, it acts as a preventative measure.

**2. Numerical Overflow/Underflow:**  The calculation of gradients often involves many chained multiplications and divisions.  Especially with large networks and batch sizes, intermediate values during these computations can easily fall outside the representable range of floating-point numbers (typically `float32`).  Underflow produces very small values close to zero, which can lead to vanishing gradients, whereas overflow results in `Inf` or `NaN` values, causing immediate training failure.  Even if the final gradient is within a reasonable range, intermediate steps might cause the problem, necessitating careful attention to the numerical stability of the model architecture and training procedure. This is often exacerbated when working with activation functions that produce values close to zero or one, particularly when dealing with high dimensionality and complex activation schemes.

**3. Improper Interaction with Custom Training Loops:** TensorFlow 1.14 provides considerable flexibility in designing custom training procedures. However, improperly integrating gradient clipping within a custom loop can lead to errors.  For instance, if the clipping operation is placed incorrectly within the gradient update step, it might not be applied to all the gradients, resulting in only partial correction and eventual training instability. Similarly, neglecting to handle potential exceptions (like `tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` which may be raised by numerical overflow in the clipping operation) can lead to silent failures, masking the underlying problem.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Correct Application of `tf.clip_by_norm`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... Define your model and loss function ...

optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001)

gradients, variables = zip(*optimizer.compute_gradients(loss))

gradients, _ = tf.clip_by_global_norm(gradients, 5.0) # Clip gradients to a global norm of 5.0

train_op = optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, variables))

# ... Rest of your training loop ...
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates the correct usage of `tf.clip_by_global_norm`. The function takes a list of gradients and a clipping threshold.  It scales all the gradients such that their global norm (the L2 norm of the concatenated gradient vector) does not exceed the threshold. This is generally preferred over individual clipping of each gradient, as it maintains the relative magnitudes between gradients, improving stability.  Crucially, the clipping happens *before* the `apply_gradients` step.


**Example 2:  Handling potential `NaN` values with `tf.clip_by_value`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... Define your model and loss function ...

optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.1)

gradients, variables = zip(*optimizer.compute_gradients(loss))

clipped_gradients = [tf.clip_by_value(grad, -10.0, 10.0) if grad is not None else None for grad in gradients]

#Check for NaN values before applying gradients
with tf.control_dependencies([tf.assert_none_equal(tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(tf.is_nan(g), tf.float32)) if g is not None else 0, 0, message="NaN gradient detected") for g in clipped_gradients]):
    train_op = optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(clipped_gradients, variables))

# ... Rest of your training loop ...
```

**Commentary:** This illustrates the use of `tf.clip_by_value` to limit individual gradient values.  Here we introduce a safety check using `tf.assert_none_equal` to explicitly detect and halt the training process if a `NaN` gradient is encountered after clipping. This is crucial, as `tf.clip_by_value` itself won't prevent the generation of `NaN` values; it merely clips already existing values.  Note that using `tf.cond` for more sophisticated error handling may be necessary in more complex scenarios.


**Example 3:  Gradient Clipping in a Custom Training Loop**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... Define your model and loss function ...

optimizer = tf.train.RMSPropOptimizer(learning_rate=0.0005)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for batch in data_loader:
            _, loss_val, grads_norm = sess.run([train_op, loss, tf.global_norm(gradients)], feed_dict={...})
            if grads_norm > 10:  # Check the global norm of gradients
                print("Gradient norm exceeded threshold:", grads_norm) # Log the problem, but continue training
                # Consider implementing more sophisticated backoff strategies


```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates monitoring the global norm of gradients within a custom training loop.  The global norm is calculated and checked. While this example doesn't directly implement clipping within the loop, it highlights a crucial aspect of debugging: monitoring relevant metrics to detect potential issues *before* they lead to catastrophic failure.  It showcases a simpler monitoring approach rather than direct clipping within the loop. Implementing clipping within this structure would require explicit gradient computation and application steps, mimicking the approach in Example 1.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation for version 1.14.  Comprehensive textbooks on numerical methods for scientific computing.  Advanced topics in deep learning, focusing on optimization algorithms and stability.  Research papers on gradient-based optimization techniques, exploring topics like adaptive learning rates and other regularization strategies.  These resources will provide the necessary background and context for a deep understanding of gradient clipping and related numerical issues in TensorFlow.
