The most common reason a Keras sequential model with a custom loss function fails to learn effectively stems from an improperly implemented gradient calculation within the custom loss itself. I've encountered this firsthand several times during model development, where seemingly innocuous code resulted in a vanishing or exploding gradient, halting any progress. The gradient, calculated via backpropagation, is the foundation for weight adjustments in a neural network. If this calculation is incorrect or undefined, the model will not adapt to the training data.

A custom loss function in Keras typically operates on two inputs: `y_true` (the ground truth labels) and `y_pred` (the model’s predicted values). The function’s output is a single scalar representing the loss for the given batch. Keras relies on TensorFlow’s automatic differentiation capabilities to compute the gradient of this loss with respect to the model's parameters. However, automatic differentiation only works correctly if the operations within the loss function are differentiable and well-defined. If the loss calculation includes operations that are either non-differentiable or that lead to undefined behavior (e.g., division by zero, logarithms of zero or negative numbers), the gradient calculation will be flawed, hindering model training. Incorrect shaping or handling of tensor dimensions within the loss function are also frequent culprits.

Consider these potential issues: 1) non-differentiable functions such as piecewise linear functions that lack a smooth derivative at specific points, or any operation that involves a sudden change in value; 2) operations that lead to NaN (Not a Number) values in the intermediate computation because NaN gradients will propagate through the network effectively halting training; 3) incorrect application of TensorFlow/Keras API functions that do not compute gradients as expected, such as treating non-TensorFlow operations within the loss scope; and 4) not properly using TensorFlow operations to handle batched computation, specifically ensuring the loss returns a scalar for each batch.

To address these common problems, careful debugging of the custom loss function is paramount. Print statements to inspect the values of intermediate variables (e.g., `y_true`, `y_pred`, and the intermediate results within the loss computation) are essential. Another valuable debugging method involves testing the custom loss using a simplified setup, potentially using a single batch of dummy data, to verify its behavior independently from the full model training pipeline. Additionally, visualizing the loss during training and plotting the gradients (if possible using TensorFlow debug tools) can help identify issues like vanishing or exploding gradients.

Here are several code examples which exemplify common pitfalls, demonstrating both faulty and correct loss function implementations, with commentary.

**Example 1: Non-differentiable Operation (Faulty)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def custom_loss_faulty(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Faulty custom loss with a non-differentiable step function.
    """
    threshold = 0.5
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.where(y_pred > threshold, tf.abs(y_true-y_pred), tf.abs(y_true-y_pred) * 0.0))
    return loss


model_faulty = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(1,))
])
model_faulty.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss_faulty)

x_train = np.random.rand(100, 1).astype('float32')
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, (100, 1)).astype('float32')
history_faulty = model_faulty.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

print(f"Loss after 100 epochs of training faulty loss = {history_faulty.history['loss'][-1]:.4f}")

```

**Commentary:**

This example introduces a step function. The `tf.where` operation creates a discontinuous point at the `threshold`, where the loss calculation abruptly changes. While this might seem like a reasonable way to create different behaviors based on the prediction values, it renders the loss non-differentiable at the transition point. During backpropagation, TensorFlow struggles to define a meaningful gradient at this point, thus preventing the model from learning effectively. The model may converge towards some initial random behavior, but further improvement would be impossible because the underlying gradient mechanism is flawed. The reported loss at the end of 100 epochs should be relatively high and may not change substantially across training epochs.

**Example 2: Operations Causing NaNs (Faulty)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def custom_loss_nan(y_true, y_pred):
  """
  Faulty custom loss with operations that can cause NaNs.
  """
  epsilon = 1e-8
  loss = tf.reduce_mean(-tf.math.log(y_pred + epsilon) * y_true)
  return loss

model_nan = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(1,))
])
model_nan.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss_nan)

x_train = np.random.rand(100, 1).astype('float32')
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, (100, 1)).astype('float32')
history_nan = model_nan.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

print(f"Loss after 100 epochs of training NaN loss = {history_nan.history['loss'][-1]:.4f}")

```
**Commentary:**

In this scenario, the custom loss function implements a form of cross-entropy. While the formula is generally used for classification problems, a critical flaw exists, particularly when ‘y_true’ values may be zeros. Here, multiplying by `y_true` and taking a log of the prediction plus a small constant is not the problem, but the output could potentially become infinite or NaN depending on the implementation of the underlying operation. This code does not explicitly generate a NaN in this toy example but for values close to 0 for `y_pred` the `-log` function might be problematic for the gradient calculations during model fitting. NaNs can quickly propagate back through the network, causing the loss function to cease improving and the model to remain untrained. The model may start learning and then stagnate, converging to a high error rate, and the printed loss may be NaN, or might jump up and down wildly.

**Example 3: Correct Custom Loss Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def custom_loss_correct(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Correct custom loss using differentiable operations.
    """
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))
    return loss

model_correct = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear', input_shape=(1,))
])
model_correct.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss_correct)

x_train = np.random.rand(100, 1).astype('float32')
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1).astype('float32')
history_correct = model_correct.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

print(f"Loss after 100 epochs of training correct loss = {history_correct.history['loss'][-1]:.4f}")

```
**Commentary:**

This implementation demonstrates a proper custom loss function. The squared difference between the true and predicted values is differentiable, and its reduction through `tf.reduce_mean` provides a well-behaved loss value. The use of `tf.square` is a differentiable operation and is compatible with TensorFlow's automatic differentiation system and is typically robust to numerical issues. With such a custom loss, the model should learn effectively and progressively achieve a lower loss rate across each epoch.

For further guidance, I recommend consulting the TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on automatic differentiation and custom training loops. The Keras documentation regarding custom loss functions provides illustrative examples, while various online courses on deep learning offer comprehensive explanations. While specifics may change with version upgrades, reviewing the official resources remains the best approach to build robust and effective custom losses. When debugging and implementing a custom loss function, remember to start with simpler, well-established loss functions, before gradually adding complexity and custom logic, to diagnose the underlying issues.
