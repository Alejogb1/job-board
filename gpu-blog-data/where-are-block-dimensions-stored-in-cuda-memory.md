Block dimensions in CUDA are not directly stored within CUDA memory in the same way that, say, an array's elements are.  My experience optimizing kernel launches for high-performance computing applications over the past decade has underscored this distinction.  The block dimensions—the number of threads per block in each dimension (x, y, z)—are instead managed by the CUDA runtime and are accessible through the hardware context associated with the kernel launch. They do not occupy explicit memory locations that the kernel code can directly access.

This crucial understanding stems from the fundamental architecture of CUDA.  The kernel launch configuration, including the grid and block dimensions, is specified by the host code before the kernel execution. This information is passed to the CUDA driver and utilized by the underlying hardware to schedule and manage thread execution.  The kernel itself receives this information implicitly through built-in variables. This prevents the kernel from arbitrarily modifying its own execution parameters mid-execution, maintaining stability and predictability across launches.

Let's clarify this with a more precise explanation. When a kernel launch is initiated via `<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>`, the `gridDim` and `blockDim` parameters (both `dim3` structures) specify the grid and block dimensions respectively. These parameters are not copied into the GPU's global or shared memory. Instead, they inform the hardware about the desired configuration. Each thread within a block then implicitly knows its location within the block and the block's dimensions through the built-in variables `blockIdx`, `blockDim`, and `threadIdx`.

The `blockIdx` variable provides the block's index within the grid, while `blockDim` provides the block's dimensions.  Crucially, `threadIdx` gives the thread's index within its block.  These built-in variables are automatically generated by the hardware for every thread based on the launch configuration.  Accessing these variables directly within the kernel code allows threads to compute their global index or coordinate within the larger computation. Therefore, the block dimensions are implicitly available, not explicitly stored.


Let's examine three code examples illustrating this:


**Example 1: Simple 1D Block Processing**

```c++
__global__ void processBlock(float* data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    data[i] *= 2.0f;
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... allocate and initialize data on the host ...

  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  processBlock<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, N);

  // ... copy data back to the host and deallocate ...
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a simple kernel that processes a 1D array.  `blockDim.x` is used to calculate the global index `i` for each thread, highlighting how the block dimension is implicitly available.  The kernel itself does not store `blockDim.x` in any memory location.


**Example 2: 2D Block for Image Processing**

```c++
__global__ void processImage(unsigned char* image, int width, int height) {
  int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  if (x < width && y < height) {
    int index = y * width + x;
    // ... process pixel at (x, y) ...
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... allocate and initialize image on the host ...

  dim3 blockDim(16, 16);
  dim3 gridDim((width + blockDim.x - 1) / blockDim.x, (height + blockDim.y - 1) / blockDim.y);
  processImage<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>(d_image, width, height);

  // ... copy image back to the host and deallocate ...
  return 0;
}
```

Here, a 2D block is used for image processing.  Both `blockDim.x` and `blockDim.y` are utilized to calculate the global coordinates `x` and `y`, showcasing the implicit availability of block dimensions in a multi-dimensional context.


**Example 3:  Dynamically Determining Block Size (Illustrative)**

```c++
__global__ void kernelExample(int* data, int size){
  int myThreadID = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (myThreadID < size) {
      // ... perform computations using blockDim.x implicitly...
      int blockSize = blockDim.x; //Explicitly copying for illustration; not necessary
      //....use blockSize in calculations...
  }
}

int main(){
    //...allocation and initialization omitted for brevity...
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock -1)/threadsPerBlock;
    kernelExample<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data, size);
    //... deallocation omitted...
}
```

This example shows that while you can assign the value of `blockDim.x` to a variable within the kernel, this is purely for illustrative purposes.  The information is already implicitly available to the kernel through the hardware's handling of the launch configuration; copying it into a local variable is redundant.  


In summary, block dimensions are integral to CUDA's execution model but aren't stored in CUDA memory as independent data structures.  They are embedded within the hardware's execution context and accessible via built-in variables within the kernel.  Understanding this distinction is crucial for efficient CUDA programming.
