Running TensorFlow without a dedicated GPU, while seemingly counterintuitive given its initial design, is a common and often necessary practice. Many scenarios, such as development on personal laptops, deployment on servers lacking GPU acceleration, or utilizing embedded systems, necessitate leveraging CPU-based computation. The core functionality of TensorFlow remains fully accessible, although with performance implications. This discussion details the process and considerations involved in executing TensorFlow models using the CPU, with examples demonstrating its practical application.

When TensorFlow detects no available GPU or is explicitly configured to use the CPU, it falls back to optimized CPU implementations for tensor operations. These implementations utilize multi-threading to maximize resource utilization across available CPU cores, attempting to compensate for the inherent parallelism advantage of GPUs. The fundamental difference lies in the execution paradigm: GPUs excel at massively parallel computations, processing many operations simultaneously, while CPUs, though capable of parallelism, operate with fewer cores designed for general-purpose computing. Consequently, model training and inference can be significantly slower on CPUs, particularly for large, complex models. However, for smaller models, initial prototyping, or situations where GPU availability is absent, CPU-based TensorFlow provides a viable alternative.

Configuration for CPU usage is typically automatic, but it can also be controlled explicitly. By default, TensorFlow attempts to detect available GPUs. If none are found or an appropriate driver is missing, TensorFlow will default to using the CPU. However, certain environments or specific configurations may require manual intervention. These interventions are generally accomplished using the TensorFlow API to control device placement, ensuring that computations are assigned to the desired device, CPU or GPU. This is also beneficial when needing to select between multiple GPUs.

Let's explore this with some code examples:

**Example 1: Basic CPU-only Execution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Explicitly configure TensorFlow to only use the CPU.
tf.config.set_visible_devices([], 'GPU')

# Verify device availability.
physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices()
for device in physical_devices:
  print(f"Device Name: {device.name}, Device Type: {device.device_type}")


# Create a simple tensor.
a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

# Perform matrix multiplication.
c = tf.matmul(a, b)
print("Result of matrix multiplication:")
print(c)

# Demonstrate a simple computation.
result = tf.reduce_sum(c)
print("Sum of all elements: ", result.numpy())

```

This initial example demonstrates the most straightforward method. By calling `tf.config.set_visible_devices([], 'GPU')`, I explicitly tell TensorFlow to disregard any available GPUs. The subsequent check using `tf.config.list_physical_devices()` reveals what devices are actually being used; in this case the CPU only. The following code segments show simple tensor creation and operations, illustrating that these computations now execute on the CPU. Even without any special device specifications beyond disabling GPUs, TensorFlow functions smoothly using the CPU. This is the simplest use case for those who want to force the usage of CPU instead of GPU, such as debugging or testing.

**Example 2: Utilizing Specific CPU Cores (Advanced)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Specify the number of threads to use for CPU operations.
os.environ['TF_NUM_INTEROP_THREADS'] = '2'  # Threads for independent operations
os.environ['TF_NUM_INTRAOP_THREADS'] = '4'  # Threads within an operation

# Create tensors and perform operations.
a = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
b = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))

c = tf.matmul(a, b)

# Perform several sequential operations.
d = tf.add(c, a)
e = tf.subtract(d, b)

result = tf.reduce_sum(e)

print("Computation Complete. Sum: ", result.numpy())

```
This second example ventures into controlling the degree of parallelism available on the CPU. By utilizing the environment variables `TF_NUM_INTEROP_THREADS` and `TF_NUM_INTRAOP_THREADS`, I can manage the number of threads TensorFlow uses. `TF_NUM_INTEROP_THREADS` dictates the threads used for independent operations, while `TF_NUM_INTRAOP_THREADS` manages threads within a single operation. Careful tuning of these parameters might improve CPU performance, as too many threads can result in context switching overhead, thereby decreasing overall speed. I've set the interop threads to 2 and intraop threads to 4 in this case, but optimal values depend heavily on the hardware and the complexity of computation. It demonstrates that some low-level tuning is possible, despite the primary bottleneck of utilizing the CPU instead of a GPU.

**Example 3: Device Placement with `tf.device` Scope**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Verify device availability.
physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices()
for device in physical_devices:
  print(f"Device Name: {device.name}, Device Type: {device.device_type}")

# Example of explicitly running code on CPU using device scope
with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
    a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
    b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

    c = tf.matmul(a, b)
    print("Result of matrix multiplication on CPU:")
    print(c)

    result = tf.reduce_sum(c)
    print("Sum of all elements on CPU: ", result.numpy())
```

This final example demonstrates an alternative method of device specification. The `tf.device('/CPU:0')` context manager allows one to define specific parts of the computation to execute on a particular device, here explicitly the CPU. This enables a finer control over device usage than the global `set_visible_devices` approach. This method is particularly helpful when mixing CPU and GPU computations, if a GPU were present, in a single script. Using `tf.device` allows the user to carefully manage how tensors are generated and processed on different pieces of hardware. It's a granular approach that is useful when mixing CPU computation with GPU, if a GPU were available.

Regarding resource recommendations, while specific websites are not directly provided here, I suggest starting with TensorFlow's official documentation. The guides offer a comprehensive overview of device placement and configurations. Books that focus on deep learning with TensorFlow can also be helpful, particularly chapters on optimization and deployment. Additionally, many online courses dedicated to TensorFlow include material that touches upon CPU-based execution, often as part of a broader discussion on resource management. The TensorFlow API documentation is paramount and provides the specifics on every method, including device placement configuration. Furthermore, online communities such as Stack Overflow often provide real-world examples and insights, but caution should always be used to verify these examples. It is paramount that any user of a software framework understands the underlying concepts, regardless of how easy the API may seem.

In summary, while GPUs are often the preferred hardware for TensorFlow, CPU execution is a valid and necessary alternative in many situations. By understanding device placement configurations and performance limitations, one can effectively leverage TensorFlow even without dedicated GPU hardware.
