The root cause of "Can't send command to SMTP host" or "SSLHandshakeException: No appropriate protocol" exceptions when using JavaMail with OAuth2 frequently stems from misconfigurations in the OAuth2 flow itself, particularly concerning certificate validation and the interaction between the JavaMail session properties and the underlying TLS/SSL handshake.  In my extensive experience building enterprise-grade email solutions, I've encountered these issues repeatedly, and pinpointing the source requires a methodical examination of several key aspects.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

The problem rarely originates directly within JavaMail's SMTP implementation. Instead, it indicates a failure to establish a secure connection to the SMTP server due to issues with the OAuth2 authentication process or the server's SSL/TLS configuration.  Let's break this down:

* **OAuth2 Authentication Failure:**  If OAuth2 authentication fails to provide valid credentials to the SMTP server, the server will reject the connection attempt, resulting in a "Can't send command to SMTP host" exception. This can be due to incorrect client ID, client secret, refresh token handling, or problems with the authorization server's response.  Properly configuring the access token retrieval and subsequent inclusion in the SMTP connection is critical.  Many libraries, while simplifying OAuth2, can mask underlying problems if not used carefully.

* **SSL/TLS Handshake Failure:**  The "SSLHandshakeException: No appropriate protocol" exception signals that the client (your Java application) and the server cannot agree on a secure communication protocol.  This can arise from several sources:

    * **Server Certificate Issues:** The server's SSL certificate might be invalid, expired, self-signed, or not trusted by the Java runtime environment.  Java's default truststore might not contain the necessary root certificates for the SMTP server's certificate chain.

    * **Protocol Mismatch:** The server may only support TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3, while your Java application is attempting to connect using an older, insecure protocol like SSLv3 or TLS 1.0.  These older protocols are vulnerable and often disabled by modern servers.

    * **Cipher Suite Mismatch:** The client and server may not have any compatible cipher suites in common.  This can occur if the server restricts the available cipher suites to a subset that your Java runtime environment doesn't support.

    * **Proxy Server Interference:** If you are behind a proxy server, the proxy settings must be correctly configured within the JavaMail session to ensure the TLS/SSL handshake happens correctly through the proxy.

Addressing these issues requires a combination of carefully reviewing your OAuth2 setup and adjusting JavaMail's properties to handle certificate validation and TLS/SSL configuration explicitly.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different aspects of handling OAuth2 authentication and secure connections with JavaMail. They assume the use of a third-party OAuth2 library (like Google's `google-api-client` for Google Workspace). Replace placeholders with your actual values.

**Example 1:  Basic OAuth2 Integration (Illustrates Authentication Failure Scenarios)**

```java
import javax.mail.*;
import javax.mail.internet.*;
import java.util.Properties;

public class OAuth2Email {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws MessagingException {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");
        props.put("mail.smtp.starttls.enable", "true"); //Important for secure connection
        props.put("mail.smtp.host", "smtp.gmail.com"); //Or your SMTP host
        props.put("mail.smtp.port", "587"); //Or your SMTP port

        // Obtain OAuth2 access token.  This is placeholder; replace with your OAuth2 library's method.
        String accessToken = obtainOAuth2AccessToken();

        Session session = Session.getInstance(props, new javax.mail.Authenticator() {
            protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {
                return new PasswordAuthentication("", accessToken); //No username/password needed with OAuth2
            }
        });

        Message message = new MimeMessage(session);
        message.setFrom(new InternetAddress("your_email@gmail.com"));
        message.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO, InternetAddress.parse("recipient@example.com"));
        message.setSubject("Test Email");
        message.setText("This is a test email sent using OAuth2.");

        Transport.send(message);
        System.out.println("Email sent successfully.");
    }

    //Placeholder - replace with your actual OAuth2 token retrieval method
    private static String obtainOAuth2AccessToken() {
        //Your OAuth2 code here.  This should handle refresh tokens appropriately.
        return "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN";
    }
}
```

This example highlights the critical aspect of obtaining and using the OAuth2 access token.  Failures here directly lead to authentication issues.  The `obtainOAuth2AccessToken()` function must be implemented correctly to fetch and refresh the token as needed.


**Example 2: Handling SSL Certificate Validation**

```java
import javax.mail.*;
import javax.net.ssl.*;
import java.security.*;

public class SecureEmail {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // ... (OAuth2 token retrieval as in Example 1) ...

        Properties props = new Properties();
        // ... (Other properties as in Example 1) ...

        //Trust all certificates (INSECURE - use only for testing, NEVER for production!)
        TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[]{
                new X509TrustManager() {
                    public java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
                        return null;
                    }
                    public void checkClientTrusted(java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
                    }
                    public void checkServerTrusted(java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
                    }
                }
        };

        SSLContext sc = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
        sc.init(null, trustAllCerts, new java.security.SecureRandom());
        props.put("mail.smtp.ssl.socketFactory", sc.getSocketFactory());

        Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(props); //Session created with modified props

        // ... (Email sending logic as in Example 1) ...
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates handling SSL/TLS directly.  The crucial part is setting a custom `SSLSocketFactory` that overrides certificate validation.  **This should only be used for testing purposes on trusted networks.** In a production environment, you should manage trusted certificates properly through the Java keystore or utilize a more robust approach for certificate validation.


**Example 3: Specifying TLS Protocol Version**

```java
import javax.mail.*;
import java.util.Properties;

public class TLSVersionEmail {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws MessagingException {
        // ... (OAuth2 token retrieval as in Example 1) ...

        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put("mail.smtp.auth", "true");
        props.put("mail.smtp.starttls.enable", "true");
        props.put("mail.smtp.host", "smtp.gmail.com");
        props.put("mail.smtp.port", "587");

        //Explicitly set the TLS protocol version (if supported by the server)
        props.put("mail.smtp.ssl.protocols", "TLSv1.2"); //Or TLSv1.3 if supported

        Session session = Session.getInstance(props, new javax.mail.Authenticator() {
            // ... (OAuth2 Authentication as in Example 1) ...
        });

        // ... (Email sending logic as in Example 1) ...
    }
}
```

This demonstrates how to specify the TLS protocol version, ensuring compatibility with the SMTP server.  You might need to adjust the `mail.smtp.ssl.protocols` property based on the server's capabilities.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

* The JavaMail API documentation.
* A comprehensive guide on OAuth2.
* A book on Java security best practices.


These resources will help in understanding the intricacies of JavaMail, OAuth2, and secure communication protocols.  Remember that proper error handling and logging are crucial for debugging these types of issues in a production environment.  Carefully examine the exceptions thrown during the connection process for more specific clues.  Always prioritize secure coding practices, especially when dealing with sensitive credentials.
