Optimizing MySQL queries designed to subtract values from two specific rows hinges on precise row identification and efficient data retrieval.  My experience working on large-scale financial data systems has highlighted the crucial role of indexing and careful query construction in achieving this.  Inefficient approaches can lead to full table scans, significantly impacting performance, especially with growing datasets.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in avoiding inefficient methods.  Directly subtracting values from two rows identified solely by their content (e.g., `WHERE column1 = 'value1' AND column2 = 'value2'`) is feasible but potentially slow.  MySQL’s query optimizer might not be able to leverage indexes effectively if the WHERE clause involves complex comparisons or functions applied to indexed columns.  A superior approach leverages unique identifiers (primary keys or unique indexes) for pinpointing specific rows. This enables the optimizer to efficiently locate and retrieve the required data without resorting to full table scans.  If no unique identifier exists, creating one might be necessary – depending on data structure and business rules, this could involve creating a new column or employing a composite key.

Furthermore, the method for performing the subtraction influences performance.  The most efficient approach utilizes a single query rather than separate `SELECT` statements.  This reduces the round trip times to the database server and minimizes overhead.  The `JOIN` operation, when used correctly, is far superior to multiple queries combined through application-level logic.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Using Primary Key for Subtraction (Most Efficient)**

Assume a table named `transactions` with a primary key `transaction_id` and columns `amount` and `type`. We need to subtract the `amount` of a 'debit' transaction from a 'credit' transaction, both identified by their `transaction_id`.

```sql
SELECT
    (
        SELECT amount FROM transactions WHERE transaction_id = 123 AND type = 'credit'
    ) -
    (
        SELECT amount FROM transactions WHERE transaction_id = 456 AND type = 'debit'
    ) AS difference;
```

This approach is suboptimal. While functional, it involves two separate queries, creating unnecessary overhead.  It would be significantly slower for large datasets compared to the next example.


**Example 2:  Using JOIN for Efficient Subtraction**

This example uses a `JOIN` to retrieve both rows in a single query.  It's significantly more efficient than separate `SELECT` statements.

```sql
SELECT
    credit.amount - debit.amount AS difference
FROM
    transactions AS credit
JOIN
    transactions AS debit ON credit.transaction_id = 123 AND debit.transaction_id = 456
WHERE
    credit.type = 'credit' AND debit.type = 'debit';
```

This is a considerable improvement. The `JOIN` operation allows MySQL to fetch both required rows simultaneously, optimizing the process.  The `WHERE` clause ensures only the intended rows are used.  The performance gain becomes particularly noticeable with larger datasets where the overhead of multiple queries becomes significant.  However, a further optimization exists.


**Example 3:  Leveraging a Unique Index for Enhanced Performance**

This refines the previous example to improve performance even further.  This assumes a unique index exists on the `transaction_id` and `type` columns (a composite index would be optimal), allowing for a quicker lookup.

```sql
SELECT
    credit.amount - debit.amount AS difference
FROM
    transactions AS credit
JOIN
    transactions AS debit ON 1=1
WHERE
    credit.transaction_id = 123 AND credit.type = 'credit'
    AND debit.transaction_id = 456 AND debit.type = 'debit';
```

This method leverages the inherent efficiency of a unique index.  The `JOIN` condition `ON 1=1` performs a cross join, effectively allowing the `WHERE` clause to filter the results. The inclusion of the `transaction_id` and `type` in the `WHERE` clause allows the optimizer to efficiently use the composite index, making this the most efficient approach.  Note that using a Cartesian product here is justifiable because the number of resulting rows remains very small (either one row or none). For large sets of data, the `JOIN` condition should be more restrictive to prevent excessive results.

In conclusion, while several methods exist for subtracting values from two specific MySQL rows, the most efficient approach relies on the use of unique identifiers, preferably through primary or unique indexes, and the strategic employment of `JOIN` operations within a single query. The choice of method directly influences query execution speed, becoming especially critical when dealing with substantial datasets. Careful consideration of indexing strategies alongside query construction ensures optimal performance and avoids unnecessary overhead.  Understanding these principles is crucial for building scalable and efficient database applications.
