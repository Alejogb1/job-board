CUDA installation on Ubuntu 20.04 necessitates a methodical approach due to its dependency on specific hardware and software configurations. My experience optimizing high-performance computing workloads across various Linux distributions, including extensive work with CUDA on Ubuntu systems, has highlighted the critical role of precise driver selection and package management.  Ignoring these can lead to protracted debugging sessions, especially when dealing with conflicting libraries.

**1. System Prerequisites and Driver Verification:**

Before initiating the CUDA installation, confirming hardware compatibility is paramount.  I've encountered numerous instances where users attempted installation on unsupported GPUs, leading to immediate failure.  The NVIDIA website provides detailed specifications for CUDA-compatible GPUs.  Verify that your graphics card is listed and supports the desired CUDA version.  Next, determine your GPU's compute capability. This crucial piece of information dictates the maximum CUDA version you can utilize.  Incorrectly identifying this can lead to compilation errors and runtime crashes during application execution.  Utilize the `nvidia-smi` command in your terminal.  Its output will clearly detail the driver version, GPU name, and compute capability.  A mismatch between your driver version and the CUDA toolkit version will almost certainly result in installation problems.  Therefore, ensuring your NVIDIA driver is up-to-date and compatible with the target CUDA version is an absolute necessity.  I strongly advise against using the default Ubuntu driver repository for NVIDIA cards; use the NVIDIA driver repository instead. This minimizes the chance of version conflicts.

**2.  Installation Procedure:**

The CUDA Toolkit installation generally follows a straightforward process, but nuances exist.  Firstly, download the appropriate CUDA Toolkit runfile from the NVIDIA website. Select the correct version based on your GPU's compute capability and operating system. After download verification (using checksums is strongly recommended), open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the runfile. Execute the installer with root privileges using `sudo`.  The installer will guide you through the process, prompting you to accept the license agreement and select the installation components.  I recommend opting for a custom installation, allowing selective installation of components to avoid unnecessary bloat. This is particularly beneficial if you're only utilizing specific CUDA libraries.  Ensure you select the CUDA driver, toolkit, and libraries pertinent to your needs.  Common issues at this stage arise from insufficient disk space or permission errors, so verifying these beforehand is crucial.

**3.  Post-Installation Verification:**

Upon completion, verifying the installation is essential.  The `nvcc` compiler is the core of the CUDA toolkit.  Locate it within the installation directory to confirm its presence.  A simple test program aids in confirming CUDA functionality.

**Code Example 1: Basic CUDA Kernel and Host Code**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void addKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    int *a, *b, *c;
    int *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

    // Allocate host memory
    a = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    b = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
    c = (int*)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

    // Initialize host memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        a[i] = i;
        b[i] = i * 2;
    }

    // Allocate device memory
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, n * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, n * sizeof(int));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, n * sizeof(int));

    // Copy data from host to device
    cudaMemcpy(d_a, a, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, b, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Launch kernel
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    addKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

    // Copy data from device to host
    cudaMemcpy(c, d_c, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Verify results
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (c[i] != a[i] + b[i]) {
            printf("Error at index %d: %d != %d\n", i, c[i], a[i] + b[i]);
            return 1;
        }
    }

    // Free memory
    free(a);
    free(b);
    free(c);
    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);

    printf("CUDA program executed successfully.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a simple vector addition using CUDA.  Successful compilation and execution using `nvcc` confirm the CUDA toolkit's basic functionality.  Errors at this stage frequently indicate issues with the CUDA installation or environment variables.

**Code Example 2:  Checking CUDA Version**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    cudaDeviceProp prop;
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);
    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: No CUDA devices found.\n");
        return 1;
    }
    cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, 0);
    printf("CUDA Version: %d.%d\n", prop.major, prop.minor);
    return 0;
}

```

This short program uses the CUDA runtime API to retrieve and print the CUDA version installed on the system.  This provides a quick way to check if the correct version is active.

**Code Example 3:  Using CUDA Libraries (cuBLAS)**

```c++
#include <cublas_v2.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    cublasHandle_t handle;
    cublasCreate(&handle);

    int n = 1024;
    float *a, *b, *c;
    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

    // Allocate host memory
    a = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    b = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    c = (float*)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Initialize host memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        a[i] = i;
        b[i] = i * 2;
    }

    // Allocate device memory
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, n * sizeof(float));

    // Copy data from host to device
    cudaMemcpy(d_a, a, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, b, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Perform vector addition using cuBLAS
    cublasSaxpy(handle, n, 1.0f, d_b, 1, d_c, 1);

    // Copy data from device to host
    cudaMemcpy(c, d_c, n * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    //Free memory and handle
    free(a); free(b); free(c);
    cudaFree(d_a); cudaFree(d_b); cudaFree(d_c);
    cublasDestroy(handle);

    return 0;
}
```

This showcases utilizing the cuBLAS library for a more sophisticated operation—vector addition—demonstrating the functionality of the installed CUDA libraries.  Failure here often points to problems with library linking.

**4.  Resource Recommendations:**

The NVIDIA CUDA documentation is indispensable.  The CUDA programming guide provides in-depth explanations of the CUDA architecture and programming model.  Exploring the CUDA samples directory, included with the toolkit, is crucial for understanding practical implementation.   Finally, consulting a comprehensive guide on Linux system administration is always beneficial.


Addressing these points comprehensively minimizes installation pitfalls, enabling a seamless CUDA experience on Ubuntu 20.04. Remember that careful attention to detail in each step is crucial for success.  Rushing the process often leads to significant troubleshooting.  Following this procedure, based on my extensive practical experience, should resolve the majority of installation-related issues.
