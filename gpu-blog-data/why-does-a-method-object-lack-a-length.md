Method objects in Python, unlike sequences or strings, do not possess a `__len__` method or a `length` attribute, because they are not containers of data whose quantity needs enumeration. Instead, they represent bound or unbound callable functions that operate on data. This distinction is fundamental to understanding Python's object model and how methods are invoked. Over my years working with Python, particularly in building complex microservice architectures, this specific characteristic of method objects frequently surfaces when employing functional programming paradigms or debugging dynamic code.

A method, in essence, is a function that’s associated with an object (an instance of a class). In Python, when you access a method through an object, you're not directly getting the function; you're receiving a bound method object. This binding involves associating the object instance as the first argument (typically called `self`) that will be passed to the underlying function when it's called. If a method is accessed through the class itself, it returns an unbound method which requires an explicit instance as its first argument. This core mechanic defines the difference between standalone functions and methods and dictates why methods do not encapsulate size data that `len()` could meaningfully operate on.

Consider that a Python list, string, or tuple has a clearly defined notion of length: the number of elements they contain. Calling `len()` on these types invokes their `__len__` method, which returns this count. On the other hand, a method, whether bound or unbound, does not hold data in a way that's comparable. Its primary function is to execute code against existing data, not hold such data directly. Attempting to measure length would therefore be an operation that simply doesn't fit their intended purpose. The focus of method objects is on the execution logic contained within their associated functions, and the association with an instance, in the case of bound methods. To put it succinctly, they are not collections, and cannot be treated as such.

The following code examples will illustrate the absence of a `length` attribute and the distinction between method objects and data structures:

**Example 1: Unbound Method**

```python
class MyClass:
    def my_method(self, value):
        return value * 2

print(type(MyClass.my_method))

try:
    print(len(MyClass.my_method))
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

try:
   print(MyClass.my_method.length)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this example, `MyClass.my_method` retrieves an unbound method object. The first `print` demonstrates that its type is `<class 'function'>`. Notice, however, that while an unbound method is a `function`, Python's dynamic object handling can, at times, obscure that this is not a standard function, but a function associated with a class, whose first parameter is intended to receive an instance of this class. The `len()` function throws a `TypeError` when applied to this method object because methods do not provide a `__len__` implementation. Finally, attempting to access a `.length` attribute raises an `AttributeError` because it does not exist. These exceptions underscore that an unbound method object does not represent something that can be quantified in length. The functionality of the method rests within its associated function.

**Example 2: Bound Method**

```python
instance = MyClass()
bound_method = instance.my_method

print(type(bound_method))

try:
    print(len(bound_method))
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

try:
   print(bound_method.length)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This example shows similar behavior but with a bound method, which is created by accessing the method through an object instance (`instance.my_method`). The first `print` confirms that the type of `bound_method` is `<class 'method'>`, illustrating the binding to a specific instance. When you access a function via an instance, it is wrapped in a method object, which encapsulates both the function and the instance it is bound to. The `TypeError` from `len()` and `AttributeError` for accessing a `length` attribute persist. Again, the method represents a callable bound to an instance and is not a container with a measurable length.

**Example 3: Function vs. Method**

```python
def standalone_function(value):
    return value * 3

my_list = [1, 2, 3]

print(type(standalone_function))
print(type(my_list.__len__))


try:
    print(len(standalone_function))
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")


try:
    print(len(my_list.__len__))
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Here, the example highlights the contrast between a standalone function (`standalone_function`), which also doesn’t have length (and therefore causes a `TypeError` when used with `len()`) and the built-in `__len__` method of a list, which itself is a method object but is fundamentally associated with a type which has a notion of a 'length'. This emphasizes that while both `my_list.__len__` and the `standalone_function` are method or function objects, they are treated differently by Python. When it is defined as `__len__`, Python knows that it represents a notion of length and provides the built-in function `len()` to act on the method object. However, neither can be directly passed to `len()`. Calling `len(my_list)` is translated to `my_list.__len__()`, which demonstrates the distinction of an object exposing a notion of length as opposed to a method not being an entity that can have a length. Specifically, method objects are not designed to have an intrinsic, quantifiable “size” or length as data-holding entities like collections. The second `try` block demonstrates that even when you grab the method from a list via `my_list.__len__`, you cannot call `len` on the method object. Methods are designed to be invoked not measured by length.

To further solidify your understanding of Python's object model, I would recommend exploring resources focusing on descriptors, metaclasses, and the specifics of the object model. The official Python documentation is an excellent source for this. I found the documentation surrounding magic methods, specifically those related to collections, highly useful in clarifying this distinction. Also, exploring resources that detail the differences between functions and methods can be equally beneficial. Understanding how methods are bound to instances helps to explain why they do not behave as containers and therefore do not possess a `__len__` method or a `length` attribute. Understanding the nature of methods as bound or unbound function objects, rather than as data containers, is the key to understanding this aspect of Python. Finally, resources that discuss the concept of duck-typing in Python provide context to why methods are invoked dynamically instead of treated as first class objects with defined length.
