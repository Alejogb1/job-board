CUDA's inherent capabilities do not directly facilitate multi-GPU distributed processing independent of an external message-passing interface (MPI) like OpenMPI.  My experience developing high-performance computing applications for geophysical simulations has consistently demonstrated this limitation. While CUDA excels at parallelizing computations within a single GPU, managing inter-GPU communication and data transfer requires a dedicated framework for coordinating processes across multiple devices.  OpenMPI, or a similar solution, provides this crucial coordination layer.

Let's clarify this point.  CUDA provides a programming model focused on thread management and memory access within the confines of a single GPU.  It handles the complexities of parallel processing at the kernel level, leveraging the massive parallel compute capabilities of the GPU. However,  CUDA itself lacks the mechanisms for distributed memory management and process synchronization necessary for efficient communication between distinct GPUs, each possessing its own independent memory space.  Attempting to coordinate computations across multiple GPUs solely using CUDA APIs would result in extremely inefficient, potentially deadlock-prone, code.

The core challenge lies in the distributed nature of the problem.  Each GPU becomes a separate computational node, requiring a means to exchange data and synchronize execution phases.  CUDA's programming model is designed for a single GPU, and while you can launch kernels on multiple GPUs using appropriate CUDA contexts and streams, the management of data transfer and overall coordination is not natively handled.  This is where MPI shines.  MPI provides a robust and well-established framework for inter-process communication, enabling efficient data exchange between processes running on separate GPUs, or even different machines entirely.

This isn't to say that there are no alternative approaches, but they typically involve leveraging other libraries and frameworks alongside CUDA.  For instance, one could use a combination of CUDA with a proprietary library specifically designed for inter-GPU communication within a specific hardware architecture.  However, these solutions are often vendor-specific, lacking the portability and wide community support that MPI offers.


**Code Examples and Commentary**

Here are three code examples illustrating different aspects of GPU programming and the role of MPI in multi-GPU scenarios.  These examples are simplified for illustrative purposes and would need significant adaptations for real-world applications.

**Example 1: Single-GPU CUDA Kernel**

This example showcases a simple CUDA kernel performing vector addition on a single GPU.  It demonstrates the basic CUDA programming paradigm, highlighting the lack of inter-GPU communication.

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation, data transfer, kernel launch, result retrieval) ...
  return 0;
}
```

This code focuses entirely on the computation within a single GPU. No inter-GPU communication is involved.  The `vectorAdd` kernel operates on data residing in the GPU's memory.

**Example 2: Multi-GPU Processing with OpenMPI**

This example outlines the structure of a multi-GPU program utilizing OpenMPI.  The essential elements are MPI initialization, data distribution, independent computation on each GPU, and data aggregation.

```c++
#include <mpi.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
  int rank, size;
  MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
  MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

  // ... (Data distribution using MPI_Scatter) ...

  // ... (CUDA kernel launch on each GPU) ...

  // ... (Data aggregation using MPI_Gather) ...

  MPI_Finalize();
  return 0;
}
```

This code uses MPI primitives (`MPI_Init`, `MPI_Comm_rank`, `MPI_Comm_size`, `MPI_Scatter`, `MPI_Gather`, `MPI_Finalize`) to manage communication and data exchange across multiple processes, each potentially running on a different GPU.  CUDA kernels would be launched within each process, handling the individual GPU computations.


**Example 3:  Illustrating the Need for MPI (Conceptual)**

This example demonstrates a hypothetical scenario highlighting the limitations of CUDA alone for multi-GPU tasks.

```c++
// Hypothetical (and flawed) attempt at multi-GPU without MPI
// This code will NOT work correctly.

// Assume two GPUs, GPU0 and GPU1.

// GPU0 performs computation on data A
// GPU1 performs computation on data B
// Result needs to be combined from both GPUs.

// ... (CUDA code for GPU0 processing data A) ...

//  Here's the problem: There's no mechanism within CUDA itself to
//  efficiently communicate the result from GPU0 to GPU1 (or a CPU)
//  for final aggregation.

// ... (CUDA code for GPU1 processing data B) ...

// The results from GPU0 and GPU1 are inaccessible to each other
// without an external communication mechanism like MPI.

```

This demonstrates the fundamental problem.  Without MPI or a similar system, there is no built-in way for separate CUDA contexts to communicate and share results efficiently.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of CUDA programming, I recommend consulting the official NVIDIA CUDA documentation.  For MPI, a comprehensive textbook on parallel computing with MPI would be invaluable.  Furthermore, exploring literature on high-performance computing and parallel algorithms will be beneficial for developing efficient multi-GPU applications.  Finally, familiarizing oneself with the nuances of different GPU architectures and their memory models is crucial for optimizing performance.
