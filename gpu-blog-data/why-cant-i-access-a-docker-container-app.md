The inability to access a Docker container application on ports other than the default, typically port 80 or 443, almost invariably stems from a misconfiguration of the container's port mappings.  During my years developing and deploying microservices within Dockerized environments, I've encountered this issue countless times, often tracing it back to a simple oversight in the `docker run` command or the `docker-compose.yml` file.  The core issue is a disconnect between the port the application *listens* on *inside* the container and the port the Docker daemon *exposes* to the host machine.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Docker utilizes a mechanism called port mapping to connect ports within a container to ports on the host machine.  The `-p` flag (or its equivalent in `docker-compose`) specifies this mapping.  The syntax is typically `<host_port>:<container_port>`.  If this mapping is incorrect or missing, external access to the application will be impossible, even if the application itself is running correctly within the container.

For example, if your application listens on port 3000 inside the container (as specified in the application's configuration) but you haven't mapped that port using `-p 3000:3000`, then attempting to access the application on your host machine's port 3000 will fail. The host's port 3000 won't be connected to anything; the connection attempt will simply time out.

Another frequent error is using port numbers already in use on the host machine.  This will result in the port mapping failing, even if the syntax is correct.  Confirm that the host port you specify is not already allocated to another process using tools like `netstat` (Linux) or `netstat -ano` (Windows) or similar commands provided by your operating system.

Finally, firewall rules on the host machine can prevent external access to even correctly mapped ports. This is less common if you're working locally, but becomes crucial when deploying to cloud environments or servers.  Verify your hostâ€™s firewall configuration to ensure that the mapped port is allowed through.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Port Mapping**

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 my-app
```

This command attempts to run the `my-app` container. The application *inside* `my-app` may be listening on port 3000, not 8080.  This results in a failed connection attempt when accessing `localhost:8080` or the relevant host IP on port 8080.  The correct command, assuming the application listens on port 3000 within the container, would be:


```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:3000 my-app
```

This mapping redirects requests to port 8080 on the host to port 3000 within the container.  I've encountered this situation numerous times during integration testing, where a developer forgot the internal application port.


**Example 2: docker-compose with Port Mapping**

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    image: my-app:latest
    ports:
      - "80:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./app:/usr/src/app
```

This `docker-compose.yml` file shows a correctly configured port mapping. The application inside the `my-app` container is listening on port 8080, and this configuration maps that internal port to port 80 on the host machine.  In a previous project, I discovered a similar configuration but with an incorrect port number inside the container, underlining the importance of cross-checking container and host port numbers against application configurations. Note the use of `volumes`, showcasing how I've integrated development workflows with Docker to enable seamless code changes and restarts.


**Example 3: Host Port Conflict**

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 my-app
```

This command attempts to map the container's port 80 to the host's port 80. However, if port 80 is already in use on the host (e.g., by Apache or Nginx), the port mapping will fail silently (or might generate an error depending on the Docker daemon configuration). Before executing this command, I consistently check which ports are occupied on the host machine using `netstat` to avoid these common conflicts.  Once I identified and stopped the conflicting process (Apache in this case), the mapping worked successfully.  This illustrates a critical step in the Docker workflow: always check host resource allocation before initiating containerization.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Docker documentation is invaluable.  Consult the sections on networking and port mappings.  Understanding the concepts of container networking, specifically the bridge networking mode, will provide a stronger understanding of how Docker handles port mappings.  Explore the nuances of specifying port mappings in different Docker commands (`docker run`, `docker-compose`, etc.).  Finally, a strong grasp of network troubleshooting tools (`netstat`, `ss`, `tcpdump`) will significantly improve your debugging skills in similar situations.  The ability to trace network connections, identify listening ports, and analyze connection failures is paramount in diagnosing such issues.
