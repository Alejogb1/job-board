Object detection models frequently incorporate post-processing steps to refine raw model outputs into final bounding box predictions and class labels. These steps, often performed using TensorFlow operations after the core model inference, can sometimes be an obstacle when attempting direct access to the model’s raw, unrefined predictions. In my experience, bypassing this post-processing is crucial for tasks like analyzing intermediate feature maps, developing custom post-processing pipelines, or integrating the model into systems requiring different output formats. The strategy primarily involves tracing the output tensors of the core detection network and selectively removing the functions that perform bounding box decoding and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS).

The typical post-processing pipeline in object detection involves several stages. The model's raw output often comprises feature maps or tensor encodings. These encodings are then transformed into bounding box coordinates and class scores, typically through anchor-based or anchor-free methods involving matrix multiplication, logistic activation functions, and coordinate transformations. The final step usually includes NMS, a critical algorithm to eliminate redundant bounding boxes based on intersection-over-union (IoU) and confidence scores. The removal process targets these post-processing functions while preserving the core detection network outputs. We'll accomplish this by either modifying the model's graph structure or re-implementing the core model's prediction mechanism. I will focus on strategies assuming you have access to a TensorFlow object detection model where these operations are not directly defined by a custom function or class.

One approach, which can be effective with models that expose internal layers, is to directly intercept and use the desired intermediate tensors. This frequently entails inspecting the model’s architecture and identifying the final layer prior to any post-processing operations. In simpler models, these layers are readily apparent in graph visualisations, where we look for the last layer performing tensor calculations, and before where any coordinate transformation and NMS algorithms occur. This can be done manually by looking at the model summary generated via `model.summary()` or using tools that visualize the model graph. Once identified, we adjust our code to return this tensor, rather than the default processed output. If you have a custom model, identifying the correct output tensor is paramount; this will be different with models based on faster RCNN versus a single shot detector like SSD. If you are using a model from the TF object detection API, the output node can usually be obtained from the model configuration and inspecting the input and output node specifications.

Another method, applicable when manipulating the original model graph is not feasible, involves recreating the core prediction mechanism. This requires understanding how the model outputs encode bounding box coordinates, classes, and scores. In essence, you must replicate the transformations the model performs up to the point where post-processing begins. Often, this information is encoded in the model definition or configuration files. For anchor-based detectors, this would entail manually calculating the bounding box coordinates from the model predictions relative to predefined anchors. If your model utilizes anchor free mechanisms, you would need to calculate the bounding boxes based on parameters or center points predicted by the model. This method demands a deeper understanding of the specific model architecture but allows a flexible way to use intermediate outputs.

The third approach, which often works with models from libraries that use a separate post processing function or class, is to manually re-implement a simplified post processing stage. Here, we retain the core of the post processing logic but remove the NMS step. This approach assumes you need the bounding boxes and classes, but do not need NMS filtering of boxes based on confidence scores and IoU. This is similar to the previous approach, in that it requires you to understand the model output format, but allows more control compared to simply using the intermediate tensors.

Here are three code examples, demonstrating each of the approaches:

**Example 1: Intercepting Intermediate Tensor Output**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Assume a basic model structure for demonstration
class DummyDetector(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DummyDetector, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')
        self.conv2 = layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu')
        self.flatten = layers.Flatten()
        self.dense_boxes = layers.Dense(4 * 100)  # Predicts 100 boxes
        self.dense_scores = layers.Dense(1 * 100, activation='sigmoid')  # 100 class scores (single class)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        boxes = self.dense_boxes(x)
        scores = self.dense_scores(x)
        return boxes, scores

# Instantiate and perform dummy inference
model = DummyDetector()
dummy_input = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3))
boxes, scores = model(dummy_input)

print(f"Shape of boxes before post processing:{boxes.shape}")
print(f"Shape of scores before post processing:{scores.shape}")
# Create a new model that exposes the raw tensors
class RawTensorModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, model):
    super(RawTensorModel, self).__init__()
    self.model = model

  def call(self, x):
    boxes, scores = self.model(x)
    return boxes, scores

raw_model = RawTensorModel(model)
raw_boxes, raw_scores = raw_model(dummy_input)
print(f"Shape of boxes after accessing via new model:{raw_boxes.shape}")
print(f"Shape of scores after accessing via new model:{raw_scores.shape}")

```
*Commentary:* This example shows how to extract the raw bounding box and score tensors from the model by creating a new model that uses the intermediate tensors. The `RawTensorModel` model does not perform any additional transformations on top of the intermediate tensors. This works since the `DummyDetector` has no other post-processing built in. The dummy model is set up such that the box and score outputs are directly accessible via the call function. This is not usually the case and requires identifying the appropriate intermediate tensors prior to any bounding box decoding and NMS operations.

**Example 2: Recreating Prediction Logic (Anchor-Based)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume model outputs box offsets and class scores
# Typically, there would be a dedicated layer to predict these, not a dense layer

class AnchorBasedModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, num_anchors=100):
      super(AnchorBasedModel, self).__init__()
      self.conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')
      self.conv2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu')
      self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
      self.dense_offsets = tf.keras.layers.Dense(4 * num_anchors) # Output offsets per box
      self.dense_scores = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1 * num_anchors, activation='sigmoid') # Output per-box class score
      self.num_anchors = num_anchors
      self.anchors = self.generate_anchors() # Example, a constant set of anchors

  def call(self, x):
    x = self.conv1(x)
    x = self.conv2(x)
    x = self.flatten(x)
    offsets = self.dense_offsets(x)
    scores = self.dense_scores(x)
    return offsets, scores


  def generate_anchors(self):
        #Placeholder
        anchors = tf.random.uniform(shape=(self.num_anchors, 4), minval=0, maxval=1)
        return tf.cast(anchors, dtype=tf.float32)

def decode_boxes(offsets, anchors):
    # Assume offsets are deltas with respect to anchors
    # Example transformation: offset * scale + anchor location
    scale = 10
    offsets = tf.reshape(offsets, (-1, 4))
    x1 = anchors[:, 0] + offsets[:, 0] * scale
    y1 = anchors[:, 1] + offsets[:, 1] * scale
    x2 = anchors[:, 2] + offsets[:, 2] * scale
    y2 = anchors[:, 3] + offsets[:, 3] * scale
    return tf.stack([x1, y1, x2, y2], axis=-1)

model = AnchorBasedModel()
dummy_input = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3))
offsets, scores = model(dummy_input)
# Recreate bounding box coordinates from offsets and anchors
decoded_boxes = decode_boxes(offsets, model.anchors)
print(f"Shape of Decoded Boxes:{decoded_boxes.shape}")
print(f"Shape of raw model scores: {scores.shape}")
```

*Commentary:* This example simulates an anchor-based object detector, where the model outputs bounding box offsets relative to predefined anchor boxes and class scores. The `decode_boxes` function implements a simplified bounding box decoding method, transforming the offsets and anchors into absolute bounding box coordinates.  This shows how you would re-create the logic between the core model output and the final bounding boxes, rather than directly using the post-processing.  This requires you to know how the bounding box values are encoded with respect to the anchors used by the model.

**Example 3: Simplified Post Processing Without NMS**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Assume a model with a specific structure
class SimplifiedModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, num_boxes=100):
        super(SimplifiedModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')
        self.conv2 = layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu')
        self.flatten = layers.Flatten()
        self.dense_boxes = layers.Dense(4 * num_boxes)
        self.dense_scores = layers.Dense(1 * num_boxes, activation='sigmoid')
        self.num_boxes = num_boxes
    def call(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        boxes = tf.reshape(self.dense_boxes(x), [-1, 4]) # Reshape into box dimension
        scores = self.dense_scores(x)
        return boxes, scores

def post_process_without_nms(boxes, scores, score_threshold=0.5):
   mask = scores > score_threshold
   filtered_boxes = tf.boolean_mask(boxes, mask)
   filtered_scores = tf.boolean_mask(scores, mask)
   return filtered_boxes, filtered_scores

model = SimplifiedModel()
dummy_input = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3))
boxes, scores = model(dummy_input)

# Apply post-processing without NMS
filtered_boxes, filtered_scores = post_process_without_nms(boxes, scores)
print(f"Shape of Filtered Boxes:{filtered_boxes.shape}")
print(f"Shape of Filtered Scores:{filtered_scores.shape}")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates how to retain the score thresholding of a simplified post-processing pipeline, while excluding NMS. This code implements a function which filters the predicted bounding boxes and scores based on a score threshold parameter, effectively replacing NMS with a simpler score based filter. It illustrates how the key aspects of post processing can be retained while selectively removing the specific logic of NMS.

In conclusion, removing post-processing from an object detection model requires a comprehensive understanding of the model's architecture and the transformations applied to its raw output. The specific approach chosen depends on the available resources and desired level of control.  Regardless of the chosen method, the goal is consistent – to access the intermediate tensors of the model prior to the standard post-processing. For further exploration, consider researching model architectures such as Faster R-CNN, SSD, and YOLO, focusing on the steps involved in converting model outputs into bounding box predictions. Also explore the TensorFlow object detection API documentation for examples of model configuration and output node specifications. Delving deeper into these areas will provide more practical context for implementing these techniques effectively.
