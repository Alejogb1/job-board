The pre-trained BERT model, available through TensorFlow Hub, provides contextualized word embeddings that significantly enhance performance across various natural language processing tasks. I've observed firsthand, after experimenting with multiple NLP architectures, that directly accessing these embeddings requires a nuanced understanding of the Hub module's structure and TensorFlow's functional API. The model isn’t a simple function; rather, it’s a configurable object that produces different outputs based on the input provided.

The fundamental mechanism involves instantiating a pre-trained BERT model via TensorFlow Hub's module URL and then passing tokenized input sequences to the model's callable interface. This interface doesn't return token embeddings directly. Instead, it yields a dictionary containing various keys, notably 'sequence_output' and 'pooled_output'. These outputs represent different layers of the BERT model and cater to various downstream tasks. The `sequence_output` provides the contextualized embedding for *each* token within the input sequence; its shape is typically `[batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size]`. The `pooled_output`, on the other hand, represents a single, aggregated embedding of the entire input sequence, useful for tasks such as sentence classification; its shape is usually `[batch_size, hidden_size]`.

The initial step is to download and load the BERT model from TensorFlow Hub. The recommended method is to use the `hub.KerasLayer` class, which seamlessly integrates with Keras and provides a trainable layer. This contrasts with older approaches that used the `hub.Module` directly. This latter method required manual handling of graph connections and was far less efficient and readable within TensorFlow 2.x and beyond. The KerasLayer approach, in my experience, allows for straightforward model composition and manipulation.

To efficiently use BERT, your text data needs to undergo a proper preprocessing step which includes tokenization using the BERT model's vocabulary. This ensures the input tokens are represented by their correct indices within the vocabulary, enabling the model to map to its learned vector representations. A corresponding tokenizer is available within the TensorFlow Hub module itself or, more practically, within libraries like `transformers`. Without correct tokenization, BERT will produce either unpredictable or nonsensical outputs.

Once the input text is tokenized and converted into numerical IDs (and padding masks), it can then be fed to the BERT model. It is crucial to understand the output structures of the model to perform effective feature extraction. Typically, I have seen that tasks like word-level tagging or named entity recognition heavily depend on the `sequence_output` where the embeddings are contextually related to specific positions within the text. Conversely, sentence-level tasks such as sentiment analysis or paraphrase detection are more likely to use the `pooled_output`.

Let’s examine some code examples to illustrate this process.

**Example 1: Extracting Sequence Embeddings**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
from transformers import BertTokenizer

# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
bert_url = "https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/3"
bert_layer = hub.KerasLayer(bert_url)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Example input text
text = ["This is an example sentence.", "Another sentence here."]

# Tokenize and prepare input for BERT
encoded_input = tokenizer(text, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='tf')
input_ids = encoded_input['input_ids']
attention_mask = encoded_input['attention_mask']

# Pass the tokenized input to the BERT layer
outputs = bert_layer([input_ids, attention_mask])

# Access sequence embeddings
sequence_output = outputs['sequence_output']

print("Shape of sequence output:", sequence_output.shape) # Output: (2, sequence_length, 768)
```

In this example, I begin by loading both the BERT model and its corresponding tokenizer. The tokenizer encodes our example sentences into numerical IDs, adds padding, and produces attention masks that the model uses to ignore masked tokens. Then, by passing the input IDs and the attention masks to the BERT model, we get the `sequence_output`. As printed, the shape is `(2, sequence_length, 768)`. The first dimension represents the batch size, the second the sequence length (padded to be equal), and the third is the hidden dimension which is 768 for this specific model. Each token in each sentence now has a 768 dimensional vector associated with it.

**Example 2: Extracting Pooled Embeddings**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
from transformers import BertTokenizer

# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
bert_url = "https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/3"
bert_layer = hub.KerasLayer(bert_url)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Example input text
text = ["This is an example sentence.", "Another sentence here."]

# Tokenize and prepare input for BERT
encoded_input = tokenizer(text, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='tf')
input_ids = encoded_input['input_ids']
attention_mask = encoded_input['attention_mask']

# Pass the tokenized input to the BERT layer
outputs = bert_layer([input_ids, attention_mask])

# Access pooled embeddings
pooled_output = outputs['pooled_output']

print("Shape of pooled output:", pooled_output.shape) # Output: (2, 768)
```

This example demonstrates how to extract the `pooled_output` instead of the `sequence_output`. Notice that the input preparation and model loading remain identical to the previous example. However, instead of accessing `outputs['sequence_output']`, we are now accessing `outputs['pooled_output']`. The shape of this output is `(2, 768)`, indicating that we now have a single 768 dimensional vector for each sentence in the batch. This embedding is more suitable for sentence-level classification or regression tasks.

**Example 3: Fine-Tuning BERT for Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
from transformers import BertTokenizer
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
bert_url = "https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/3"
bert_layer = hub.KerasLayer(bert_url, trainable=True)  # Enable fine-tuning
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Example input text and labels
text = ["This is a positive example.", "This is a negative one."]
labels = [1, 0] # 1 for positive, 0 for negative

# Tokenize and prepare input for BERT
encoded_input = tokenizer(text, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='tf')
input_ids = encoded_input['input_ids']
attention_mask = encoded_input['attention_mask']

# Define a simple classification model
inputs = {'input_ids': input_ids, 'attention_mask': attention_mask}
outputs = bert_layer(inputs)
pooled_output = outputs['pooled_output']
dropout = layers.Dropout(0.1)(pooled_output)
output = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(dropout)
model = models.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=output)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model on some dummy data (replace with real data)
model.fit(inputs, tf.constant(labels, dtype=tf.float32), epochs=1)

print(f"Model Summary: {model.summary()}")

```
This final example illustrates the core concept of fine-tuning the BERT model. The notable change is that we set `trainable=True` when loading the `hub.KerasLayer`. This allows the BERT model's weights to be updated during training. We define a simple classification layer on top of the pooled output, including a dropout layer to reduce overfitting. The model is then compiled and trained using some dummy labels. The key here is the `trainable=True` which enables the entire model to be fine-tuned for the specific task. This illustrates the versatility and power of using BERT as a component within larger pipelines. The ability to fine-tune a model pre-trained on vast amounts of text data to a specific task usually gives much better results than starting with training from scratch.

For further exploration and deeper understanding of BERT and TensorFlow Hub, I would suggest delving into the official TensorFlow documentation and tutorials. Additionally, the documentation and code examples from the `transformers` library provide a comprehensive resource for working with various pre-trained models and tokenizers. Reading academic papers outlining BERT architecture and its different implementations provides the theoretical background which enhances practical application. Also reviewing well-established machine learning textbooks can strengthen your understanding of underlying concepts behind various layers used for NLP tasks.
