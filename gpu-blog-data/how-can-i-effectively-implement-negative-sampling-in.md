Negative sampling is crucial for optimizing performance in many neural network architectures, particularly those dealing with large vocabularies, like word2vec or recommendation systems.  My experience optimizing a large-scale collaborative filtering model highlighted the critical need for efficient negative sampling implementation within the TensorFlow 2.0 Keras framework.  Naive approaches lead to significant computational bottlenecks; therefore, understanding the nuances of implementation is vital.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Negative sampling aims to reduce the computational cost associated with training models that involve predicting from a vast output space. Instead of computing the loss for all possible output classes (which can be computationally prohibitive), we randomly sample a subset of negative examples for each training instance.  The loss function then compares the model's prediction for the positive example against the predictions for the sampled negative examples.  Effective negative sampling requires careful consideration of several aspects:

* **Sampling Distribution:** The probability of selecting a negative sample should not be uniform.  Items that occur more frequently should have a lower probability of being selected as a negative sample. This is because frequent items already have many positive examples contributing to their representation, mitigating the need for numerous negative samples.  The common approach is to use a power-law distribution, often with an exponent of 0.75, based on item frequency.

* **Number of Negative Samples:** This hyperparameter needs careful tuning. Too few samples may lead to insufficient learning, while too many increase computational overhead.  Optimal values depend heavily on the dataset and model architecture.  Experimentation and validation are crucial.

* **Sampling Strategy:** Efficient sampling methods are essential for scalability.  Techniques like Alias Method or efficient implementations of weighted random sampling are preferred over naive approaches which can be significantly slower for large datasets.

* **Integration with Loss Function:**  The negative sampling strategy needs seamless integration with the chosen loss function, typically a binary cross-entropy variant. The positive example is treated as a positive instance (label 1), while the sampled negative examples are treated as negative instances (label 0).

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Negative Sampling with tf.random.categorical**

This example demonstrates a basic negative sampling implementation using `tf.random.categorical`.  While simple, it may not be the most efficient for very large vocabularies.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def simple_negative_sampling(positive_examples, vocabulary_size, num_neg_samples):
    # Assuming positive_examples is a tensor of positive indices
    neg_samples = tf.random.categorical(
        tf.math.log(tf.ones((tf.shape(positive_examples)[0], vocabulary_size))), #Uniform distribution
        num_neg_samples
    )
    return tf.reshape(neg_samples, [-1])

# Example usage:
positive_examples = tf.constant([1, 5, 10])
vocabulary_size = 1000
num_neg_samples = 5
negative_samples = simple_negative_sampling(positive_examples, vocabulary_size, num_neg_samples)
print(negative_samples)
```

This code generates uniform negative samples.  For improved performance with non-uniform distributions, the `tf.ones` tensor needs replacement with a tensor reflecting the desired power-law distribution based on item frequencies.


**Example 2: Negative Sampling with Weighted Random Sampling (using tf.random.shuffle and tf.gather)**

This approach uses a more efficient sampling technique, leveraging `tf.random.shuffle` for randomization and `tf.gather` for selection based on weighted probabilities.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def weighted_negative_sampling(positive_examples, weights, num_neg_samples):
    # weights should be a 1D tensor representing item frequencies
    num_items = tf.shape(weights)[0]
    probabilities = weights / tf.reduce_sum(weights)
    indices = tf.random.shuffle(tf.range(num_items))
    cumulative_probabilities = tf.cumsum(probabilities)
    random_numbers = tf.random.uniform((tf.shape(positive_examples)[0], num_neg_samples))
    sampled_indices = tf.searchsorted(cumulative_probabilities, random_numbers)
    return tf.reshape(tf.gather(indices, sampled_indices), [-1])


# Example Usage:
weights = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
weights = weights/np.sum(weights)
weights = tf.constant(weights)
positive_examples = tf.constant([1, 5, 10])
num_neg_samples = 5
negative_samples = weighted_negative_sampling(positive_examples, weights, num_neg_samples)
print(negative_samples)

```

This example utilizes a pre-calculated weight vector; in real-world scenarios, these weights would be derived from the item frequencies in the training data.


**Example 3:  Integration with a Keras Model and Binary Cross-Entropy**

This example demonstrates how to integrate negative sampling within a Keras model using a binary cross-entropy loss function.  It focuses on a simplified recommendation system.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, Input, Dot, Flatten, Concatenate, Dense

def create_recommendation_model(num_users, num_items, embedding_dim, num_neg_samples):
    user_input = Input(shape=(1,))
    item_input = Input(shape=(1,))

    user_embedding = Embedding(num_users, embedding_dim)(user_input)
    item_embedding = Embedding(num_items, embedding_dim)(item_input)

    user_vec = Flatten()(user_embedding)
    item_vec = Flatten()(item_embedding)

    dot_product = Dot(axes=1)([user_vec, item_vec])

    model = keras.Model(inputs=[user_input, item_input], outputs=dot_product)
    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam') #Uses binary_crossentropy for pos/neg sample comparison
    return model

# Dummy data and weights (replace with your actual data)
num_users = 1000
num_items = 5000
embedding_dim = 64
num_neg_samples = 5
weights = np.random.rand(5000) #Replace with real-world item frequencies
weights = weights/np.sum(weights)
weights = tf.constant(weights)

model = create_recommendation_model(num_users, num_items, embedding_dim, num_neg_samples)

#Training Loop (Illustrative)
user_ids = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
item_ids = tf.constant([10, 20, 30])
negative_samples = weighted_negative_sampling(item_ids, weights, num_neg_samples)


#Combine positive and negative examples for training. Note this needs expansion for larger batch sizes
all_item_ids = tf.concat([item_ids, negative_samples],axis = 0)
labels = tf.concat([tf.ones(len(item_ids)), tf.zeros(len(negative_samples))], axis = 0)
user_ids = tf.concat([user_ids]* (num_neg_samples + 1), axis = 0)

model.fit([user_ids,all_item_ids], labels, epochs=10)
```

This example shows a basic training loop;  a more robust implementation would involve mini-batching and more sophisticated data handling. The critical aspect is the use of `binary_crossentropy` to evaluate the model's prediction for the positive and negative samples, effectively leveraging the negative sampling results within the loss calculation.
