The deprecation of `tf.summary` in TensorFlow 2.x and the transition to the `tf.compat.v1.Summary` API necessitates a careful understanding of the underlying changes in TensorFlow's data logging mechanisms.  My experience migrating large-scale production models from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x highlighted the crucial difference:  `tf.summary` operates within the eager execution context of TensorFlow 2.x, whereas `tf.compat.v1.Summary` maintains compatibility with the graph-based execution model of TensorFlow 1.x.  This distinction dictates the appropriate usage and necessitates different approaches depending on the desired execution environment.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow 2.x introduced eager execution as the default, allowing for immediate execution of operations.  This contrasts sharply with TensorFlow 1.x's graph-based execution where operations were defined within a computational graph and executed only after the graph's construction. The `tf.summary` function in TensorFlow 2.x reflects this paradigm shift, integrating seamlessly with the eager execution environment.  However, for compatibility with pre-existing TensorFlow 1.x codebases, the `tf.compat.v1` module provides backward compatibility functions, including `tf.compat.v1.Summary`.  This function replicates the behavior of the original `tf.summary` from TensorFlow 1.x, allowing developers to maintain existing logging workflows during a gradual migration process.

The key difference lies in how the summaries are written.  `tf.summary` typically uses `tf.summary.FileWriter` to write summaries directly during eager execution. In contrast, `tf.compat.v1.Summary` often requires the creation of a `tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter` and the use of `tf.compat.v1.Session` to manage the graph and write summaries after graph construction. Ignoring this distinction leads to errors related to the lack of a graph context or improper summary writer usage.

Therefore, the "correct" approach depends entirely on whether you are working within a TensorFlow 1.x-style graph or a TensorFlow 2.x eager execution environment.  While `tf.compat.v1.Summary` provides the bridge to maintain legacy code, new projects should leverage the features and efficiencies of `tf.summary` within the eager execution framework.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: TensorFlow 1.x style (using `tf.compat.v1.Summary`)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a graph
with tf.compat.v1.Graph().as_default():
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        # Create a summary writer
        summary_writer = tf.compat.v1.summary.FileWriter('./logs', sess.graph)

        # Create a scalar summary
        summary_op = tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar('loss', tf.constant(10.5))

        # Run the session and write the summary
        summary = sess.run(summary_op)
        summary_writer.add_summary(summary, 0)
        summary_writer.flush()
        summary_writer.close()
```

This example demonstrates the traditional TensorFlow 1.x approach.  A graph is explicitly defined, a session is created, and summaries are written within the session context.  `tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar` creates the scalar summary which is then added to the writer using `add_summary`.  The `FileWriter` is crucial for writing the summary data to disk. Note the use of `sess.graph` to add the graph to TensorBoard.


**Example 2: TensorFlow 2.x eager execution (using `tf.summary`)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Enable eager execution (though this is the default in TF2.x)
tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()

# Create a summary writer
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('./logs')

# Create a scalar summary
with summary_writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.scalar('loss', 10.5, step=0)

# This is not strictly necessary in eager mode, but demonstrates the process
summary_writer.flush()
```

This example showcases the cleaner, more concise approach of TensorFlow 2.x.  The `tf.summary.create_file_writer` creates the writer. The `with` statement ensures that the summary is written to the correct writer.  Crucially, there's no explicit session management needed. The `step` argument tracks the training step.


**Example 3:  Handling multiple summaries**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('./logs')

with summary_writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.scalar('loss', 10.5, step=0)
    tf.summary.scalar('accuracy', 0.8, step=0)
    tf.summary.histogram('weights', tf.random.normal((10,)), step=0)

summary_writer.flush()
```

This builds upon Example 2, showing how to log multiple summaries within a single step. This is essential for comprehensive model monitoring.  It leverages the flexibility of the TensorFlow 2.x eager execution to directly write different types of summaries without the overhead of manual graph management.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is your primary resource for staying current with API changes and best practices.  Consult the TensorFlow guide dedicated to visualization and the specific sections covering summaries and TensorBoard.  Furthermore, review examples and tutorials on creating custom summaries if you need more specialized logging functionalities.  Finally, examine the `tf.compat.v1` documentation for details on backward compatibility functions and their relationship to their TensorFlow 2.x equivalents.  This allows for a well-informed and robust migration strategy.
