The maximum potential block size for CUDA unary functions utilizing variable shared memory is not a fixed value, but rather a function of the available shared memory per multiprocessor, the size of each thread's allocated shared memory, and the hardware's limitations on warp and block dimensions. The misconception that there's a single definitive limit often arises from a conflation of architectural limits with practical constraints imposed by resource availability. My experience developing high-throughput image processing pipelines on various NVIDIA architectures highlights this nuanced relationship.

The CUDA architecture, particularly since compute capability 2.0, allows for dynamically allocated shared memory per kernel invocation. This shared memory resides on the multiprocessor and is accessible to all threads within a block, facilitating efficient inter-thread communication. When we examine a unary function utilizing this feature, our primary concern becomes maximizing block occupancy without exceeding available shared memory or running into the warp size and block size limits of the hardware. Let's break down the key limitations:

First, every multiprocessor on the GPU has a fixed amount of shared memory. This memory is not specific to a single block; rather, it's shared by all blocks concurrently executing on that multiprocessor. A primary limitation lies in the aggregate sum of shared memory used by all running blocks. I've observed that exceeding the multiprocessor shared memory capacity results in reduced multiprocessor utilization due to scheduling limitations and resource pressure.

Second, there is an upper limit on the number of threads within a block. Currently, CUDA supports a maximum of 1024 threads per block. However, this is the absolute limit, and achieving it is often impractical. The constraint of warp execution dictates that a block’s size must be a multiple of the warp size (typically 32). This means that non-multiple block sizes will always result in some thread id's being unused in the last warp.

Third, the maximum block size is not independent of the number of registers each thread uses, nor the amount of shared memory allocated per thread. These three resources - thread count, register use, and shared memory - together determine the total number of blocks the hardware can concurrently execute and therefore, contribute to overall performance. The more resources used per thread, the less overall throughput can be achieved, and more importantly, the fewer blocks can be launched to fill the GPU cores.

Therefore, the 'maximum potential block size' in the context of variable shared memory for unary functions is not a single static value. Instead, it requires careful balancing between these architectural limitations and the specific algorithm’s needs. A too small block size means less potential parallelism, whereas a too large block size will constrain the number of active blocks, and thus, the utilization. My process involves calculating the shared memory required per thread, then determining the maximum allowable number of threads per block that maintains sufficient multiprocessor occupancy given the shared memory allocation.

Let's consider three illustrative examples:

**Example 1: Simple Summation with Variable Shared Memory**

In this scenario, each thread calculates an intermediate sum, and the shared memory is used to efficiently combine these partial sums.

```cpp
__global__ void sumKernel(int *input, int *output, int n, int *shared) {
    int tid = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    extern __shared__ int sdata[];
    int partialSum = 0;

    if (tid < n) {
        partialSum = input[tid];
    }
     sdata[threadIdx.x] = partialSum;

    __syncthreads();
     int i = blockDim.x / 2;
     while (i !=0) {
         if (threadIdx.x < i){
             sdata[threadIdx.x] += sdata[threadIdx.x + i];
         }
     __syncthreads();
         i >>= 1;
     }
    if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
        output[blockIdx.x] = sdata[0];
    }
}
```

This kernel uses a dynamically allocated shared memory array, `sdata`. Here, if we wish to process 1024 elements, we might launch blocks of 256 threads each. Each thread uses `sizeof(int)` bytes for its local copy in shared memory. The `blockDim.x` value is set during kernel launch.  The total allocation for `sdata` is therefore `blockDim.x * sizeof(int)`, which must be passed during kernel launch.  This approach is suitable for relatively small datasets where the overhead of block creation isn't prohibitive.

**Example 2: Image Processing with Local Neighborhood Access**

Consider an image filter where each pixel accesses its immediate neighbors in shared memory. This requires allocating space in shared memory for the pixel data, plus a neighborhood radius.

```cpp
__global__ void filterKernel(float *input, float *output, int width, int height, int filterRadius) {
    int x = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    int y = threadIdx.y + blockIdx.y * blockDim.y;
    extern __shared__ float sdata[];

    if (x >= 0 && x < width && y >= 0 && y < height) {
            int sIndexX = threadIdx.x;
            int sIndexY = threadIdx.y;
         
            
            int gx = x;
            int gy = y;
          
            //Load data into shared memory
          
           sdata[(sIndexY * (blockDim.x + 2* filterRadius) + sIndexX + filterRadius)] = input[(gy * width) + gx];
            
         __syncthreads();
         float filterSum = 0.0f;

         for(int i = -filterRadius; i <= filterRadius; i++){
            for (int j = -filterRadius; j <= filterRadius; j++){
                int sx = sIndexX + j + filterRadius;
                int sy = sIndexY + i + filterRadius;
             filterSum += sdata[sy*(blockDim.x+2*filterRadius) + sx] * 1.0f/( (2*filterRadius+1)*(2*filterRadius+1));
            }
         }

            output[(y*width) + x ] = filterSum;
    }
}
```

In this scenario, each thread processes a pixel. However, it also needs to hold the pixels around its pixel. This means that each thread needs not only the storage for the local pixel but also the neighbor pixels in the local block in the shared memory. If the filter radius is 1, for example, we need to provide shared memory for a local 3x3 square around each pixel in a block, and as such, the shared memory requirement per thread increases dramatically. The overall shared memory size per block is `(blockDim.x + 2*filterRadius)*(blockDim.y + 2*filterRadius) * sizeof(float)`. Therefore, the filterRadius has a significant impact on the number of blocks that can run concurrently. My typical process here is to experiment with smaller block sizes until the performance curve flattens.

**Example 3: Scan Operation with Shared Memory**

Here, a prefix sum operation is performed, a process which uses shared memory for intermediate results.

```cpp
__global__ void scanKernel(int *input, int *output, int n){
    int tid = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    extern __shared__ int sdata[];

    if(tid < n){
        sdata[threadIdx.x] = input[tid];
    } else {
        sdata[threadIdx.x] = 0;
    }

   __syncthreads();

   int offset = 1;
   for(int d = blockDim.x >> 1; d > 0; d >>=1){
        __syncthreads();
        if(threadIdx.x < d){
            int ai = offset*(2*threadIdx.x + 1)-1;
            int bi = offset*(2*threadIdx.x + 2) - 1;
             sdata[bi] += sdata[ai];
        }
        offset *= 2;
    }

  __syncthreads();

    if(threadIdx.x == 0){
        sdata[blockDim.x-1] = 0;
    }
    for(int d = 1; d < blockDim.x ; d*=2){
        offset = d;
        __syncthreads();
        if (threadIdx.x < blockDim.x && (threadIdx.x & (2*d-1))==d-1) {
            int ai = threadIdx.x;
            int bi = threadIdx.x + d;
                sdata[bi] += sdata[ai];
        }
    }
    
  __syncthreads();
   if (tid < n) output[tid] = sdata[threadIdx.x];
}
```

In this scan implementation, each thread requires `sizeof(int)` bytes in shared memory. The shared memory allocation is straightforward, and the maximum block size can often be pushed close to 1024 threads, especially if no other constraints exist. The shared memory size per block is `blockDim.x * sizeof(int)`. The key is still ensuring that register pressure is minimal. These examples collectively highlight that no single block size maximizes throughput for all cases.

**Resource Recommendations**

To deepen understanding, it is helpful to explore the following areas:

*   **CUDA Programming Guide:** NVIDIA's official documentation is comprehensive and updated with each new architecture. The sections on memory management, specifically shared memory, are invaluable.
*   **CUDA Best Practices Guide:** This document provides detailed advice on code optimization, including considerations for shared memory usage, memory alignment, and thread synchronization.
*   **Example CUDA Code Repositories:** Exploring repositories such as the NVIDIA CUDA samples can give practical insights on usage patterns and optimization strategies. Focus particularly on the kernel parameters like block dimension configurations to understand how those affect practical execution.

In conclusion, there is no universally applicable maximum potential block size for CUDA unary functions using variable shared memory. The ideal block size is a product of available shared memory, the algorithm’s memory access patterns, and the constraints of the specific GPU hardware. Thorough profiling and iterative experimentation are essential to reach optimal performance for any given application.
