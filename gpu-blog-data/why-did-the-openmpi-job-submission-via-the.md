OpenMPI job submissions failing via the Slurm REST API frequently stem from mismatched or improperly formatted JSON payloads in the POST request.  In my experience troubleshooting high-performance computing clusters, this is by far the most common cause, eclipsing network issues or Slurm daemon problems.  The API is meticulously designed, and even slight deviations from its expected structure result in rejection.  Let's examine this in detail.

1. **Clear Explanation:** The Slurm REST API employs a strict schema for job submissions.  This schema defines the required and optional fields, their data types, and their permissible values.  When submitting an OpenMPI job, the JSON payload must accurately reflect this schema.  Any discrepancy, such as an incorrect data type (e.g., submitting an integer where a string is expected), an extra field not defined in the schema, or a missing required field, will cause the submission to fail. This failure is typically signaled by an HTTP error code, most often a 400 Bad Request, accompanied by an error message within the response body that often pinpoints the issue.  Further complicating matters is the potential for errors within the OpenMPI launch parameters themselves, even if the Slurm submission portion of the JSON is structurally correct. OpenMPI requires specific formatting for its environment variables and executable command lines, which are often embedded within the Slurm submission request.  An incorrect specification here leads to OpenMPI failing to launch correctly even if Slurm accepts the job submission.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Type**

```json
{
  "account": "myaccount",
  "job_name": "openmpi_job",
  "ntasks": 10,
  "nodes": 2,
  "time": "00:30:00",
  "mail_type": "ALL",
  "mail_user": "myemail@example.com",
  "command": "mpirun -n 10 myprogram",
  "cpus_per_task": 1,
  "partition": "compute",
  "output": "/path/to/output.txt",
  "error": "/path/to/error.txt",
  "exclusive": true,  // Incorrect data type (should be boolean)
}
```

This example demonstrates an incorrect data type.  The `exclusive` parameter is expected to be a boolean (true/false), but it's presented as a string ("true"). This will result in a Slurm REST API rejection.  In my own experience, debugging such issues involves carefully comparing the submitted JSON against the Slurm REST API documentation, paying close attention to every data type.  I've found that using a JSON schema validator against the Slurm API specification can expedite this process significantly.

**Example 2: Missing Required Field**

```json
{
  "job_name": "openmpi_job",
  "ntasks": 10,
  "nodes": 2,
  "time": "00:30:00",
  "command": "mpirun -n 10 myprogram",
  "cpus_per_task": 1,
  "partition": "compute",
  "output": "/path/to/output.txt",
  "error": "/path/to/error.txt"
}
```

This example omits the `account` field, which is usually a mandatory field for job submission unless certain system configurations allow for default account usage.  The absence of this field will directly lead to submission failure.  During my work on cluster resource management, I've discovered that missing required fields, even seemingly trivial ones, are a common source of errors.  Carefully verifying the submission script against the API specification is crucial to avoid these.

**Example 3: Incorrect OpenMPI Command Line**

```json
{
  "account": "myaccount",
  "job_name": "openmpi_job",
  "ntasks": 10,
  "nodes": 2,
  "time": "00:30:00",
  "mail_type": "ALL",
  "mail_user": "myemail@example.com",
  "command": "mpirun -n 10 myprogram arg1 arg2",
  "cpus_per_task": 1,
  "partition": "compute",
  "output": "/path/to/output.txt",
  "error": "/path/to/error.txt",
  "exclusive": false
}
```

While this JSON structure is technically correct, the `command` section might have problems if `myprogram` expects a different number of arguments, or lacks appropriate error handling.  In this scenario, Slurm might accept the job, but the OpenMPI execution would fail.  The error messages would then originate from OpenMPI itself, which requires separate debugging, often involving inspecting the output and error files specified in the submission request.  Years of resolving similar issues have taught me to meticulously verify not only the Slurm submission parameters but also the correctness of the OpenMPI launch command.

3. **Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting the official Slurm documentation, focusing particularly on the Slurm REST API specification.  A thorough understanding of the JSON schema, including data types and required fields, is paramount.  Additionally, the OpenMPI documentation should be reviewed to ensure accurate specification of the `mpirun` command and environment variables within the Slurm job script.  Finally, familiarizing oneself with common HTTP error codes and their implications in the context of REST API interactions is invaluable.  Debugging tools that allow detailed inspection of HTTP requests and responses, including JSON payloads, are highly recommended. Employing a robust logging strategy in your submission scripts, recording both Slurm responses and OpenMPI execution details, will significantly streamline the debugging process.  Careful examination of the Slurm job logs and the OpenMPI output files is critical for pinpointing the root cause of the failure.
