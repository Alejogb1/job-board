The most common reason for a TensorFlow 2 custom loss function returning NaN (Not a Number) is numerical instability stemming from operations that produce undefined results, such as division by zero or the logarithm of a non-positive number.  My experience debugging numerous production models points to this as the primary culprit, far outweighing issues with gradient calculation or incorrect loss function definition.  This often manifests subtly, appearing only under specific training conditions or with particular input data.  Thorough investigation into the numerical behavior of the loss function within its operational context is crucial.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A NaN value propagating through your TensorFlow graph effectively contaminates the entire computation.  Once a NaN is introduced, it's likely to persist, often obscuring the root cause.  The problem rarely lies in a single, obviously erroneous calculation. Instead, it's typically a cascade of operations, where some intermediate result becomes undefined, then participates in further calculations, eventually leading to the NaN appearing in your loss value.  This makes debugging particularly challenging.

To systematically approach this, I've found it beneficial to dissect the custom loss function's calculation into its constituent parts.   We need to analyze each operation, considering potential inputs that could lead to NaN. Common offenders include:

* **Division by zero or near-zero values:**  If your loss function involves any division operation, carefully examine the divisor.  Check for potential scenarios where it might approach zero during training.  Strategies to mitigate this include adding a small epsilon value to the denominator (e.g., `1e-7`), employing robust numerical methods like those found in libraries designed for scientific computing, or re-architecting the loss function to avoid division entirely.

* **Logarithms of non-positive values:** Similar to division, the logarithm function is undefined for non-positive numbers.  If your loss calculation utilizes logarithms, rigorously ensure that the input is always strictly positive.  This often requires careful handling of intermediate results or data transformations.  For instance, clipping values to a small positive minimum can prevent this issue.

* **Exponentiation resulting in overflow:**  Calculations involving exponentiation, especially with large exponents, can easily lead to overflow, producing infinities or NaNs.   Monitoring the magnitude of intermediate values during training is essential.  If values become excessively large, it indicates a problem that needs addressing through techniques such as scaling or normalization of inputs.

* **Incorrect use of numerical operations involving NaN or Inf:**  Existing NaNs or infinite values in your input tensors can directly propagate through calculations and contaminate the result.  Always perform input validation and consider handling such cases before performing computations within your custom loss.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate these points with examples.  Assume we are working with a binary classification problem.

**Example 1: Division by Near-Zero**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def flawed_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  epsilon = 1e-7  # Added to prevent division by zero.
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_true - y_pred) / (tf.abs(y_pred) + epsilon))

# Example usage:
y_true = tf.constant([0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0])
y_pred = tf.constant([0.000001, 0.99, 0.000000001, 0.9])
loss = flawed_loss(y_true, y_pred)
print(loss) # Without epsilon, this would likely produce NaN
```

In this example, without the `epsilon`, `tf.abs(y_pred)` would produce near-zero values, resulting in a division-by-zero error. Adding a small epsilon is a common workaround, but ideally, one would redesign the loss to avoid such vulnerability.


**Example 2: Logarithm of Non-Positive Value**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def flawed_loss2(y_true, y_pred):
  # This is problematic if y_pred is ever 0 or negative.
  return -tf.reduce_mean(y_true * tf.math.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * tf.math.log(1 - y_pred))

# Safer alternative:
def improved_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  epsilon = 1e-7
  y_pred = tf.clip_by_value(y_pred, epsilon, 1 - epsilon) # clip to avoid log(0) or log(1)
  return -tf.reduce_mean(y_true * tf.math.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * tf.math.log(1 - y_pred))

# Example usage:
y_true = tf.constant([0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0])
y_pred = tf.constant([0.0, 0.9, 0.001, 0.9])
loss = flawed_loss2(y_true, y_pred)  # This might produce NaN
improved_loss_val = improved_loss(y_true, y_pred) # This is safer
print(f"Flawed Loss: {loss}\nImproved Loss: {improved_loss_val}")
```

The `flawed_loss2` function uses the cross-entropy loss formula but without error handling. `improved_loss` addresses the potential NaN issue by clipping predictions to avoid taking the logarithm of zero or one.  Clipping, while often effective, isn't always the optimal solution and might impact performance.


**Example 3: Overflow in Exponentiation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def flawed_loss3(y_true, y_pred):
  #Potential for overflow if y_pred is very large
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.exp(tf.abs(y_true - y_pred)))

#Better approach with scaling and clamping
def improved_loss3(y_true, y_pred):
    scaled_diff = tf.clip_by_value(tf.abs(y_true - y_pred), -10, 10) #Clamp for stability
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.exp(scaled_diff))

y_true = tf.constant([0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0])
y_pred = tf.constant([1000.0, 0.9, 1000.0, 0.9])
loss = flawed_loss3(y_true, y_pred) # Likely produces inf or NaN
improved_loss_val_3 = improved_loss3(y_true,y_pred) #Much more stable

print(f"Flawed Loss: {loss}\nImproved Loss: {improved_loss_val_3}")
```

`flawed_loss3` demonstrates a situation where exponentiating a large difference could lead to overflow. `improved_loss3` uses clamping to prevent excessively large inputs to the exponential function, enhancing numerical stability.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Numerical Recipes in C++", "Introduction to Numerical Analysis",  "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow et al.  These resources provide comprehensive background on numerical methods and the challenges of numerical computation in scientific and machine learning contexts. Focusing on chapters related to numerical stability and error analysis will be particularly relevant to resolving NaN issues in custom TensorFlow loss functions.  Careful study of TensorFlow's documentation on numerical stability and the specifics of its numerical computation methods is also strongly recommended.  Understanding TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities and how they interact with potentially unstable numerical operations is critical.
