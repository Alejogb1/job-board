1x1 convolutions, despite their seemingly trivial kernel size, play a crucial role in network architectures, primarily by enabling efficient dimensionality reduction and cross-channel information mixing without altering the spatial dimensions of the input feature maps.  This characteristic is pivotal in understanding their effect on feature preservation.  My experience optimizing convolutional neural networks for medical image segmentation highlighted this aspect repeatedly; inefficient feature manipulation directly impacted model performance and convergence speed.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A standard convolution operation involves sliding a kernel (a small matrix of weights) across an input feature map, performing element-wise multiplication, and summing the results to produce a single output value at each location.  The kernel size defines the spatial extent of the receptive field.  A 1x1 convolution, therefore, has a receptive field limited to a single pixel.  This might initially seem inconsequential, but the significance lies in its application across the entire depth (number of channels) of the input feature map.

Consider an input feature map with dimensions `H x W x C`, where `H` and `W` represent height and width, and `C` represents the number of channels.  A 1x1 convolution with `K` filters produces an output feature map of dimensions `H x W x K`.  Crucially, the spatial dimensions remain unchanged.  Each output channel is a weighted sum of the input channels at the same spatial location.  This weighted summation allows for complex interactions between channels, effectively performing a linear transformation on each spatial location independently.

The critical aspect regarding feature preservation relates to the *type* of transformation applied.  While the spatial information (position of features) remains exactly preserved, the feature itself is transformed.  This transformation isn't a simple copy; instead, it's a linear combination of input channels, which can emphasize or suppress certain aspects of the features.  For example, if a particular combination of input channels corresponds to a specific feature, the 1x1 convolution can learn weights to amplify that combination, effectively enhancing the feature. Conversely, it can also learn to suppress irrelevant channel combinations, thereby reducing noise or irrelevant information.  The preservation is therefore not of the raw feature data, but rather of its *spatial location* and a potentially refined or enhanced *representation* of the feature.  This refined representation is what contributes to the efficacy of 1x1 convolutions in deep learning architectures. The inherent linear transformation allows for efficient learning through backpropagation, enabling faster training and better generalizability compared to techniques that directly alter spatial dimensionality.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate 1x1 convolutions using TensorFlow/Keras.  These examples assume familiarity with tensor operations and convolutional neural networks.

**Example 1: Simple Dimensionality Reduction**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor:  Height x Width x Channels
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 64)) # Example: 64 channels

# 1x1 convolution for dimensionality reduction to 32 channels
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (1, 1), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 64))
])

output_tensor = model(input_tensor)

print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: (1, 28, 28, 32)  Spatial dimensions preserved.
```

This example showcases a common application: reducing the number of channels to mitigate computational costs while still preserving spatial information. The ReLU activation introduces non-linearity into the transformation.


**Example 2:  Cross-Channel Information Mixing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3)) # RGB image

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (1, 1), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(3, (1, 1), activation='sigmoid') # Back to 3 channels for example
])

output_tensor = model(input_tensor)

print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: (1, 28, 28, 3)
```

Here, the 1x1 convolution with 64 filters mixes information across the three input channels (RGB).  The second 1x1 convolution projects the output back to three channels, demonstrating the capacity for complex feature transformations.  The sigmoid activation ensures output values between 0 and 1, suitable for tasks like image generation or normalization.


**Example 3:  Incorporating within a Larger Network**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), #Example input
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (1, 1), activation='relu'), #Dimensionality Reduction
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.summary()
```

This demonstrates a more realistic scenario.  The 1x1 convolution layer is embedded within a larger convolutional neural network.  It reduces the number of channels after the second 3x3 convolutional layer, acting as a bottleneck layer that compresses feature representations before proceeding with further processing.  This improves computational efficiency without sacrificing significant information.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I suggest reviewing standard deep learning textbooks focusing on convolutional neural networks.  In addition, research papers on Inception networks and residual networks provide valuable insights into practical applications of 1x1 convolutions.  Examining the source code of popular deep learning frameworks' implementations of convolutional layers will offer a clear understanding of the underlying mechanics. Finally, exploring the documentation of those frameworks will clarify any remaining ambiguities.
