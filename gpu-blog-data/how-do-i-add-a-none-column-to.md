Adding a column filled with `None` values to a NumPy array presents a unique challenge due to NumPy's core design as a library for numerical computation. NumPy arrays are fundamentally homogeneous; they are designed to hold elements of the same data type. Consequently, directly inserting `None` alongside numerical or string data within a standard NumPy array is not possible without either changing the array’s type to `object` (which can sacrifice performance) or restructuring the data. The best approach depends heavily on your specific needs and performance priorities. I've encountered this precise problem frequently when dealing with data pipelines originating from disparate sources, where certain data fields might be missing.

My experience, particularly in geospatial data analysis, where data might be incomplete depending on the sensor or survey, has led me to a few reliable methods for introducing ‘missing’ data represented by `None`. The choice hinges primarily on whether or not you need to preserve optimal numerical performance.

The core issue lies in the fact that a NumPy array, declared initially, establishes a data type upon its creation. This type then constrains all values within the array. If you begin with, say, a `float64` array and attempt to append `None`, NumPy will either attempt to force a type conversion (which will fail for `None`), raise an error, or silently coerce the `None` to an alternative value depending on the methods used. Attempting to directly insert a `None` type value into this array will either result in a cast to zero (or potentially a NaN for float), an error, or unintended behavior.

One straightforward method is to convert the NumPy array to a NumPy array of `object` type. This change fundamentally alters how NumPy stores data, effectively turning the array into a collection of Python object pointers. Consequently, the performance gains you expect from NumPy’s optimized numerical computations diminish significantly, so this method should be chosen judiciously when performance is not the absolute priority. This allows the insertion of ‘None’ directly, without the limitations of NumPy’s homogeneity requirement.

Here’s a basic illustration:

```python
import numpy as np

# Original numerical array
original_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                          [4, 5, 6],
                          [7, 8, 9]], dtype=int)

# Convert to object dtype
object_array = original_array.astype(object)

# Create a column of None
none_column = np.array([None] * object_array.shape[0], dtype=object).reshape(-1,1)


# Concatenate column to the object array.
final_array = np.concatenate((object_array, none_column), axis=1)

print(final_array)
print(final_array.dtype) # Output: object
```
In the above example, I begin with an integer array, which is then transformed into an object array by applying the `.astype(object)` method. A column of None values is created as a vector and reshaped to the dimensions needed for concatenation with the original object array. The final `concatenate` method then adds this column to the original array, resulting in the desired output. Notice that the resulting data type, as printed, is `object`.

A second technique, often preferred when maintaining numeric performance is essential, involves representing 'missing' or 'None' values with a placeholder value. Common placeholders include NaN (Not a Number) for floating point arrays, or a very out of range number for integer types. You should then keep track of your placeholder in metadata outside of the Numpy array itself. This approach keeps the array as a numerical array and enables you to use the full performance of NumPy, while still accounting for missing values.

Here is an example using a 'NaN' to represent None:

```python
import numpy as np
# Original numerical array (float type here to use NaN)
original_array = np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
                          [4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
                          [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]], dtype=float)

# Create a column of NaNs
nan_column = np.full((original_array.shape[0], 1), np.nan)


# Concatenate column to the array.
final_array = np.concatenate((original_array, nan_column), axis=1)

print(final_array)
print(final_array.dtype)  # Output: float64

```
In this code, an array of floats is created, and a column is filled with ‘NaN’ values using ‘np.full’. The arrays are then concatenated using NumPy’s concatenate function, resulting in a final array with a ‘NaN’ column while maintaining the float64 dtype. Using NaN or another placeholder preserves the array type and thus, is generally the best method for numerical calculations. One needs to exercise caution in keeping track of what the placeholder value actually represents.

Finally, there are scenarios where it may be more appropriate to fundamentally restructure the data into structured arrays, or pandas DataFrames. Structured arrays, allow each column to have its own data type, potentially removing the need to coerce to object, or use placeholder values. Similarly, pandas allows `None` values by default and has more built-in mechanisms for handling it. A key tradeoff here would be to analyze if the performance gains of pure numpy arrays outweighs the ability to directly use None as an actual value. I would generally recommend that for datasets where 'missingness' is not a major issue, pure numpy arrays with placeholders can work efficiently, but when data is missing more often, pandas or structured numpy might be more beneficial.

Here is an illustration of the use of structured arrays:

```python
import numpy as np

# Original numerical array
original_array = np.array([(1,2,3),(4,5,6),(7,8,9)], dtype=[('col1', 'i4'), ('col2', 'i4'), ('col3', 'i4')])

# Create an array of None, setting column names
none_array = np.array([(None,), (None,), (None,)], dtype=[('col4', 'O')])

# Merge to one structured array using numpy.lib.recfunctions.join_by
final_array = np.lib.recfunctions.join_by('col1', original_array, none_array, jointype='leftouter')


print(final_array)
print(final_array.dtype)
```

In this final example, the original numerical array is declared as a structured array, assigning column names and types. A second structured array with a single column is made to hold the None values, also with column names and an object type, 'O', to accept None. Finally, the two structured arrays are joined using `numpy.lib.recfunctions.join_by`, which allows joins on specific columns. The resulting structured array has both the original and the None columns.

For further understanding of NumPy arrays, I would recommend exploring the official NumPy documentation for details regarding array creation, manipulation, and data types. For a deeper dive into handling missing data, I suggest reading literature on data cleaning and preprocessing techniques within the broader field of data science. Specifically, material on how different libraries like Pandas handle missing data, and their impact on downstream analytics. Lastly, understanding the nuances of structured arrays is critical if you begin working with mixed data types, and the NumPy documentation can guide the necessary steps. These resources offer a complete perspective on the core problem of representing null or missing data.
