Transformer models, fundamentally designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, typically expect input in the form of tokenized sequences. However, the question of feeding a *decoded* input – which, by its nature, implies prior processing and potential alteration from the original representation – introduces several complexities and necessitates careful handling. My experience building translation systems for low-resource languages taught me the critical nuances of input preprocessing and how deviations from the model’s expected structure can drastically affect performance.

The direct answer hinges on the understanding that transformers operate on numerical representations derived from tokens. The decoding process, often performed by models themselves in an autoregressive manner or via external algorithms, transforms these numerical outputs back into a readable format, be it text or any other symbolic representation. Feeding this *decoded* output directly back into the transformer requires re-encoding it, essentially reversing the decoding process but preserving the modifications, and requires aligning it with the expected input structure. The key is not to bypass the transformer's inherent design; rather, to judiciously leverage its capacity to process sequences, even those that have undergone prior transformations.

The process of feeding decoded inputs usually arises in scenarios where you want to iteratively refine an output or incorporate additional information after an initial decoding pass. This could include: error correction in machine translation, where you want to feed a first-pass translation through a transformer that focuses on improving fluency; iterative text generation, where a previous generation is used as the basis for the next; and controlled text generation using external knowledge or constraints, where an initial output is adjusted based on specific criteria before feeding the adjusted sequence back through.

There are a few methods one might employ. The simplest is re-tokenization: after decoding, the output is re-tokenized using the same tokenizer employed for the original training data. This produces a new sequence of numerical tokens that can be directly fed into the transformer’s encoder. However, nuances arise: this approach discards any potential positional information generated or implicit in the decoding process, which could limit any further modeling that can be performed on it. You're effectively treating the decoded input as a fresh sequence, rather than one derived from a prior operation.

A second, more involved approach incorporates the decoded output within the *encoder* input, potentially alongside the original input. For example, in error correction for a translation, both the erroneous translation (the decoded input) and the original source text could be provided to the encoder, allowing the model to learn patterns and relationships between the two. The model’s subsequent generations can be made conditional on both. This methodology allows the model to explicitly attend to the original source, the previously generated translation, and, if used, any auxiliary information. This also necessitates some form of a special token strategy to demarcate these different segments, or even different embeddings, a consideration that I’ll delve into in the following code example.

Another more complex approach might involve a dual-encoder architecture, or even a multi-stage system where a sequence of models work on the input in a pipelined fashion. Here the output of one encoder, possibly a fine-tuned model, is used as an input to another, the transformer that forms part of the final sequence-to-sequence part of the overall solution. This enables more advanced control over the flow of information and allows for custom modeling in intermediate stages.

Let’s examine some practical examples:

**Example 1: Basic re-tokenization:**

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

# Assume 'decoded_text' is the output of a previous decoding step.
decoded_text = "This is the decoded sentence."

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small") # Using t5-small for demonstration
inputs = tokenizer(decoded_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Now 'inputs' can be passed to a transformer model's encoder.
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("t5-small")
outputs = model.encoder(**inputs) # Just using the encoder in this case, for conciseness.
# Note: this approach ignores any decoder hidden states of a previous generation.
print(outputs.last_hidden_state.shape)
```
This code demonstrates the most basic form of feeding decoded input, re-tokenization. We use a pre-trained T5 tokenizer to convert the decoded text back to a sequence of token IDs suitable for the transformer encoder. The output provides a tensor of last hidden states. While simple, this approach sacrifices the information present in the previous decoding operation itself.

**Example 2: Incorporating decoded output with special tokens:**

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
import torch

source_text = "This is the original sentence."
decoded_text = "This is the altered sentence."

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-small")

# Add special tokens. For example "<SRC>", "<DECODED>".
tokenizer.add_tokens(["<SRC>", "<DECODED>"])

# Encode both the original and decoded text with added tokens.
combined_input = "<SRC> " + source_text + " <DECODED> " + decoded_text
inputs = tokenizer(combined_input, return_tensors="pt")

# Ensure the model is aware of the new special tokens, as their IDs will be new.
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("t5-small")
model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))

outputs = model.encoder(**inputs)
print(outputs.last_hidden_state.shape)
```
Here, I’ve expanded upon the previous example. By prepending special tokens, I explicitly signal to the model which part is the original input and which is the decoded output. The model can now potentially learn relationships between the two sequences based on the special tokens. Critically, I also resized the token embeddings to accommodate the added tokens. This approach facilitates more nuanced modeling by letting the transformer process and differentiate between the source and the transformed data.

**Example 3: A simplified conceptual dual-encoder pipeline:**

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch

source_text = "This is the initial input."
decoded_text = "This is the modified input."

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased") # Using BERT for encoder demonstration.

# First Encoder for original input.
encoder1 = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
inputs1 = tokenizer(source_text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs1 = encoder1(**inputs1).last_hidden_state

# Second Encoder for modified input.
encoder2 = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
inputs2 = tokenizer(decoded_text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs2 = encoder2(**inputs2).last_hidden_state

# Potentially concatenate or combine outputs1 and outputs2 to form the input for a later module.
combined_output = torch.cat((outputs1, outputs2), dim=1)
print(combined_output.shape) #  torch.Size([1, 2 * sequence_length, 768])
```
This last example illustrates a conceptual dual-encoder architecture. Two separate encoders are used, each with a different input, the original sequence, and the transformed sequence. The outputs of each can then be concatenated or combined in a more sophisticated manner, before being passed to other parts of the overall model. This dual-encoder or multi-stage approach enables more fine-grained control and modularity of the input data preprocessing.

The choice of method depends heavily on the specific application. I’ve often found that while re-tokenization is the simplest approach, it frequently underperforms when compared to solutions which keep the relationships of pre and post processing explicit through techniques such as token tagging. However, it still can be a useful initial step or baseline from which to develop more sophisticated techniques.

For further reading, I recommend research exploring the following areas: advanced prompt engineering, especially methods which explore the importance of special tokens; the use of sequence-to-sequence models in iterative refinement; and exploration of dual-encoder architectures. Textbooks that focus on the practical implementation of transformers in a specific domain, like natural language processing or machine translation, will likely contain more specific examples depending on your area. Additionally, consider resources that go into the implementation details of training, and not just the theory, as the correct handling of the input is often the key to achieving acceptable results.
