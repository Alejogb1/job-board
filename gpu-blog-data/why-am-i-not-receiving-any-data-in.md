The absence of data in a profiler often stems from misconfiguration of the profiling tool itself, rather than inherent issues with the application under scrutiny.  My experience debugging performance bottlenecks across diverse applications, from embedded systems to large-scale web services, has shown this to be a remarkably common source of frustration.  The profiler needs to be correctly attached to the target process, with appropriate instrumentation enabled, and the correct data collection parameters specified.  Failing to account for any of these aspects will result in an empty or incomplete profiling report.

**1. Explanation:**

Profilers operate by observing the execution of a program, gathering data on various aspects such as CPU usage, memory allocation, function call counts, and execution times.  The methodology differs depending on the type of profiler â€“ sampling profilers periodically interrupt execution to record the call stack, while instrumentation profilers modify the application's code to insert tracking points.  Regardless of the approach, the profiler needs explicit access to the target program.  This access is granted through various means, depending on the profiler's design and the operating system.

A common oversight is inadequate permission settings.  If the profiler lacks the necessary privileges to access the process' memory space or its execution flow, it will fail to collect data.  This is particularly relevant in secured environments or when dealing with processes running under different user accounts.  Another critical aspect is the correct selection of the target process.  One might unintentionally profile the wrong process, particularly when multiple instances of the application are running concurrently.  Moreover, incorrect configuration of the profiler's parameters, such as sampling frequency, data collection duration, or specific functions/modules to monitor, will limit or entirely suppress data acquisition.  Finally, incompatible profiler versions or conflicts with other system utilities can silently obstruct the profiling process.

**2. Code Examples:**

Let's illustrate this with examples focusing on Python, using `cProfile`, and a hypothetical scenario involving a C++ application profiled with a custom-built instrumentation profiler.  These demonstrate different scenarios where proper configuration is key.

**Example 1: Python `cProfile` Misconfiguration**

```python
import cProfile
import time

def my_function():
    time.sleep(1) # Simulate some work

# Incorrect usage: profiling not activated
my_function()

# Correct usage: cProfile properly invoked
cProfile.run('my_function()')
```

In the first instance, `my_function` executes without any profiling.  The second shows the correct usage where `cProfile.run` explicitly instructs the profiler to monitor the execution of `my_function`.  The output will be a detailed breakdown of the function's performance characteristics if the configuration is correct and the function takes a measurable time to execute.

**Example 2: C++ Instrumentation Profiler (Conceptual)**

This demonstrates a scenario where incorrect instrumentation placement prevents data collection:

```c++
// Hypothetical instrumentation profiler interface
class Profiler {
public:
    void startProfiling();
    void stopProfiling();
    void recordFunctionEntry(const char* functionName);
    void recordFunctionExit(const char* functionName);
};

// Correct Instrumentation
void myFunction() {
    Profiler profiler;
    profiler.startProfiling();
    profiler.recordFunctionEntry("myFunction");
    // ...function code...
    profiler.recordFunctionExit("myFunction");
    profiler.stopProfiling();
}

// Incorrect Instrumentation: No profiling started
void incorrectMyFunction() {
    Profiler profiler;
    profiler.recordFunctionEntry("incorrectMyFunction");
    // ...function code...
    profiler.recordFunctionExit("incorrectMyFunction");
}
```

The `myFunction` correctly uses the `Profiler` class to record the function entry and exit, allowing for accurate timing and profiling information.  `incorrectMyFunction` omits the vital calls to `startProfiling()` and `stopProfiling()`, rendering the instrumentation ineffective.  In a real-world scenario, incorrect placement of instrumentation markers within the source code will lead to incomplete or misleading profiling data.

**Example 3: Java with a hypothetical sampling profiler (Conceptual)**

This demonstrates the potential for issues with JVM configuration interfering with a sampling profiler.

```java
// Hypothetical Sampling Profiler setup in a system properties file:
// profiler.enabled=true
// profiler.interval=10 // milliseconds

// Java application code (unmodified)
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ... application logic ...
    }
}
```

This illustrates a setup where a sampling profiler is enabled but relies on system properties, which might be misconfigured or missing, therefore, resulting in no profile being generated.  Without the correct JVM settings, the profiler might not attach itself correctly, hindering data acquisition.  The application code itself would be completely unchanged.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the profiler's documentation for detailed configuration instructions, including environment variable settings, required permissions, and the correct specification of the target process.  Review the profiler's output logs for error messages.  Consider using a debugger alongside the profiler to identify potential issues during the profiling process. For advanced analysis, familiarize yourself with system-level performance monitoring tools provided by your operating system.  These tools can provide crucial insights into resource usage and help pinpoint bottlenecks outside the direct purview of application-level profiling.
