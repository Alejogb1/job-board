The crucial point regarding 1D convolutional layers operating on 2D feature maps lies in the implicit assumption of spatial separability.  While a 1D convolution inherently operates along a single axis, its application to a 2D map is achieved by applying the same 1D kernel multiple times, effectively treating each row (or column) independently. This process is fundamentally different from a 2D convolution, which considers the spatial relationships across both axes simultaneously.  In my experience optimizing real-time image processing pipelines for autonomous vehicle navigation, understanding this distinction proved critical in balancing computational cost with performance requirements.

**1. Explanation:**

A 2D feature map can be conceptually viewed as a collection of 1D signals, each representing a row or a column.  A 1D convolutional layer operates on these 1D signals individually.  If the 1D convolution is applied to the rows, it processes each row independently, producing a new row in the output feature map.  The same kernel is used for every row.  Similarly, if applied to the columns, the operation proceeds column-wise.  Crucially, no information is exchanged between rows (or columns) during a single 1D convolution.  This lack of cross-axis interaction is both a strength (simplicity and computational efficiency) and a weakness (limited spatial context capture) of this approach compared to true 2D convolutions.

The choice between row-wise and column-wise application is usually dictated by the specific application and the desired feature extraction.  For example, in text processing, where the 2D map represents a sequence of words embedded into vectors, a 1D convolution along the sequence axis captures temporal relationships.  In image processing, row-wise application might focus on horizontal features, while column-wise application emphasizes vertical features.  A common strategy is to use two separate 1D convolutional layers sequentially – one for rows and one for columns – to capture both horizontal and vertical characteristics, effectively simulating some aspects of a 2D convolution.

This separable convolution approach significantly reduces computational complexity compared to a full 2D convolution.  A 2D convolution with a kernel of size `k x k` requires `k x k x C_in x C_out` multiplications per output element, where `C_in` and `C_out` are the input and output channel depths. In contrast, two sequential 1D convolutions (one of size `k` along rows and another of size `k` along columns) require `2 * k * C_in * C_out` multiplications per output element. This difference is substantial for larger kernel sizes and significantly impacts performance when dealing with high-resolution images or large sequences.

**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate 1D convolutions applied to 2D feature maps using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.  These examples assume a grayscale image for simplicity, but the concept extends readily to multi-channel inputs.

**Example 1: Row-wise 1D Convolution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input feature map (grayscale image, 32x32)
input_map = tf.random.normal((1, 32, 32, 1))

# 1D convolution kernel (size 3)
kernel = tf.random.normal((3, 1, 1))

# Reshape input for 1D convolution (batch_size, height, width, channels) -> (batch_size * height, width, channels)
reshaped_input = tf.reshape(input_map, (-1, 32, 1))

# Perform 1D convolution
output = tf.nn.conv1d(reshaped_input, kernel, stride=1, padding='SAME')

# Reshape back to 2D (batch_size * height, width, channels) -> (batch_size, height, width, channels)
output = tf.reshape(output, (1, 32, 32, 1))

print(output.shape) # Output shape: (1, 32, 32, 1)
```
This code first reshapes the 2D feature map into a series of independent rows, then applies the 1D convolution along each row. The `'SAME'` padding ensures the output has the same dimensions as the input.  The reshaping is crucial for utilizing the TensorFlow `conv1d` function.

**Example 2: Column-wise 1D Convolution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Input feature map (grayscale image, 32x32)
input_map = tf.random.normal((1, 32, 32, 1))

# 1D convolution kernel (size 3)
kernel = tf.random.normal((3, 1, 1))

# Transpose the input to process columns
transposed_input = tf.transpose(input_map, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])

# Reshape input for 1D convolution
reshaped_input = tf.reshape(transposed_input, (-1, 32, 1))

# Perform 1D convolution
output = tf.nn.conv1d(reshaped_input, kernel, stride=1, padding='SAME')

# Reshape back to 2D
output = tf.reshape(output, (1, 32, 32, 1))

# Transpose back to original orientation
output = tf.transpose(output, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])

print(output.shape) # Output shape: (1, 32, 32, 1)
```
This example mirrors the row-wise convolution but transposes the input to treat columns as rows, applying the 1D convolution and then transposing back to the original orientation.

**Example 3: Separable 1D Convolution (Row then Column)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Input map and kernel definition as in previous examples) ...

# Row-wise convolution
row_output = tf.nn.conv1d(tf.reshape(input_map, (-1, 32, 1)), kernel, stride=1, padding='SAME')
row_output = tf.reshape(row_output, (1, 32, 32, 1))

# Column-wise convolution
transposed_row_output = tf.transpose(row_output, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])
col_output = tf.nn.conv1d(tf.reshape(transposed_row_output, (-1, 32, 1)), kernel, stride=1, padding='SAME')
col_output = tf.reshape(col_output, (1, 32, 32, 1))
final_output = tf.transpose(col_output, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])

print(final_output.shape) # Output shape: (1, 32, 32, 1)
```
This code demonstrates a separable convolution, cascading row-wise and column-wise 1D convolutions for a more comprehensive feature extraction.  Note that this does not exactly replicate a 2D convolution but provides a computationally efficient approximation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a more profound understanding, I would suggest consulting standard textbooks on digital image processing and deep learning.  Focusing on chapters detailing convolutional neural networks and their variations will provide comprehensive background.  Furthermore, studying research papers on efficient convolutional architectures will illuminate the advantages and limitations of separable convolutions in various contexts.  Finally, exploring the documentation of deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch is invaluable for practical implementation and experimentation.
