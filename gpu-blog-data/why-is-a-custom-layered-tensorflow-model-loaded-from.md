The unexpected behavior of a pickled TensorFlow model yielding a list rather than a model object upon loading often stems from the serialization process interacting poorly with custom layers, particularly when not properly subclassed from `tf.keras.Model` or when custom layer logic isn’t explicitly captured during pickling. In my experience building deep learning models for image segmentation, I've encountered this exact issue multiple times and traced it to this fundamental cause.

The core of the problem lies in how Python's `pickle` module handles custom objects versus standard TensorFlow constructs. `tf.keras.Model` instances, when structured traditionally (sequential or functional API models), implicitly serialize their architectural graph and layer weights in a way that `pickle` can reconstruct into a model. However, when you introduce custom layers that are derived solely from `tf.keras.layers.Layer`, the pickle process doesn't automatically know how to reconstruct the complex relationships, computation graphs, and training-specific variables these layers might contain. It defaults to storing the layers in a list.

Let's break this down into a more concrete explanation: TensorFlow models are essentially computational graphs built from tensors and layer operations. When you save a model using `model.save()` (which relies on SavedModel internally), it meticulously captures this graph, including the custom layer's structure, variables, and any potential training configurations that exist within those custom layers. `pickle`, on the other hand, does not possess intrinsic knowledge of TensorFlow’s computational graphs. It relies on Python’s standard object serialization methods. When a complex TensorFlow model including custom layers built solely from `tf.keras.layers.Layer` is pickled, `pickle` may treat these custom layers as plain Python objects, effectively discarding vital information that makes it a functional TensorFlow component. When loaded, `pickle` might not be able to rebuild those relationships and hence restores them as a generic list.

To exemplify, consider a custom layer, not derived from `tf.keras.Model`, as this directly reveals the core problem.

**Code Example 1: Problematic Custom Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pickle

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
    super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    self.units = units

  def build(self, input_shape):
    self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                            initializer='random_normal',
                            trainable=True)
    self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                            initializer='zeros',
                            trainable=True)

  def call(self, inputs):
    return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b

# Constructing a model with the faulty method:
inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = MyCustomLayer(units=5)(inputs)
outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(x)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

# Save model using pickle (demonstrates the problem)
with open('my_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)

# Load model
with open('my_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    loaded_model = pickle.load(f)

print(type(loaded_model)) # This will print "<class 'list'>", demonstrating the issue
```

The code defines `MyCustomLayer`, a custom layer based directly on `tf.keras.layers.Layer`. Although this defines the weights properly and functions within a model structure, pickling this model results in the loaded object being a list. The reason is that `pickle` doesn't know how to fully serialize the custom layer as a TensorFlow component, it cannot restore it with the proper computational structure; therefore when the graph-level pickle.load happens, it returns a list of the stored objects.

To correct this, the best approach is to make your custom structure and computation reside within a subclass of `tf.keras.Model`, as it knows how to handle those objects by design.

**Code Example 2: Correct Custom Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import pickle

class MyCustomModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
    super(MyCustomModel, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    self.units = units
    self.custom_layer = MyCustomLayer(units)
    self.dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)

  def call(self, inputs):
      x = self.custom_layer(inputs)
      return self.dense_layer(x)

# Constructing the model the right way
model = MyCustomModel(units=5)
# Build the model
model(tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10)))

# Save model using pickle
with open('my_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)

# Load model
with open('my_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    loaded_model = pickle.load(f)

print(type(loaded_model)) # This will print "<class '__main__.MyCustomModel'>", the desired result
```

Here, `MyCustomModel` inherits from `tf.keras.Model`. The model's architecture, and now the custom layer, are implicitly contained and properly processed by the Model class’ methods, including save/serialization ones. Using the Keras `save` method is also a valid alternative as it encapsulates the necessary information to reconstruct it on load:

**Code Example 3: Custom Layer Correct Use with tf.keras.Model.save()**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
    super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    self.units = units

  def build(self, input_shape):
    self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                            initializer='random_normal',
                            trainable=True)
    self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                            initializer='zeros',
                            trainable=True)

  def call(self, inputs):
    return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b


class MyCustomModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
    super(MyCustomModel, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    self.units = units
    self.custom_layer = MyCustomLayer(units)
    self.dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)

  def call(self, inputs):
      x = self.custom_layer(inputs)
      return self.dense_layer(x)

# Constructing the model the right way
model = MyCustomModel(units=5)
# Build the model
model(tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10)))

# Save the model using tf.keras.Model.save()
model.save("my_model_save")

# Load the model
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("my_model_save")

print(type(loaded_model))  # Output: <class '__main__.MyCustomModel'>
```
Here, the custom layer was encapsulated inside a custom model class that inherits from `tf.keras.Model`. The `save` and `load_model` function provided by Keras encapsulate the correct way of saving and loading models, no matter how complex it is, since it directly uses its own internal functions.

In summary, the transformation of a TensorFlow model into a list when pickled occurs because `pickle` fails to capture the structural dependencies inherent in a TensorFlow model, particularly when custom layers are not integrated into the model using the `tf.keras.Model` class directly or saved via the keras `save` method. The solution is to either encapsulate the functionality inside a Model class that inherits from `tf.keras.Model`, or using `tf.keras.Model.save()` method directly.

For further study, I recommend researching the following areas. First, deeply understand TensorFlow's SavedModel format. Second, study the intricacies of Python’s `pickle` module and its limitations with custom objects. Third, read through the TensorFlow Keras API documentation, specifically around `tf.keras.Model`, custom layers, and the various save/load functionalities. Understanding these components will provide a solid foundation for tackling complex serialization problems and creating robust, reusable custom models and layers. Finally, carefully examine how serialization within a class via `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` might help.
