Gradient artifacts, particularly vanishing and exploding gradients, significantly impact the efficacy of average pooling layers within deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  My experience optimizing CNN architectures for high-resolution medical image analysis has highlighted this repeatedly.  The issue stems from the inherent nature of average pooling, where gradients are uniformly distributed across the pooled region, potentially leading to a suppression of relevant features and hindering the learning process.

**1.  Explanation of the Impact**

Average pooling, unlike max pooling, computes the average activation within a defined receptive field. During backpropagation, the gradient is equally distributed across all activations contributing to the average. In shallower layers, where feature maps exhibit high spatial correlation, this uniform distribution might not pose a considerable problem. However, as we delve deeper into the network, feature maps become increasingly abstract and less spatially coherent.  Crucially, this impacts how gradients flow.

Consider a scenario where a critical feature occupies only a small portion of a pooling region.  During forward propagation, this feature contributes to the average, yet its influence is diluted by the averages of other, potentially irrelevant, activations.  During backpropagation, the gradient allocated to this crucial feature is divided equally among all activations within the pooling region.  Consequently, the gradient update for this crucial feature might be vanishingly small, effectively preventing the network from learning its importance.  This is exacerbated when multiple pooling layers are stacked, leading to a compounding effect.  The gradient signal becomes increasingly diffused and weak, culminating in vanishing gradients.

Conversely, if the activations within the pooling region exhibit extremely high values, the average will also be high.  During backpropagation, this translates to a large gradient that is distributed across the pooling region.  This can result in exploding gradients, destabilizing the training process and leading to numerical instability.  My work with high-dynamic-range medical imaging data has demonstrated this sensitivity acutely. The variance in pixel intensity required normalization techniques and careful layer design to mitigate the exploding gradient problem.

The issue is further amplified by the use of activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit). ReLU introduces non-linearity but also potentially results in zero gradients for negative activations.  If a substantial portion of activations within a pooling region are zero due to ReLU, the effective gradient contribution is reduced, again leading to vanishing gradients for the remaining activations.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate how gradient artifacts manifest in practice, using a simplified CNN architecture for illustrative purposes.  These examples utilize PyTorch for brevity and clarity.

**Example 1: Demonstrating Gradient Flow with Average Pooling**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Simple CNN with average pooling
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(1, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.AvgPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
    nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.AvgPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2),
    nn.Flatten(),
    nn.Linear(32 * 7 * 7, 10) # Assuming 28x28 input
)

# Example input
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 1, 28, 28)

# Optimizer and loss function
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Forward and backward pass
output = model(input_tensor)
loss = criterion(output, torch.tensor([0])) # Example label
loss.backward()

# Inspect gradients (example for first convolutional layer)
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if 'conv1.weight' in name:
        print(f"Gradients for {name}: {param.grad.mean()}")
```

This code snippet showcases a simple CNN and demonstrates the calculation of gradients after a forward and backward pass.  The `param.grad.mean()` line specifically highlights how gradients are distributed across the weight parameters of the first convolutional layer.  Observing these gradients over epochs will reveal how they may converge, diverge or stagnate due to the effect of average pooling.

**Example 2: Comparing Average and Max Pooling**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
# ... (rest of the imports and model definition as in Example 1, but replace AvgPool2d with MaxPool2d in one model instance) ...

model_avg = nn.Sequential(...) #model with average pooling
model_max = nn.Sequential(...) #model with max pooling

# ... (training loop, but comparing loss between both models) ...

print("Average pooling Loss:", loss_avg)
print("Max pooling Loss:", loss_max)
```

This example directly contrasts average pooling with max pooling.  By training both models and comparing their loss functions, one can empirically observe how the choice of pooling layer impacts the overall performance and potentially highlights the instability or slower convergence associated with average pooling.  Consistent inferior performance of the average pooling model indicates gradient issues.

**Example 3:  Illustrating the Impact of ReLU**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
# ... (imports as before) ...

# Model with ReLU
model_relu = nn.Sequential(...) # with ReLU

# Model without ReLU (e.g., using Sigmoid or Tanh)
model_no_relu = nn.Sequential(...) # without ReLU

# ... (training loop comparing both model performance) ...

print("ReLU Model Loss:", loss_relu)
print("No ReLU Model Loss:", loss_no_relu)
```

This comparison shows the effect of ReLU on gradient flow in conjunction with average pooling.  By removing ReLU, we alter the non-linearity and potentially mitigate some issues with zero gradients contributing to vanishing gradient problems.  This example would directly demonstrate the interaction between ReLU and average pooling in affecting gradient flow.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of gradient-based optimization and the intricacies of backpropagation, consult standard deep learning textbooks.  Additionally, papers focusing on architectural innovations in CNNs, specifically addressing the challenges of vanishing and exploding gradients, would prove invaluable.  Finally, examining optimization techniques like gradient clipping and the use of alternative activation functions will provide insight into practical mitigation strategies.
