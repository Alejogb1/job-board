Node.js streams, specifically readable streams, often exhibit a delayed halt rather than an immediate stop when an asynchronous operation is initiated within their processing pipeline, due to the interplay between the stream's internal buffering mechanisms and Node.js' event loop. This delay isn't a bug, but a consequence of how streams manage data and how asynchronous callbacks are handled.

The core issue stems from the fact that when you pipe data from a readable stream to a transformation stream or directly to a writable stream and invoke an asynchronous function within the data handling process, the stream's `data` event handler relinquishes control before the asynchronous operation completes. The stream's internal read buffer may have prefetched data, anticipating subsequent processing, but the asynchronous operation breaks the synchronous flow needed to trigger subsequent reads. Node.js, by design, doesn't block the event loop waiting for asynchronous calls to finish. This creates a gap where the stream's mechanisms can’t easily determine that it needs to pause data delivery.

Let’s illustrate this behavior through some code examples and explore why a direct halt is not the norm.

**Example 1: Basic Stream with Asynchronous Delay**

Consider a scenario where a readable stream emulates file reading, and we inject an artificial asynchronous delay before processing each chunk of data:

```javascript
const { Readable } = require('stream');

class DelayedReader extends Readable {
    constructor(options = {}) {
        super(options);
        this.chunks = ["First Chunk", "Second Chunk", "Third Chunk", "Fourth Chunk"];
        this.index = 0;
    }
    _read(size) {
        if (this.index >= this.chunks.length) {
           return this.push(null); // Signal end of stream
        }
        const delay = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100); // Random delay
        setTimeout(() => {
            this.push(this.chunks[this.index++]);
        }, delay);
    }
}
const reader = new DelayedReader();

reader.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log('Received:', chunk.toString());
    setTimeout(()=> {
        console.log("Async Processed:", chunk.toString());
    }, 100);
});

reader.on('end', () => console.log("Stream Ended."));
```

In this example, the `DelayedReader` simulates reading data chunks, and each chunk is delivered asynchronously via `setTimeout` within the `_read` method. The `data` event handler then logs the received chunk and then initiates another asynchronous call via `setTimeout`. The stream does not immediately stop pushing data from the `_read` method, since each `push` call isn’t blocked.  The stream is still considered readable and will try to fill its internal buffer based on the size constraint it was given. This demonstrates that even with an asynchronous call inside `data` event handler, stream keeps pushing data from `_read`. This is because, the `_read` method is not blocked by the `setTimeout` used inside the `data` handler.

**Example 2: Backpressure Implementation**

Now, let's introduce a backpressure mechanism to see how to pause the readable stream:

```javascript
const { Readable } = require('stream');

class DelayedReaderWithBackPressure extends Readable {
    constructor(options = {}) {
        super(options);
        this.chunks = ["First Chunk", "Second Chunk", "Third Chunk", "Fourth Chunk"];
        this.index = 0;
        this.isPaused = false;
    }
    _read(size) {
         if (this.isPaused) {
          return;
       }
      if (this.index >= this.chunks.length) {
          return this.push(null);
      }
      const delay = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100); // Random delay
        setTimeout(() => {
           this.push(this.chunks[this.index++]);
        }, delay);
    }
}
const readerWithBackpressure = new DelayedReaderWithBackPressure();

readerWithBackpressure.on('data', (chunk) => {
    console.log('Received:', chunk.toString());
    readerWithBackpressure.isPaused = true; //Pause reading from stream

    setTimeout(()=> {
        console.log("Async Processed:", chunk.toString());
        readerWithBackpressure.isPaused = false;
        readerWithBackpressure.read(); // Resume reading once async completed
    }, 100);

});

readerWithBackpressure.on('end', () => console.log("Stream Ended."));
```

Here, we explicitly control the flow.  The `_read` method check `isPaused` flag before it attempts to push data.  When the `data` event handler starts to process data, we set `isPaused` to true and set it back to `false` in the timeout along with calling the `read` method to ensure stream starts emitting data again.  This is one of the ways to apply backpressure. If `read()` is not called at the end of async operation, readable stream will be paused. This is how we can control the flow of data processing when using asynchronous operations. This backpressure strategy allows the stream to respect the asynchronous operations.

**Example 3: Using Transformation Streams**

Often, we use transformation streams to modify data, let's use that to demonstrate how async operations inside transformation stream affect the flow:

```javascript
const { Readable, Transform } = require('stream');

class DelayedReaderTransform extends Readable {
    constructor(options = {}) {
        super(options);
        this.chunks = ["First Chunk", "Second Chunk", "Third Chunk", "Fourth Chunk"];
        this.index = 0;
    }
    _read(size) {
      if (this.index >= this.chunks.length) {
           return this.push(null);
        }
        const delay = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100); // Random delay
         setTimeout(() => {
            this.push(this.chunks[this.index++]);
        }, delay);
    }
}

class AsyncTransformer extends Transform {
   constructor(options={}) {
    super(options);
  }
  _transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    setTimeout(()=>{
        const modifiedChunk = chunk.toString().toUpperCase();
        callback(null, modifiedChunk);
    }, 100);
  }
}

const reader = new DelayedReaderTransform();
const transformer = new AsyncTransformer();

reader.pipe(transformer)
    .on('data', (chunk) => {
        console.log('Transformed Received:', chunk.toString());
    })
    .on('end', () => console.log("Stream Ended."));

```

In this example, we have a `DelayedReaderTransform` that simulates data source and `AsyncTransformer` that operates on the data using asynchronous operation. The key difference here is the `_transform` method takes a callback that should be invoked once the transformation is complete. By calling `callback` at the end of asynchronous operation, we are indicating that a unit of data is transformed and the stream is ready to accept more input. Even if the underlying readable stream is ready with more data, the transformation stream will respect the callback, thus effectively applying backpressure and avoiding stream from halting without processing data. If `callback` is never called, the stream will be stalled indefinitely waiting for data.

These examples highlight that the delayed halt in stream processing with asynchronous operations arises from the default behavior of streams which prefer to buffer data and try to process as much data as possible, unless explicitly told to pause. Streams don't inherently block on asynchronous actions; it's the developer's responsibility to handle backpressure correctly to ensure proper flow control.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Node.js streams and asynchronous programming, I recommend consulting the official Node.js documentation. The API documentation for the `stream` module provides a comprehensive overview of the available classes and methods, including detailed explanations for managing flow control and implementing backpressure. Additionally, the Node.js guide on asynchronous control flow can significantly improve comprehension on how event loop and asynchronous callbacks interact with stream operations. Finally, reviewing examples from various open-source projects using streams will offer real-world context and solutions for managing complex asynchronous data pipelines effectively.
