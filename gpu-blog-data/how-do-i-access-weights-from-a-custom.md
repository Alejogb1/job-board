Accessing the weights of a custom layer from within another TensorFlow layer requires careful consideration of scope and the framework's underlying variable management. TensorFlow’s layer architecture relies on internal tracking of trainable and non-trainable variables. Directly accessing weights outside of the layer’s intended method can lead to unintended side effects or misalignments during training. The appropriate strategy involves leveraging the `self.add_weight()` method within the custom layer’s `build()` method and then retrieving these weights via the layer's `variables` or `trainable_variables` property when needed in another layer's logic.

The primary challenge stems from the fact that TensorFlow handles variable creation and retrieval through a well-defined lifecycle. Attempting to access a custom layer’s weight tensors directly by referring to them outside of the layer's scope will typically result in errors, as the internal mechanisms for managing and updating weights during backpropagation are bypassed. Instead, the built-in mechanisms for tracking and querying the layer's variables must be used.

Let's illustrate with a custom layer which we'll call `MyCustomDense`. This layer performs a linear transformation with a bias term, much like the standard `tf.keras.layers.Dense`, but for this example, we'll explicitly define it for demonstration purposes.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomDense(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomDense, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.w = None # Placeholder for weight
        self.b = None # Placeholder for bias


    def build(self, input_shape):
        # Creating weight variable
        self.w = self.add_weight(
            shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
            initializer="random_normal",
            trainable=True,
            name="kernel"
        )
         # Creating bias variable
        self.b = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units,),
            initializer="zeros",
            trainable=True,
            name="bias"
        )

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b


```

In the `MyCustomDense` layer, the weights (`self.w`) and bias (`self.b`) are created using `self.add_weight()`. This method registers these tensors as trainable variables associated with the layer, ensuring they will be included during backpropagation and updates from an optimizer. The `build()` method ensures that these variables are only created once the input shape of the layer is known.

Now, consider another layer, say, `WeightAnalyzerLayer`, designed to access and analyze the weights of our custom dense layer.

```python
class WeightAnalyzerLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, dense_layer, **kwargs):
      super(WeightAnalyzerLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
      self.dense_layer = dense_layer

    def call(self, inputs):
      # Accessing variables using layer properties
      weights = self.dense_layer.trainable_variables
      if weights:
        # Perform some analysis or manipulation with weights.
        # For this example we'll just return a norm value for the weights
        weight_norms = tf.norm(weights[0])
        return  weight_norms
      else:
        return tf.constant(0.0) # Default value if there are no weights
```

The crucial aspect here is `self.dense_layer.trainable_variables`. This property returns a list of all the trainable variables belonging to the `dense_layer`. Note that we access the `weights` with index `[0]` as `trainable_variables` returns a list, and we know based on the custom layer implementation the first entry of the list corresponds to `w` and second to `b`. It's recommended to use names for proper variable identification if there are more than one. This approach avoids direct attribute access, adhering to the proper way of interacting with layer weights and variables. Attempting to access the `w` attribute of `self.dense_layer` directly, as in `self.dense_layer.w`, could lead to errors if `build()` method hasn’t been called before or in cases where Tensorflow decides to change this underlying variable and thus break access using this direct method. This also ensures the variables are retrieved from the correct computation context during training or inference.

Let's construct a simple model using these layers to further show the functionality of the retrieval of weights using layer properties:

```python

# Example usage of the custom layers.
inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
dense = MyCustomDense(units=5)(inputs)
analyzer = WeightAnalyzerLayer(dense_layer=dense)(inputs)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=analyzer)

# Generate dummy data
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 10))
# Get output. The weights are only accessed within the layer's scope, not outside of it
weight_norm_output = model(dummy_input)

print(f"Weight norm calculated and returned by the WeightAnalyzerLayer: {weight_norm_output}")


```

In this example, we see how the custom layers interact within a model context. The `WeightAnalyzerLayer` does not need to know the specific structure of the custom dense layer, beyond the fact that it should implement `trainable_variables`. This promotes abstraction and modularity in complex neural networks. The `WeightAnalyzerLayer` computes the norm of the `MyCustomDense` layer's weights. The main point is that we avoid accessing `self.dense_layer.w` directly. Instead, we use the documented way of querying the variables of a layer, which can be accessed using the layer properties.

While `trainable_variables` returns the tensors that are modified during backpropagation, we could also retrieve all variables using the `variables` property. This will include trainable variables as well as non trainable variables that might be included in the layers. The choice of which property to use depends on the application. If the use case only requires information about the parameters updated during the gradient descent, it is advisable to use `trainable_variables` to avoid the unnecessary overhead of accessing the non-trainable variables.

In summary, accessing weights within a TensorFlow layer from a different layer requires leveraging the layer's properties `trainable_variables` or `variables`. These properties provide a reliable, consistent method to obtain the weights tracked by the layer, while ensuring proper compatibility with TensorFlow's internal management system. Direct access to a layer’s underlying tensors is prone to instability and should be avoided in favor of this recommended practice.

For further study, consult the official TensorFlow documentation on custom layers, specifically regarding variable creation within the `build()` method and the layer properties `trainable_variables` and `variables`. Explore examples in the official TensorFlow GitHub repositories demonstrating usage of complex custom layers and model implementations, with attention given to the proper access and management of layer variables. Detailed tutorials and guides concerning variable scoping within TensorFlow will also provide a better understanding of these mechanisms. Lastly, delving into the design principles behind TensorFlow's Layer API can offer valuable insights.
