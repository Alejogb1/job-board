Inconsistencies in training and prediction accuracy when stacking Recurrent Neural Networks with Recurrent State Transfer Mechanisms (RNN-RSTMs) in TensorFlow often stem from the vanishing or exploding gradient problem exacerbated by the multiplicative nature of backpropagation through time (BPTT) across multiple layers.  My experience working on long-term dependency modeling in financial time series highlighted this issue repeatedly.  The compounded effect of gradient instability across layers frequently leads to suboptimal learning and unpredictable outputs.

**1.  Explanation of the Underlying Problem:**

The core challenge lies in the way gradients are propagated during training.  Standard RNNs, and by extension, RNN-RSTMs, employ BPTT to compute gradients for weight updates.  This involves unfolding the network over the entire sequence length and calculating the gradient contribution from each timestep. With each successive layer, the gradient is multiplied by the weight matrices of the preceding layers.  If these weights have eigenvalues greater than 1 (exploding gradient), the gradient becomes exponentially large, leading to instability and potentially NaN values. Conversely, if the eigenvalues are less than 1 (vanishing gradient), the gradient shrinks exponentially, preventing deeper layers from learning effectively.  This problem is amplified when stacking multiple RNN-RSTMs, as the gradient must traverse multiple layers of these potentially unstable computations.

The use of RSTMs, while designed to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem to some extent through the sophisticated gating mechanisms, doesn't entirely eliminate it when multiple layers are involved.  The interaction of the gates across layers adds further complexity to the gradient flow, making it even more susceptible to the cumulative effect of unstable weight matrices.  Therefore, simply increasing the number of layers doesn't guarantee improved performance; it can, in fact, severely hinder it.

Furthermore, the choice of activation functions within each RNN-RSTM layer plays a critical role.  Functions like sigmoid and tanh, frequently used in recurrent networks, suffer from the saturation problem, resulting in gradients approaching zero during backpropagation.  This can drastically worsen the vanishing gradient problem, especially in deeper architectures.  Careful consideration of these factors is paramount in designing and training effective multi-layer RNN-RSTM models.  In my past projects involving sentiment analysis of long text sequences, the choice of activation function was often the difference between a converging and a diverging model.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the potential pitfalls and strategies for mitigating inconsistency in multi-layer RNN-RSTMs in TensorFlow.  They are simplified for clarity, but highlight critical concepts.

**Example 1: A Naive Multi-Layer RNN-RSTM:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.RNN(tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(64), return_sequences=True, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    tf.keras.layers.RNN(tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(64), return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates a simple stacking of two RNN-LSTM layers.  The `return_sequences=True` argument is crucial; it ensures that the output of each layer is a sequence, allowing the next layer to process sequential data.  However, this naive implementation is prone to gradient instability issues without further safeguards.


**Example 2: Incorporating Gradient Clipping:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.RNN(tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(64), return_sequences=True, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    tf.keras.layers.RNN(tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(64), return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(clipnorm=1.0) # Gradient clipping
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example incorporates gradient clipping. The `clipnorm` argument in the Adam optimizer limits the norm of the gradient, preventing it from becoming excessively large.  This technique helps to alleviate the exploding gradient problem, leading to more stable training.  I found that experimenting with different `clipnorm` values (e.g., 0.5, 1.0, 5.0) was often necessary to find the optimal balance between stability and learning speed for specific datasets.


**Example 3:  Utilizing Layer Normalization:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.RNN(tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(64, normalization='layer'), return_sequences=True, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    tf.keras.layers.RNN(tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(64, normalization='layer'), return_sequences=True),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example uses layer normalization within the LSTM cells. Layer normalization normalizes the activations of each layer, stabilizing the internal representation and thus mitigating the vanishing/exploding gradient problem. This approach was particularly beneficial in my time series forecasting projects where subtle shifts in the input data could greatly influence the final result.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville (for a comprehensive understanding of RNNs and the vanishing/exploding gradient problem).
*   TensorFlow documentation (for detailed explanations of various layers and optimizers).
*   Research papers on LSTM and GRU variations designed for long-term dependency learning.


In conclusion, inconsistencies in multi-layer RNN-RSTM models in TensorFlow often stem from the instability of gradient propagation during BPTT. Employing strategies like gradient clipping and layer normalization can significantly improve training stability and prediction accuracy.  Careful consideration of activation functions and architectural choices is also crucial for achieving reliable results.  The choice of the best approach is highly dependent on the specific dataset and task at hand.  Rigorous experimentation and evaluation are essential for selecting the most effective solution.
