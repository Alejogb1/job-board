The complete uninstallation of CUDA, particularly after a purging attempt, often leaves residual configurations that can cause conflicts during subsequent installations or when using other GPU-accelerated libraries.  It's critical to methodically eliminate these remnants, and relying solely on package managers isn't consistently reliable. My experience, spanning multiple deep learning projects, has shown that a manual approach following purge is often the most effective.

The challenge primarily stems from how CUDA, as a development platform, embeds itself into multiple layers of the operating system.  Beyond the primary CUDA toolkit, components such as the NVIDIA display drivers, various shared libraries, and symbolic links are distributed throughout the filesystem.  A `purge` command, while effective for removing the primary packages, typically doesn't address these scattered elements. The result is an incomplete cleanup, which can lead to mysterious errors down the line.

My approach involves a multi-step process: identifying and removing remaining packages, then manually addressing system directories and environment variables, and finally verifying that no lingering CUDA installations exist.

Firstly, I ensure all NVIDIA packages are completely removed. The `dpkg` package manager can help identify installed packages with `nvidia` in their name. This is a crucial step because sometimes, not all related packages are cleaned up during the purge operation.

```bash
sudo dpkg -l | grep nvidia
```

This command provides a list of all installed packages related to NVIDIA, including drivers and CUDA components.  From this list, I identify any packages still present, including libraries or specific driver versions. Once identified, the individual packages are removed with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge <package-name1> <package-name2> ...
```

*Code commentary:* This command uses `apt-get remove` with the `--purge` flag, attempting to remove not only the binary files but also the associated configuration files.  `<package-name1>`, `<package-name2>`, etc., should be replaced with the names of the packages identified in the previous step.  The process should be iterated until the `dpkg -l | grep nvidia` returns no packages.  Careful selection of the correct package names prevents accidental removal of unrelated software.  I have found that neglecting this step leads to partially uninstalled drivers and CUDA libraries, making a clean reinstall a challenge.

After addressing the visible packages, the next critical step focuses on removing CUDA-related files scattered in system directories. This is where manual cleaning becomes indispensable.  The most common locations include `/usr/local/cuda*`, where CUDA installs its primary toolkit, and `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/` where CUDA adds configuration files to influence runtime library loading. Within the home directory, hidden `.cuda` directories might contain configuration information.  Additionally, remnants can sometimes reside within shared library directories like `/usr/lib`, `/usr/lib64`, and similar folders in `/opt`.

The following command exemplifies the process of identifying and removing files from `/usr/local`:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/cuda*
```

*Code commentary:* This `rm -rf` command forcefully and recursively removes any directories or files matching the pattern `/usr/local/cuda*`. The asterisk allows for the removal of both `cuda` and specific versioned installations like `cuda-11.8`.  While powerful, extreme caution is advised here. Removing the wrong directory can lead to irreversible system damage; therefore, meticulous attention to the target path is essential before executing this command. If unsure, the use of `ls /usr/local/` can be a preliminary check to ensure only CUDA related folders are targeted for deletion.

The last critical step I undertake is to eliminate any environment variable modifications introduced by the CUDA installation. CUDA's setup typically involves modifying shell startup files like `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.profile` to include the CUDA toolkit path.  These environment variables, notably `CUDA_HOME` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, must be removed.

I usually open these files with a text editor and search for lines containing "cuda," "nvcc," or other related keywords. If found, they are commented out or deleted.  I have noticed, that forgetting to remove these paths creates issues when using other machine learning frameworks or when trying to use newly installed CUDA versions. This step should be taken within every user's shell startup files.

```bash
# Example: Check for CUDA_HOME
grep CUDA_HOME ~/.bashrc
grep CUDA_HOME ~/.zshrc
grep CUDA_HOME ~/.profile
```

*Code commentary:* These commands use grep to search for the `CUDA_HOME` environment variable within typical shell startup files.  If found, the command will output the lines, allowing for identification. Using `grep` first is recommended before editing the files, as one can have unexpected modifications on their startup routines. Once identified, they should be removed from their respective files using a text editor. Alternatively, this could be achieved with `sed` if automation is needed. I personally prefer a manual edit as it provides the needed oversight to prevent any unintended modifications.

Finally, after all steps are completed, a verification step is crucial. The command `nvcc --version` should return a message indicating that the command is not found or an error is returned. This confirms that the system cannot find CUDA.  If `nvcc --version` returns version information, remnants are still present in the system, and further investigation and cleaning, based on the presented steps, is needed.

For further reading and to deepen the understanding of the subject, I recommend exploring resources like the official NVIDIA CUDA Installation Guides available on NVIDIA's developer website. Operating system specific forums, such as Ubuntu's forums, and articles about system administration can offer more insight into file system organization and package management. The documentation for `apt-get`, `dpkg`, and `rm` is also invaluable. Familiarizing oneself with how these commands operate allows for deeper troubleshooting, beyond simple recipes. Additionally, delving into system environment variables and their management can prevent future conflicts. Finally, becoming versed in system administration topics, particularly regarding file organization, can prevent such issues from ever arising again.
