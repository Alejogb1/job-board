When fine-tuning large neural networks or implementing certain regularization strategies, selectively disabling weight updates is a critical technique. In Keras, while a direct "disable" switch isn't provided at the individual weight level, it can be achieved by manipulating the trainable attribute of layers, combined with custom training loops or specialized layer implementations. My experience stems from designing adversarial training algorithms for image generation models, where precise control over which parameters are updated is essential for stability and achieving desired adversarial effects.

Here's the breakdown of how to accomplish this, along with several illustrative examples.

The core principle hinges on Keras's object-oriented approach. Each layer, whether a dense connection, convolutional operation, or an activation function, possesses a `trainable` attribute. This attribute is a boolean, and when set to `False`, Keras's gradient descent optimizers skip weight updates for that specific layer during the backpropagation step. The `trainable` attribute is inherited, so if a model's overall `trainable` attribute is set to `False`, then all child layers' weights become untrainable, regardless of their individual settings. We can work around this by strategically adjusting the attribute at the layer level.

**Method 1: Disabling Training at the Layer Level**

The simplest approach is to iterate through the desired layers and set their `trainable` attributes accordingly. This approach is suitable for cases where the selection criteria are relatively simple – perhaps layers based on name, type, or position in the model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define a simple sequential model.
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', name='dense_1', kernel_initializer='random_normal'),
    layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', name='dense_2', kernel_initializer='random_normal'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='output', kernel_initializer='random_normal')
])

# Selectively disable training for the first dense layer.
model.get_layer('dense_1').trainable = False


# Print out trainable states to verify changes
for layer in model.layers:
    print(f"{layer.name}: trainable = {layer.trainable}")

#Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Example usage of the model (replace with your training data)
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)
```

*   In this example, I create a sequential model with three dense layers.
*   I then use `model.get_layer('dense_1')` to access the first dense layer based on its assigned name and set its `trainable` attribute to `False`. This prevents backpropagation from updating the layer’s weights during training.
*  I print out trainable states of each layer to show verification of disabled training on layer 'dense_1'.
*   I compile the model to prepare for training and demonstrate the weight freezing by fitting it to random data.
*   Crucially, only the weights in `dense_2` and `output` will be updated during the training.

**Method 2: Function-Based Selection and Parameter Management**

For more complex scenarios, like conditional weight freezing based on model architecture or a hyperparameter value, I have used a function-based selection. The following code showcases this.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

def freeze_layers_by_name(model, layer_names):
    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer.name in layer_names:
            layer.trainable = False
        else:
            layer.trainable = True

# Create a simple model for this example
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
x = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(input_tensor)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Flatten()(x)
x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
output_tensor = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)

#Define layers to freeze using the helper function
layers_to_freeze = [layer.name for layer in model.layers if isinstance(layer, layers.Conv2D)]

freeze_layers_by_name(model, layers_to_freeze)

# Verify that the layers have been frozen
for layer in model.layers:
    print(f"{layer.name}: trainable = {layer.trainable}")

# Compile the model for usage
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Example usage of the model
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 28, 28, 1))
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)
```

*   Here I create a more elaborate CNN model.
*   I define a function `freeze_layers_by_name` that takes a model and a list of layer names. This method offers enhanced flexibility.
*   I use a list comprehension to filter only convolutional layers and obtain their names for freezing purposes.
*   I then call the function to freeze all convolutional layers.
*   As before, I check the `trainable` attribute after applying the function.
*   The code compiles and fits with random data to show the freezing is in place.

**Method 3: Custom Layer with Trainable Flags**

In scenarios requiring finer-grained control within a layer, specifically over the trainable states of individual parameters within a layer (like freezing a bias term but not the kernel), I would suggest implementing custom layers. This method adds some complexity but allows parameter-specific adjustments.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

class CustomDense(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, trainable_kernel=True, trainable_bias=True, **kwargs):
        super(CustomDense, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.trainable_kernel = trainable_kernel
        self.trainable_bias = trainable_bias

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                     initializer='random_normal',
                                     trainable=self.trainable_kernel,
                                     name='kernel')
        self.bias = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                   initializer='zeros',
                                   trainable=self.trainable_bias,
                                   name='bias')
        super(CustomDense, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel) + self.bias

# Build the model using the custom layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    CustomDense(32, trainable_kernel=False, name="custom_dense_1"),
    layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', name='dense_2'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='output')
])

# Verify that the trainable states have been set
for layer in model.layers:
    if isinstance(layer, CustomDense):
      print(f"Layer {layer.name}: kernel trainable = {layer.kernel.trainable}, bias trainable = {layer.bias.trainable}")
    else:
      print(f"Layer {layer.name}: trainable = {layer.trainable}")

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Example usage
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((100,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=2)
```

*   In this version, I create a custom layer, `CustomDense`, derived from `keras.layers.Layer`.
*   The constructor accepts trainable flags for the kernel and bias.
*   Inside the `build` method, I create both the kernel and bias weights. The trainable flag for each weight is set based on the constructor parameter passed to the layer.
*   I instantiate the model using the `CustomDense` layer, disabling kernel training for the first dense layer in the model.
*    I print out trainable states of the custom layer and other standard layers.
*   The custom layer approach provides parameter-level control which is essential for very specialized tasks.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To gain further understanding, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation. Focus on the sections detailing the following:

1.  The Keras `Layer` class, specifically its `trainable` property. The documentation outlines how layers are constructed and how this attribute affects training.
2.  The gradient tape for deeper insights into how TensorFlow computes gradients. Understanding the mechanics of gradient calculation will help with more advanced training modifications and debugging.
3.  Custom layer creation within Keras. This provides guidance for developing bespoke layer functionalities and using the add\_weight method for custom trainable parameters.
4.  The `Model` class details, focusing on how layer connections, trainable attributes, and the `compile` method work together during model training.

These resources collectively provide a solid foundation for manipulating Keras models with selective weight updates. I have personally found a thorough understanding of these areas invaluable for my work. Through careful combination of Keras's built-in capabilities and customized extensions, precise control over trainable parameters can be achieved.
