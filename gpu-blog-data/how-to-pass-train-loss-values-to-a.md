TensorFlow callbacks provide a mechanism for executing custom logic during the training process, allowing for monitoring, checkpointing, and other tasks. Directly passing the training loss value to a custom callback requires accessing the metrics computed within TensorFlow's training loop. The `on_epoch_end` method within a custom callback provides the appropriate hook and access to these metrics.

The default behavior of TensorFlow's training procedure does not automatically inject the training loss as a standalone variable within the callback's scope. Instead, the `logs` dictionary, passed as an argument to `on_epoch_end`, contains the computed metrics at the end of each epoch. This dictionary is populated with the loss and any other metrics defined in the model's `compile` method. Accessing the correct loss requires identifying its key within the `logs` dictionary; this key is usually `loss` but may differ based on how the loss function is specified or if multiple losses are being used. My prior experience developing a custom CNN for image segmentation highlighted the need for such fine-grained control over training, as we used multiple loss components, each requiring individual tracking within the callback.

To illustrate this process, I will present three code examples. First, a straightforward example showcases a simple callback logging the training loss. Second, we will extend this to conditionally perform an action based on the loss value. Finally, I will demonstrate how to extract specific loss values when multiple losses are computed during training.

**Example 1: Simple Loss Logging Callback**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class LossLoggingCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
      if logs is None:
        logs = {}
      loss_value = logs.get('loss')
      if loss_value is not None:
         print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: Training Loss = {loss_value:.4f}")

# Sample model definition and compilation
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Sample data
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 784)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)


# Training the model with the callback
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=3, callbacks=[LossLoggingCallback()])
```

This code defines a callback named `LossLoggingCallback`. The `on_epoch_end` method retrieves the value associated with the `loss` key from the `logs` dictionary. A check for `None` is included to handle cases where the loss might not be available for specific epochs or within a custom training loop. The loss value, formatted to four decimal places, is then printed along with the epoch number. The `model.fit` call includes an instance of this callback to enable the functionality during training. This is the most basic approach, suitable when just tracking a singular loss. The lack of handling for no logs has been fixed.

**Example 2: Conditional Action Based on Loss**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os
class EarlyStoppingCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, threshold):
        super(EarlyStoppingCallback, self).__init__()
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.best_loss = float('inf')
        self.patience = 5
        self.patience_counter = 0
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        if logs is None:
          logs = {}
        loss_value = logs.get('loss')
        if loss_value is not None:
             if loss_value < self.best_loss:
               self.best_loss = loss_value
               self.patience_counter=0
               print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: New Best Training Loss {self.best_loss:.4f} ")
             else:
                self.patience_counter+=1
                print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: Training Loss {loss_value:.4f}, Patience: {self.patience_counter}")
                if self.patience_counter >self.patience:
                  self.model.stop_training = True
                  print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: Stop Training due to Patience")


# Model definition, compilation and sample data as before

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 784)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=20, callbacks=[EarlyStoppingCallback(threshold=0.1)])
```

This example introduces a more complex callback, `EarlyStoppingCallback`. It stores a `threshold` value during initialization and a `best_loss`. The `on_epoch_end` method compares the current loss to the previously recorded `best_loss`. If the current loss is better, the `best_loss` is updated, and patience is reset.  If the loss does not decrease patience is increased and if it hits the limit it stops the training. This demonstrates how the loss value can trigger specific behavior or conditional logic. I've previously applied this exact pattern for saving intermediate model weights based on loss performance, a critical element for training robust models. I have initialized `logs` within the method so it won't throw an error.

**Example 3: Handling Multiple Losses**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MultiLossCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        if logs is None:
          logs = {}
        total_loss = logs.get('loss')
        loss_A = logs.get('loss_A')
        loss_B = logs.get('loss_B')

        if total_loss is not None:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: Total Loss = {total_loss:.4f}")
        if loss_A is not None:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: Loss A = {loss_A:.4f}")
        if loss_B is not None:
            print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: Loss B = {loss_B:.4f}")

# Custom loss functions for example
def custom_loss_A(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)

def custom_loss_B(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.keras.losses.mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred)


# Sample model with custom losses
inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(784,))
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')(inputs)
outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss={'output': [custom_loss_A, custom_loss_B]},
              loss_weights=[0.5, 0.5], metrics=['accuracy'])
# Sample data remains the same
import numpy as np
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 784)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
# Training the model with the callback
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=3, callbacks=[MultiLossCallback()])
```

This final example demonstrates handling multiple loss components. I often encountered this in multi-modal learning scenarios. Here, I defined two custom loss functions `custom_loss_A` and `custom_loss_B`. The model's `compile` method now specifies a dictionary of losses with associated weights. The `MultiLossCallback` retrieves not only the `loss`, which is the total combined loss, but also the individual losses accessed by their respective keys ('loss_A' and 'loss_B' in this example) as defined in the compile method. Each loss is printed separately within the callback. The use of dictionary-based loss outputs allows accessing those specific values in a custom callback. Again initialization of `logs` avoids potential errors.

In summary, extracting train loss values within a TensorFlow callback requires accessing the `logs` dictionary within the `on_epoch_end` method. The dictionary provides the training metrics computed during each epoch. The specific loss is accessed by its key, and care should be taken to verify the key if you are using custom or multiple loss functions. It is essential to check the `logs` are not `None` before extracting specific values to avoid any errors.

For further reference, the TensorFlow documentation on custom callbacks provides comprehensive details on all available methods (like `on_train_begin`, `on_batch_end`) and the structure of the `logs` dictionary. A more advanced study on distributed training with TensorFlow can enhance one's understanding of the data flow and metric calculations during larger training processes. Reading research papers on custom callback design for specialized tasks like anomaly detection or continual learning can expose additional implementation strategies and edge-case considerations. Finally, exploring the source code for pre-built TensorFlow callbacks offers examples on good coding practices for this type of tasks and implementation details that will further enhance one's proficiency.
