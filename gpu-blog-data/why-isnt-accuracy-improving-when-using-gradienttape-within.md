Training deep learning models within TensorFlow's graph execution via `tf.function` offers significant performance benefits but, as I've observed firsthand in multiple projects, can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior when working with `tf.GradientTape`. Specifically, a situation I encountered while developing a time-series forecasting model involved an unchanging validation accuracy, despite what appeared to be a proper backpropagation setup. The issue stemmed from how variables are treated inside and outside of traced functions, particularly with `tf.GradientTape`.

The core problem is that `tf.function`, when first executed, traces the operations. This trace captures the concrete values of tensors at the time of tracing, not the abstract tensor objects themselves. While variables are initially captured and used within the tracing process, subsequent operations on those variables *outside* the traced function might not be reflected in the computations of the *traced* graph. This can lead to a discrepancy between the true state of the variables and their values within the computational graph used for gradient calculation.

In essence, if the weights of your model (typically `tf.Variable` objects) are modified outside of the gradient tape that was created inside `tf.function`, the gradient computed using that tape will be computed using the *stale* version of the weights, not the updated ones. Therefore, the optimizer's subsequent update based on this inaccurate gradient will not move you toward minimizing the loss. This is especially critical in iterative optimization algorithms where the same variables are modified repeatedly within a training loop.

To clarify this behavior, consider this simplified example of a single neuron:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initial Variable
w = tf.Variable(1.0, name="weight")
b = tf.Variable(0.0, name="bias")
x = tf.constant(2.0)
y_true = tf.constant(3.0)
learning_rate = 0.01

def loss_function(y_pred, y_true):
    return tf.square(y_pred - y_true)

def prediction(x, w, b):
    return x * w + b

@tf.function
def train_step():
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = prediction(x, w, b)
        loss = loss_function(y_pred, y_true)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [w, b])
    w.assign_sub(learning_rate * gradients[0]) # Assign Subtraction Operation - Crucial Step
    b.assign_sub(learning_rate * gradients[1])
    return loss, w, b

for i in range(3):
    loss_val, w_val, b_val = train_step()
    print(f"Loss: {loss_val.numpy()}, Weight: {w_val.numpy()}, Bias: {b_val.numpy()}")
```
Here, the `train_step` function, decorated with `@tf.function`, performs both the forward pass, loss calculation, gradient computation and the variable updates. Notice specifically the usage of `assign_sub` method for updating variables using the computed gradients *within the traced function*. If the variable updates were performed directly (e.g., `w = w - learning_rate * gradients[0]`), the update would happen *outside* the traced graph leading to the described issue. This is because the assignment to `w` within the function will create a new python variable rather than updating the existing tensor. Because assignment operations are python operations, not TF tensor operation, they are not part of the autograd graph that `GradientTape` uses.

Observe how loss and the variables change with each iteration of the training loop. This is because the gradient update is a tensor operation inside the traced function. Had the gradients been calculated inside `tf.GradientTape` and used to update the variable outside of `tf.function`, the `train_step` function would be operating using the initial variable values rather than the updated ones, leading to stagnant results.

Now, let's examine the problem when using an object-oriented approach for model management. The following code utilizes a custom model and shows a similar situation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class LinearRegressionModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(LinearRegressionModel, self).__init__()
        self.w = tf.Variable(1.0, name="weight")
        self.b = tf.Variable(0.0, name="bias")

    def call(self, x):
        return x * self.w + self.b

model = LinearRegressionModel()
x = tf.constant(2.0)
y_true = tf.constant(3.0)
learning_rate = 0.01

def loss_function(y_pred, y_true):
    return tf.square(y_pred - y_true)


@tf.function
def train_step(model, x, y_true):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_function(y_pred, y_true)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    model.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables)) # Use of optimizer.apply_gradients
    return loss

model.optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=learning_rate)
for i in range(3):
    loss_val = train_step(model, x, y_true)
    print(f"Loss: {loss_val.numpy()}, Weight: {model.w.numpy()}, Bias: {model.b.numpy()}")
```
In this scenario, using a `tf.keras.Model` subclass, the `train_step` now updates the model weights using `optimizer.apply_gradients`. This method correctly handles the variable updates within the computational graph defined by `tf.function`. We are able to see the variables updated each time. However, if we were to update the variables manually, outside of the tf.function, the weights would be stale within the traced graph leading to the same problem.

Let's modify the above snippet to highlight the incorrect way of updating the variables:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class LinearRegressionModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(LinearRegressionModel, self).__init__()
        self.w = tf.Variable(1.0, name="weight")
        self.b = tf.Variable(0.0, name="bias")

    def call(self, x):
        return x * self.w + self.b

model = LinearRegressionModel()
x = tf.constant(2.0)
y_true = tf.constant(3.0)
learning_rate = 0.01

def loss_function(y_pred, y_true):
    return tf.square(y_pred - y_true)


@tf.function
def train_step(model, x, y_true):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = model(x)
        loss = loss_function(y_pred, y_true)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    return loss, gradients

model.optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=learning_rate)
for i in range(3):
    loss_val, gradients = train_step(model, x, y_true)
    model.w.assign_sub(learning_rate * gradients[0]) # Incorrect way of updating the variable
    model.b.assign_sub(learning_rate * gradients[1]) # Incorrect way of updating the variable
    print(f"Loss: {loss_val.numpy()}, Weight: {model.w.numpy()}, Bias: {model.b.numpy()}")
```
Notice that despite the gradients being computed properly *within* the traced function, applying updates through `model.w.assign_sub()` and `model.b.assign_sub()` *outside* the graph results in `train_step` always utilizing the initial variable values. This causes the loss to remain constant and no learning to take place.

When troubleshooting such issues, it is critical to verify if variable updates occur inside or outside the traced `tf.function`. The recommended approach is to always use `tf.Variable.assign` or the `optimizer.apply_gradients` methods within the function if you intend to use `tf.function` for your training loop. This ensures that the variable updates happen inside the traced graph, and thus, the gradient computation uses the most recent weight values. Furthermore, using an optimizer within the `tf.function` makes your code more robust and easier to manage.

For further study on this topic, I would suggest reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation regarding `tf.function` and automatic differentiation, paying close attention to the tracing mechanisms. The TensorFlow tutorial on custom training loops also provides a good overview of the intended workflow, and Keras tutorials will give practical examples of best practices. Lastly, exploring more advanced optimization techniques and how to integrate them correctly into your code will also prove beneficial.
