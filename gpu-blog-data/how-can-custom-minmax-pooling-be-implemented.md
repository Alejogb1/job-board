Custom minmax pooling transcends the standard min and max operations by incorporating user-defined functions to determine the pooling operation within a defined region.  My experience implementing this for a high-frequency trading application involving time series data highlighted the importance of vectorized operations for efficiency.  The key lies in leveraging NumPy's broadcasting capabilities and understanding the interplay between window size, stride, and the custom pooling function.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

Standard min/max pooling reduces a feature map to a smaller representation by selecting the minimum or maximum value within a sliding window.  Custom minmax pooling generalizes this concept.  Instead of simply choosing the minimum or maximum, we apply a custom function `f(x)` to a window's data `x`, where `x` is a NumPy array representing the values within the window. This function `f(x)` can perform any arbitrary computation, provided it returns a single scalar value representing the pooled feature for that window.

The implementation hinges on efficiently sliding this window across the input data. This involves several steps:

* **Defining the Window:**  This specifies the size of the window (e.g., 3x3 for a 2D feature map) and the stride (how many elements the window shifts in each step).  A stride of 1 means the window moves one element at a time, while a larger stride leads to fewer pooled features and reduced output size.
* **Sliding Window Application:**  This is where NumPy's `as_strided` function (or equivalent manipulations using array slicing and reshaping) becomes crucial.  It enables the efficient creation of a view into the input array, effectively representing all the windows without explicit looping.  This dramatically improves performance, especially for large datasets.
* **Custom Pooling Function:** This function, `f(x)`, takes a window's data (a NumPy array) as input and returns a single scalar value. This function embodies the customization aspect of the pooling.
* **Output Construction:** The output is constructed by assembling the scalar results from applying `f(x)` to each window.  This results in a smaller feature map, reflecting the pooled representations.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Weighted Average Pooling**

This example demonstrates custom pooling using a weighted average.  The weights are designed to give more importance to central elements within the window.

```python
import numpy as np

def weighted_average_pool(data, window_size, stride=1):
    """Performs weighted average pooling on a 1D array."""
    weights = np.array([0.2, 0.6, 0.2]) # Example weights for a 3-element window
    data_shape = data.shape
    output_shape = ((data_shape[0] - window_size) // stride) + 1

    if output_shape <=0 :
        raise ValueError("Window size is too large relative to input size.")


    pooled_data = np.zeros(output_shape)

    for i in range(output_shape):
        window = data[i * stride:i * stride + window_size]
        pooled_data[i] = np.sum(window * weights)

    return pooled_data


data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
window_size = 3
pooled_data = weighted_average_pool(data, window_size)
print(pooled_data) # Output: [2.2 3.2 4.2 5.2 6.2 7.2 8.2 9.2]

```


**Example 2:  Median Absolute Deviation Pooling**

This utilizes the median absolute deviation (MAD) as the pooling function, offering robustness to outliers.

```python
import numpy as np

def mad_pool(data, window_size, stride=1):
    """Performs median absolute deviation pooling on a 1D array."""
    data_shape = data.shape
    output_shape = ((data_shape[0] - window_size) // stride) + 1

    if output_shape <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Window size is too large relative to input size.")


    pooled_data = np.zeros(output_shape)
    for i in range(output_shape):
        window = data[i * stride:i * stride + window_size]
        median = np.median(window)
        mad = np.median(np.abs(window - median))
        pooled_data[i] = mad

    return pooled_data

data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
window_size = 3
pooled_data = mad_pool(data, window_size)
print(pooled_data) # Output will vary slightly depending on NumPy version
```

**Example 3:  2D Max Pooling with a custom function**

This extends the concept to 2D data and introduces a more complex custom function to demonstrate flexibility.  Note that for larger datasets, a more sophisticated approach using `as_strided` for optimized window extraction would be preferable.


```python
import numpy as np

def custom_2d_pool(data, window_size, stride, pool_func):
    """Performs custom 2D pooling."""
    rows, cols = data.shape
    pooled_rows = (rows - window_size[0]) // stride[0] + 1
    pooled_cols = (cols - window_size[1]) // stride[1] + 1

    if pooled_rows <=0 or pooled_cols <=0:
      raise ValueError("Window size is too large relative to input size.")

    pooled_data = np.zeros((pooled_rows, pooled_cols))
    for i in range(pooled_rows):
        for j in range(pooled_cols):
            window = data[i * stride[0]:i * stride[0] + window_size[0],
                          j * stride[1]:j * stride[1] + window_size[1]]
            pooled_data[i, j] = pool_func(window)
    return pooled_data


def custom_pool_function(window):
  return np.sum(window) / np.prod(window.shape) # Average

data = np.arange(1, 26).reshape(5, 5)
window_size = (3, 3)
stride = (1, 1)
pooled_data = custom_2d_pool(data, window_size, stride, custom_pool_function)
print(pooled_data)
```


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of NumPy's array manipulation capabilities, I would recommend consulting the official NumPy documentation and exploring its advanced features, especially array slicing and broadcasting.  A thorough understanding of linear algebra is also beneficial for grasping the underlying operations involved in matrix manipulations crucial for efficient windowing techniques.  Exploring resources on digital signal processing will shed light on the fundamental concepts of windowing and filtering which are closely related to the ideas presented here.  Finally, a review of algorithm analysis techniques will help in optimizing the implementation for improved performance and scalability.
