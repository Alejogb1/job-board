TensorFlowLearn, now largely deprecated, presented a higher-level API built atop TensorFlow.  Direct migration isn't a straightforward process of replacing imports; it necessitates understanding the underlying TensorFlow graph structure and rebuilding equivalent functionality using the core TensorFlow APIs.  This stems from the fundamental differences in model construction and execution between the two.  My experience migrating numerous models from TensorFlowLearn to TensorFlow during my work on large-scale image classification projects at a previous company highlighted the crucial need for careful analysis and rewriting, rather than automated conversion.

**1. Understanding the Core Differences:**

TensorFlowLearn heavily relied on the `Estimator` API, which abstracted away many low-level details of graph construction.  This convenience came at the cost of reduced control over the computational graph.  TensorFlow, on the other hand, offers granular control over every aspect of the graph, from node creation to session management.  The migration process, therefore, involves dissecting the `Estimator`'s internal workings and explicitly recreating them using TensorFlow's core functionalities. This includes defining placeholders for input data, constructing the layers of the neural network manually, specifying loss functions, optimizers, and training procedures directly within the TensorFlow graph.

Furthermore, TensorFlowLearn's input functions, often used with `input_fn`, need to be re-implemented using TensorFlow's data input pipelines, typically involving `tf.data.Dataset`. This allows for finer-grained control over data preprocessing, batching, and shuffling, crucial for efficient training and performance optimization. Finally, evaluation metrics, previously managed by the `Estimator`, must be calculated and tracked explicitly using TensorFlow operations within the training loop.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the migration process for a simple linear regression, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and a convolutional neural network (CNN).  Each example demonstrates the transformation from the `Estimator`-based approach to direct TensorFlow graph construction.

**Example 1: Linear Regression**

```python
# TensorFlowLearn approach
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.estimator import Estimator, LinearRegressor

# ... (Feature columns definition) ...

linear_regressor = LinearRegressor(feature_columns=feature_columns)

# ... (Training and evaluation using linear_regressor) ...

# TensorFlow approach
import tensorflow as tf

X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, num_features])
y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1])

W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([num_features, 1]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))

y_pred = tf.matmul(X, W) + b
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y))
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01)
train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)

# ... (Session creation and training loop using train_op and loss) ...
```

Here, we replace the high-level `LinearRegressor` with explicit definition of placeholders (`X`, `y`), weights (`W`), biases (`b`), loss function, and optimizer. The training loop then directly utilizes the `train_op` within a TensorFlow session.


**Example 2: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**

```python
# TensorFlowLearn approach
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.estimator import Estimator, DNNClassifier

# ... (Feature columns and model parameters definition) ...

dnn_classifier = DNNClassifier(hidden_units=[10, 20, 10], n_classes=num_classes, feature_columns=feature_columns)

# ... (Training and evaluation using dnn_classifier) ...

# TensorFlow approach
import tensorflow as tf

X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, num_features])
y = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None])

hidden1 = tf.layers.dense(X, 10, activation=tf.nn.relu)
hidden2 = tf.layers.dense(hidden1, 20, activation=tf.nn.relu)
hidden3 = tf.layers.dense(hidden2, 10, activation=tf.nn.relu)
logits = tf.layers.dense(hidden3, num_classes)
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits=logits, labels=y))
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer()
train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)

# ... (Session creation and training loop using train_op and loss) ...
```

The `DNNClassifier` is replaced by a sequence of `tf.layers.dense` calls, explicitly constructing the MLP layers.  The loss function and optimizer are defined and used within the training loop.


**Example 3: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

```python
# TensorFlowLearn approach (Simplified for brevity)
# ... (Using tf.estimator.Estimator with custom model_fn incorporating CNN layers) ...

# TensorFlow approach
import tensorflow as tf

X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, height, width, channels])
y = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None])

conv1 = tf.layers.conv2d(X, 32, 3, activation=tf.nn.relu)
pool1 = tf.layers.max_pooling2d(conv1, 2, 2)
conv2 = tf.layers.conv2d(pool1, 64, 3, activation=tf.nn.relu)
pool2 = tf.layers.max_pooling2d(conv2, 2, 2)
flattened = tf.layers.flatten(pool2)
dense1 = tf.layers.dense(flattened, 128, activation=tf.nn.relu)
logits = tf.layers.dense(dense1, num_classes)
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits=logits, labels=y))
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer()
train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)

# ... (Session creation and training loop using train_op and loss) ...
```

This mirrors the MLP example but uses convolutional and pooling layers (`tf.layers.conv2d`, `tf.layers.max_pooling2d`) appropriate for image data.  The core principle remains the same: explicit construction of the graph and training loop.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on core APIs such as `tf.data`, `tf.layers`, optimizers, and loss functions.  Further understanding of the underlying TensorFlow graph execution model is beneficial.  Consulting advanced TensorFlow tutorials and books focusing on building custom models will greatly aid in the migration process.  Finally, revisiting the fundamentals of neural network architectures and training algorithms will solidify the understanding required for successful migration.  Careful examination of the original TensorFlowLearn code, paying close attention to hyperparameters and data preprocessing steps, is paramount.
