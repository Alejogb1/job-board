A significant reason a CUDA 2D kernel might fail when using a large block size, despite logical correctness in thread indexing, often stems from exceeding shared memory limitations or thread register constraints on the targeted GPU architecture, manifesting as launch failures or incorrect execution. My experience migrating a fluid simulation from CPU to GPU highlighted this issue acutely, initially with a 32x32 block size that worked flawlessly, but immediately failing when expanded to a 64x64 configuration on an older Tesla GPU.

Fundamentally, a CUDA kernel executes on the GPU in a grid of blocks, with each block comprising a set of threads. These threads, within a block, execute the same kernel code but on different data. The programmer specifies the dimensions of both the grid and the blocks. While the kernel code may be logically correct, the sheer size of a block can overextend the limited resources available to each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) within the GPU. The two most common bottlenecks are shared memory and registers per thread.

Shared memory, also called local data share (LDS) in AMD GPUs, is an extremely fast on-chip memory that is shared by all threads within a block. CUDA provides a limited amount of shared memory per SM and per block. A programmer may explicitly allocate shared memory within the kernel using the `__shared__` keyword and must specify the size at compile time. A large block size, especially when coupled with algorithms requiring significant shared memory for inter-thread communication, can rapidly exhaust the available shared memory, preventing the kernel from launching or resulting in kernel-level errors that are often cryptic. A block size of 64x64, compared to 32x32, immediately quadruples the number of threads that potentially require shared memory. If each thread requires even a small amount, say 4 bytes, of shared memory, the 64x64 block now needs 64 * 64 * 4 = 16384 bytes. This simple example highlights how easy it is to outgrow shared memory availability with increased block size. This can lead to a launch failure, a failed `cudaGetLastError` check returning `cudaErrorLaunchFailure` or potentially even incorrect computation without an explicit error, which is more difficult to debug.

Similarly, registers are used to store local variables for each thread. There is also a finite number of registers per SM. A high register usage within the kernel in combination with a large number of threads due to large block size, can lead to a register spill. In this scenario, the compiler might re-use registers or move values to global memory. This reduces performance dramatically, and in extreme cases can also lead to a launch failure, as the necessary memory for local variables might exceed the allowed limits. The compiler generally optimizes register usage, but complex kernels with many variables and array indexing can easily exceed register limits, especially with increasing block size.

To illustrate, consider a simple 2D kernel that sums elements within a square subregion of a larger matrix.

**Example 1: Shared Memory Usage (Problematic)**

```c++
__global__ void sum_region_shared(float *input, float *output, int width, int height, int region_size) {
  int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  if (x < width && y < height) {
      __shared__ float local_region[1024]; // Potential Shared Memory issue
      int index = threadIdx.y * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

      local_region[index] = 0.0f;

    //  Load data to shared memory
      if (x < width && y < height && (x < width && x >= 0 && y < height && y >= 0)){
          local_region[index] = input[y * width + x];
        }

        __syncthreads();


        float sum = 0.0f;
        if (x < width && y < height && (x < width && x >= 0 && y < height && y >= 0)){
            for(int j=0; j < region_size; j++){
               for (int i = 0; i < region_size; i++) {
                   int local_index_x = x+i;
                   int local_index_y = y+j;
                   if(local_index_x < width && local_index_y < height && (local_index_x < width && local_index_x >= 0 && local_index_y < height && local_index_y >= 0))
                   {
                       sum += local_region[local_index_y * blockDim.x + local_index_x];
                    }
                }
             }
            output[y * width + x] = sum;
         }
    }
}
```

Here, the `local_region` array is declared within shared memory. This is the culprit for the launch failure. If `blockDim.x` and `blockDim.y` are both large, such as 64, we need `64*64 = 4096` elements, exceeding the size allocated for the `local_region` array. However, even if that is increased to accommodate the large block size, the shared memory required by each thread will exhaust the available per block shared memory resources.  The intention of loading a subregion into shared memory before doing the computation is valid for optimization purposes, but not if the shared memory available per block is exceeded. When the block size grows, the total shared memory requirement also grows, potentially exceeding available resources resulting in the observed launch failure. It also illustrates an common error of assuming that an array size in shared memory is the maximum needed.

**Example 2: Incorrect Thread Synchronization**

```c++
__global__ void incorrect_sync(float *input, float *output, int width, int height) {
  int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

    if (x < width && y < height) {
        float temp_value = input[y * width + x];
        output[y * width + x] = temp_value + 1.0f;

        // Intended incorrect synchronization
       // __syncthreads(); // Removed intentionally
        output[y * width + x] = output[y * width + x] * 2.0f; // Data race if multiple threads update the same memory location at same time.
    }
}
```

This second example highlights a common error with larger block sizes where incorrect or omitted synchronization (`__syncthreads()`) can lead to data races and incorrect results. With fewer threads, the likelihood of data races might be lower, but with larger block sizes, the chances of multiple threads simultaneously writing to the same memory location increases, leading to unpredictable program behaviour. The kernel would typically not fail but will provide incorrect results which is more difficult to detect compared to a simple launch failure. This behavior is exacerbated with larger blocks as concurrent access is more likely.

**Example 3: Register Pressure (Simplified)**

```c++
__global__ void register_pressure(float *input, float *output, int width, int height) {
  int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

  if (x < width && y < height) {
    float var1 = input[y * width + x];
    float var2 = var1 * 2.0f;
    float var3 = var2 / 3.0f;
    float var4 = var3 + 4.0f;
    float var5 = var4 - 5.0f;
    float var6 = var5 * 6.0f;
    float var7 = var6 / 7.0f;
    float var8 = var7 + 8.0f;
    float var9 = var8 - 9.0f;
    float var10 = var9 * 10.0f;
    //  ... imagine a chain of many more calculations
      output[y*width + x] = var10;

  }
}
```

While seemingly harmless, this example simulates register pressure. Although these variables are scalars, when a kernel is highly complex and has a large number of local variables, the compiler may struggle to fit all register allocation per thread, resulting in spilled registers. This behavior is not exclusive to large block size, but larger blocks result in more concurrent threads and increase the stress on the registers which can ultimately lead to poor performance and sometimes launch failures. This is a very simplified example, and in reality the register usage could be in complex calculations in the kernel body or from complex indexing logic, requiring many temporaries for address calculation.

Debugging such issues requires systematic investigation. First, I'd review the kernel code focusing on shared memory allocations and register usage based on number of variables, complexity of indexing, and if the compiler reports register spill. I would then employ the CUDA profiler to gain insight on resources utilization at the hardware level. NVIDIA Nsight tools can help analyze memory traffic, register usage, and shared memory access patterns which may reveal the bottleneck.  I typically start with lower block sizes, and slowly increase it while monitoring resources to identify the thresholds.

To effectively address these limitations, several strategies are available. For shared memory constraints, one must carefully analyze the algorithm and optimize data access patterns to reduce the shared memory footprint and often re-architect the approach to operate with less per thread resources. Techniques like tiling or blocking, where a large computation is broken into smaller blocks processed using shared memory, can also be utilized. As well as re-architecturing, one should always ensure that only the required minimum amount of shared memory per thread and block is allocated to minimize resource consumption. For register pressure issues, one should look for areas where code complexity can be reduced, or variables can be reused. Sometimes, re-writing parts of the kernels to minimize memory loads can also reduce the register footprint. Furthermore, optimizing memory access patterns can also help reduce register pressure.

General recommendations would include studying NVIDIAâ€™s CUDA programming guides; they offer insights into optimizing memory access patterns, shared memory usage, and strategies for mitigating register pressure. Texts focused on GPU computing architectures, like the ones from David Kirk or John Hennessey, will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying hardware limitations that contribute to the issues that occur when using large block sizes. Furthermore, the CUDA Toolkit documentation itself is invaluable and contains detailed descriptions of architectural considerations and programming best practices that help with debugging. In summary, while increasing the block size can lead to higher occupancy and therefore more parallelism, this must always be done within the limits of the hardware and considering the specific algorithm implementation in the kernel code.
