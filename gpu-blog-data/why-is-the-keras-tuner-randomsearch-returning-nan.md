The occurrence of NaN (Not a Number) scores during hyperparameter optimization using Keras Tuner's `RandomSearch` is frequently indicative of numerical instability arising during model training, particularly within the loss calculation or gradient computation. This instability often stems from problematic hyperparameter configurations that, when applied during a model's training phase, lead to extremely large or undefined numerical values.

Let's delve into the specifics. The core function of `RandomSearch` is to explore a predefined hyperparameter space by randomly sampling configurations. Each sampled configuration undergoes a trial, where the model is constructed, trained, and evaluated. The evaluation phase typically involves calculating a loss value, which is subsequently used by the tuner to gauge the efficacy of the current hyperparameters. The presence of NaN scores, at this stage, signals that the loss function, at least for the attempted configuration, has produced an invalid number rather than a concrete numerical score. This invalidation can stem from several sources, many linked to numerical precision and the nature of the operations being performed within the training loop, particularly when dealing with extreme values.

One common cause is the application of an excessively large learning rate. The learning rate governs the magnitude of updates to the model's weights during backpropagation. If set too high, weight updates can lead to drastic changes in the model's predicted outputs. Such changes can destabilize the loss calculation, particularly if it involves logarithmic or exponential functions. For example, consider a binary cross-entropy loss. If the predicted probability becomes negligibly small or numerically equal to 0, taking the logarithm will generate negative infinity, which is often handled by the underlying numerical libraries as NaN during floating-point operations.

Another cause relates to the modelâ€™s architecture, particularly when layers involving non-linear activation functions are involved, in conjunction with suboptimal initialization. Activation functions like sigmoid or tanh can result in 'vanishing gradients' when the input to these functions grows too large or small and they saturate, thereby halting weight updates. However, the activation functions themselves don't directly produce NaN; rather, it is the loss calculation in the following step that is affected, particularly the logarithmic portion. An initially poor weight distribution that, combined with an excessively large learning rate can lead to a runaway divergence in loss computation, again leading to NaN values.

Batch normalization layers, while designed to improve training stability, can also contribute to NaN scores if configured improperly. If the input batch to such layers has insufficient variance (for instance if all the values within a batch are the same) the calculation of the normalization coefficients becomes problematic, frequently leading to division by zero. Although many numerical libraries will try to avoid it using a fudge factor (a small constant added to the denominator) these techniques are not always enough to prevent instability, particularly with high learning rates.

Finally, although less frequent, data quality issues can sometimes result in NaN scores. If the target variables used for training contain NaN values, then the loss function will inevitably return NaN. Also, if there are excessively large values in your inputs, this can trigger overflow/underflow issues, potentially contributing to NaN results after various model transformations and loss computations.

Here are code examples illustrating scenarios where NaN scores can manifest:

**Example 1: Excessive Learning Rate**

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf

def build_model(hp):
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=128, step=32), activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
  ])
  learning_rate = hp.Float('learning_rate', min_value=1e-5, max_value=1e-1, sampling='log')
  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate)
  model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  return model

tuner = kt.RandomSearch(
    build_model,
    objective='val_loss',
    max_trials=10,
    directory='my_dir',
    project_name='my_project'
)

x_train = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)
x_val = tf.random.normal(shape=(20, 10))
y_val = tf.random.uniform(shape=(20, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)

tuner.search(x_train, y_train, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), epochs=10)

```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates how a poorly sampled learning rate, specifically in the higher end of the range (1e-1), can lead to NaN loss values. The `sampling='log'` ensures we are using a logarithmic distribution of learning rates, which is a common practice, but the magnitude is still something that needs to be tuned carefully, as shown here, since a high learning rate will result in unstable training and possibly NaN.

**Example 2: Poor Initialization and Activation Saturation**

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def build_model(hp):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=128, step=32),
                            kernel_initializer=tf.keras.initializers.RandomNormal(stddev=5), # problematic initialization
                            activation='tanh', input_shape=(10,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model


tuner = kt.RandomSearch(
    build_model,
    objective='val_loss',
    max_trials=10,
    directory='my_dir',
    project_name='my_project'
)

x_train = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)
x_val = tf.random.normal(shape=(20, 10))
y_val = tf.random.uniform(shape=(20, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)


tuner.search(x_train, y_train, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), epochs=10)
```

*Commentary:* Here, we use a `RandomNormal` initializer with a standard deviation of 5. This can cause many weights to have large magnitude, which, when passed through the tanh activation function, saturate it in the initial forward pass. This can, in turn, result in instability, and the subsequent loss calculation might yield a NaN, especially when this is combined with the sigmoid in the last layer and a binary cross entropy. The key takeaway is to use smaller deviations on initializations or use better weight initializations such as Glorot or He initializations, which take into account the dimensions of the layers.

**Example 3: Data with NaN/Extreme Values**

```python
import keras_tuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def build_model(hp):
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=128, step=32), activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
  ])
  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
  model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  return model


tuner = kt.RandomSearch(
    build_model,
    objective='val_loss',
    max_trials=10,
    directory='my_dir',
    project_name='my_project'
)


x_train = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.uniform(shape=(100, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32).numpy()
y_train[0] = np.nan # introducing NaN in the target

x_val = tf.random.normal(shape=(20, 10))
y_val = tf.random.uniform(shape=(20, 1), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)

tuner.search(x_train, y_train, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), epochs=10)

```

*Commentary:* In this case, we intentionally introduce a NaN value into the training target (`y_train`). This single NaN within the labels, while seemingly innocuous, immediately results in the binary cross-entropy loss producing a NaN.

For addressing NaN score problems during hyperparameter optimization with Keras Tuner, I would advise the following course of action. First, systematically reduce the learning rate range during hyperparameter search, using `hp.Float` with `sampling='log'` in `build_model`. Second, verify your model's weights initializations. Keras provides various initializations, using techniques such as Glorot or He initializations might help. Third, perform thorough preprocessing of your data. Ensure that your inputs do not include NaN or extreme values and that your target variables are correct, without undefined numerical values. Finally, consider adding batch normalization layers (if not already in place) and thoroughly tune the batch size alongside other hyperparameters.

Recommended resources for deeper understanding include the following documentation: the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on optimizers, layers, loss functions, initializations and batch normalization. There are also good texts on numerical stability and deep learning, that can provide more background information on these concepts. Furthermore, reading papers on gradient descent and its variants, including discussions on different weight initialization strategies, can also prove beneficial.
