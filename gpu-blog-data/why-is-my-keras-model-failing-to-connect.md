The most frequent cause of a Keras model failing to connect to an expected layer stems from inconsistencies between layer definitions and the model's sequential structure, often manifesting as shape mismatches or incompatible data types.  This is a problem I've encountered countless times during my work developing deep learning models for natural language processing, particularly when working with recurrent networks and custom layers.  My experience has shown that careful attention to input/output shapes, data preprocessing, and explicit layer specification is paramount.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras, built on top of TensorFlow or Theano, facilitates the construction of neural networks through a highly modular architecture.  Models are typically constructed sequentially, with each layer receiving the output of the preceding layer as its input.  A failure to connect implies a break in this chain, preventing information flow. Several factors can contribute to this:

* **Incompatible Input Shapes:** The most common culprit.  If the output shape of layer *n* doesn't precisely match the expected input shape of layer *n+1*, Keras will raise an error, or worse, silently fail, producing nonsensical results.  This mismatch can arise from incorrect layer configuration (e.g., specifying incorrect `kernel_size`, `input_shape`, or `units`), data preprocessing inconsistencies (e.g., unintended dimension changes during normalization or tokenization), or the use of layers with implicit shape transformations that aren't fully understood.

* **Data Type Mismatches:**  While less common, discrepancies in data types (e.g., attempting to feed floating-point data to a layer expecting integers) can disrupt the connection. Keras layers are often optimized for specific data types, and providing incompatible data will lead to errors.

* **Incorrect Layer Ordering:** The sequential nature of Keras models is crucial.  Improperly ordering layers (e.g., placing a dense layer before a convolutional layer when the data is image-based) will cause shape mismatches and prevent the model from functioning correctly.

* **Issues with Custom Layers:** When incorporating custom layers, errors are more likely due to complexities in handling input shapes and potential bugs within the custom layer's implementation.  Carefully validating the forward pass of a custom layer, and ensuring its input and output shapes are explicitly defined and consistent with the rest of the model is essential.

* **Forgotten `input_shape`:**  For the first layer in a sequential model, the `input_shape` argument must be explicitly defined. Failing to do so often results in connection failures, especially if the input data is not a simple vector.

Debugging these issues requires careful examination of each layer's input and output shapes, using Keras' built-in utilities or custom debugging statements to track the data's flow through the network.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Shape Mismatch due to Incorrect `units` Parameter**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

# Incorrect model definition - units in Dense layer is incompatible
model_incorrect = keras.Sequential([
  Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)), # Assuming 28x28 input images
  Dense(100, activation='relu'),
  Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Incorrect - should match the number of classes
])

#Attempt to compile the model with a suitable loss function
try:
  model_incorrect.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
except ValueError as e:
  print(f"Error during compilation: {e}") #This will likely catch the shape mismatch error


# Correct model definition
model_correct = keras.Sequential([
  Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
  Dense(10, activation='softmax') #Correct
])
model_correct.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This demonstrates a shape mismatch arising from an incorrect number of units in a Dense layer.  The `Flatten` layer transforms a 28x28 image into a 784-dimensional vector.  The first `Dense` layer reduces this to 100 dimensions, but the second layer tries to connect to 10, which could be appropriate only if there are 10 classes.  The correct model handles this directly.  The `try-except` block demonstrates a robust approach to error handling.

**Example 2: Data Type Mismatch**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Dense

# Incorrect data type
x_train_incorrect = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=np.int32)
y_train_incorrect = np.array([0, 1], dtype=np.int32)

model_data_type = keras.Sequential([
  Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(2,))
])

try:
    model_data_type.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
    model_data_type.fit(x_train_incorrect, y_train_incorrect, epochs=1)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"TypeError during model training: {e}")

# Correct data type
x_train_correct = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=np.float32)
y_train_correct = np.array([0.0, 1.0], dtype=np.float32)

model_data_type.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
model_data_type.fit(x_train_correct, y_train_correct, epochs=1)

```

Here, the model anticipates floating-point inputs due to the `binary_crossentropy` loss function, but integer data is provided.  Using `np.float32` for both input and output rectifies this problem.  The `try-except` block helps catch the potential error.

**Example 3:  Custom Layer Integration Problem**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Layer

class CustomLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                initializer='random_normal',
                                trainable=True)
        super(CustomLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)


model_custom = keras.Sequential([
  Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  CustomLayer(units=32),
  Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_custom.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

#The following will fail if the shape of output from the custom layer and input shape of the next layer do not match
model_custom.summary() #Examine the output summary to verify shapes

try:
  model_custom.fit(np.random.rand(100, 10), np.random.randint(0, 2, 100), epochs=1)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"ValueError during model training with custom layer: {e}")
```

This example features a custom layer where the `build` method correctly handles input shape but an error in the internal calculation within `call` could lead to a shape mismatch error when connected to other layers. The `model.summary()` statement helps in detecting such shape inconsistencies before running the fit operation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation provides comprehensive tutorials and guides on model building.  Familiarize yourself with the `keras.layers` module and understand the input/output shapes of each layer.  A thorough understanding of NumPy for array manipulation is essential.  Finally, debugging tools such as TensorFlow's `tf.print` can be invaluable when tracking tensor shapes and values during model execution.   Mastering these resources will significantly improve your ability to build and debug complex Keras models.
