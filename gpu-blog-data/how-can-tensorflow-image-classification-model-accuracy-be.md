Evaluating the accuracy of a TensorFlow image classification model on a per-class basis requires a nuanced approach beyond simply calculating overall accuracy.  My experience in developing robust image recognition systems for medical imaging highlighted the critical need for granular accuracy assessment, especially when class imbalances exist, or when misclassifications in certain classes carry disproportionate consequences.  We cannot rely solely on aggregate metrics; individual class performance must be scrutinized.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The standard approach of calculating overall accuracy – the ratio of correctly classified images to the total number of images – provides an insufficient picture.  Consider a scenario where you're classifying images of ten different types of flowers.  If one flower type, say "Rose," comprises 90% of the dataset, a model might achieve a high overall accuracy by simply classifying everything as a Rose.  However, its performance on the remaining nine flower types would be abysmal. This is indicative of a model with significant class imbalance issues.

To assess per-class accuracy, we need to examine the confusion matrix.  This matrix visualizes the performance of a classifier by showing the counts of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) predictions for each class.  From the confusion matrix, we can derive various metrics:

* **Precision:**  The proportion of correctly predicted positive identifications out of all positive identifications (TP / (TP + FP)). This metric reflects the model's ability to avoid false positives. A high precision is crucial where false positives are costly (e.g., misclassifying a benign tumor as malignant).

* **Recall (Sensitivity):** The proportion of correctly predicted positive identifications out of all actual positive instances (TP / (TP + FN)).  This metric highlights the model's ability to detect all actual positive instances. High recall is vital when false negatives are unacceptable (e.g., misclassifying a malignant tumor as benign).

* **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall (2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)). This metric provides a balanced measure considering both precision and recall, useful when we need to weigh both types of errors equally.

Calculating these metrics for each class independently offers a detailed understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.  Furthermore, visualizing the confusion matrix allows for rapid identification of classes exhibiting poor performance, enabling targeted improvements in model training or data augmentation.  In my work, visualizing these class-specific metrics proved far more insightful than relying solely on overall accuracy.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples utilize TensorFlow/Keras and assume a pre-trained and evaluated model.

**Example 1:  Using `sklearn.metrics` for Confusion Matrix and Metrics Calculation**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Assuming 'y_true' contains the true labels (one-hot encoded or integer labels)
# and 'y_pred' contains the model's predictions (one-hot encoded or integer labels).
#  These are obtained from the model's evaluation on a test set.

y_true = np.array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0])  #Example True Labels
y_pred = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0]) #Example Predicted Labels

cm = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", cm)

report = classification_report(y_true, y_pred, output_dict=True)
for class_label, metrics in report.items():
    if class_label != 'accuracy' and class_label != 'macro avg' and class_label != 'weighted avg':
        print(f"Class {class_label}: Precision = {metrics['precision']:.2f}, Recall = {metrics['recall']:.2f}, F1-score = {metrics['f1-score']:.2f}")

```

This code leverages the `sklearn.metrics` library for efficient calculation of the confusion matrix and per-class precision, recall, and F1-score. The output clearly shows performance for each class separately. Note that this code assumes that you have prepared your `y_true` and `y_pred` appropriately, which might include one-hot encoding decoding if necessary.


**Example 2: Manual Calculation of Metrics from a Confusion Matrix**

```python
import numpy as np

cm = np.array([[5, 1, 0],
               [1, 6, 1],
               [0, 2, 4]])  # Example Confusion Matrix

num_classes = cm.shape[0]
for i in range(num_classes):
    tp = cm[i, i]
    fp = np.sum(cm[:, i]) - tp
    fn = np.sum(cm[i, :]) - tp
    precision = tp / (tp + fp) if (tp + fp) > 0 else 0
    recall = tp / (tp + fn) if (tp + fn) > 0 else 0
    f1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) if (precision + recall) > 0 else 0
    print(f"Class {i}: Precision = {precision:.2f}, Recall = {recall:.2f}, F1-score = {f1:.2f}")

```

This demonstrates manual calculation, useful for understanding the underlying formulas. It iterates through each class in the confusion matrix and computes the metrics directly. This approach is valuable for educational purposes and for situations where the use of external libraries is restricted. Error handling is included to prevent division by zero.


**Example 3:  Using TensorFlow's `tf.math.confusion_matrix` (Requires adaptation for multi-class scenarios)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming 'model' is your trained TensorFlow/Keras model, and 'test_data' and 'test_labels' are your test data and labels.

predictions = model.predict(test_data)
#  Convert predictions to class labels (e.g., using argmax for one-hot encoded predictions)
predicted_labels = tf.argmax(predictions, axis=1)

# Assuming binary classification for this simplified example. Multi-class requires adjustment.
conf_matrix = tf.math.confusion_matrix(labels=test_labels, predictions=predicted_labels, num_classes=2)

TP = conf_matrix[1,1]
TN = conf_matrix[0,0]
FP = conf_matrix[0,1]
FN = conf_matrix[1,0]

precision = TP/(TP+FP) if TP+FP >0 else 0.0
recall = TP/(TP+FN) if TP+FN > 0 else 0.0
f1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) if precision+recall > 0 else 0.0

print(f'Precision:{precision}, Recall:{recall}, F1-score:{f1}')
```

This example shows how to utilize TensorFlow's built-in functions to generate parts of the confusion matrix. For binary classification, the metrics can be easily computed as shown. For multi-class scenarios, you would need to loop through each class and calculate the TP, FP, TN, FN for each class separately, akin to the manual computation example. Remember to handle potential division by zero errors.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation; a comprehensive textbook on machine learning (particularly those covering classification metrics and evaluation); relevant research papers on class imbalance problems and handling techniques; and finally, documentation for the `scikit-learn` library.  These resources provide a solid foundation for understanding and applying these techniques effectively.  Careful study of these materials will enhance your understanding and ability to implement robust evaluation strategies.
