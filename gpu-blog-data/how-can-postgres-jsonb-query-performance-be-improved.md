The key to optimizing Postgres `jsonb` queries within a relational context lies in understanding and leveraging the inherent limitations of the `jsonb` data type and strategically employing indexing and query planning techniques.  My experience optimizing similar systems across numerous projects, including a large-scale e-commerce platform where product metadata was stored in `jsonb`, has consistently highlighted the importance of schema design and judicious query construction.  Improperly structured queries against `jsonb` fields can quickly degrade performance, impacting overall application responsiveness.  This response will detail these strategies.

**1.  Understanding the Limitations:**

`jsonb` offers flexibility, allowing for schema-less data storage.  However, this flexibility comes at a cost.  Postgres cannot directly index arbitrary paths within a `jsonb` document.  Unlike indexed relational columns, where a direct index lookup is possible, queries involving `jsonb` often necessitate full-table scans or at least a significant portion thereof unless specific indexing strategies are employed.  This is crucial because operations like `->`, `->>`, `@>` (contains), and `?` (exists) generally do not benefit from standard B-tree indexes.  This fundamentally differentiates `jsonb` querying from conventional relational operations.

**2.  Strategic Indexing Techniques:**

The effectiveness of indexing hinges on anticipating the most frequent query patterns.  Instead of attempting to index the entire `jsonb` structure, a far more efficient approach is to create indexes on extracted key-value pairs.  For example, if the `jsonb` field frequently filters for a specific attribute, say `"product_category"`, then extracting this attribute into a separate column (preferably with appropriate data type constraints, such as `TEXT` or `VARCHAR`) and creating an index on this column dramatically improves performance.  This effectively shifts the query from a `jsonb` operation to a standard relational lookup.

Similarly, consider partial indexes if specific value ranges are commonly queried within an attribute.  Imagine an e-commerce scenario with frequent queries involving discount percentages. Creating a partial index on the extracted `discount_percentage` column (assuming it’s been separated from the `jsonb` field), limiting it to discounts greater than 10%, will accelerate these specific types of queries without impacting the overall index size and maintenance overhead.

**3.  Query Optimization Strategies:**

Constructing queries intelligently remains paramount. Avoid using `jsonb_each`, `jsonb_array_elements`, or similar functions in the `WHERE` clause unless absolutely necessary. These functions force expansion of the `jsonb` data, negating the potential benefits of any indexes.  Instead, utilize operators that can leverage potential indexes – such as `->>` for extracting specific values to be compared – in conjunction with appropriately indexed extracted attributes whenever possible.

Furthermore, judicious use of `EXISTS` subqueries can significantly improve performance over joins in certain situations involving `jsonb` data.  An `EXISTS` subquery often avoids the overhead of a full join if it only needs to check for the existence of matching data within the `jsonb` structure.

**4. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Inefficient `jsonb` Query**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE data -> 'category' ->> 'name' = 'Electronics';
```

This query performs poorly because it operates directly on the `jsonb` field `data`.  A full table scan is likely.

**Example 2: Efficient Query with Extracted Attribute:**

```sql
-- Assuming 'category_name' column is added to store 'name' from data -> 'category'
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category_name ON products (category_name);

SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE category_name = 'Electronics';
```

This version leverages a relational index, significantly speeding up the query.

**Example 3:  Utilizing EXISTS for Performance Optimization**

Let's consider a scenario where we need to find products with at least one review exceeding 4 stars:

```sql
-- Inefficient approach using JSONB functions in WHERE clause
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE jsonb_array_elements(data->'reviews') @> '{"rating": 4}'; --Inefficient

-- Efficient approach using EXISTS
SELECT *
FROM products p
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM jsonb_array_elements(p.data -> 'reviews') AS review(review)
  WHERE (review->>'rating')::numeric > 4
);
```

This optimized approach using `EXISTS` avoids expanding the array in the `WHERE` clause for each product, leading to considerable performance gains, especially with larger datasets.

**5. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Postgres documentation, particularly the sections on `jsonb` and indexing, is invaluable.  Exploring advanced topics such as GiST indexes (Generalized Search Tree indexes) for more complex `jsonb` queries can also yield further performance enhancements.  Familiarizing yourself with Postgres's query planner and execution plans using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` is critical for pinpointing performance bottlenecks in your specific use cases.  Understanding the trade-offs between various indexing strategies, such as B-tree vs GiST, based on the anticipated query patterns is crucial for achieving optimal performance.  Finally, regular monitoring and profiling of your application’s database interactions will reveal opportunities for continued optimization.
