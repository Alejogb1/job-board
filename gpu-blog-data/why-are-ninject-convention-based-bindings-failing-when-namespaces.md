Convention-based bindings in Ninject, particularly those relying on naming conventions within assemblies, hinge critically on consistent type resolution. I've personally observed situations, while working on a modular application utilizing a plugin architecture, where seemingly identical bindings would sporadically fail when deployed to separate, dynamically loaded modules. This behavior stems primarily from how Ninject, by default, handles type name comparison during its convention scanning, which becomes problematic when namespaces diverge, even slightly, across assemblies.

Ninject's convention binding system employs reflection to discover types within specified assemblies and applies binding rules based on naming patterns or attributes. For instance, an interface named `IWidgetService` might be bound to a concrete implementation named `WidgetService`. These conventions often assume a straightforward match, such as the implementation being named the same as the interface, potentially with a prefix or suffix removed. However, when namespaces are not perfectly aligned across projects or dynamically loaded modules, this implicit expectation of a direct string-based name match can break down. The issue isn't with the binding logic itself, but the underlying type resolution strategy applied *before* those binding rules are enforced.

Ninject, by default, tends to use a simple equality comparison of full type names. Thus, if `IWidgetService` is located in `MyProject.Contracts` and its corresponding implementation, `WidgetService`, resides in `MyProject.Implementation`, the convention will typically succeed. However, introduce a dynamic module that contains a `MyModule.Implementation.WidgetService` implementation intended to satisfy an `IWidgetService` contract in `MyProject.Contracts`, and the convention scanning in Ninject will frequently miss the intended binding unless configured to explicitly account for the namespace difference. The comparison fails because `MyProject.Implementation.WidgetService` does not equal `MyModule.Implementation.WidgetService`.

This problem is not unique to Ninject. The underlying principle of resolving types across modules or plugins based on conventions, instead of explicit configuration, needs mechanisms to handle variation in type identities.

Consider these code examples to clarify:

**Example 1: Default Configuration (Failing Scenario)**

```csharp
// Assume MyProject.Contracts.dll contains IWidgetService
namespace MyProject.Contracts
{
    public interface IWidgetService { void DoSomething(); }
}

// Assume MyProject.Implementation.dll contains WidgetService
namespace MyProject.Implementation
{
    public class WidgetService : IWidgetService
    { public void DoSomething() { /*...*/ } }
}

// Assume MyModule.Implementation.dll contains a WidgetService in a different namespace
namespace MyModule.Implementation
{
    public class WidgetService : MyProject.Contracts.IWidgetService
    { public void DoSomething() { /*...*/ } }
}

// Main application startup:
var kernel = new StandardKernel();
kernel.Bind(x => x
    .FromAssembliesMatching("*.dll")
    .SelectAllClasses()
    .BindDefaultInterface()
);

// Attempting to resolve the service in a module context will likely fail with the default convention, as no binding for MyProject.Contracts.IWidgetService -> MyModule.Implementation.WidgetService is established.
var service = kernel.Get<MyProject.Contracts.IWidgetService>(); //Potentially fails, depending on load order.
```

In this scenario, using Ninject's `BindDefaultInterface`, a common convention, the convention will discover and likely bind `MyProject.Contracts.IWidgetService` to `MyProject.Implementation.WidgetService`. However, the `WidgetService` in `MyModule.Implementation` is considered a completely different type for binding purposes. During the resolution phase in the main application, when `kernel.Get<MyProject.Contracts.IWidgetService>()` is called, Ninject does not automatically identify that `MyModule.Implementation.WidgetService` should satisfy the contract, hence it will likely throw a binding exception if no other matching type was loaded before it.

**Example 2: Custom Convention Binding (Explicit Name Matching, Partial Solution)**

```csharp
// Main application startup with a custom convention:
var kernel = new StandardKernel();
kernel.Bind(x => x
    .FromAssembliesMatching("*.dll")
    .SelectAllClasses()
    .Where(type => type.Name.EndsWith("Service"))
    .Bind(type => kernel.Bind(
        kernel.GetBindings(typeof(MyProject.Contracts.IWidgetService)).FirstOrDefault(binding=> binding.Service.Name == type.Name)?.Service ?? typeof(MyProject.Contracts.IWidgetService),  type)
    );
//Attempting to resolve service.
var service = kernel.Get<MyProject.Contracts.IWidgetService>(); // Will now bind successfully.
```

In this corrected example, I've introduced a custom binding where the lambda expression now looks for types that end with `Service`. When binding, we check if any bindings for IWidgetService is already registered on the kernel. If it is, and that binding shares the type name of the service we are attempting to bind, then we use that. Otherwise we fall back to the original type for binding. This provides a way to allow `MyModule.Implementation.WidgetService` to successfully bind to the interface despite the namespace difference because it directly matches on name instead of full type name. This relies on the knowledge that the desired service will also end in "Service", and that all contracts match the name of their implementations. This provides a limited solution, but still introduces constraints on naming conventions.

**Example 3: Specific Implementation Binding (Explicit Control, Recommended Solution)**

```csharp
//Main Application startup with an explicit binding for specific module.
var kernel = new StandardKernel();

kernel.Bind<MyProject.Contracts.IWidgetService>().To<MyModule.Implementation.WidgetService>();

kernel.Bind(x => x
    .FromAssembliesMatching("MyProject.*.dll")
    .SelectAllClasses()
    .BindDefaultInterface());

//Attempting to resolve service.
var service = kernel.Get<MyProject.Contracts.IWidgetService>(); // Will bind successfully due to explicit binding.
```

In this third example, I've opted to bypass convention based binding for the dynamic module, and instead explicitly bind the implementation in `MyModule.Implementation` to the contract within `MyProject.Contracts`. This approach offers full control and avoids issues with type name mismatches and also allows other modules to use convention based bindings as before. The drawback is the necessity of predefining bindings for specific implementations, potentially leading to more manual configuration effort. However, it is generally the preferred approach as it reduces the reliance on naming conventions.

The key takeaway here is that relying on convention-based binding for scenarios where namespaces can differ demands a mechanism that handles variations in type identities, or completely avoids that approach. While Ninject provides a convenient way to automatically register many bindings using conventions, those conventions must be understood to work on name equality by default, or custom methods must be introduced to circumvent that. Otherwise, the convention might fail in dynamic loading scenarios due to unexpected type resolution when namespaces are not uniform.

To further explore Ninject and address this challenge more generally, I recommend investigating the following resources:
*   **Ninject Documentation**: The official documentation, available on the Ninject project website, provides the most comprehensive explanation of features and best practices.
*   **Advanced Binding Strategies**: Reviewing advanced topics such as custom binding extensions, module loading mechanisms and lifecycle management, which are all crucial for tackling modular architectures, will help.
*   **Dependency Injection Best Practices**: General books and resources on DI can provide further insight on how to manage these issues and provide alternative options to automatic convention based bindings, and address the common pitfalls.

While convention-based binding is a convenient tool, recognizing the limitations of its type matching strategy and adjusting binding procedures based on the specific context of the application are important for maintaining robustness, especially in complex modular systems.
