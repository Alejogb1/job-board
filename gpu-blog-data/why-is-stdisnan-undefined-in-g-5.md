The `std::isnan` function, introduced in the C++11 standard, is designed to determine if a floating-point number represents a "Not-a-Number" value. However, its absence in g++-5 stems from the compiler's partial implementation of that standard, specifically its lack of complete `<cmath>` library support required for `std::isnan`. This deficiency isn’t about the core language features; it’s about the library implementation backing it. Having spent considerable time developing cross-platform numerical simulations, I’ve encountered this issue directly and understand its practical implications.

The C++ standard library, particularly components related to numerical computations, is implemented and maintained separately from the core language syntax and semantics. The standard committee specifies the interface and behavior of functions like `std::isnan`, but the actual code responsible for executing it resides in the standard library implementation provided by the compiler vendor. G++ versions before 6.0 often had incomplete implementations of the C++11 standard library, relying on an older version of libstdc++ (GNU Standard C++ Library) or a less comprehensive version. The incomplete `<cmath>` library was a known area of divergence from the complete C++11 specification in those earlier GCC distributions.

Specifically, while core language features from C++11 were generally available, many of the new library features, especially those involving math functions and advanced containers, were often missing or not fully functional. This meant that even if a program compiled successfully with C++11 mode enabled, it could fail at runtime due to missing library symbols or exhibit incorrect behavior because the implementation did not align with standard’s specifications for functions like `std::isnan`.

The underlying reason `std::isnan` is missing is that the appropriate symbols and implementation were not included in the libstdc++ bundled with g++-5. The standard requires the function to be provided within the `std::` namespace after including the `<cmath>` header file. If the library implementing that header file does not define `std::isnan`, then any attempt to use it will result in an undefined symbol error at link time, not necessarily during compilation. This highlights the crucial distinction between compilation, which focuses on syntax correctness, and linking, which resolves symbols from the different object files and libraries. The problem manifests itself when the linker can't find `std::isnan` during the final linkage phase.

As a practical workaround for projects compiled with g++-5, one could employ platform-specific macros or substitute an equivalent alternative. Specifically, I've frequently used a custom inline function that encapsulates the underlying architecture's implementation of detecting NaN values. This strategy allows the use of a portable solution. Here are examples, focusing on x86 platforms for demonstration:

```cpp
#include <limits>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

// Platform-specific implementation (example for x86)
inline bool isNaN_x86(double val) {
    // Use a bitwise comparison on the raw representation of the float
    //  to detect NaN as implemented in IEEE 754 standard.
    // A NaN has its mantissa part non-zero and its exponent
    // is all ones.
    uint64_t raw_value = 0;
    std::memcpy(&raw_value, &val, sizeof(double));
    uint64_t exponent_mask = 0x7ff0000000000000;
    uint64_t mantissa_mask = 0x000fffffffffffff;
    return ( (raw_value & exponent_mask) == exponent_mask) &&
            (raw_value & mantissa_mask) != 0 ;
}

// Custom cross platform function
inline bool isNaN_custom(double val) {
#if defined(__x86_64__) || defined(__i386__)
        return isNaN_x86(val);
#elif defined(__ARM_ARCH) || defined(_ARM)
       // Implementation for ARM here based on bitwise examination if needed.
       // Or using std::isnan once a more suitable compiler version is used.
        return std::isnan(val);
#else
       // Fallback to the standard if possible or provide a generic implementation.
        return std::isnan(val);
#endif
}

int main() {
    double nan_value = std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN();
    double valid_value = 10.0;

    std::cout << "Using standard std::isnan(): "
              << (std::isnan(nan_value) ? "true" : "false") << " (will cause problems with g++-5)" << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Using custom isNaN_custom(nan_value): "
              << (isNaN_custom(nan_value) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;

    std::cout << "Using custom isNaN_custom(valid_value): "
              << (isNaN_custom(valid_value) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Code Example 1: A platform specific implementation.** The provided code gives a working example for x86 architectures. The core idea is to access the raw bit representation of the double value and perform bitwise comparisons to check for the characteristic bit pattern of a NaN. The `std::memcpy` copies the binary data of the double into a 64-bit integer, which then allows bitwise comparisons. The `exponent_mask` covers the exponent part and the `mantissa_mask` covers the mantissa part of the float. If the exponent is all ones and the mantissa is not zero it is a NaN.

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

//Fallback if the target platform has no specific alternative
inline bool isNaN_fallback(double val)
{
     //Check for inequality using the float's own comparison logic,
     // as a NaN is never equal to itself.
     return val != val;
}

int main() {
     double nan_value = std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN();
     double valid_value = 10.0;

     std::cout << "Using isNaN_fallback(nan_value): " << (isNaN_fallback(nan_value) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
     std::cout << "Using isNaN_fallback(valid_value): " << (isNaN_fallback(valid_value) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
     return 0;
}
```

**Code Example 2: A fallback implementation utilizing NaN's self-inequality property.** This demonstrates a basic yet powerful cross-platform method. The essence of this solution is that NaN is defined to be unequal to itself; thus, `val != val` will only evaluate to `true` if `val` is a NaN. The simplicity is very effective. This specific logic relies on the specific properties of NaN under the IEEE 754 standards.

```c++
#include <limits>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <cfloat>

//Another potential alternative implementation for x86 platforms using C functions
inline bool isNaN_x86_alt(double val) {
    return std::fpclassify(val) == FP_NAN;
}

int main() {
    double nan_value = std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN();
    double valid_value = 10.0;

    std::cout << "Using std::fpclassify(nan_value) approach: "
                << (isNaN_x86_alt(nan_value) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Using std::fpclassify(valid_value) approach: "
                << (isNaN_x86_alt(valid_value) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Code Example 3: Using `fpclassify` with a C standard library.** Here, a C math function `fpclassify` is employed to check the type of a floating-point number. The `FP_NAN` macro returns the constant representing that a float is a NaN type according to the standard. This C standard library approach may be more robust than bit manipulation if the target platform has a complete or well-implemented version of `cfloat`. The implementation still needs the support of an available C math library.

When working with older compilers, understanding which C++ standard library components are properly implemented can be critical to avoid unexpected behavior or link-time errors. While compiler upgrades often resolve issues like this, retrofitting older codebases sometimes requires using techniques like these to maintain compatibility.

For further reference on standards compliance and C++ library implementations, it is advisable to consult documentation for specific compiler versions as well as the ISO C++ standard documents themselves, typically available on official standardization body websites. Textbooks on advanced C++ programming and numeric computing often include discussions on standard library usage and cross-platform development, which can shed further light on nuances of this kind of issue and general numerical considerations. Finally, examination of the libstdc++ documentation, which is the GNU standard library often used on Linux systems, is another important resource.
