My experience has shown that, while it’s common to perceive pooling layers as solely reducing dimensionality, a `Conv1D` layer, used strategically *after* a `MaxPool1D`, can indeed increase the dimensionality of a sequential dataset. This is because `MaxPool1D` inherently shrinks the temporal dimension of the input but doesn’t alter the number of channels. This sets the stage for a `Conv1D` layer to expand the channel dimension, thus achieving a net dimensionality increase when considering total feature map size.

Essentially, `MaxPool1D` operates by sliding a window across the input, selecting the maximum value within each window and creating a downsampled output. The output retains the input's number of channels but reduces the length of the sequence. A subsequent `Conv1D` layer applies convolutional filters across this reduced sequence length *and* across channels. The number of filters in a `Conv1D` layer dictates the number of output channels, which are the new, higher-dimensional representation of data.

Let's consider a scenario in time series analysis. Suppose you’re analyzing sensor data with a single channel, representing some physical quantity. If you feed this single-channel sequence into a `MaxPool1D` layer, you would reduce the sequence length but maintain a single channel. This could be useful, for example, in extracting dominant features that are robust to minor time shifts. Following this, you can pass the output to a `Conv1D` layer with a designated number of filters; each of these filters will generate a new channel, thus achieving an increase in the total size of the feature map. The output now has a reduced sequence length but multiple channels, where each channel can capture distinct relationships within the pooled data.

Here are a few concrete examples, employing Python using TensorFlow/Keras, to showcase this:

**Example 1: Basic Dimensionality Change**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPool1D, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Define the input shape as sequence length (20) and one channel.
input_shape = (20, 1)  
input_layer = Input(shape=input_shape)

# MaxPool1D with a pool size of 2 reduces sequence length
maxpool_layer = MaxPool1D(pool_size=2)(input_layer)

# Conv1D with 8 filters increases the channel dimension to 8.
conv_layer = Conv1D(filters=8, kernel_size=3, padding='same')(maxpool_layer)

model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=conv_layer)
model.summary()

# Sample input data
import numpy as np
sample_input = np.random.rand(1, 20, 1)
output = model.predict(sample_input)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}") # Output shape: (1, 10, 8)
```

In this example, the initial input data has shape `(1, 20, 1)` – a batch size of one, sequence length of 20, and one channel.  `MaxPool1D` with a pool size of 2 halves the sequence length to 10, maintaining the single channel; hence the output of `MaxPool1D` layer has shape `(1, 10, 1)`. The `Conv1D` layer, with 8 filters, produces 8 output channels while retaining the reduced sequence length and thus the output shape is `(1, 10, 8)`.  This clearly demonstrates an increase in overall feature map size: 20 elements in input vs. 80 elements in the output. Observe, that padding is used in the `Conv1D` layer, which in 'same' mode keeps the size of the temporal dimension constant (after the convolution).

**Example 2:  Increased Feature Complexity**

This example adds a second convolutional layer *after* the pool layer, showing how such an architecture can be stacked.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPool1D, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

input_shape = (50, 1)
input_layer = Input(shape=input_shape)

maxpool_layer = MaxPool1D(pool_size=5)(input_layer) # Sequence length reduced to 10

conv_layer1 = Conv1D(filters=4, kernel_size=3, padding='same')(maxpool_layer) # 4 channels

conv_layer2 = Conv1D(filters=16, kernel_size=3, padding='same')(conv_layer1) # 16 channels

model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=conv_layer2)
model.summary()

# Sample input data
import numpy as np
sample_input = np.random.rand(1, 50, 1)
output = model.predict(sample_input)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}") # Output shape: (1, 10, 16)
```

Here, a slightly larger input sequence of length 50 is used. The first max-pooling reduces the length to 10. The first `Conv1D` layer produces 4 channels, and the subsequent `Conv1D` layer increases the channels to 16. Note that while pooling reduces the length dimension, the `Conv1D` layers increase the feature dimensionality significantly.  The stacked `Conv1D` operations can learn complex patterns across the now-downsampled temporal axis.

**Example 3:  Adjusting Channel Size in Input.**

This final example shows how the technique scales when the input data itself has multiple channels, simulating a multi-sensor scenario.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPool1D, Input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

input_shape = (40, 3)  # 3 channels
input_layer = Input(shape=input_shape)

maxpool_layer = MaxPool1D(pool_size=4)(input_layer) # Sequence length reduced to 10, but maintains 3 channels

conv_layer = Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=3, padding='same')(maxpool_layer) # 32 channels

model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=conv_layer)
model.summary()

# Sample input data
import numpy as np
sample_input = np.random.rand(1, 40, 3)
output = model.predict(sample_input)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}") # Output shape: (1, 10, 32)
```

In this case, we begin with 3 input channels and a sequence length of 40. After the max-pooling operation, sequence length is reduced to 10, but the number of channels remains at 3. The `Conv1D` layer is then applied, and it generates 32 output channels. Again, while the spatial dimension is reduced by pooling, the feature dimensionality is increased by the convolutional operation, resulting in a higher overall feature map size.

These examples illustrate the core principle that `Conv1D` layers following `MaxPool1D` can increase the channel dimensionality. The max-pooling operation, used wisely, allows subsequent convolutional layers to operate more efficiently on a smaller sequence length, while also adding rich features via increased channel dimensions. This combination offers a balance between spatial compression and feature expansion.

For further learning, I'd recommend exploring literature on convolutional neural network architectures, especially those focused on temporal data processing. Studying the effects of different padding options in convolution operations will deepen the comprehension of temporal relationships. Additionally, researching different activation functions and the impact of batch normalization are highly recommended for those interested in working on these network structures. Consider examining case studies that apply these types of architectures to real-world time series problems. Finally, thoroughly reviewing the documentation for TensorFlow's Keras API will enable precise implementation and control of these layer types. These resources, when carefully studied, can help one navigate the nuances of building effective time series models.
