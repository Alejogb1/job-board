The most efficient method for dividing a Pandas DataFrame into three new DataFrames hinges on understanding the underlying data and the desired partitioning criteria.  While simple slicing might suffice for straightforward scenarios, more sophisticated approaches, such as employing Boolean indexing or custom functions, are often necessary for complex divisions.  My experience working with large datasets in financial modeling has highlighted the importance of choosing the right technique for optimal performance and maintainability.

**1.  Explanation of Partitioning Strategies**

Several strategies exist for partitioning a Pandas DataFrame into three distinct DataFrames. The optimal approach depends heavily on the basis for the division:

* **Equal Partitioning:**  If the goal is to divide the DataFrame into three roughly equal parts, the `len()` function and integer division can be used to determine the indices for slicing. This method is straightforward and computationally inexpensive, suitable when the data lacks inherent structure that dictates a more nuanced division.

* **Partitioning by Index or Column Values:**  Frequently, the division is based on specific values within a column or the DataFrame index.  Boolean indexing provides an elegant solution.  We can create Boolean masks based on conditions applied to a column, generating three separate masks to identify rows belonging to each of the three new DataFrames.  This method is versatile and handles complex partitioning criteria effectively.

* **Partitioning by Custom Function:** For intricate scenarios where the partitioning logic transcends simple comparisons, a custom function can be applied to each row, assigning it to one of three categories.  This function's output can then be used for Boolean indexing or as a new column that allows grouping and splitting. This approach is the most flexible but demands careful consideration of the function's design to ensure correctness and efficiency.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Equal Partitioning**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample DataFrame
data = {'A': np.random.rand(9), 'B': np.random.randint(0, 10, 9)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Determine partition sizes
n = len(df)
partition_size = n // 3

# Create three DataFrames
df1 = df[:partition_size]
df2 = df[partition_size:2 * partition_size]
df3 = df[2 * partition_size:]

#Verification (optional)
print(f"Length of df1: {len(df1)}")
print(f"Length of df2: {len(df2)}")
print(f"Length of df3: {len(df3)}")
```

This code demonstrates the simplest partitioning method.  It divides the DataFrame into three parts of (approximately) equal size using simple slicing.  The `//` operator ensures integer division, handling cases where the DataFrame length isn't perfectly divisible by three.  The optional verification step confirms the lengths of the resulting DataFrames.  Note that this approach assumes no specific ordering or grouping within the data is relevant.


**Example 2: Partitioning by Column Values**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
data = {'Category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'],
        'Value': np.random.rand(9)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Boolean indexing for partitioning
mask_A = df['Category'] == 'A'
mask_B = df['Category'] == 'B'
mask_C = df['Category'] == 'C'

df_A = df[mask_A]
df_B = df[mask_B]
df_C = df[mask_C]

#Verification (optional)
print(f"Number of rows in df_A: {len(df_A)}")
print(f"Number of rows in df_B: {len(df_B)}")
print(f"Number of rows in df_C: {len(df_C)}")
```

Here, we partition the DataFrame based on the values in the 'Category' column.  Boolean masks are created for each category ('A', 'B', 'C'), efficiently selecting the corresponding rows.  This approach is particularly useful when dealing with categorical data or when specific column values determine the desired partitions. The optional verification step counts rows in each resulting DataFrame.


**Example 3: Partitioning by Custom Function**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample DataFrame
data = {'Value': np.random.rand(9)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Custom function for partitioning
def categorize_value(value):
    if value < 0.33:
        return 'Low'
    elif value < 0.66:
        return 'Medium'
    else:
        return 'High'

# Apply the function and create a new column
df['Category'] = df['Value'].apply(categorize_value)

# Partition based on the new column
df_low = df[df['Category'] == 'Low']
df_medium = df[df['Category'] == 'Medium']
df_high = df[df['Category'] == 'High']

#Verification (optional)
print(f"Number of rows in df_low: {len(df_low)}")
print(f"Number of rows in df_medium: {len(df_medium)}")
print(f"Number of rows in df_high: {len(df_high)}")
```

This example demonstrates the use of a custom function (`categorize_value`) to assign each row to one of three categories ('Low', 'Medium', 'High') based on the 'Value' column. The function's output is used to create a new column ('Category'), which then enables Boolean indexing for partitioning. This approach is highly flexible, adapting to complex, data-specific partitioning logic.  The optional verification again provides a row count for each resulting DataFrame.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of Pandas DataFrames and efficient data manipulation techniques, I would recommend exploring the official Pandas documentation,  a comprehensive textbook on data analysis using Python, and a practical guide focused on data wrangling and cleaning.  These resources offer a wealth of information covering various aspects of DataFrame manipulation, including advanced indexing, data aggregation, and performance optimization strategies.  Furthermore, studying examples of efficient DataFrame manipulation in open-source projects will provide invaluable insights.
