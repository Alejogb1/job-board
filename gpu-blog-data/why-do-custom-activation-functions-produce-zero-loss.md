The observation of zero loss yet low accuracy with custom activation functions often stems from a subtle but crucial issue: the function's interaction with the gradient descent optimization process, specifically its effect on gradient vanishing or explosion, and its potential to create saturated regions within the activation landscape.  My experience debugging similar issues across several deep learning projects reinforces this understanding.  The problem isn't necessarily the function's inherent capacity to represent complex relationships, but rather its suitability for efficient training within the chosen optimization framework.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Zero training loss generally implies the model perfectly fits the training data.  However, this perfect fit might be achieved through mechanisms that hinder generalization. With custom activation functions, several factors can contribute to this phenomenon:

* **Gradient Vanishing/Exploding:**  Many custom activation functions lack the properties that ensure stable gradient propagation during backpropagation.  Functions with extremely flat or steep gradients in certain regions can lead to vanishing (near-zero gradients, preventing weight updates) or exploding (extremely large gradients, leading to instability) gradients. This hampers the model's ability to learn effectively from the training data. Consequently, the optimizer might settle into a local minimum representing a perfect fit for the training data but failing to capture the underlying data distribution.  The model, effectively memorizing the training set, will perform poorly on unseen data.

* **Saturation:**  Custom activation functions can introduce saturation regions, where small changes in the input produce minimal changes in the output.  This is especially problematic when combined with gradient-based optimization algorithms.  If a significant portion of the activation landscape falls within a saturated region, the gradients become very small or even zero, causing the optimization process to stall and prevent further learning, even if the initial loss is driven to zero.  The model learns nothing beyond this superficial fitting.

* **Non-monotonic Behavior:**  A non-monotonic activation function (one that doesn't consistently increase or decrease) can complicate the optimization landscape, making it challenging for gradient descent to find a global minimum.  Oscillations or unpredictable behavior within the function can lead to erratic weight updates, potentially trapping the optimizer in a suboptimal solution where the training loss is zero but the model lacks generalization ability.  This is amplified if the activation function's non-monotonicity is pronounced.

* **Numerical Instability:**  Poorly designed custom activation functions may introduce numerical instability during computation.  This could manifest as computational errors leading to spurious results, including a misleadingly low training loss.  Careful consideration of the function's numerical properties is critical to avoid such scenarios.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Activation function causing gradient vanishing:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def vanishing_activation(x):
  return tf.math.tanh(x**5) # High powers lead to very flat gradients for |x| < 1

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation=vanishing_activation),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ...training code...
```

**Commentary:** The `vanishing_activation` function uses a high power within the `tanh` function. For inputs with an absolute value less than 1, the gradient becomes extremely small, leading to vanishing gradients and hindering learning, despite potentially reaching a zero training loss.


**Example 2: Activation function with saturation:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def saturating_activation(x):
  return tf.math.sigmoid(10*x) #Steep sigmoid saturates quickly

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation=saturating_activation),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ...training code...
```

**Commentary:**  The `saturating_activation` function uses a steep sigmoid.  A large scaling factor (10x) pushes many inputs into the saturated regions of the sigmoid, limiting gradient magnitude and causing the optimization to stall prematurely, resulting in low accuracy despite a possible zero training loss.


**Example 3: Non-monotonic activation function:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def non_monotonic_activation(x):
  return tf.math.sin(x) # Oscillatory and non-monotonic

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation=non_monotonic_activation),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ...training code...
```

**Commentary:** The `non_monotonic_activation` function uses a sine function which oscillates. This non-monotonic behavior creates a complex and potentially difficult-to-navigate optimization landscape. The optimizer may get trapped in local minima where the training loss is low or zero, but the model fails to generalize.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of activation functions and their impact on optimization, I suggest consulting standard deep learning textbooks covering backpropagation and optimization algorithms.  Furthermore, exploring research papers on activation function design and their mathematical properties, particularly those focusing on gradient flow analysis, will significantly enhance your comprehension.  Finally, reviewing the documentation for various deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) regarding activation functions and optimization algorithms provides valuable insights into practical implementation details.  These resources, in conjunction with hands-on experimentation, will provide a comprehensive perspective on this topic.
