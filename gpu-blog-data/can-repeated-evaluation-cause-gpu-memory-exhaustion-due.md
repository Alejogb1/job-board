Repeated evaluation of large datasets on a GPU can indeed lead to memory exhaustion due to redundant data copying, a phenomenon I've encountered frequently in my work developing high-performance deep learning models.  The core issue stems from the inherent limitations of GPU memory bandwidth and the often-implicit data transfer operations performed during model training or inference.  While frameworks attempt optimization, careless data handling can easily overwhelm the available resources.

My experience working on large-scale image classification projects using TensorFlow and PyTorch highlighted this problem. In one instance, involving a dataset of several terabytes,  a seemingly minor oversight in data loading resulted in a significant performance bottleneck and ultimately, GPU OOM (Out Of Memory) errors.  The root cause was unintentional repeated copies of the dataset into GPU memory during each epoch of training.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The GPU, while powerful for parallel computation, possesses a finite memory capacity.  When processing large datasets, the efficient transfer of data from the system's main memory (RAM) to the GPU's VRAM is crucial.  Inefficient data handling leads to unnecessary copies of the same data, quickly filling the GPU's memory. This becomes particularly problematic during iterative processes like training neural networks, where the dataset might be accessed multiple times per epoch.

Several factors contribute to this problem:

* **Data Loading Strategies:** Improperly configured data loaders can repeatedly load the entire dataset into GPU memory during each iteration.  For example, loading the entire dataset into memory before each epoch without utilizing efficient batching mechanisms.
* **Framework Overheads:** Deep learning frameworks themselves can introduce hidden memory overheads.  Certain operations, if not carefully managed, can lead to the creation of intermediate tensors that consume substantial memory.  This is often exacerbated by eager execution modes, where computations are performed immediately rather than relying on graph optimization.
* **Model Architecture:** Complex models with many layers and large numbers of parameters inherently require more GPU memory.  When coupled with inefficient data handling, this can easily exceed the VRAM capacity.
* **Debugging Practices:**  Debugging practices involving repeated model evaluations or intermediate tensor inspections, without careful memory management, can also contribute to GPU memory exhaustion.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential pitfalls and best practices using PyTorch, highlighting the importance of proper data loading and memory management.

**Example 1: Inefficient Data Loading**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

# Assume 'dataset' is a large NumPy array representing the dataset.
dataset = np.random.rand(100000, 3, 256, 256)  # Example large dataset

for epoch in range(10):
    gpu_dataset = torch.tensor(dataset, device='cuda') # Repeated copying to GPU
    # ... training loop using gpu_dataset ...
```

This code suffers from repeated copying of the entire dataset to the GPU in each epoch.  This is highly inefficient and will quickly exhaust GPU memory for large datasets.


**Example 2: Efficient Data Loading with DataLoaders**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]

dataset = np.random.rand(100000, 3, 256, 256)
dataset = torch.tensor(dataset) # initial copy once
my_dataset = MyDataset(dataset)
dataloader = DataLoader(my_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True, pin_memory=True)


for epoch in range(10):
    for batch in dataloader:
        batch = batch.cuda(non_blocking=True) # transfer batches to GPU asynchronously
        # ... training loop using batch ...
```

This example demonstrates a more efficient approach using PyTorch's `DataLoader`.  It loads and transfers data in batches, significantly reducing memory consumption.  `pin_memory=True` helps optimize data transfer to the GPU, and `non_blocking=True` allows asynchronous transfer, avoiding blocking the main thread.


**Example 3:  Memory Management with `torch.no_grad()`**

```python
import torch

with torch.no_grad():
    # ... perform operations that don't require gradient calculations ...
```

During model evaluation, or any process not requiring gradient updates, using `torch.no_grad()` disables gradient tracking, freeing up GPU memory that would otherwise be used to store gradients. This is particularly helpful for large models or datasets.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend thoroughly reviewing the documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) regarding data loading best practices and memory management techniques.  Explore the concepts of automatic mixed precision training (AMP) to reduce memory usage. Familiarize yourself with profiling tools to identify memory bottlenecks in your code.  Finally, consult advanced resources on GPU memory optimization and parallel computing principles.  A strong understanding of these aspects is crucial for tackling large-scale machine learning tasks.
