The inherent architectural flexibility of the Transformer architecture, underpinning KerasNLP models, allows for the simultaneous execution of multiple downstream tasks from a single encoder.  This isn't a simple concatenation of independent models; rather, it involves leveraging the rich contextual embeddings generated by the shared encoder to produce outputs relevant to distinct tasks like Classification (CLS) and Masked Language Modeling (MLM).  My experience building large-scale language understanding systems for financial news sentiment analysis has highlighted the efficiency gains achievable through such a multi-output design.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Creating a multi-output KerasNLP model for CLS and MLM involves a shared encoder followed by task-specific decoder heads.  The encoder processes the input sequence, producing contextualized word embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into separate decoder heads: one designed for classification (CLS head) and the other for masked language modeling (MLM head).  The CLS head typically involves a classification layer (e.g., a dense layer with a softmax activation) to predict the class label, while the MLM head uses a dense layer to predict the probability distribution over the vocabulary for each masked token.

Crucially, the weights of the shared encoder are updated during training based on the loss functions of both the CLS and MLM tasks.  This allows the encoder to learn representations beneficial for both tasks, resulting in improved performance compared to training separate models.  The optimal strategy for weight sharing and loss function combination (e.g., weighted averaging) requires experimentation based on the dataset and specific task requirements.  In my past work, I found that employing a weighted average loss, with the weights adjusted based on the relative performance of each task during validation, offered the best results.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Multi-Output Model using `tf.keras.Model`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras_nlp.models import bert
from keras_nlp.layers import TransformerEncoder

# Define the shared encoder (BERT in this case)
encoder = bert.BertEncoder.from_preset("bert_base_uncased_en")

# Define the CLS head
cls_head = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation="relu"),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation="softmax")  # num_classes depends on your task
])

# Define the MLM head
mlm_head = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(encoder.vocabulary_size, activation="softmax")
])

# Create the multi-output model
inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(None,), dtype="int32")
encoder_output = encoder(inputs) # shape (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dimension)

# Extract the CLS token embedding for classification
cls_embedding = encoder_output[:, 0, :] #shape (batch_size, embedding_dimension)

# Pass the encoder output to the MLM head.  (Note: Masking needs to be handled appropriately)
mlm_output = mlm_head(encoder_output)

cls_output = cls_head(cls_embedding)


model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[cls_output, mlm_output])

# Compile the model with separate loss functions and weights
model.compile(
    loss={
        "cls_output": "categorical_crossentropy", #Or sparse_categorical_crossentropy depending on your labels
        "mlm_output": "sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
    },
    loss_weights={"cls_output": 0.5, "mlm_output": 0.5}, # Adjust weights as needed
    optimizer="adamw", #or any suitable optimizer
    metrics={"cls_output": "accuracy", "mlm_output": "accuracy"},
)
```

This example shows a straightforward implementation utilizing `tf.keras.Model` for defining the architecture.  The CLS head operates on the [CLS] token embedding (first token in the sequence), whereas the MLM head processes the entire encoder output.  Note that appropriate masking is crucial for MLM; this example omits the masking mechanism for brevity but is a critical element in a production-ready system.  The loss weights control the relative importance of each task during training.

**Example 2:  Utilizing Keras Functional API with Custom Layers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras_nlp.models import bert
from keras_nlp.layers import TransformerEncoder

# ... (Encoder definition as before) ...

class MLMPredictionLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation="softmax")

    def call(self, inputs, mask):
        #Apply masking here.  For example using tf.boolean_mask
        masked_inputs = tf.boolean_mask(inputs, mask)
        return self.dense(masked_inputs)

# ... (CLS head definition as before) ...

mlm_prediction_layer = MLMPredictionLayer(encoder.vocabulary_size)


# Functional API approach
inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(None,), dtype="int32")
encoder_output = encoder(inputs)
mask = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(None,), dtype="bool") #Input mask
cls_output = cls_head(encoder_output[:, 0, :])
mlm_output = mlm_prediction_layer(encoder_output, mask)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[inputs, mask], outputs=[cls_output, mlm_output])

# ... (Compilation as before) ...

```

This illustrates using the Keras functional API for better control, introducing a custom `MLMPredictionLayer` to explicitly handle the masking operation within the MLM head. This separation enhances readability and maintainability. Remember to generate the mask appropriately based on your data preprocessing.

**Example 3: Incorporating a Pre-trained MLM Head**


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from keras_nlp.models import bert
from keras_nlp.layers import TransformerEncoder

# ... (Encoder definition as before) ...
# ... (CLS head definition as before) ...

# Utilize pre-trained MLM head if available from KerasNLP or elsewhere.
# Assuming a pre-trained MLM head 'mlm_head_pretrained' exists.
# mlm_head_pretrained = ...

#Modify the pre-trained head if needed to match the encoder output dimension.
#For example adding a dense layer to match output dimensions.
# mlm_head_pretrained = tf.keras.Sequential([
#     mlm_head_pretrained,
#     tf.keras.layers.Dense(encoder.vocabulary_size, activation="softmax")
# ])


# Functional API approach with pre-trained MLM head
inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(None,), dtype="int32")
encoder_output = encoder(inputs)
mask = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(None,), dtype="bool")
cls_output = cls_head(encoder_output[:, 0, :])
mlm_output = mlm_head_pretrained(encoder_output, training=True) #Important to set training=True


model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[inputs, mask], outputs=[cls_output, mlm_output])

# ... (Compilation as before) ...

```

This example leverages a pre-trained MLM head, potentially reducing training time and improving performance.  Note the inclusion of `training=True` to ensure the pre-trained weights are updated during training.  Adapting the pre-trained head to match the output dimensions of the shared encoder might be necessary, often involving additional layers.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The KerasNLP documentation;  Textbooks on Deep Learning (Goodfellow et al.,  Aurélien Géron);  Research papers on Transformer architectures and multi-task learning.  Understanding the intricacies of masking techniques in MLM is paramount.  Explore different loss functions and optimization algorithms to fine-tune the model effectively.  Regularization techniques like dropout and weight decay should also be considered.
