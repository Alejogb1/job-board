TensorFlow's lack of explicit gradient functions for specific variables isn't due to a fundamental limitation within the framework; rather, it stems from its automatic differentiation mechanism.  My experience building and optimizing large-scale neural networks over the past five years has consistently reinforced this understanding. TensorFlow, unlike some symbolic differentiation libraries, leverages automatic differentiation through computational graphs, eliminating the need for manually specifying gradients for individual variables.

**1. Explanation of TensorFlow's Automatic Differentiation:**

TensorFlow's core strength lies in its ability to automatically compute gradients for any differentiable operation within a computational graph. When you define a TensorFlow model, you're implicitly constructing this graph, where nodes represent operations (e.g., matrix multiplication, activation functions) and edges represent data flow.  Crucially, each operation has a defined gradient function inherent to its nature.  For instance, the gradient of a matrix multiplication is readily available and efficiently computed.

The `tf.GradientTape` context manager plays a vital role in this process.  Within this context, TensorFlow records all operations performed on TensorFlow tensors.  When you call `tape.gradient()`, TensorFlow traverses the recorded computational graph backward, applying the chain rule of calculus to compute the gradients of your target output with respect to the variables used in the graph.  This process is entirely automatic; you don't explicitly define gradient functions for individual variables.  The framework automatically identifies dependencies and calculates the gradients accordingly.  This approach drastically simplifies model development and eliminates the error-prone task of manually deriving and implementing gradients, which is particularly challenging for complex models.

The absence of explicit gradient functions for individual variables therefore reflects a design decision aimed at efficiency, ease of use, and avoidance of redundancy.  Manually specifying gradients would be unnecessary overhead, potentially leading to inconsistencies and difficulties in maintaining code accuracy.  TensorFlow's automatic differentiation mechanism handles this implicitly and robustly.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the automatic gradient calculation in TensorFlow.  Note that in each case, we are never explicitly defining a gradient function for any specific variable.

**Example 1: Simple Linear Regression**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define variables
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1]), name='weight')
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name='bias')

# Define the model
def model(x):
  return W * x + b

# Define the loss function
def loss(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

# Define training data
x_train = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
y_train = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]])

# Training loop
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
epochs = 1000

for epoch in range(epochs):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x_train)
    current_loss = loss(y_train, y_pred)

  grads = tape.gradient(current_loss, [W, b])
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, [W, b]))
  if epoch % 100 == 0:
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {current_loss.numpy()}")

print(f"Final Weight: {W.numpy()}, Final Bias: {b.numpy()}")
```

This example demonstrates a simple linear regression model. The gradients for `W` and `b` are automatically computed by `tape.gradient()`. There's no need to provide any explicit gradient calculations.


**Example 2:  Multilayer Perceptron**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()

#Training loop (simplified for brevity)
for x_batch, y_batch in data:
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(x_batch)
        loss_value = loss_fn(y_batch, predictions)

    grads = tape.gradient(loss_value, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
```

Here, a multilayer perceptron is trained using Keras, which builds upon TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities. Again, gradient calculation is handled automatically for all the model's weights and biases.  Note the simplicity; the complexity of the gradients is entirely abstracted away.


**Example 3:  Custom Gradient Calculation (Illustrative)**

While typically unnecessary, you can override gradients for specific operations if needed.  This is primarily useful for custom operations or when dealing with non-differentiable functions where you can provide a suitable approximation. This is *not* specifying gradients per variable directly, but rather defining custom gradients for specific operations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.custom_gradient
def my_custom_op(x):
    y = tf.square(x)

    def grad(dy):
      return 2 * x * dy  # Custom gradient

    return y, grad

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  z = my_custom_op(x)

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(dz_dx) #Output: 4.0 (correctly computed)
```

This illustrates how to define a custom gradient for a custom operation (`my_custom_op`).  The gradient function within `my_custom_op` defines how the gradients propagate through this custom operation.  However, this is still managing gradients at the level of operations, not individual variables.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation is an invaluable resource, particularly the sections dedicated to automatic differentiation and `tf.GradientTape`.  Furthermore, exploring the Keras API will provide insights into higher-level abstractions that simplify the gradient calculation process.  Finally, a solid grasp of calculus, particularly the chain rule, is essential for a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms.  Advanced topics in optimization theory are relevant for fine-tuning training strategies.
