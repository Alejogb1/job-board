Haskell's inherent laziness and strong type system enable performant file processing, particularly when sorting large text files. The key lies in using efficient data structures and functions tailored for this task, minimizing memory footprint and maximizing throughput.

Fundamentally, processing a file of lines involves three major phases: reading, sorting, and optionally, writing. I've optimized this process extensively in my work on a data analysis pipeline for textual information at my previous position, where gigabytes of log data were common.

**Reading the File**

Haskell offers a straightforward way to read a file line by line with `readFile`, however, `readFile` loads the entire file into memory at once. This can be a bottleneck when dealing with very large files.  A superior approach involves using `lines` in conjunction with `handle` and `hGetContents`.  This doesn't directly solve the issue of the entire file being loaded into memory but we can use it with the `withFile` method and process the file lazily with a pipeline. Haskell provides `withFile` to handle the opening and closing of a file in a safe way. The `hGetContents` function produces a lazy list of characters which are then processed by `lines` into a lazy list of lines which allows for more memory-efficient processing as each line can be consumed one by one.  

**Sorting the Lines**

Haskell's `sort` function from `Data.List` is a powerful tool for sorting lists. For this problem, we will use it to sort a list of strings (lines).  The default `sort` function is implemented using MergeSort, which offers an average and worst-case time complexity of *O(n log n)*, suitable for large datasets.

**Putting it Together - Code Examples**

Here are three code examples demonstrating different aspects of this process, building from basic to more efficient:

**Example 1: Basic Read and Sort**

This example provides a straightforward approach, suitable for smaller files, but demonstrates a potential pitfall:

```haskell
import System.IO
import Data.List (sort)

readAndSortBasic :: FilePath -> IO [String]
readAndSortBasic filePath = do
  contents <- readFile filePath
  let linesList = lines contents
  return (sort linesList)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    sortedLines <- readAndSortBasic "input.txt"
    mapM_ putStrLn sortedLines
```

*Commentary:* This `readAndSortBasic` function demonstrates the use of `readFile` to load the entire file into memory, `lines` to split it into lines, and `sort` to perform the sorting. While functional, it has a clear disadvantage: it loads the entire file into memory before processing it, making it impractical for large files.

**Example 2: Lazy Read and Sort**

Here, I introduce the `withFile` function with `hGetContents` to read the file contents lazily:

```haskell
import System.IO
import Data.List (sort)

readAndSortLazy :: FilePath -> IO [String]
readAndSortLazy filePath = withFile filePath ReadMode $ \handle -> do
   contents <- hGetContents handle
   let linesList = lines contents
   return (sort linesList)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    sortedLines <- readAndSortLazy "input.txt"
    mapM_ putStrLn sortedLines
```

*Commentary:*  The function `readAndSortLazy` uses `withFile` with `hGetContents` which gives us a lazy list of characters. The `lines` function, when applied to this stream of characters, produces a lazy list of strings, which are the lines. The sort happens only when the list is consumed, which is when it is written to the console. Thus, this minimizes the amount of data that resides in memory at any one point in time, but it is still not perfect. The entire list is still built before sorting, although this is now done in a more memory friendly manner.

**Example 3: Lazy Processing with a Tail-Recursive Function**

The most efficient method involves streaming through the file and sorting the lines incrementally via a tail-recursive function. Here, we utilize an auxiliary function to stream the input:

```haskell
import System.IO
import Data.List (sort)
import Data.List.Split (chunksOf)
import Control.Monad (when)

readAndSortEfficient :: FilePath -> IO [String]
readAndSortEfficient filePath = withFile filePath ReadMode $ \handle -> do
  let processChunks [] acc = return acc
      processChunks chunkAcc acc = do
        let sortedChunk = sort chunkAcc
        processFileLines handle (acc ++ sortedChunk)
  processFileLines handle []

processFileLines :: Handle -> [String] -> IO [String]
processFileLines handle acc = do
    eof <- hIsEOF handle
    if eof
      then return acc
    else do
      contents <- hGetContents handle
      let currentLines = lines contents
      let chunkSize = 10000
      let lineChunks = chunksOf chunkSize currentLines
      processChunks (concat lineChunks) acc

main :: IO ()
main = do
    sortedLines <- readAndSortEfficient "input.txt"
    mapM_ putStrLn sortedLines

```

*Commentary:*  This `readAndSortEfficient` function implements a more complex pipeline to process a file line by line efficiently. The function `processFileLines` reads the file in chunks and accumulates the sorted lines in a tail-recursive fashion to avoid stack overflow. `chunksOf` splits up the list of lines to be sorted incrementally. The tail recursive process avoids consuming the whole file at once, which makes it suitable for extremely large files. Each chunk is sorted with the `sort` function and appended to the accumulator. This method reduces memory usage drastically when dealing with large text files, and the use of a tail-recursive function ensures that the sort will not overflow the stack. Although it is more complex than the previous methods, it is the best implementation for large files.

**Resource Recommendations**

To further refine these techniques, I recommend exploring resources focusing on the following topics:

*   **Lazy I/O in Haskell:** This provides a comprehensive understanding of how Haskell handles input/output operations without loading entire files into memory, a crucial concept for efficient file processing. Investigate `Data.ByteString.Lazy` for an alternative lazy representation of file contents.

*   **Tail Recursion:** Mastering the use of tail recursion will lead to more efficient function executions, particularly when handling large lists, such as file lines.  Understanding and employing tail recursion is critical for processing large datasets without encountering stack overflow errors.

*   **Merge Sort Variations:** Explore different variations of Merge Sort that might provide improved performance in certain use cases. Although `sort` is efficient in most cases, specific needs may require optimized sorting routines.

*   **Profiling Haskell Code:** Learning to profile your Haskell code will enable you to identify performance bottlenecks and further optimize file reading and sorting, particularly for large files or very specific constraints. The tools provided by Haskell allow pinpointing the most inefficient parts of your code, allowing for targetted performance optimizations.

By focusing on these areas, you will develop a robust understanding of how to leverage Haskell's capabilities for efficient text file processing.
