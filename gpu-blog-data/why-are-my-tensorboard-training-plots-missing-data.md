TensorBoard's failure to display complete training data in a Jupyter Notebook environment using TensorFlow/Keras frequently stems from inconsistencies in how the `tf.summary` logging mechanism interacts with the Keras training loop.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on large-scale image classification projects, and the root cause often lies in the improper placement or configuration of summary writers within the training process.  It's not always immediately apparent, as the training itself might proceed without errors, leaving the missing plot data as the sole indicator of a problem.

My experience suggests three primary reasons for incomplete TensorBoard visualizations:

1. **Incorrect Summary Writer Placement:**  The `tf.summary.scalar` calls must occur *inside* the training loop, typically within the `train_step` function or a similar structure that executes for each batch.  Placing them outside the loop, such as before or after the `model.fit` call, leads to only a single data point being logged, representing the final state.  Furthermore, ensuring the writer is properly associated with the correct training epoch or step is crucial for accurate visualization.

2. **Mismatched Step Counts:**  TensorBoard relies on a monotonically increasing step counter to accurately plot data over time.  If your step counter is reset, jumps inconsistently, or doesn't reflect the actual number of training steps, TensorBoard will struggle to represent the data correctly, leading to gaps or missing values in the plots.  This often occurs when using custom training loops or when modifying the default step counting behavior of `model.fit`.

3. **Buffering and Flushing Issues:** TensorBoard operates asynchronously. The data written to the summary writer might not immediately be flushed to disk.  If the Jupyter Notebook kernel is terminated prematurely or the logging process encounters errors, the buffered data might be lost, resulting in incomplete plots.  Explicitly flushing the writer at intervals can mitigate this risk.

Let's examine these issues with code examples.  Assume we're training a simple sequential model for MNIST digit classification.

**Example 1: Correct Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... (Data loading and model definition) ...

log_dir = "logs/fit/"
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

def train_step(images, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(images)
        loss = loss_function(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    with summary_writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=optimizer.iterations)
        tf.summary.scalar('accuracy', accuracy_metric(labels, predictions), step=optimizer.iterations)

epochs = 10
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for images, labels in dataset:
        train_step(images, labels)
    #Optional: Add epoch-level summaries here for overall metrics
    #with summary_writer.as_default():
    #    tf.summary.scalar('epoch_loss', epoch_loss, step=epoch)

print("Training complete. Run `tensorboard --logdir logs/fit` to visualize the results.")
```

This example demonstrates correct placement of `tf.summary.scalar` calls within the `train_step` function. The `optimizer.iterations` counter ensures a continuous step count.  Note the optional epoch-level summary commented out; its inclusion depends on the specific metric tracking strategy.


**Example 2: Incorrect Placement Leading to Missing Data**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# ... (Data loading and model definition) ...

log_dir = "logs/fit/"
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

# Incorrect placement â€“ outside the training loop
with summary_writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.scalar('loss', 0, step=0) #Only one data point will be logged


model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir)])

print("Training complete. Run `tensorboard --logdir logs/fit` to visualize the results.")
```

Here, the summary is written only once before the training loop, resulting in incomplete plots. Although the TensorBoard callback might appear to function, it might only log some metrics and not others leading to selective data loss in TensorBoard.


**Example 3:  Illustrating Step Count Issues**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# ... (Data loading and model definition) ...

log_dir = "logs/fit/"
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

step_counter = 0  #Incorrectly managed counter
for epoch in range(10):
    for images, labels in dataset:
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(images)
            loss = loss_function(labels, predictions)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

        with summary_writer.as_default():
            tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=step_counter) #Inconsistent step counts
            step_counter += 1 #Potentially inconsistent increment based on dataset loop
            #Adding a sleep here, or random step jumps could cause unpredictable visualizations

print("Training complete. Run `tensorboard --logdir logs/fit` to visualize the results.")
```

This example uses a manually managed `step_counter`.  If the loop iterates unevenly or there are unexpected exceptions, the `step_counter` might not accurately reflect the training progress, causing inconsistencies in TensorBoard.  Relying on the optimizer's internal step counter is generally safer and more robust.


**Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend thoroughly reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.summary` and the Keras `TensorBoard` callback.  Consult advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on custom training loops and visualizations.  Finally, examining example code repositories for complex model training pipelines can be highly beneficial for understanding best practices.  These resources will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the intricacies of TensorBoard integration.  Debugging such issues often requires carefully examining the training loop's structure and the logging mechanisms used.  Systematic exploration of the logging outputs and manual inspection of the generated TensorBoard files can help identify the specific reasons for missing data.
