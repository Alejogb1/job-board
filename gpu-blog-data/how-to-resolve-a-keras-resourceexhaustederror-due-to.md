The `ResourceExhaustedError` in Keras, especially when dealing with tensors of the size you've described (shape `[26671, 32, 32, 64]`), directly indicates that the available memory, either on your GPU or system RAM, cannot accommodate the requested allocation. This specific tensor requires a significant contiguous memory block to store the floating-point values represented by its elements. The sheer number of elements (26671 * 32 * 32 * 64 = roughly 1.7 billion) multiplied by the memory footprint per element (typically 4 bytes for single-precision floats) explains the error. I've encountered this repeatedly working on high-resolution image datasets for my convolutional network experiments.

The core problem stems from attempting to load, process, or generate tensors that exceed the memory limits. Resolution isn't a one-size-fits-all solution; it requires a layered approach. First, meticulously investigate *where* the offending tensor is generated. Often, it is located during the batch loading of training data or within layers that generate large intermediary outputs. If the tensor represents an entire training set, the most immediate and effective solution involves reducing the memory footprint required for processing at any given time, most commonly achieved using batching strategies. This requires modifying how the data is loaded and fed into the model.

Secondly, if the memory pressure exists *within* the model architecture, then the layer configuration must be addressed. This may require compromises in model capacity or specific layer types to reduce the total number of parameters being computed. A model with too many filters or overly complex dense layers can easily generate large tensors, especially during backpropagation. For example, activation maps for certain CNN layers can be very substantial before pooling operations.

Thirdly, sometimes neither batching nor model modification will be sufficient and the underlying data itself may need to be pre-processed to reduce its inherent memory demands. Techniques such as data downsampling or feature selection are viable. For instance, if the input consists of 32x32 images, reducing these to 16x16 could provide a four-fold reduction in memory usage. However, this must be weighed carefully against any potential impact on model accuracy.

Let's explore these approaches through code examples. First, assuming the tensor is generated during data loading within your model's training loop:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume you have a large dataset as a numpy array, too large to fit in memory
# For illustration, we will simulate a large dataset.
def create_simulated_dataset(num_samples, image_height, image_width, channels):
  data = np.random.rand(num_samples, image_height, image_width, channels).astype(np.float32)
  labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(num_samples,))
  return data, labels

# Simulated Large Dataset
num_samples = 26671
image_height = 32
image_width = 32
channels = 64
data, labels = create_simulated_dataset(num_samples, image_height, image_width, channels)

# Original Code (Likely causes the error)
# train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
# This loads all data into memory, resulting in a large tensor
# This line needs to be changed

# Solution: Batch the data
batch_size = 32
train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels)) \
    .batch(batch_size)

# Now the dataset provides batches of size 32, reducing memory pressure.

# Model Training Loop Example:
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(image_height, image_width, channels)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fit the model using the batched dataset
model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=10)
```

In this example, instead of loading all data into memory using `from_tensor_slices` directly (which leads to the `ResourceExhaustedError`), the dataset is now loaded using `batch(batch_size)`. This ensures the model receives a manageable chunk of data during each step of the training process. The batch size should be chosen carefully; very small batches can lead to noisy gradient estimates, while very large batches may still exceed memory capacity. Experimentation is often necessary.

Next, if the issue lies within the model's layer configuration, consider simplifying the model architecture:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example Model (may cause issues)
# model = tf.keras.Sequential([
#     tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 64)), # Too many filters here
#     tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
#     tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(256, (3, 3), activation='relu'), # Again, too many filters
#     tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
#     tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
#     tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'), # Dense layer size may be problematic
#     tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
# ])

# Solution: Reduced Complexity Model

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 64)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])


model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Using the batched dataset from the previous example
model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=10)
```

The commented-out section shows a potentially problematic network with many filters in its convolutional layers and a large dense layer. By reducing the filter sizes (e.g. from 128 to 32, 256 to 64) and the size of the dense layer (e.g. from 256 to 128), we significantly reduce the memory used by activation tensors. Carefully analyze your model architecture to pinpoint potential bottlenecks where excessive tensors are being created. Itâ€™s crucial to strike a balance between model capacity and computational cost.

Finally, as a last resort, consider reducing data dimensionality or sample size:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Dataset and model from the first example

# Simulated Large Dataset
num_samples = 26671
image_height = 32
image_width = 32
channels = 64

# Original data, assumed to be the result of some preprocessing or data loading
data, labels = create_simulated_dataset(num_samples, image_height, image_width, channels)

# Example Downsampling using numpy
# For demonstration, this is a very basic downsample function
def downsample_data(data, new_height, new_width):
    # Using a simple average. More advanced methods exist.
    resized = np.zeros((data.shape[0], new_height, new_width, data.shape[3]), dtype=np.float32)
    for i in range(data.shape[0]):
        resized[i] = tf.image.resize(data[i], [new_height, new_width]).numpy()
    return resized

# Downsample the data to reduce image dimensions
new_height = 16
new_width = 16
downsampled_data = downsample_data(data, new_height, new_width)

# New shape of downsampled data
print(downsampled_data.shape)

# Create TF Dataset with reduced images.
batch_size = 32
train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((downsampled_data, labels)) \
    .batch(batch_size)

# Model architecture should use the new input shape of (16, 16, 64)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(new_height, new_width, channels)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_dataset, epochs=10)
```
In this instance, the data is resized using a `downsample_data` function. While this example utilizes a simple resizing function, in practice you would often need to employ methods appropriate for the data type, such as pooling or more complex interpolation techniques. This is often a necessary trade-off when resources are limited; the image data is reduced in size, thereby also reducing the memory footprint it requires. The model will also need to be adjusted to reflect the reduced input dimensions.

For further understanding, research the following topics: "TensorFlow Dataset API" for optimized data loading, "Model Profiling tools in TensorFlow" for identifying memory bottlenecks during training, and "Deep learning model optimization strategies" for techniques on reducing the memory footprint of deep neural networks. It's vital to understand how the memory utilization is changing as data is loaded and as the model is training, and each of the strategies we've covered can address these issues.
