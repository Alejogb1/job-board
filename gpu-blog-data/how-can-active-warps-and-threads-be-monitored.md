Understanding the precise execution dynamics of a CUDA kernel, particularly with divergent control flow, requires careful monitoring of warp and thread activity. A straightforward global counter isn’t sufficient because it lacks granularity. I’ve seen this complexity firsthand while optimizing a large-scale particle simulation, where seemingly minor variations in input parameters led to significant performance fluctuations due to uneven workload distribution across warps. Simply profiling overall kernel time didn’t provide the insights needed to effectively debug bottlenecks. The core issue is that within a kernel, individual threads within a warp can diverge, executing different instruction paths due to conditional statements. This divergence impacts performance since the hardware typically executes instructions in a lockstep fashion within a warp; when divergence occurs, the warp’s execution is serialized or masked, causing some threads to idle while others proceed. Monitoring this behavior requires a methodology that tracks which threads and warps are active at any given point within the kernel’s execution.

One effective approach is to utilize shared memory and atomic operations to construct a histogram of thread activity. Instead of merely counting total execution time, this method counts, within each warp, which threads executed a particular code branch. This provides the necessary per-warp insight. We establish a shared memory region accessible by all threads within a block to hold the histogram data. Each bin of this histogram would correspond to a specific execution path or condition within the kernel. Then, within the conditional code blocks, threads use atomic operations (such as `atomicAdd`) to increment the appropriate histogram bin based on their active path. This results in a per-warp, per-condition, summary of which threads actually followed that condition.

Consider a kernel containing a branching construct based on thread ID:

```c++
__global__ void divergentKernel(int *output, int numElements) {
  extern __shared__ int histogram[];
  int tid = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;

  if (tid < numElements) {
    // Initialize Histogram
    if (threadIdx.x == 0){
      for(int i = 0; i < 2; ++i){
        histogram[i] = 0;
      }
    }
    __syncthreads();
    
    if (tid % 2 == 0) {
        atomicAdd(&histogram[0],1); // Even thread path
      output[tid] = tid * 2;
    } else {
       atomicAdd(&histogram[1],1); // Odd thread path
      output[tid] = tid + 100;
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, `histogram` is declared as shared memory, and two histogram bins are allocated within each block. Before any path execution, a thread zero initializes the entire shared memory region. The `__syncthreads()` barrier prevents the subsequent conditional path execution from starting before all histogram locations are cleared. Finally, each thread adds its presence to the respective histogram bin based on whether its thread ID is even or odd. After the kernel execution, the host retrieves the histogram, allowing observation of how many threads followed each path. This example demonstrates a basic form of path tracking; in a practical scenario, you would use more bins to distinguish more conditional code paths. Note that the size of `histogram` should be computed according to the maximum possible number of bins.

A more complex scenario might involve conditional paths within loops, or based on input data. The tracking mechanism remains the same; each conditional branch is associated with a histogram bin, and threads increment these bins as they execute. The following kernel illustrates how this histogram tracking can be integrated into a loop:

```c++
__global__ void loopedDivergentKernel(int *input, int *output, int numElements) {
  extern __shared__ int histogram[];
  int tid = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;

    if (tid < numElements) {
    // Initialize Histogram
    if (threadIdx.x == 0){
      for(int i = 0; i < 3; ++i){
        histogram[i] = 0;
      }
    }
    __syncthreads();

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
      if (input[tid] > i) {
        atomicAdd(&histogram[0], 1); // Input greater than loop counter
        output[tid] += i;
      }
        else if (input[tid] == i)
        {
          atomicAdd(&histogram[1],1); // Input equal to loop counter
          output[tid] -= i;
        }
      else{
           atomicAdd(&histogram[2],1); // Input less than loop counter
          output[tid] = 0;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here, each iteration of the loop contains a conditional block using the input data at the current thread index. This leads to different execution paths. A three-bin histogram is used to track whether `input[tid]` is greater than, equal to, or less than the loop counter (`i`). This mechanism gives insight into the spread of data and reveals potential workload imbalances across the different threads.

Furthermore, the same histogram approach can also be adapted to track warp-level activity, although it requires careful consideration of data coalescing and atomic operations. Instead of each thread contributing directly to a histogram, an intermediate stage, potentially within shared memory, can be used where each warp aggregates thread-level information, before committing it to a global histogram. However, this adds a layer of complexity. The following, slightly more abstract, example introduces a simplified version of warp-level analysis, by reducing thread level operations and concentrating on per-warp activity within a simple condition:

```c++
__global__ void warpActivityKernel(int *output, int numElements){
    extern __shared__ int histogram[];
    int tid = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    int warpId = tid / warpSize; // Warp identifier


    if(tid < numElements){
        if(threadIdx.x == 0){
          for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
            histogram[i] = 0;
          }
        }
        __syncthreads();

        if(warpId % 2 == 0)
        {
          if(threadIdx.x == 0){
           atomicAdd(&histogram[0], 1); //Even Warp path
          }
          output[tid] = tid * 2;

        }
         else{
          if(threadIdx.x == 0){
            atomicAdd(&histogram[1], 1); // Odd Warp path
          }
            output[tid] = tid + 100;
        }

    }
}
```

Here the `warpId` is calculated from the thread identifier. Each warp only has one thread (thread 0) that performs an atomic operation, effectively only registering the activity of the entire warp based on its ID. While this simplifies the process, it does lose per-thread granularity within the warp, so the approach must be adjusted according to the specific analytical need. This simplification provides some basic insight into how often a given warp executes a branch of code, although it does not show individual thread activity.

After each kernel run, retrieving the data from global memory will give a detailed picture of the execution profile. The collected histogram values can then be used to identify areas of significant divergence and potential bottlenecks. For instance, if a particular branch has very few increments, it might indicate that threads are predominantly executing other branches, suggesting a potential for optimization or adjustment of workload distribution.

For more advanced monitoring techniques and related background information, I would recommend examining resources focusing on CUDA performance optimization. These often include examples of utilizing the CUDA profiler (NVIDIA Nsight) for detailed hardware-level analysis, which can complement the code-level analysis presented here. Documentation from NVIDIA, focusing specifically on CUDA shared memory, atomics and warp execution characteristics is also crucial. Finally, articles and books on parallel programming, particularly those addressing performance aspects of GPGPU computing, can offer additional theoretical and practical insights into this topic.
