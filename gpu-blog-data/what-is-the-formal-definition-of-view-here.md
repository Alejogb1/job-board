The concept of a "view," within the context of a relational database system, is frequently misunderstood, leading to inefficiencies and design flaws.  My experience working on large-scale data warehousing projects for over a decade has consistently highlighted the importance of precisely defining and implementing views. A view is not simply a saved query, as many newcomers assume; instead, it's a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. This result-set is dynamically generated each time the view is accessed, thereby presenting a customized perspective of underlying base tables without actually storing the data independently.  This distinction is crucial for understanding its strengths and limitations.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Formally, a view is a stored query that materializes as a virtual table. This virtual table does not exist physically; its data is derived on demand from one or more underlying base tables (or other views). The SQL statement defining the view, often referred to as the view definition, specifies which columns and rows from the base tables are included in the view's result-set.  Crucially,  the view definition can include `WHERE` clauses to filter rows, `JOIN` clauses to combine data from multiple tables, and functions to transform data.  This allows for creating customized perspectives of the data, tailored to specific user needs or application requirements.

Several key characteristics differentiate views from materialized views or simply saved queries.  First,  a view does not store data independently.  Modifications to the underlying base tables immediately affect the view, reflecting the changes in real-time (unless explicit constraints, such as `INSTEAD OF` triggers, are implemented). Second, the view definition remains stored within the database's metadata;  it's not simply a user-saved query stored in a file or application. Third, views can be used in SQL queries just like base tables, allowing for a high degree of flexibility and data abstraction.

However, views also possess limitations. Complex views, especially those involving multiple joins or subqueries, can lead to performance bottlenecks if not carefully designed and indexed.  Furthermore,  certain SQL operations, such as `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE`, may not be directly applicable to all views;  depending on the view definition and the underlying database system's capabilities, specific restrictions may apply.  This is where the concept of `INSTEAD OF` triggers becomes important, allowing developers to override the default behavior and define custom actions for data manipulation within the view.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's illustrate these concepts with examples using standard SQL syntax.  Assume we have two base tables: `Customers` and `Orders`.

**Example 1: Simple View**

```sql
CREATE VIEW HighValueCustomers AS
SELECT customerID, customerName, totalSpent
FROM Customers
WHERE totalSpent > 1000;
```

This creates a view named `HighValueCustomers` containing only customers with `totalSpent` exceeding 1000.  The data is dynamically generated from the `Customers` table each time the view is accessed.  This is a simple example showcasing how a view can filter data.  The view inherits the data types and constraints of the underlying table.

**Example 2: View with Join**

```sql
CREATE VIEW CustomerOrderSummary AS
SELECT c.customerID, c.customerName, o.orderID, o.orderDate
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.customerID = o.customerID;
```

This view combines data from `Customers` and `Orders` tables using an `INNER JOIN`.  It provides a summary of customer orders, linking each customer to their respective orders.  This demonstrates how views can integrate data from multiple sources.  Observe the use of aliases (`c` and `o`) to improve readability and avoid ambiguity.

**Example 3: View with Calculated Column and `INSTEAD OF` Trigger (Illustrative)**

```sql
CREATE VIEW OrderTotals AS
SELECT orderID, orderDate, SUM(itemPrice * itemQuantity) AS totalOrderValue
FROM OrderItems
GROUP BY orderID, orderDate;

-- Simplified representation - actual implementation varies by database system
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER update_order_totals
INSTEAD OF UPDATE ON OrderTotals
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE OrderItems
  SET itemPrice = :NEW.itemPrice, itemQuantity = :NEW.itemQuantity
  WHERE orderID = :NEW.orderID;
END;
/
```

This example showcases a view (`OrderTotals`) calculating the `totalOrderValue` for each order. The `INSTEAD OF` trigger demonstrates how to manage updates to the view. Instead of directly updating the `OrderTotals` view (which is generally not allowed for views that include aggregate functions), we update the underlying `OrderItems` table which subsequently updates the `OrderTotals` view.  Note: This is a simplified illustrative trigger; actual implementation details and error handling would be significantly more complex in a production environment.  The exact syntax and behavior of triggers vary across different database systems (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I suggest consulting the official documentation for your specific database management system (DBMS). The documentation provides detailed explanations of view creation, usage, limitations, and advanced features like materialized views and `INSTEAD OF` triggers. Additionally, a good intermediate-level SQL textbook will provide a strong foundation in database design principles, including the effective use of views in query optimization and data abstraction.  Finally, exploring SQL style guides and best practices will further enhance your understanding of proper view implementation and management within a broader development context.
