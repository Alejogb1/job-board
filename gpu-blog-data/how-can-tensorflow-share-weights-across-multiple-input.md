Weight sharing in TensorFlow across multiple input placeholders is fundamentally achieved through the careful structuring of the computational graph and the reuse of the same TensorFlow `Variable` objects.  My experience building large-scale recommendation systems taught me that inefficient weight sharing leads to significant performance bottlenecks, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional input spaces.  Properly implemented weight sharing, however, dramatically reduces model complexity and improves training efficiency.

The core concept revolves around defining weight matrices or tensors *once* and then repeatedly using them within different branches of the computational graph that correspond to your multiple input placeholders.  Each input placeholder feeds into a section of the network that utilizes these pre-defined weights.  This differs from simply creating separate weight matrices for each input; that approach would defeat the purpose of weight sharing and lead to a drastically larger model with more parameters to train.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The key is leveraging the `tf.compat.v1.get_variable` function (or its equivalent in newer TensorFlow versions).  This function allows you to retrieve a variable from the graph. If a variable with the specified name already exists, it's retrieved; otherwise, a new one is created.  This is crucial for weight sharing.  By using the same name for the weight variable across multiple branches of your graph, you ensure that all branches are operating on the same underlying weight matrix.  The graph structure ensures the shared weights are updated during backpropagation based on the combined effect from all inputs. This is distinct from simple variable assignment, which would create separate, independent copies.  Consider the scenario of processing multiple image channels concurrently: you might want to share convolutional filters across those channels, reducing the total number of parameters and promoting feature extraction consistency.

This process is often associated with convolutional layers, but the principle applies equally to densely connected layers or other network architectures.  The critical aspect is that the shared weights act as a common learned representation across different input streams, enabling efficient learning from diverse data sources and mitigating overfitting by reducing model complexity.  The overall efficiency gain is significant, especially when dealing with many input streams or large feature spaces.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Weight Sharing in Dense Layers:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define input placeholders
input1 = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10])
input2 = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10])

# Define shared weights
W = tf.compat.v1.get_variable("shared_weights", shape=[10, 5], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer())
b = tf.compat.v1.get_variable("shared_biases", shape=[5], initializer=tf.zeros_initializer())

# Define operations for each input
output1 = tf.matmul(input1, W) + b
output2 = tf.matmul(input2, W) + b

# Define loss function and optimizer (example)
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(output1 - output2))  # Example loss; replace as needed
optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01).minimize(loss)

# ... (rest of the TensorFlow session setup and training loop)
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates the core principle. `tf.compat.v1.get_variable` ensures that `W` and `b` are shared between the two branches processing `input1` and `input2`.  Both branches use the same weights for their respective matrix multiplications.  The loss function is illustrative; a suitable loss function should be selected based on the specific problem.

**Example 2: Weight Sharing in a Convolutional Layer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define input placeholders (e.g., for two image channels)
input1 = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 28, 28, 1]) # 28x28 grayscale image
input2 = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 28, 28, 1])

# Define shared convolutional weights
conv_weights = tf.compat.v1.get_variable("conv_weights", shape=[3, 3, 1, 32], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer()) # 3x3 kernel, 1 input channel, 32 output channels

# Apply convolution to each input
conv1 = tf.nn.conv2d(input1, conv_weights, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')
conv2 = tf.nn.conv2d(input2, conv_weights, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')

# ... (rest of the convolutional network, pooling, etc.)
```

**Commentary:** This showcases weight sharing in a convolutional neural network (CNN).  The same `conv_weights` are applied to both `input1` and `input2`.  This is a standard technique for efficient feature extraction across multiple input channels.  Note the shape of `conv_weights`:  `[kernel_height, kernel_width, input_channels, output_channels]`.

**Example 3:  More Complex Scenario with Conditional Weight Sharing:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define input placeholders and a control variable
input_a = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10])
input_b = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10])
use_shared_weights = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.bool)

# Define shared weights
shared_weights = tf.compat.v1.get_variable("shared_weights", shape=[10, 5], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer())

# Conditional weight usage
weights_a = tf.cond(use_shared_weights, lambda: shared_weights, lambda: tf.compat.v1.get_variable("weights_a", shape=[10,5], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer()))
weights_b = tf.cond(use_shared_weights, lambda: shared_weights, lambda: tf.compat.v1.get_variable("weights_b", shape=[10,5], initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer()))

# Define operations using conditional weights
output_a = tf.matmul(input_a, weights_a)
output_b = tf.matmul(input_b, weights_b)

# ... (rest of the model)
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates conditional weight sharing.  The boolean placeholder `use_shared_weights` controls whether the shared weights are used or if separate weights are created for each branch.  This allows for flexible model architectures where weight sharing can be dynamically enabled or disabled during training or inference.  This flexibility is crucial in situations requiring adaptive model behavior.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, covering neural network architectures and TensorFlow implementation details.  Research papers on weight sharing techniques in various neural network architectures, focusing on convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.  These resources will provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical principles and advanced applications of weight sharing.  Practical experience building and training models is invaluable for mastering these techniques.
