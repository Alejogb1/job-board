TensorFlow 2.3's inability to directly compile a `tf.keras.Sequential` model when using a `tf.distribute.Strategy` such as `MirroredStrategy`, stems from the way the framework handles variable creation and assignment within a distributed training environment. The core issue lies in the strategy's need to manage model replicas and their associated variables, something that implicit construction within a `Sequential` model bypasses when not explicitly scoped by the strategy's context. This behavior is by design and emphasizes the imperative to explicitly define model building and variable creation when operating in a distributed setting.

The challenge begins with `tf.keras.Sequential`. When you define layers sequentially, Keras automatically initializes layer weights and biases during the construction phase. This initialization happens outside the explicit control of the chosen distribution strategy’s scope. In other words, the model’s variables are created on the default, single-device context, not replicated across the available devices when a distribution strategy is in place. Therefore, when the model is then used within the strategy's `scope` for training, it finds that the variables are not appropriately distributed.

The strategy's `scope` is designed to enforce distributed variable creation. All variable creation should happen inside the strategy's context because it dictates how and where the variables are located. When training with MirroredStrategy, variables should be replicated across all devices, allowing for parallel computations. A standard `Sequential` model bypasses this scope requirement leading to mismatched variable locations. This incompatibility makes the `model.compile()` call fail, due to the inability to synchronize gradients and variables across devices.

Specifically, during compilation, TensorFlow performs several checks to prepare the model for distributed execution. This process ensures that input data distribution, variable synchronization, and gradient aggregation are properly handled. However, when a Sequential model is constructed outside the strategy scope, its variables reside on the default device, while the strategy expects replicated variables on the associated devices. The compilation phase relies on this replicated structure, making it unable to complete without properly placed variables.

To solve this, I've consistently found that models must be constructed and compiled within the strategy's scope if you want them to operate within a distributed environment. This explicit control ensures that variables are replicated correctly when using strategies such as `MirroredStrategy`, `TPUStrategy`, or `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`. By construction inside a scope the strategy can properly manage the allocation of model variables.

Let's consider three code examples to demonstrate this. The first will showcase the failure case, and the subsequent two will show the correct application.

**Code Example 1: Failure Case (Sequential outside the strategy's scope)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()
metrics = ['accuracy']

# The below line will error because model is not built in the strategy scope
try:
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss, metrics=metrics)
    print("Model compiled successfully (This should not print).") # This will not be printed
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during compilation: {e}") # Prints a Variable Error
```

In this example, the `Sequential` model is instantiated outside the strategy's context. This leads to an exception during compilation. The error message is typically related to mismatched variables or devices, indicating that the strategy was unable to reconcile model variables with its distributed setting. It highlights the critical distinction between how the model is built and the strategy's expectation for where model components are located, thereby preventing the model from properly compiling. The variable creation, happening during the construction of the `Sequential` model is not placed within the replicated architecture.

**Code Example 2: Correct Application (Model defined within strategy's scope)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

def create_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    return model

with strategy.scope():
    model = create_model()
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
    loss = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()
    metrics = ['accuracy']
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss, metrics=metrics)

print("Model compiled successfully.") # This will be printed
```

This revised code places model construction inside the strategy's context via the `with strategy.scope():` block. Consequently, variable creation and assignment are now managed by the strategy, ensuring replication across available devices. The `create_model` function allows for the consistent creation of models within scope without repeated `tf.keras.Sequential` declarations. Crucially, the `model.compile` line is placed within the strategy scope as well ensuring variables are properly assigned to the correct device set. This allows the program to compile without error.

**Code Example 3: Correct Application (Using a Custom Model Class)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

class CustomModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)

with strategy.scope():
    model = CustomModel()
    model.build(input_shape=(None, 100))
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
    loss = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()
    metrics = ['accuracy']
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss, metrics=metrics)
print("Custom Model compiled successfully.") # This will be printed
```

This third example illustrates an alternative approach using a custom model class inheriting from `tf.keras.Model`. Instead of using `Sequential`, we explicitly define layers in `__init__` and pass data through these layers in the `call` function. The model construction using a custom class still happens within the strategy’s scope to manage distribution. In this case, `.build(input_shape=(None, 100))` needs to be called, so that the variables are instantiated in the appropriate scope. This is needed due to the non-eager nature of inheriting from `tf.keras.Model`. This allows the framework to correctly compile within the strategy. Using custom models gives even finer control of a model's construction but also requires some additional steps.

In summary, the inability to directly compile a `tf.keras.Sequential` model outside a distribution strategy's scope is not a bug but rather a fundamental design choice in TensorFlow 2.x. It enforces explicit variable management for distributed training by making the variable instantiation explicit within the strategy's scope. It's a crucial element of ensuring proper replication and synchronization during parallel computations when training on multiple devices. The error serves as a strong indicator that the distributed model creation procedure requires adjustments.

For further learning, consult TensorFlow's official documentation on distributed training. Deep learning textbooks that cover distributed architectures and model design in frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch can be also be helpful. Research papers focused on parallel computing and model optimization can also be informative for a deep dive into underlying theory.
