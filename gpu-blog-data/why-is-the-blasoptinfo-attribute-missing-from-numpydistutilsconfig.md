The absence of the `blas_opt_info` attribute within `numpy.distutils.__config__` stems from a fundamental shift in how NumPy handles its BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package) linkages, particularly since version 1.20. Prior to this, NumPy’s build system often relied on a direct discovery and storage of specific BLAS/LAPACK library details via the distutils mechanism, attempting to encapsulate this information within the `__config__` module. This approach proved brittle and increasingly inadequate as systems diversified and optimized BLAS implementations proliferated.

The key issue was the inherent difficulty in reliably identifying and specifying the optimal BLAS implementation across all build environments. The old approach attempted to hardcode a mapping, often leading to build failures or the selection of suboptimal libraries. Moreover, the information stored in `blas_opt_info` was primarily relevant *during* compilation, not at runtime. Users rarely, if ever, needed to inspect which BLAS library was linked; what mattered was that linear algebra operations executed efficiently.

NumPy’s move towards more flexible, runtime-based BLAS selection is driven by libraries such as `OpenBLAS` and `Intel MKL` increasingly becoming the primary optimized BLAS choices. Instead of attempting to lock in a specific library during the build process, the current approach relies on dynamic discovery at runtime. This allows NumPy to utilize whichever optimized BLAS is available on the user's machine, providing optimal performance without needing a pre-defined build-time configuration.

The consequences of this shift are that the `blas_opt_info` attribute, which used to provide details about the linked library, is no longer relevant and consequently, removed from `numpy.distutils.__config__`. The responsibility for determining the appropriate BLAS/LAPACK implementation is now largely delegated to NumPy itself at runtime through its internal mechanism and through libraries like `scipy.linalg`.

To illustrate the former behavior and current paradigm, consider the following examples.

**Code Example 1: Prior to NumPy 1.20 (Hypothetical)**

```python
# Hypothetical code based on pre-1.20 behavior (not functional today)
import numpy.distutils.__config__ as cfg

try:
    blas_info = cfg.blas_opt_info
    print(f"BLAS information: {blas_info}")
except AttributeError:
    print("blas_opt_info not available.")

# This would potentially print something like:
# BLAS information: {'libraries': ['mkl_rt'], 'library_dirs': ['/opt/intel/mkl/lib/'], 'define_macros': [('HAVE_CBLAS', None)]}
```

This hypothetical code exemplifies how, in older versions of NumPy, we might have accessed the `blas_opt_info` attribute to retrieve details about the linked BLAS implementation during the build. It would include information such as library paths, library names, and defined macros that provided specifics of the linking process. This approach was cumbersome and often led to conflicts when different BLAS installations were present in the environment. The try/except block simulates situations where no information is available due to build errors or missing dependencies.

**Code Example 2: Current NumPy (1.20 and Later)**

```python
import numpy.distutils.__config__ as cfg

try:
    blas_info = cfg.blas_opt_info
    print(f"BLAS information: {blas_info}")
except AttributeError:
    print("blas_opt_info not available (as expected).")

# Output: blas_opt_info not available (as expected).
```

This code, when run with recent versions of NumPy, will invariably fail to find the `blas_opt_info` attribute and print the fallback message. The attribute has been deliberately removed. The lack of the attribute indicates that NumPy doesn't rely on a stored compile-time BLAS configuration. Instead, it relies on the runtime mechanism.

**Code Example 3: Determining Active BLAS using SciPy**

```python
import scipy
import scipy.linalg

def get_blas_info():
    try:
        # Attempt to infer BLAS provider
        info = scipy.linalg.get_blas_funcs('dot')
        blas_name = info[0].__module__.split('.')[0] # Extract provider name
        print(f"Active BLAS provider: {blas_name}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error retrieving BLAS information: {e}")

get_blas_info()

# Sample output (might differ based on environment):
# Active BLAS provider: _blas
# or
# Active BLAS provider: mkl
```

This final example illustrates the contemporary way to infer which BLAS library is being used. `scipy.linalg.get_blas_funcs('dot')` attempts to get the underlying BLAS functions (in this case `dot`). Then, we can inspect the module of these functions to find the active BLAS provider. This demonstrates the runtime approach.

The `_blas` indicates that the underlying BLAS functions are those directly wrapped by NumPy or a system-default BLAS, while `mkl` signifies that the Intel Math Kernel Library is being used. This reflects the move from a compile-time configuration to a dynamic, run-time lookup mechanism for BLAS selection. Crucially, while we can determine the active BLAS, there is no built-in mechanism to inspect specific paths or flags, as was once available using `blas_opt_info`.

This approach simplifies the build process, increases portability, and usually yields more efficient linear algebra performance. Instead of relying on the fragile system of compile-time configurations, users benefit from the optimal BLAS implementation available on their current system, without needing special build flags.

For users seeking greater control over BLAS linking, options outside of the `numpy.distutils` module are necessary. Consider consulting:

*   **System Package Managers:** For specific control over BLAS installations at the system level, use system package managers such as `apt`, `yum`, or `conda`. They often offer pre-compiled optimized BLAS libraries (like OpenBLAS or Intel MKL) that can be managed independently of NumPy’s internal choices.
*   **Intel MKL Documentation:** Intel MKL’s official documentation provides comprehensive information regarding installation, environment setup, and how to control MKL’s usage within various scientific libraries, including NumPy and SciPy.
*   **OpenBLAS Documentation:** OpenBLAS documentation is useful for those who prefer an open-source alternative to MKL. It guides users through installation and optimization techniques, including building OpenBLAS directly from source.
*   **SciPy Documentation:** Reviewing SciPy's documentation relating to linear algebra often provides insights about its interaction with BLAS/LAPACK. The documentation may not contain specific details about underlying BLAS paths but will help to understand the underlying concepts.

In summary, the absence of the `blas_opt_info` attribute from `numpy.distutils.__config__` is not an error, but a deliberate and positive change. It reflects a move towards a more robust, adaptable, and ultimately, performant approach to BLAS linking. Instead of relying on a single, hardcoded configuration, NumPy now dynamically leverages whatever optimized BLAS library is available at runtime. This transition is vital for supporting modern scientific computing environments and improving overall user experience.
