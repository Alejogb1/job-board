Python's dynamic typing and its flexible object model allow for attribute assignment that modifies object length, but the specifics depend heavily on the object type.  My experience working extensively with custom object serialization and large-scale data processing has highlighted crucial distinctions.  Mutable sequences like lists and dictionaries readily accommodate this, while immutable types such as tuples and strings necessitate object recreation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Python doesn't inherently track "length" in a universal sense.  Instead, the concept of length is tied to specific object methods. For mutable sequences (lists, sets, dictionaries), length is determined by the number of elements.  Modifying this length means adding or removing elements.  Immutable sequences (tuples, strings) have a fixed length upon creation; changing their length necessitates creating a new object.

When assigning an attribute to an object, Python checks if the object has a predefined mechanism for handling that attribute. For instance, lists have built-in methods like `append()`, `insert()`, `pop()`, and `del` that directly modify the underlying data structure and thus the length.  Attempts to assign attributes that don't correspond to such built-in mechanisms, or attempts to directly modify attributes of immutable objects, will typically result in either no change or a `TypeError` if the operation is incompatible with the object's nature.

Consider a list. Appending elements increases its length, and removing elements decreases it. The assignment is indirect; it involves using methods that affect the list's internal state. In contrast, attempting to directly assign a length attribute to a tuple (e.g., `my_tuple.length = 10`) fails because tuples are immutable.  Any apparent length modification requires constructing a completely new tuple.

The behavior is also impacted by the way the object is constructed.  Objects built using classes typically have length determined by the number of items stored in their internal containers (often lists or dictionaries). If the container is mutable, modifying the container will change the effective length, even if there's no explicit "length" attribute within the class itself.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Modifying Lists**

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(f"Initial length: {len(my_list)}")  # Output: Initial length: 3

my_list.append(4)  # Modifies the list in place, increasing length.
print(f"Length after append: {len(my_list)}")  # Output: Length after append: 4

my_list.extend([5, 6]) #Another in-place modification increasing length.
print(f"Length after extend: {len(my_list)}") # Output: Length after extend: 6

del my_list[0] #Removes an element, modifying the length in-place.
print(f"Length after deletion: {len(my_list)}") # Output: Length after deletion: 5
```

This demonstrates the direct modification of list length using built-in methods.  Crucially, the `len()` function reflects these changes immediately, highlighting the dynamic nature.  There's no separate "length" attribute to explicitly manage.


**Example 2: Immutability and Tuples**

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(f"Initial length: {len(my_tuple)}")  # Output: Initial length: 3

try:
    my_tuple.append(4)  # This will raise an AttributeError.
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Output: Error: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'

#To "change" length, create a new tuple:
new_tuple = my_tuple + (4,5)
print(f"Length of new tuple: {len(new_tuple)}") # Output: Length of new tuple: 5
```

This example shows that tuples resist direct length modification. The attempt to use `append()` results in an error. To effectively change the length, we must create a new tuple incorporating the desired elements.  This is a fundamental characteristic of immutability.


**Example 3: Custom Class with Mutable Internal State**

```python
class MyData:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def add_item(self, item):
        self.data.append(item)

    def remove_item(self, index):
        del self.data[index]

my_data = MyData([10, 20, 30])
print(f"Initial data length: {len(my_data.data)}")  # Output: Initial data length: 3

my_data.add_item(40)
print(f"Data length after addition: {len(my_data.data)}")  # Output: Data length after addition: 4

my_data.remove_item(0)
print(f"Data length after removal: {len(my_data.data)}")  # Output: Data length after removal: 3
```

Here, a class encapsulates a list.  Methods `add_item` and `remove_item` act as intermediaries, modifying the internal list and thus indirectly changing the "length" of the object's data.  The length isn't a direct attribute of `MyData` but is derived from its internal mutable list.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a more comprehensive understanding of Python's data structures and object-oriented programming, consult the official Python documentation.  Focus specifically on the sections dealing with mutable and immutable objects, as well as the detailed explanation of list methods.  Studying relevant chapters in a well-regarded Python textbook would provide further depth. Consider exploring materials on object-oriented design principles, as understanding inheritance and composition is vital when dealing with complex objects and their attributes.  Finally, practicing with various data structures and implementing custom classes will solidify your understanding.
