The core issue lies in the inherent loss of information when converting a dense tensor to its sparse representation.  `torch.save` and `torch.load` handle the data structure as provided; they don't inherently possess knowledge of the original tensor density.  Thus, restoring a dense tensor from a sparse representation saved this way necessitates reconstructing the missing zero values.  My experience working on large-scale graph neural networks frequently involved this precise challenge, especially when dealing with adjacency matrices represented sparsely for memory efficiency.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process of restoring a dense tensor from a sparse representation saved using `torch.to_sparse()` involves understanding the underlying data structure of the sparse tensor.  `torch.to_sparse()` converts a dense tensor into a compressed sparse row (CSR) or compressed sparse column (CSC) format, depending on the context.  This format stores only the non-zero elements along with their indices, significantly reducing memory consumption.  However, this information alone is insufficient to reconstruct the original dense tensor.  We require knowledge of the original tensor's shape to correctly place the non-zero elements in their respective positions within the dense matrix.  The restoration therefore involves creating a zero-filled tensor of the original dimensions and then populating it with the non-zero values from the sparse representation based on their indices.

Several methods can achieve this. The simplest leverages the `torch.sparse_coo_tensor`'s conversion to dense.  More complex methods might involve custom indexing or leveraging advanced sparse matrix libraries for large datasets exceeding available RAM.  The critical step remains constructing the zero tensor with the appropriate dimensions.  Failing to do so will result in shape mismatches and runtime errors.  The shape information is not explicitly stored within the sparse tensor itself; it is crucial to save the shape alongside the sparse tensor to ensure a successful reconstruction.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Restoration using `torch.sparse_coo_tensor`:**

```python
import torch

# Original dense tensor
dense_tensor = torch.tensor([[0, 0, 3], [4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0]])

# Convert to sparse
sparse_tensor = dense_tensor.to_sparse()

# Save (simulated; in practice use torch.save)
saved_sparse_tensor = sparse_tensor
saved_shape = dense_tensor.shape

# Load (simulated; in practice use torch.load)
loaded_sparse_tensor = saved_sparse_tensor
loaded_shape = saved_shape

# Restore to dense
restored_tensor = torch.sparse_coo_tensor(loaded_sparse_tensor.indices(), loaded_sparse_tensor.values(), loaded_shape).to_dense()

print(f"Original Dense Tensor:\n{dense_tensor}")
print(f"Restored Dense Tensor:\n{restored_tensor}")
```

This example directly utilizes the `torch.sparse_coo_tensor` constructor to rebuild the dense tensor.  The `indices()` and `values()` methods access the non-zero elements' indices and values, respectively, from the sparse tensor.  The `loaded_shape` variable holds the crucial shape information, preventing errors.  This method is straightforward and efficient for smaller tensors.


**Example 2: Handling Custom Sparse Formats (Illustrative):**

```python
import torch

# Simulate a custom sparse format (row, col, value)
custom_sparse = [(0, 2, 3), (1, 0, 4), (2, 1, 2)]

rows, cols, values = zip(*custom_sparse)
rows = torch.tensor(rows)
cols = torch.tensor(cols)
values = torch.tensor(values)
shape = (3, 3) #Important: Shape information must be preserved!

#Restore dense tensor
restored_tensor = torch.zeros(shape)
restored_tensor[rows, cols] = values

print(f"Restored Dense Tensor from custom format:\n{restored_tensor}")

```

This example demonstrates a scenario where you might encounter a sparse representation not directly compatible with PyTorch's built-in sparse functions.  It highlights the necessity of preserving the shape information, regardless of the sparse format employed.  It simulates handling a custom format – a tuple list containing row, column, and value — and then reconstructs the dense tensor accordingly.  In real-world scenarios, robust error handling should be added.


**Example 3:  Large-scale restoration (Conceptual):**

```python
import torch
import scipy.sparse  #Requires scipy library

# Simulate a large sparse matrix (using scipy for efficiency)
large_sparse_matrix = scipy.sparse.random(10000, 10000, density=0.01, format='csr')

# Convert to PyTorch sparse tensor (if needed)
pytorch_sparse = torch.sparse_coo_tensor(torch.tensor([large_sparse_matrix.row, large_sparse_matrix.col]), torch.tensor(large_sparse_matrix.data))

# Save shape information (crucial for large datasets)
shape = pytorch_sparse.shape

# (Simulated saving and loading)
saved_sparse = pytorch_sparse
loaded_sparse = saved_sparse
loaded_shape = shape

# Restore to dense (using PyTorch for smaller chunks if necessary)
restored_dense = torch.sparse_coo_tensor(loaded_sparse.indices(), loaded_sparse.values(), loaded_shape).to_dense()

print(f"Large tensor restoration complete (shape: {restored_dense.shape})") # Verification
```

This example sketches a process for larger tensors that might exceed available RAM.  It leverages the `scipy.sparse` library for initial creation and handling of the large sparse matrix, exploiting its optimized memory management.  Conversion to a PyTorch sparse tensor might be necessary for compatibility.  For extremely large tensors, the reconstruction could be handled in batches or using memory-mapped files.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **PyTorch Documentation:**  The official documentation provides detailed information on sparse tensors and their manipulation.
* **Scipy Sparse Matrices:**  The SciPy library offers a powerful set of tools for working with sparse matrices, often crucial for efficient handling of large datasets.
* **Linear Algebra Textbooks:**  A strong understanding of linear algebra is essential for comprehending sparse matrix formats and operations.


This detailed response provides a comprehensive approach to restoring dense tensors from sparse representations.  Remember, the crucial factor is to always preserve and utilize the original tensor's shape information during the saving and loading process.  Choosing the appropriate method depends on tensor size and available memory resources.  For extremely large tensors, exploring techniques like out-of-core computation or distributed processing might be necessary.
