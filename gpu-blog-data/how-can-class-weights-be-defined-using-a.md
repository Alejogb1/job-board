Handling imbalanced datasets is a recurring challenge in my work developing machine learning models for financial risk assessment.  A particularly effective technique I've employed involves leveraging class weights, specifically defined as a dictionary within the Keras or TensorFlow frameworks.  This approach offers granular control over the learning process, allowing us to mitigate the effects of class imbalance by assigning higher weights to under-represented classes.  This directly influences the loss function, penalizing misclassifications of minority classes more heavily.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Class weights in Keras and TensorFlow adjust the contribution of each class to the overall loss function.  Instead of treating all classes equally, we assign weights proportional to their inverse frequency in the training dataset.  This means that a class with fewer samples receives a higher weight, thus increasing its influence on the model's learning process.  The weights are typically specified as a dictionary where the keys are the class labels (often integers or strings) and the values are the corresponding weights.  The `class_weight` parameter in Keras' `model.fit()` method readily accepts this dictionary format.  Correctly defining these weights requires careful consideration of the dataset's class distribution.

The calculation of class weights isn't standardized; different approaches exist depending on the desired effect and the nature of the imbalance.  A common approach, and the one I'll illustrate here, is to inversely proportion the weights to the class frequencies.  This means a class with a frequency of 10% would receive a weight approximately ten times larger than a class with a 90% frequency.  The exact calculation often involves a normalization step to ensure the weights are well-scaled.  While other methodologies exist (e.g., using heuristics or analyzing the cost matrix for misclassifications), the inverse frequency method generally provides a good starting point.

One crucial aspect is understanding that class weights modify the *loss function*.  They don't directly influence the data itself; they act as multipliers during the backpropagation phase, thereby emphasizing the importance of correctly classifying under-represented samples.  This is a crucial distinction: we're not oversampling or undersampling; we're adjusting the learning algorithm's sensitivity to errors within different classes.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Binary Classification**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.utils import class_weight

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.array([0] * 90 + [1] * 10)  # Imbalance: 90% class 0, 10% class 1

# Calculate class weights using sklearn
class_weights = class_weight.compute_class_weight('balanced', np.unique(y), y)
class_weight_dict = dict(enumerate(class_weights))

# Define a simple model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model with class weights
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, class_weight=class_weight_dict)
```

This example demonstrates binary classification where `sklearn.utils.class_weight` conveniently calculates the balanced class weights.  The `enumerate` function ensures that the dictionary keys align with the class labels (0 and 1 in this case).  The model is then trained using these weights.  Note that this uses a balanced class weight which simplifies the calculation, particularly useful when dealing with a large number of classes.


**Example 2: Multi-class Classification with Manual Weight Calculation**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.array([0] * 80 + [1] * 10 + [2] * 10) # 80%, 10%, 10% class distribution

# Manually calculate class weights (inverse frequency)
class_counts = np.bincount(y)
class_weights = {i: 1.0 / count for i, count in enumerate(class_counts)}
total = np.sum(class_counts)
class_weights_normalized = {i: (total*w) / class_counts[i] for i, w in class_weights.items()} # Normalize weights

# Define a multi-class model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax') # Output layer for 3 classes
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

#One-hot encode the target variables.
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
y_cat = to_categorical(y)

# Train the model with class weights
model.fit(X, y_cat, epochs=10, class_weight=class_weights_normalized)
```

Here, we manually compute class weights based on the inverse frequency.  The normalization step ensures the weights are suitably scaled for the optimizer.  This example highlights multi-class classification using `categorical_crossentropy` and requires one-hot encoding of the target variable `y`.


**Example 3:  Handling String Class Labels**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Sample data with string class labels
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.array(['A'] * 80 + ['B'] * 10 + ['C'] * 10)

# Calculate class weights for string labels
unique_classes, counts = np.unique(y, return_counts=True)
class_weights = dict(zip(unique_classes, 1.0 / counts))
total_count = np.sum(counts)
class_weights_normalized = {k: (total_count*v) / counts[np.where(unique_classes == k)[0][0]] for k,v in class_weights.items()}


# Define a model (similar to Example 2, adjusted for the number of classes)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Convert string labels to numerical indices using LabelEncoder
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
y_encoded = le.fit_transform(y)

# Train the model with class weights (using encoded labels)
model.fit(X, y_encoded, epochs=10, class_weight=class_weights_normalized)
```

This example demonstrates how to handle string class labels using `LabelEncoder` from scikit-learn.  The class weights are calculated based on the string labels and then used with the encoded numerical representations during model training.  The `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss function is appropriate for integer labels, offering efficiency for large datasets.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I would advise consulting the official Keras and TensorFlow documentation on model compilation and the `class_weight` parameter.  Additionally, research papers focusing on handling class imbalance in machine learning would provide valuable theoretical background.  A good statistics textbook focusing on probability and distributions would be helpful for understanding the underlying principles of weighting schemes.  Finally, reviewing examples and tutorials from reputable sources on data preprocessing and model training within the Keras/TensorFlow ecosystem would solidify your understanding.  These resources, combined with careful consideration of your dataset's characteristics, will empower you to effectively leverage class weights for your specific imbalanced classification tasks.
