The core challenge in using PyTorch's `DataParallel` with a custom model lies not in the `DataParallel` module itself, but in ensuring your custom model adheres to the structural requirements necessary for proper parallel execution across multiple GPUs.  Over the years, I've encountered numerous instances where seemingly straightforward custom models failed to cooperate with `DataParallel` due to subtle inconsistencies in their construction, primarily related to state management and the handling of input tensors.  Proper implementation necessitates a deep understanding of how `DataParallel` replicates the model and distributes the workload.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`DataParallel` in PyTorch replicates your model across multiple GPUs, dividing a batch of input data among them. Each GPU processes a subset of the batch independently, using its own copy of the model. The outputs from each GPU are then aggregated, typically by averaging the gradients during backpropagation. This process relies heavily on the model being constructed in a way that allows for seamless replication.  Crucially, the model's state (weights and biases) must be easily replicated and synchronized. This presents the primary hurdle for custom models.  If your model contains internal state not managed by PyTorch's `nn.Module` mechanisms, `DataParallel` might struggle to replicate it correctly, leading to synchronization issues or incorrect computations.

Furthermore, your custom model must correctly handle the input tensors it receives.  `DataParallel` automatically splits the input batch along the batch dimension (dimension 0). Your model's `forward` method must be designed to accept this split batch and operate correctly on it.  Ignoring this aspect can lead to runtime errors or incorrect model behavior.  Finally, remember that using `DataParallel` is fundamentally about distributing computation; it doesn't magically increase memory available to each GPU. If a single GPU's memory is exceeded by the model's parameters or the input batch size, `DataParallel` will still fail, even with multiple GPUs.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: A Basic Compliant Model:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn import DataParallel

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x

model = MyModel()
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
  print("Let's use", torch.cuda.device_count(), "GPUs!")
  model = DataParallel(model)
model.to('cuda')
```

This example shows a simple model adhering to PyTorch's `nn.Module` structure.  The `DataParallel` wrapper seamlessly handles replication. The `if` statement ensures `DataParallel` is used only if multiple GPUs are available, preventing errors on single-GPU systems.  Crucially, all model components are standard PyTorch layers, eliminating potential state management complexities.


**Example 2: Handling Custom Layers:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn import DataParallel

class MyCustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(in_features, out_features))
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(out_features))

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.mm(x, self.weight) + self.bias


class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.custom_layer = MyCustomLayer(10, 5)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.custom_layer(x)
        x = self.linear(x)
        return x

model = MyModel()
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
  print("Let's use", torch.cuda.device_count(), "GPUs!")
  model = DataParallel(model)
model.to('cuda')
```

This example demonstrates incorporating a custom layer (`MyCustomLayer`).  The key is that `MyCustomLayer` correctly inherits from `nn.Module` and uses `nn.Parameter` to define its learnable parameters.  This ensures that `DataParallel` can properly manage and replicate the layer's state across GPUs.


**Example 3:  Addressing Potential Issues with Internal State:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn import DataParallel

class ProblematicModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ProblematicModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 2)
        self.internal_state = torch.zeros(2) # Incorrect: Not a Parameter

    def forward(self, x):
        self.internal_state += torch.sum(x, dim=0) # Incorrect: Modifies internal state directly
        x = self.linear(x)
        return x, self.internal_state #Incorrect: Returning external state

model = ProblematicModel()

#The following line will likely result in errors or unexpected behavior
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    model = DataParallel(model)
    model.to('cuda')
```

This example highlights a common pitfall.  `internal_state` is not a `nn.Parameter`, and the model directly modifies it. This makes it difficult for `DataParallel` to replicate and synchronize the state correctly across GPUs. The correct approach would be to integrate `internal_state` into the model's `nn.Parameter`s or design the model to manage its internal state using the standard `nn.Module` methods.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation on `nn.DataParallel` is essential.  Furthermore, consult advanced PyTorch tutorials covering distributed training, particularly those focusing on the intricacies of model parallelism and distributed data loading.  Consider reviewing materials on best practices for creating custom PyTorch modules to ensure they're suitable for parallel computation.  Finally, carefully examine the documentation for the specific GPU hardware you're using, as certain hardware limitations might necessitate alternative distributed training strategies.  Thorough testing across different GPU configurations and batch sizes is crucial for verifying the correctness and stability of your implementation.  Debugging distributed training can be intricate; thus, systematic testing and logging are imperative.
