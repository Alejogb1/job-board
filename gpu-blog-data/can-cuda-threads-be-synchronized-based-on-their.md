CUDA thread synchronization based solely on `threadIdx` is fundamentally infeasible for general-purpose synchronization within a block.  While `threadIdx` provides a unique identifier for each thread within a block, it doesn't offer a mechanism for threads to wait on each other based on that identifier alone.  My experience optimizing large-scale molecular dynamics simulations using CUDA highlighted this limitation repeatedly.  Direct, `threadIdx`-based barriers or waits are absent from the CUDA programming model.

The core issue stems from the inherent architecture of CUDA.  Threads within a warp (typically 32 threads) are inherently synchronized – instructions within a warp execute concurrently, and divergence within a warp leads to serialization of instructions for divergent branches.  However, this warp-level synchronization is managed implicitly by the hardware and isn't controllable at the granularity of individual threads based on their `threadIdx`.  Attempts to create such synchronization artificially using only `threadIdx` lead to race conditions, deadlocks, or unpredictable behavior.  The CUDA model prioritizes efficient parallel execution, and explicit, fine-grained thread-level synchronization based solely on `threadIdx` would severely hamper this efficiency.

Instead, CUDA provides other synchronization primitives for inter-thread communication and synchronization within a block.  These mechanisms include `__syncthreads()`, atomic operations, and shared memory.  Let's examine how each of these addresses the need for thread coordination in scenarios where `threadIdx` might seem relevant:

**1. `__syncthreads()`:** This intrinsic function acts as a barrier synchronization point within a block.  All threads within the block executing this instruction must reach it before any thread can proceed past it.  This is crucial for ensuring that data written by one thread is visible to others.  It doesn't inherently use `threadIdx` for synchronization, but it guarantees that all threads reach a specific point before continuing execution.

**Code Example 1: Using `__syncthreads()` for block-wide synchronization:**

```cuda
__global__ void kernel(int *data, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    // ... some computation ...
    data[i] *= 2; // Example computation
    __syncthreads(); // Barrier synchronization
    // ... further computation that depends on the results from all threads ...
  }
}
```

In this example, `__syncthreads()` ensures that all threads complete their initial computation before proceeding to the second phase.  This avoids race conditions if the second phase depends on the results from the first. The `threadIdx` is implicitly used to identify individual threads’ data locations within the array but does not manage the synchronization itself.

**2. Atomic Operations:**  These operations guarantee atomic access to shared memory locations, allowing threads to update shared variables without race conditions.  These operations are essential when multiple threads need to modify the same data concurrently. While thread identification is implicit in accessing these memory locations, it’s not used for direct synchronization between threads.

**Code Example 2: Using atomic operations for updating a shared counter:**

```cuda
__global__ void kernel(int *counter) {
  atomicAdd(counter, 1); // Atomically increment the counter
}
```

In this case, multiple threads might try to increment `counter` simultaneously.  The `atomicAdd` function ensures that these increments happen atomically, avoiding data corruption.  The underlying implementation manages the synchronization, which is transparent to the programmer.  The `threadIdx` plays a role in the access pattern but not in dictating the synchronization process.


**3. Shared Memory:**  Shared memory provides fast access to data within a block.  It's crucial for efficient communication and cooperation among threads within the same block.  Threads use `threadIdx` to access their designated locations in shared memory, but the synchronization itself is typically achieved through other mechanisms like `__syncthreads()`.

**Code Example 3: Using shared memory and `__syncthreads()` for reduction:**

```cuda
__global__ void reductionKernel(int *input, int *output, int N) {
  __shared__ int partialSums[256]; // Assuming block size of 256

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int sum = 0;
  if (i < N) {
    sum = input[i];
  }

  partialSums[threadIdx.x] = sum;
  __syncthreads();

  // Reduction within the shared memory (simplified for brevity)
  for (int s = blockDim.x / 2; s > 0; s >>= 1) {
    if (threadIdx.x < s) {
      partialSums[threadIdx.x] += partialSums[threadIdx.x + s];
    }
    __syncthreads();
  }

  if (threadIdx.x == 0) {
    output[blockIdx.x] = partialSums[0];
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates a reduction operation using shared memory.  Threads load data from global memory into shared memory, perform the reduction in shared memory using `__syncthreads()` for synchronization between reduction steps, and then write the partial sums back to global memory.  `threadIdx` is crucial for addressing shared memory, but `__syncthreads()` manages the necessary synchronization steps.


In conclusion, while `threadIdx` plays a vital role in accessing data and performing operations within a CUDA kernel, it is insufficient for direct inter-thread synchronization.  Using `__syncthreads()`, atomic operations, and appropriately structured shared memory access are the correct approaches for coordinating threads within a block.  Relying solely on `threadIdx` for synchronization leads to undefined behavior and often results in difficult-to-debug race conditions.  Understanding the underlying CUDA architecture and utilizing the provided synchronization primitives is paramount for writing correct and efficient CUDA code.
