The fundamental challenge in determining the count of elements in an unordered array that exceed every other element lies in the inherent lack of sorted order.  Brute-force approaches, while conceptually simple, suffer from quadratic time complexity, rendering them inefficient for larger datasets. My experience optimizing search algorithms in high-frequency trading systems highlighted this precisely –  a naive approach to finding market-leading prices within a rapidly updating data stream was simply untenable.  The solution necessitates a more refined algorithmic approach leveraging efficient comparison and counting strategies.

The optimal solution involves a two-pass algorithm. The first pass identifies the maximum element within the array. The second pass then iterates through the array, incrementing a counter for each element equal to the previously identified maximum.  This approach significantly improves performance, achieving linear time complexity (O(n)), a considerable improvement over the quadratic complexity (O(n²)) of nested-loop comparisons.

**Explanation:**

The algorithm's efficiency stems from its avoidance of redundant comparisons.  A naive approach would involve comparing each element against every other element, leading to nested loops. In contrast, the two-pass strategy first isolates the maximum element, eliminating the need for repeated comparisons against this element in the subsequent pass.  This reduces the number of comparisons from approximately n²/2 to 2n, where n is the array's size. The constant factor of 2 is negligible compared to the significant reduction in order of growth.

The first pass uses a simple linear scan, efficiently identifying the maximum. The second pass is another linear scan, incrementing a counter whenever an element matches the maximum. This straightforward approach minimizes computational overhead and memory usage.  Edge cases such as empty arrays or arrays containing only one element are easily handled with conditional checks before initiating the algorithm.  Error handling, such as checking for non-numeric values in the array, would be implemented depending on the context of the application, and would be added as pre-processing steps.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Python**

```python
def count_greater_than_all(arr):
    """
    Counts elements in an array greater than all other elements.

    Args:
        arr: The input array of numbers.

    Returns:
        The count of elements exceeding all others, or 0 for empty arrays.  Raises TypeError if input is not a list or contains non-numeric elements.
    """
    if not isinstance(arr, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list.")
    if not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in arr):
        raise TypeError("List elements must be numbers.")
    if not arr:
        return 0

    max_element = float('-inf')  # Initialize with negative infinity
    for num in arr:
        max_element = max(max_element, num)

    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        if num == max_element:
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
array1 = [1, 5, 2, 5, 3]
result1 = count_greater_than_all(array1)  #result1 will be 2
print(f"Number of elements greater than all others in {array1}: {result1}")

array2 = [10]
result2 = count_greater_than_all(array2) #result2 will be 1
print(f"Number of elements greater than all others in {array2}: {result2}")

array3 = []
result3 = count_greater_than_all(array3) #result3 will be 0
print(f"Number of elements greater than all others in {array3}: {result3}")

#Example of error handling
array4 = [1, 'a', 3]
try:
    result4 = count_greater_than_all(array4)
    print(result4)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Example 2: C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits> // Required for numeric_limits

int countGreaterThanAll(const std::vector<double>& arr) {
    if (arr.empty()) {
        return 0;
    }

    double maxElement = std::numeric_limits<double>::lowest(); // Initialize with the smallest possible double
    for (double num : arr) {
        maxElement = std::max(maxElement, num);
    }

    int count = 0;
    for (double num : arr) {
        if (num == maxElement) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<double> array1 = {1.5, 5.2, 2.1, 5.2, 3.7};
    int result1 = countGreaterThanAll(array1);
    std::cout << "Number of elements greater than all others: " << result1 << std::endl; // Output: 2

    std::vector<double> array2 = {10.0};
    int result2 = countGreaterThanAll(array2);
    std::cout << "Number of elements greater than all others: " << result2 << std::endl; // Output: 1

    std::vector<double> array3 = {};
    int result3 = countGreaterThanAll(array3);
    std::cout << "Number of elements greater than all others: " << result3 << std::endl; // Output: 0
    return 0;
}
```

**Example 3: JavaScript**

```javascript
function countGreaterThanAll(arr) {
    if (arr.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    let maxElement = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
    for (let num of arr) {
        if (typeof num !== 'number') {
            throw new Error("Array elements must be numbers.");
        }
        maxElement = Math.max(maxElement, num);
    }

    let count = 0;
    for (let num of arr) {
        if (num === maxElement) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Example usage
const array1 = [1, 5, 2, 5, 3];
const result1 = countGreaterThanAll(array1); // result1 will be 2
console.log(`Number of elements greater than all others in ${array1}: ${result1}`);

const array2 = [10];
const result2 = countGreaterThanAll(array2); // result2 will be 1
console.log(`Number of elements greater than all others in ${array2}: ${result2}`);

const array3 = [];
const result3 = countGreaterThanAll(array3); // result3 will be 0
console.log(`Number of elements greater than all others in ${array3}: ${result3}`);

// Example of error handling
const array4 = [1, 'a', 3];
try {
    const result4 = countGreaterThanAll(array4);
    console.log(result4);
} catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
}
```
