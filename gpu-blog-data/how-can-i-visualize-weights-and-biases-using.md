TensorBoard's direct integration with `tf.GradientTape()` for visualizing weights and biases during training isn't straightforward.  My experience working on large-scale neural network models for financial forecasting highlighted this limitation.  `tf.GradientTape()` primarily facilitates automatic differentiation;  it doesn't inherently possess the logging mechanisms needed for TensorBoard integration.  Therefore, achieving this visualization requires a manual approach, carefully recording the necessary data during the training process and subsequently feeding it into TensorBoard.

The solution involves leveraging TensorBoard's SummaryWriter API to log the weights and biases of your model's layers at specific training intervals. This necessitates extracting these values from your model after each gradient calculation within the `tf.GradientTape()` context.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves three key steps:

* **Data Extraction:**  Within the training loop, extract the weights and biases from each layer of your model after the `tf.GradientTape()` context has computed the gradients.  This avoids unnecessary computational overhead.  This data should be extracted at regular intervals, determined by your training frequency, such as after every epoch or a specific number of training steps.

* **Data Formatting:** Prepare the extracted weight and bias tensors into a format suitable for TensorBoard. This typically means converting them to NumPy arrays using `.numpy()` and then shaping them appropriately for visualization.  High-dimensional tensors might require reshaping or aggregation for meaningful representation in TensorBoard.

* **TensorBoard Logging:** Use the `tf.summary` module's functions, such as `tf.summary.histogram` (for visualizing weight and bias distributions) or `tf.summary.image` (for visualizing weight matrices as images, potentially helpful for convolutional layers), to write these arrays to TensorBoard logs.  You'll need to create a `SummaryWriter` object and specify the log directory.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Dense Layer Visualization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... model definition ... (e.g., a simple dense layer model)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
                             tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('./logs')

for epoch in range(10):
    # ... training loop ...
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(training_data)
        loss = loss_function(predictions, training_labels)

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    # Logging weights and biases
    with summary_writer.as_default():
        for i, layer in enumerate(model.layers):
            if hasattr(layer, 'kernel'): # Check for the existence of weights (e.g., dense layer)
                tf.summary.histogram(f"layer_{i}_weights", layer.kernel.numpy(), step=epoch)
                tf.summary.histogram(f"layer_{i}_biases", layer.bias.numpy(), step=epoch)

```

This example demonstrates logging weight and bias histograms for a simple sequential model.  The `hasattr()` check ensures that the code gracefully handles layers lacking weights (like activation layers).  The `step` argument in `tf.summary.histogram` ensures proper time-series representation in TensorBoard.


**Example 2:  Convolutional Layer Visualization (Image Representation)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

#... Convolutional model definition ...

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

#... Optimizer and SummaryWriter ...


for epoch in range(10):
    # ... training loop ...
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        #... forward pass and loss calculation ...

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))


    with summary_writer.as_default():
      for i, layer in enumerate(model.layers):
        if isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.Conv2D):
            weights = layer.kernel.numpy()
            # Reshape weights for image visualization (adjust as needed)
            weights_reshaped = np.transpose(weights, (3, 0, 1, 2))
            tf.summary.image(f"layer_{i}_weights", weights_reshaped, step=epoch, max_outputs=min(weights_reshaped.shape[0],10)) #Limit to 10 images


```

This illustrates visualization of convolutional layer weights as images.  Note the crucial reshaping of the weight tensor before feeding it to `tf.summary.image`.  `max_outputs` limits the number of images displayed in TensorBoard to manage potential overload.



**Example 3: Handling  RNN Layers (Averaging Weights)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

#... Recurrent model definition (e.g., LSTM) ...
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=False, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

#... Optimizer and SummaryWriter ...

for epoch in range(10):
    # ... training loop ...
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        #... forward pass and loss calculation ...

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    with summary_writer.as_default():
      for i, layer in enumerate(model.layers):
        if isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.LSTM):
          # Averaging weights across time steps for simpler visualization
          weights = np.mean(layer.kernel.numpy(), axis=0) # Average across time dimension
          biases = layer.bias.numpy()
          tf.summary.histogram(f"layer_{i}_weights", weights, step=epoch)
          tf.summary.histogram(f"layer_{i}_biases", biases, step=epoch)

```

This addresses RNNs, where the weight matrices are often time-dependent.  Averaging across the time dimension simplifies visualization, providing a summary of the weight distribution over the training sequence.  Adapting this averaging approach to different RNN architectures might require careful consideration of the weight tensor's structure.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.summary` and TensorBoard provides extensive details on the available logging functions and visualization options.  The TensorFlow tutorials section offers practical examples of model training and TensorBoard integration.  Finally, exploring the Keras documentation on different layer types and their weight structures is valuable for understanding how to extract and appropriately format weight data for visualization.  These resources offer a robust foundation for mastering these techniques.
