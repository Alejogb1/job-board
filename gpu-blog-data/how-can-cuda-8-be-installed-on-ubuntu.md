The incompatibility between CUDA 9 and certain legacy libraries, especially those prevalent in research environments, often necessitates using older CUDA toolkits like CUDA 8, even when running on relatively recent operating systems such as Ubuntu 17.04. Directly installing CUDA 8 on a system geared for newer drivers presents significant challenges, primarily related to driver version conflicts and dependency issues. My experience migrating a suite of molecular simulation tools to an older compute server highlighted the need for precise steps to avoid system instability and ensure successful compilation with CUDA 8.

The primary hurdle stems from the NVIDIA driver model. Ubuntu 17.04 typically utilizes newer driver versions optimized for the latest CUDA releases. Attempting to install CUDA 8's specific driver will likely conflict with these existing drivers, potentially breaking graphics functionality and introducing unpredictable system behavior. Therefore, careful management of the driver installation becomes crucial. My approach focused on disabling the Nouveau driver – the open-source driver often pre-installed – before proceeding with the CUDA 8 driver installation. Failing to do this could result in driver conflicts that are extremely difficult to diagnose and resolve, often requiring a complete driver wipe and reinstall. This is not something you want to do on a production system.

The correct installation process involves multiple steps, each requiring careful attention to avoid conflicts. First, the Nouveau driver must be blacklisted to prevent it from interfering with the NVIDIA driver installation. Secondly, the correct version of the CUDA 8 toolkit should be downloaded from NVIDIA’s archives. The runfile installation is usually recommended for specific version control and customization in environments such as this where a specific setup is needed. Thirdly, the environment variables must be properly set to ensure the CUDA toolkit is found by the system and the compiler. Fourthly, after installation, the NVIDIA driver must be explicitly selected using the NVIDIA driver selection tool. These four basic steps create a solid foundation for the CUDA toolchain.

The installation itself begins by blacklisting Nouveau. The following steps are usually effective: Create a file called `blacklist-nouveau.conf` within `/etc/modprobe.d/` containing the following:
```
# blacklist nouveau drivers
blacklist nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0
```
This code block tells the system not to load the nouveau kernel module. This needs to be completed before any driver installation. It avoids a common conflict point that many overlook. It’s also critical to run `sudo update-initramfs -u` to ensure these changes are reflected in the initramfs. This update ensures the driver is not loaded during the boot process.

Next, the CUDA 8 runfile installer should be downloaded from the NVIDIA archive. Ensure it matches the specific Ubuntu 17.04 architecture (usually x86_64). For example, the command to download a likely candidate install file would be the following.
```bash
wget https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/8.0/prod/local_installers/cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux-run
```

This step must be done carefully to ensure the correct file is obtained. After the file is downloaded, it must be made executable and then run.
```bash
chmod +x cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux-run
sudo ./cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux-run
```
The installer will then prompt you with several questions regarding driver installation and the location of libraries. Critically, it is important to agree to install the driver and also install the CUDA toolkit itself. During the installation, you'll have the option to specify install paths for the CUDA toolkit and related components. Pay close attention to these options, as they directly impact the following step: Setting the environment variables.

After the installation process completes, you must set the environment variables. This can be achieved by editing the `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file. Assuming CUDA was installed in its default location, the following lines would be added.
```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
```
These lines export both the path to the executables within the `bin` directory of the installation and the libraries required at link time. These lines must be added to your shell’s initialization file so they are available when running programs in any terminal instance. In my own experience, a common mistake is to miss the `export` command or misspell the variables which could lead to the compiler not being able to locate these resources.

Finally, ensure that the correct NVIDIA driver is being used. This can be done using the command `nvidia-smi`, and should display the version number associated with the driver included in the CUDA 8 installation. If this does not match, you should use `sudo ubuntu-drivers devices` to view the available drivers for your GPU and then use `sudo ubuntu-drivers install <specific driver version number>` to select the correct driver. It is also recommended to reboot your machine after setting up these drivers. Using the correct driver is critical for a stable CUDA environment. The wrong driver can lead to runtime errors and other obscure issues.

In terms of resources for advanced troubleshooting, NVIDIA maintains its developer documentation, including release notes and installation guides for older CUDA versions. While they do not directly support the Ubuntu 17.04 version, the information contained within these guides for older hardware and operating systems is invaluable. Furthermore, the community forums on NVIDIA's website can be a valuable resource to see if others have encountered similar challenges during their installation of this older version of CUDA. Lastly, the official Ubuntu documentation on driver management and kernel module loading can provide more detailed background on driver issues and potential conflicts with open-source drivers. These combined can provide sufficient guidance for any CUDA 8 troubleshooting process.

In conclusion, installing CUDA 8 on Ubuntu 17.04 requires careful attention to driver management, particularly the blacklisting of the Nouveau driver and ensuring the NVIDIA driver from the CUDA 8 distribution is utilized. Setting the necessary environment variables and ensuring the driver version is correct are also critical steps. By carefully following the outlined process, it is possible to establish a stable environment for compiling CUDA 8 applications, even on more recent versions of Linux distributions. Ignoring even one of these steps can lead to system instabilities or compile errors. Therefore, patience and attention to detail is paramount.
