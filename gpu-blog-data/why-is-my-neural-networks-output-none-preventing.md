A neural network outputting `None` typically indicates an unexecuted forward pass or an incomplete model definition during training or inference, leading to the absence of a tensor and consequently its shape. The commonality of this issue across different deep learning frameworks necessitates a systematic approach to identification and resolution. My experience with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras has revealed several consistent underlying causes, each requiring a distinct troubleshooting strategy.

The most frequent reason for encountering a `None` output is failing to execute the forward pass, the core mechanism through which a neural network transforms input data into predictions. This commonly occurs when a model instance is created but not provided with input data via the `forward()` method in PyTorch, the `call()` method in TensorFlow, or the `.predict()` method in Keras. Without this explicit call to evaluate the model, the outputs remain undefined and default to `None`. Further complications arise if custom modules within the network aren't correctly defined, especially those not inheriting properly or lacking an implementation of the forward pass themselves. Moreover, if the data processing pipeline doesn’t feed data correctly into the network, no calculation will be performed and `None` will be returned.

Another critical factor is incomplete model definition or initialization. A neural network relies on the precise ordering of layers and their connections to perform computation. If a layer or a required activation function is omitted, or if the parameters of a layer are not initialized correctly during construction, the forward pass might encounter an error leading to a `None` value rather than a valid tensor output. Similarly, incorrect batch dimensions or the absence of a crucial reshape or permutation operation before feeding the data into the model can be problematic. Improper handling of edge cases, like zero-length input sequences when using recurrent networks, can also cause this.

Let’s examine some concrete examples illustrating these causes.

**Example 1: Unexecuted Forward Pass (PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Model instantiation
model = SimpleNet(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, output_size=5)

# Incorrect: Output will be None as forward() is never called
output = model  # Accessing the model itself, not the result
print(output)

# Correct: We feed input data into the network via the forward() pass
input_data = torch.randn(1, 10) # Create tensor with batch size = 1
output = model(input_data) # Calling the forward pass
print(output)
print(output.shape) # Now shape is available
```

In this PyTorch example, directly accessing the model without passing data through the `forward()` method results in the variable `output` containing the model itself (a `SimpleNet` instance), not a calculated tensor, and attempts to print its shape will result in an error because this is not a tensor. When `input_data` is passed to the model, we see an actual output tensor from the network. The `.shape` can be accessed without issue. The core lesson is to ensure that the model is called with input data for the transformation process to happen.

**Example 2: Incorrect Module Definition (TensorFlow)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomDense(tf.keras.layers.Layer): # Note the proper inheritence
  def __init__(self, units, activation=None):
    super(CustomDense, self).__init__()
    self.units = units
    self.activation = tf.keras.activations.get(activation)
    self.kernel = None # Initialized later

  def build(self, input_shape):
     self.kernel = self.add_weight("kernel", shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units))

  def call(self, inputs): # Proper implementation of call method
    output = tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel)
    if self.activation is not None:
      output = self.activation(output)
    return output


class IncompleteModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(IncompleteModel, self).__init__()
    self.dense1 = CustomDense(10, activation="relu")
    self.dense2 = CustomDense(5) # Activation is defined in init not build

  #No call method defined
  # def call(self, inputs):
    # x = self.dense1(inputs)
    # x = self.dense2(x)
    # return x

# Incorrect: Call method is never called.
model = IncompleteModel()
input_data = tf.random.normal((1, 20)) # Generate dummy input
output = model(input_data) # This line will result in error/None

print(output)

class CompleteModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(CompleteModel, self).__init__()
    self.dense1 = CustomDense(10, activation="relu")
    self.dense2 = CustomDense(5)


  def call(self, inputs):
    x = self.dense1(inputs)
    x = self.dense2(x)
    return x

# Correct: call method defined and will return tensor
model_complete = CompleteModel()
output_complete = model_complete(input_data)
print(output_complete)
print(output_complete.shape)
```

Here, the `IncompleteModel` class does not have the crucial `call()` method defined within the `tf.keras.Model` subclass. This is necessary for the model to be callable. Consequently, the attempt to invoke it with `model(input_data)` returns `None`.  The `CustomDense` class's build method is necessary as weights require the dimensions of the input to be known. By implementing the `call()` method for the `CompleteModel` and utilizing a proper subclassing technique we correct this, creating valid tensor output which gives access to the shape attribute.

**Example 3: Keras Functional API and Missing Input (Keras)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect: Model defined but not passed input tensor
inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(20,)) # Input layer without connecting to model
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')(inputs)
outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5)(x)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs) # Inputs should be passed during model calls

output = model  # This is a Keras Model, not a Tensor
print(output) # Not a tensor
try:
  print(output.shape) # Causes an error because this isn't a tensor
except AttributeError as e:
  print("AttributeError:", e)


# Correct: Passing in tensor during forward pass.
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1,20))
output_correct = model(input_tensor)
print(output_correct)
print(output_correct.shape)
```

In this Keras example using the functional API, the `tf.keras.Model` object is instantiated without actually performing the necessary computations within the model. Without input being passed when model is called, Keras won't execute the network and the output variable refers to the model instance itself not a calculated tensor. When `input_tensor` is passed to `model()` we see the output has a shape.

To debug issues leading to `None` outputs, I recommend a methodical approach. First, meticulously check that the forward pass is being explicitly executed. Examine the model's definition, specifically the `forward` or `call` methods, ensuring they are present and correctly implemented. Pay careful attention to layer dimensions and their consistency with input data. Use print statements after each layer to monitor the output. This isolates the source of error. Ensure your data pipeline is functional, properly transforming and preparing your data. Visual inspection of your tensors, particularly input tensor shapes is vital. Utilize print statements and TensorBoard or similar to track data shapes.

For further resources, consider reviewing introductory and advanced documentation on the deep learning framework used (PyTorch documentation for PyTorch, TensorFlow guides for TensorFlow, and Keras documentation for Keras). Additionally, research best practices in neural network architecture and common debugging strategies within these frameworks. There are also a multitude of textbooks focused on deep learning with chapters specifically covering model construction and debugging, such as Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville, which provides fundamental understanding that can aid in troubleshooting.
