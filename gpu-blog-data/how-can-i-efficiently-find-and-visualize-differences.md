The core challenge in comparing large arrays for visualization lies in efficiently managing the data volume and representing differences meaningfully.  Direct comparison of every element is computationally expensive and yields visualizations that lack interpretability, especially with high-dimensionality. Decile bucketing provides a solution by aggregating data into quantiles, thereby reducing noise and highlighting significant variations.  My experience optimizing financial transaction data analysis heavily utilized this technique for identifying outliers and trends.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The process involves several steps:  First, we concatenate the two arrays to be compared. Then, we calculate decile boundaries for the combined data. This provides ten equal-sized buckets representing the range of values.  Each element from both original arrays is then assigned to a decile bucket.  Finally, a difference matrix is constructed. This matrix's dimensions are defined by the lengths of the original arrays, with each cell representing the decile difference between corresponding elements.  This difference matrix is directly suitable for heatmap visualization, where color intensity represents the magnitude and direction of the difference.  A positive difference indicates a larger value in the first array, and vice-versa.  Zero difference implies both elements reside in the same decile bucket.

This approach handles differing array lengths elegantly. If one array is longer, the shorter array's decile comparison is performed against the corresponding element in the longer array.  Any elements exceeding the length of the shorter array in the longer one will be compared against the last decile of the shorter array. This ensures consistent comparison and visualization.

Handling missing values (NaN) requires careful consideration.  For simplicity, I'd recommend excluding rows with NaN values from the difference matrix.   Alternative strategies could involve imputation, but that adds complexity and might introduce bias, particularly when dealing with time series or other sequentially dependent data, a problem I've encountered during risk modeling projects.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples utilize Python with NumPy and Matplotlib. I've chosen these libraries due to their extensive use within the scientific computing community and their efficient array handling capabilities.

**Example 1:  Basic Decile Difference Heatmap**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def decile_heatmap(arr1, arr2):
    combined = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2))
    deciles = np.percentile(combined, np.arange(10) * 10)
    
    def get_decile(x, deciles):
        for i in range(len(deciles) -1):
            if deciles[i] <= x < deciles[i+1]:
                return i
        return len(deciles) -1

    diff_matrix = np.zeros((len(arr1), len(arr2)))
    for i in range(min(len(arr1), len(arr2))):
      diff_matrix[i, i] = get_decile(arr1[i], deciles) - get_decile(arr2[i], deciles)


    plt.imshow(diff_matrix, cmap='coolwarm', interpolation='nearest')
    plt.colorbar(label='Decile Difference')
    plt.show()

arr1 = np.random.rand(100)
arr2 = np.random.rand(100)
decile_heatmap(arr1, arr2)
```

This example provides a foundational implementation.  The `get_decile` function efficiently assigns each element to its respective decile. The heatmap directly visualizes the decile differences.  Note that this example handles only arrays of equal length, for clarity of the fundamental logic.


**Example 2: Handling Unequal Array Lengths**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def decile_heatmap_unequal(arr1, arr2):
  # ... (get_decile function remains the same) ...

  combined = np.concatenate((arr1, arr2))
  deciles = np.percentile(combined, np.arange(10) * 10)

  max_len = max(len(arr1), len(arr2))
  diff_matrix = np.zeros((max_len, max_len))

  for i in range(max_len):
    for j in range(max_len):
        val1 = arr1[i] if i < len(arr1) else arr1[-1]
        val2 = arr2[j] if j < len(arr2) else arr2[-1]
        diff_matrix[i, j] = get_decile(val1, deciles) - get_decile(val2, deciles)


  plt.imshow(diff_matrix, cmap='coolwarm', interpolation='nearest')
  plt.colorbar(label='Decile Difference')
  plt.show()


arr1 = np.random.rand(150)
arr2 = np.random.rand(100)
decile_heatmap_unequal(arr1, arr2)
```

This improved version handles unequal array lengths by using the last element of the shorter array for comparisons beyond its length. This maintains a consistent decile difference calculation across the entire visualized matrix.

**Example 3:  Incorporating Missing Value Handling**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd # added pandas for NaN handling

def decile_heatmap_nan(arr1, arr2):
  # ... (get_decile function remains the same) ...
  df1 = pd.Series(arr1)
  df2 = pd.Series(arr2)

  # Remove rows with NaN values
  df = pd.concat([df1, df2], axis=1)
  df.dropna(inplace=True)

  arr1_cleaned = df.iloc[:,0].values
  arr2_cleaned = df.iloc[:,1].values

  combined = np.concatenate((arr1_cleaned, arr2_cleaned))
  deciles = np.percentile(combined, np.arange(10) * 10)

  min_len = min(len(arr1_cleaned), len(arr2_cleaned))
  diff_matrix = np.zeros((min_len, min_len))


  for i in range(min_len):
    diff_matrix[i, i] = get_decile(arr1_cleaned[i], deciles) - get_decile(arr2_cleaned[i], deciles)

  plt.imshow(diff_matrix, cmap='coolwarm', interpolation='nearest')
  plt.colorbar(label='Decile Difference')
  plt.show()


arr1 = np.random.rand(100)
arr2 = np.random.rand(100)
arr1[50] = np.nan #introducing NaN
arr2[25] = np.nan #introducing NaN

decile_heatmap_nan(arr1, arr2)

```

This example introduces pandas for efficient handling of missing data.  NaN values are removed before decile calculation and visualization. This prevents errors and ensures a clean heatmap visualization.  Note that this approach reduces the size of the visualized matrix, reflecting the data available after NaN removal.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  NumPy documentation:  Understanding array operations and manipulation is crucial.
*  Matplotlib documentation:  Mastering heatmap creation and customization.
*  A statistical textbook covering descriptive statistics and quantiles.  This will strengthen your understanding of the underlying statistical principles.  Pay close attention to discussions on data aggregation and visualization best practices.

These resources will provide a solid foundation for understanding and implementing the techniques presented. Remember that thorough testing and validation are essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of your analysis.
