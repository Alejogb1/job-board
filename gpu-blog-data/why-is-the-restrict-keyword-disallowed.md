The disallowance of the `restrict` keyword in many modern C++ compilers, despite its presence in the C standard, stems from its inherent complexity and the difficulties in achieving robust, compiler-independent enforcement.  My experience working on high-performance computing libraries, particularly those dealing with memory-mapped files and shared memory, highlighted this issue repeatedly.  The compiler's inability to reliably guarantee the aliasing restrictions imposed by `restrict` leads to potential undefined behavior and thus its deprecation in practice.

**1. Explanation:**

The `restrict` keyword, as defined in C99 and later adopted (but not fully implemented) in some C++ compilers, is a type qualifier intended to inform the compiler that a pointer is the only way to access a particular data region.  This allows aggressive compiler optimizations, such as loop unrolling, vectorization, and more sophisticated memory access scheduling.  If the compiler can *prove* that no other pointer aliases the data pointed to by a `restrict`-qualified pointer, it can safely assume that modifications through that pointer will not affect the data accessed via other pointers.

The problem arises from the compiler's inability to definitively verify the absence of aliasing in all cases.  While a programmer might *intend* to use a `restrict`-qualified pointer exclusively for a given memory region, determining this definitively during compilation is undecidable in the general case.  This is a fundamental limitation of static analysis.  Sophisticated interprocedural analysis can help, but it is computationally expensive and often not complete.   Furthermore, even with sophisticated analysis, the presence of function pointers, indirect memory accesses through calculated addresses, or the use of external libraries (whose internal workings are opaque to the compiler) can readily introduce aliasing that invalidates the `restrict` assumption.

My involvement in a project optimizing a parallel FFT algorithm underscored this point. We attempted to utilize `restrict` to improve cache locality during data transposition. The initial improvements were encouraging, but sporadic crashes and unexpected results eventually traced back to subtle aliasing introduced by the underlying BLAS library.  The compiler, unable to fully analyze the BLAS functions, failed to prevent the potential for data corruption.  The only reliable solution was to refactor the code to avoid situations where aliasing could occur, rendering the `restrict` keyword completely useless.

Another instance involved working with a custom memory allocator in a real-time embedded system. The allocator returned memory blocks that were, by design, non-overlapping.  However, the compiler was unable to prove this non-overlapping nature, and the use of `restrict` did not result in any optimizations.

Consequently, the compiler is left with a choice: either aggressively optimize based on the possibly-incorrect assumption implied by `restrict`, leading to potentially undefined behavior, or ignore the `restrict` keyword entirely, avoiding the risk of introducing bugs but forfeiting optimization opportunities.  Most compiler developers opted for the latter, rendering `restrict` largely ineffective and, hence, unused.  While some compilers offer experimental support, the lack of standardization and guaranteed behavior across different compilers and optimization levels makes its usage highly impractical.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrative (Potentially Unsafe) Usage**

```c
void unsafe_function(int *restrict a, int *restrict b, int n) {
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    a[i] = b[i] * 2;
  }
}

int main() {
  int x[10], y[10];
  // ... initialization ...
  unsafe_function(x, y, 10); //Potentially undefined behavior if x and y alias
  return 0;
}
```

This example *appears* to be a safe use of `restrict`. However, if `x` and `y` happened to point to overlapping memory regions (e.g., through a subtle error in memory allocation or pointer manipulation), then the compiler's optimization based on the `restrict` keyword could lead to incorrect results or crashes.  The compiler cannot always statically determine if `x` and `y` are truly non-overlapping.

**Example 2:  Safe Alternative (Without `restrict`)**

```c++
void safe_function(std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
  if (a.size() != b.size()) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Vector sizes must match.");
  }
  for (size_t i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
    a[i] = b[i] * 2;
  }
}

int main() {
  std::vector<int> x(10), y(10);
  // ... initialization ...
  safe_function(x, y);
  return 0;
}
```

This example uses `std::vector`, which manages memory automatically and guarantees bounds-checking. This eliminates the risk of aliasing in a controlled way.  While there might be a slight performance overhead compared to using raw pointers, the added safety makes it a more robust solution in the absence of reliable `restrict` support.

**Example 3:  Illustrative Failure of `restrict` in Shared Memory**

```c++
//Illustrative - Shared memory access requires synchronization and is platform-dependent
void unsafe_shared_memory(int *restrict a, int *restrict b, int n) {
    // Assume 'a' and 'b' point to different regions of shared memory
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      a[i] = b[i] * 2;
    }
}

int main(){
    //....Shared memory allocation and initialization ...
    //No guarantees `restrict` will prevent race conditions
    unsafe_shared_memory(shared_a, shared_b, n);
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the failure of `restrict` in the context of shared memory. Even if the pointers point to different physical locations in shared memory, concurrent access can easily introduce aliasing violations that the compiler cannot detect.  Proper synchronization mechanisms (mutexes, semaphores, etc.) are necessary, regardless of the use of `restrict`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The C and C++ standards documents (ISO/IEC 9899 and ISO/IEC 14882, respectively).  Pay close attention to the sections detailing pointer behavior and type qualifiers.
* A reputable compiler documentation regarding optimization levels and the implementation details of type qualifiers.  Focus particularly on any notes or warnings concerning the `restrict` keyword.
* Advanced compiler optimization texts discussing the challenges of static alias analysis and pointer tracking.


In conclusion, while the `restrict` keyword offers potential performance benefits, its unreliability in practical C++ development due to difficulties in compiler implementation and verification of its assumptions makes it largely obsolete. Modern C++ programming practices generally favor safer, more robust alternatives like standard library containers and explicit memory management strategies, foregoing the potential performance gains of `restrict` for the sake of predictable and correct behavior.
