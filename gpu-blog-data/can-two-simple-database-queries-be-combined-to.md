Database query optimization frequently involves consolidating multiple operations into a single, more efficient statement.  The question of combining two simple queries to produce a single hash result hinges on the nature of those queries and the desired characteristics of the final hash.  My experience with large-scale data processing systems, particularly within the context of financial transaction auditing, necessitates precise control over data integrity and performance.  Therefore, a direct concatenation of query results followed by hashing is generally insufficient.  The correctness and efficiency depend entirely on the database system used, the data types involved, and the desired hashing algorithm.

The straightforward approach involves fetching the results of two separate queries and then performing the hashing operation in application code.  This is often the simplest method, especially when dealing with systems lacking advanced SQL capabilities or when the queries are significantly different.  However, this approach is inherently less efficient due to the additional data transfer between the database and the application.  Furthermore, it becomes less viable as the size of the datasets involved grows.

A more efficient, database-centric approach leverages SQL's aggregation and string concatenation functions to perform the consolidation within the database itself.  This minimizes data transfer and reduces the computational burden on the application server.  However, this requires careful consideration of data types and the potential for exceeding maximum string lengths within the database.  The choice of hashing algorithm must also align with the database's capabilities.  For instance, some databases may offer built-in hashing functions, while others might require the use of user-defined functions.

Finally,  a nuanced solution considering the specific needs and characteristics of the data could involve creating a temporary table to store intermediate results. This method enhances efficiency when dealing with queries that operate on large datasets and would otherwise lead to memory exhaustion or excessively long processing times in the application layer. The temporary table allows for optimized data manipulation within the database engine before the final hash calculation.  This approach, however, adds complexity in terms of database management and cleanup processes.

Let's illustrate these approaches with code examples using PostgreSQL, a database system I've extensively used in various projects.  These examples assume we have two tables: `users` with columns `id` (INT) and `username` (VARCHAR), and `orders` with columns `id` (INT), `user_id` (INT), and `amount` (DECIMAL).  The goal is to create a hash of the combined data for each user â€“ their username and the sum of their order amounts.

**Example 1: Application-Side Hashing**

```sql
-- Query 1: Retrieve usernames
SELECT username FROM users;

-- Query 2: Retrieve sum of order amounts per user
SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) AS total_amount FROM orders GROUP BY user_id;
```

```python
import hashlib

# Assume results from queries are stored in Python lists: usernames and user_totals
usernames = ['user1', 'user2', 'user3']
user_totals = [(1, 100.0), (2, 250.0), (3, 50.0)]

hashed_data = {}
for username, (user_id, total_amount) in zip(usernames, user_totals):
    combined_data = f"{username}:{total_amount}"
    hashed_data[user_id] = hashlib.sha256(combined_data.encode()).hexdigest()

print(hashed_data)
```

This example demonstrates the application-side approach.  It requires fetching data from two separate queries and then performing hashing within the application. This is less efficient than database-side processing for larger datasets. The use of `hashlib.sha256` is illustrative; other hashing algorithms are equally applicable.


**Example 2: Database-Side Hashing with String Concatenation**

```sql
SELECT
    u.id,
    sha256(u.username || ':' || COALESCE(SUM(o.amount), 0)::TEXT) as combined_hash
FROM
    users u
LEFT JOIN
    orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
GROUP BY
    u.id, u.username;
```

This example uses PostgreSQL's `sha256` function and string concatenation to perform the hashing directly within the database.  The `COALESCE` function handles cases where a user has no orders, preventing errors. This approach reduces data transfer and is generally more efficient than the application-side method.

**Example 3: Database-Side Hashing with a Temporary Table**

```sql
-- Create a temporary table to store intermediate results
CREATE TEMP TABLE user_order_totals AS
SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) AS total_amount FROM orders GROUP BY user_id;

-- Perform the final hash calculation using the temporary table
SELECT
    u.id,
    sha256(u.username || ':' || COALESCE(t.total_amount, 0)::TEXT) as combined_hash
FROM
    users u
LEFT JOIN
    user_order_totals t ON u.id = t.user_id;

-- Drop the temporary table
DROP TABLE user_order_totals;
```

This example demonstrates the use of a temporary table.  This is particularly beneficial for very large datasets. The temporary table pre-aggregates the order totals, optimizing the final join and hash calculation.  The cleanup step, dropping the temporary table, is crucial for good database hygiene.


Resource Recommendations:  For a deeper understanding, consult the official documentation for your specific database system, focusing on its string functions, aggregation functions, and available hashing algorithms.  Explore resources on SQL optimization techniques and database performance tuning.  Investigate different hashing algorithms and their security implications.  Finally, understand the trade-offs between application-side and database-side processing for data aggregation and hashing.  These elements are critical for effective and secure data handling in any system.
