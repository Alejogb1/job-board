Discrepancies in evaluation metrics when loading a model's state dictionary stem primarily from subtle differences in the model's internal state beyond the weight parameters explicitly saved.  My experience debugging this issue across numerous projects, involving both PyTorch and TensorFlow, has highlighted the critical role of buffer tensors, optimizer states, and even seemingly innocuous aspects of data preprocessing pipelines.  Let's examine these factors.

**1. The Role of Buffer Tensors:**

Many models, particularly those employing techniques like Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) or Layer Normalization (LayerNorm), maintain internal buffer tensors.  These tensors accumulate statistics during training, such as running means and variances for normalization layers.  These statistics are crucial for the model's inference behavior.  If the state dictionary only saves model weights and biases, neglecting these buffers, the loaded model will operate with uninitialized or default buffer values, leading to performance degradation. This is especially relevant in situations where the training and evaluation datasets differ significantly in statistical properties.

**2. Optimizer State:**

The optimizer's internal state, which includes momentum, gradient history, and other parameters specific to optimization algorithms like Adam or SGD, is not consistently saved within a model's state dictionary.  While the model's weights are updated, the optimizer's internal parameters track the optimization process. Loading just the model weights, without the optimizer state, can result in unexpected behavior.  For instance, resuming training from a checkpoint might lead to instability or different convergence patterns if the optimizer state isn't properly restored.  The resulting model, even with identical weights, might thus produce different evaluations.


**3. Data Preprocessing Discrepancies:**

A seemingly insignificant oversight, inconsistent data preprocessing between training and evaluation phases, frequently contributes to discrepancies.  Differences in data normalization, scaling, or augmentation procedures can profoundly affect the model's output and lead to disparities in evaluation metrics.  I've observed instances where seemingly minor variations in the random seed used for data augmentation resulted in significant discrepancies in evaluation scores, despite identical model weights.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: PyTorch - Correct loading with buffers and optimizer state:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple model with BatchNorm
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm1d(10)
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.bn(x)
        x = self.linear(x)
        return x

# Initialize model, optimizer, and training loop (simplified for brevity)
model = MyModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# ... training loop ...

# Save the entire state, including buffers and optimizer state.  This is crucial.
torch.save({
    'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),
    'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer.state_dict()
}, 'checkpoint.pth')

# Load the model and optimizer state
checkpoint = torch.load('checkpoint.pth')
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer_state_dict'])

# Evaluate the model
# ... evaluation loop ...
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates the correct procedure for saving and loading both the model's state dictionary and the optimizer's state dictionary.  The inclusion of the optimizer state is particularly crucial for resuming training or obtaining consistent results when evaluating after training. The `model.state_dict()` inherently includes the BatchNorm buffer statistics.


**Example 2: TensorFlow/Keras - Handling internal state:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple model with BatchNormalization
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.BatchNormalization(input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# ... training loop ...

# Save the model weights and architecture
model.save_weights('model_weights.h5')

# Recreate the model architecture (crucial for consistency)
new_model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.BatchNormalization(input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Load the weights
new_model.load_weights('model_weights.h5')

# Evaluate the model
# ...evaluation loop...
```

**Commentary:**  TensorFlow/Keras handles internal states slightly differently. While the `save_weights` method saves only the model parameters, the crucial step here is recreating the identical model architecture before loading weights using `load_weights`. This ensures that the internal structure, including the BatchNorm layers and their internal state, aligns perfectly between the trained and loaded models.  However, if the model has custom layers with internal state, careful management of that state is necessary.


**Example 3: Highlighting Data Preprocessing Impact (Illustrative):**

```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate data preprocessing differences
def preprocess_data(data, normalize=True):
    if normalize:
        return (data - np.mean(data)) / np.std(data)
    else:
        return data

# ... (Model definition and training loop using some model and data)...

# Evaluate with different preprocessing
eval_data = np.random.rand(100,10)

eval_results_normalized = model.evaluate(preprocess_data(eval_data), labels) # Normalized data
eval_results_unnormalized = model.evaluate(preprocess_data(eval_data, normalize=False), labels) # Unnormalized Data
```

**Commentary:** This example, although simplified, showcases the effect of data preprocessing.  In real-world scenarios, these differences could be more subtle.  For instance, applying different image augmentation techniques during training and evaluation or using slightly different data scaling factors could lead to evaluation discrepancies.  Ensuring exact replication of the entire data processing pipeline, from loading to final feature extraction, is fundamental for consistent results.



**Resource Recommendations:**

The official documentation for PyTorch and TensorFlow;  a thorough textbook on deep learning; a comprehensive guide to numerical computation in Python.  Exploring research papers on model reproducibility and best practices for machine learning experimentation would also be highly beneficial.  Understanding the intricacies of specific layers and their internal state mechanisms will be necessary to debug these types of issues effectively.
