The NVIDIA Visual Profiler (NVP) does not directly display concurrent kernel execution in a readily interpretable manner like a simple "yes/no" indicator.  My experience working on high-performance computing projects involving GPUs, including several years spent optimizing CUDA applications for large-scale simulations, has shown that understanding concurrent kernel execution within NVP requires a nuanced approach, involving careful interpretation of multiple metrics and potentially correlating them with other profiling tools.

**1. Explanation:**

NVP primarily focuses on profiling the execution of individual kernels. While it provides detailed information about kernel launch times, execution times, occupancy, memory accesses, and other relevant performance metrics, it doesn't explicitly visualize the overlapping execution of multiple kernels.  This is because concurrent kernel execution is fundamentally a characteristic of the GPU scheduler, an internal component not directly exposed within the NVP's primary interface. The scheduler manages the allocation of resources (SMs, registers, memory) to concurrently running kernels, aiming to maximize throughput.  However, the profiler's perspective remains kernel-centric; it tracks each kernel's progress independently.  Observing concurrency requires inferring it from the timing data of multiple kernels launched within a specific timeframe.

To infer concurrency, one must analyze the kernel launch and completion timestamps, ideally in conjunction with examining GPU utilization metrics. If the execution intervals of different kernels significantly overlap, this strongly suggests concurrent execution.  However, the degree of overlap does not directly translate to the level of simultaneous instruction execution within the Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs).  The scheduler's decisions are complex and depend on many factors, including kernel characteristics, available resources, and the overall workload.

Furthermore, apparent concurrency in the profiling data might be misleading.  For instance, a kernel might appear to execute concurrently with another, but in reality, its execution might be interspersed with the execution of the other kernel on different SMs. This is a common situation in GPUs designed for massively parallel computation. Therefore, a superficial analysis of kernel execution times can lead to inaccurate conclusions regarding true parallel processing within the hardware.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how to structure code to potentially facilitate the analysis of concurrent kernel execution in NVP. Remember that NVP itself doesn't explicitly show concurrency, but these examples highlight data that can be used to infer it.  All examples assume familiarity with CUDA programming.

**Example 1:  Simple Concurrency Test**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void kernel1() {
  // Some computation
}

__global__ void kernel2() {
  // Some computation
}

int main() {
  // ...  Resource allocation and data initialization ...

  cudaEvent_t start1, stop1, start2, stop2;
  cudaEventCreate(&start1);
  cudaEventCreate(&stop1);
  cudaEventCreate(&start2);
  cudaEventCreate(&stop2);


  cudaEventRecord(start1, 0);
  kernel1<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>();
  cudaEventRecord(stop1, 0);

  cudaEventRecord(start2, 0);
  kernel2<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>();
  cudaEventRecord(stop2, 0);

  cudaEventSynchronize(stop1);
  cudaEventSynchronize(stop2);

  float elapsedTime1, elapsedTime2;
  cudaEventElapsedTime(&elapsedTime1, start1, stop1);
  cudaEventElapsedTime(&elapsedTime2, start2, stop2);

  printf("Kernel 1 execution time: %f ms\n", elapsedTime1);
  printf("Kernel 2 execution time: %f ms\n", elapsedTime2);

  // ... Resource deallocation ...

  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This example uses CUDA events to time the execution of two kernels. By analyzing the reported execution times in NVP and comparing their start and end times, one can visually infer if the kernels executed concurrently (overlapping execution intervals).  Note: This only provides an indication; the degree of concurrency at the SM level remains hidden.


**Example 2:  Using Streams for Explicit Concurrency**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
// ... other includes ...

int main() {
    // ... resource allocation ...

    cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);

    kernel1<<<gridDim, blockDim, 0, stream1>>>();
    kernel2<<<gridDim, blockDim, 0, stream2>>>();

    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1);
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream2);

    // ... resource deallocation ...
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);

    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:**  This uses CUDA streams to explicitly launch kernels concurrently.  Each kernel is launched on a separate stream, allowing the GPU scheduler to potentially execute them in parallel.  NVP will still profile each kernel individually, but the timestamps will more clearly show overlap if the scheduler successfully executes them concurrently.


**Example 3:  Measuring GPU Utilization**

```cpp
// This example focuses on utilizing metrics *outside* the direct kernel profiling in NVP.
// It would require integrating with other profiling tools or custom monitoring.
//This is a conceptual outline and requires significant implementation detail.

// ... Code to capture GPU utilization metrics at regular intervals using NVIDIA's SMI or similar tools ...

// Analyze the utilization data to check if GPU utilization remains high during the kernel execution periods.
// High utilization during kernel execution strongly suggests concurrent processing.
//However, high utilization does not guarantee simultaneous instructions in SMs.

// ... Code to correlate utilization data with kernel execution times obtained from NVP.

```

**Commentary:** This example highlights that a more complete understanding of concurrency requires data beyond what NVP directly provides.  By incorporating GPU utilization metrics (obtained via tools like the NVIDIA System Management Interface – SMI), one can assess if the GPU's resources were fully utilized during the period when the kernels were ostensibly running concurrently, thus providing indirect evidence of concurrent execution.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The NVIDIA CUDA C++ Programming Guide.  Thorough understanding of CUDA is crucial for interpreting NVP data effectively.
*   The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation.  This contains comprehensive details on profiling tools and techniques.
*   A textbook on parallel computing and GPU architectures.  This provides the necessary theoretical background.



In conclusion, while NVIDIA Visual Profiler doesn't directly showcase concurrent kernel execution, a skilled developer can glean insights into this behavior by combining kernel timing data from NVP with additional information such as GPU utilization metrics. The key is to understand the limitations of NVP and employ a multi-faceted approach to profiling that complements the profiler’s core functionalities.  Properly interpreting this data necessitates a deep understanding of CUDA programming, GPU architecture, and parallel computing principles.
