The fundamental challenge when reconstructing strings from text vectorization in TensorFlow lies in the inherently lossy nature of the transformation. The TextVectorization layer, when configured with integer output mode, essentially maps unique tokens (words, characters, n-grams) to integer indices. This process discards the original textual form, preserving only its numerical representation based on a learned vocabulary. The inverse operation, transforming these integer indices back into human-readable strings, necessitates retaining and utilizing the vocabulary mapping generated during the layer's adaptation process.

To elaborate, the TextVectorization layer initially builds a vocabulary from the input training corpus. This vocabulary is a mapping between unique tokens and their corresponding integer indices. When the layer is used to vectorize new text, each token is replaced with its assigned index from this established mapping. The output, a sequence of integer indices, effectively represents the text in a numerical format suitable for machine learning models. Critically, this mapping isn't automatically inverted during the vectorization process. To reconstruct the string, one must explicitly access the vocabulary and reverse the lookup.

Here are three examples illustrating the process of converting predicted integer vectors back to strings, each highlighting different common scenarios:

**Example 1: Basic Token Reconstruction**

This example demonstrates a basic reconstruction process using the `get_vocabulary()` method and simple indexing. It presumes the simplest case where each token is represented by a single integer.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import TextVectorization
import numpy as np

# Hypothetical training data
training_data = ["the quick brown fox", "jumps over the lazy dog", "a fox jumps"]

# Initialize and adapt TextVectorization
vectorizer = TextVectorization(output_mode="int", output_sequence_length=10)
vectorizer.adapt(training_data)

# Vectorize sample input
sample_input = ["the fox jumps"]
vectorized_input = vectorizer(sample_input)
print(f"Vectorized input: {vectorized_input.numpy()}")

# Get vocabulary
vocabulary = vectorizer.get_vocabulary()

# Define a reverse lookup function
def vector_to_string(vector, vocab):
  string_list = [vocab[i] for i in vector if i < len(vocab) and i > 0]
  return " ".join(string_list)


# Reconstruct string
reconstructed_string = vector_to_string(vectorized_input.numpy()[0], vocabulary)
print(f"Reconstructed string: {reconstructed_string}")

# Expected output (will vary depending on padding and vocabulary):
# Vectorized input: [[2 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
# Reconstructed string: the fox jumps
```

In this instance, we initialize a `TextVectorization` layer with integer output. After adapting it to sample text, we vectorize a new input. The crucial part is the `vector_to_string` function. This function iterates through each integer in the input vector. It retrieves the corresponding token from the `vocabulary` based on its index. I've added an additional check to discard padded zeroes (`i < len(vocab) and i > 0`).  The recovered tokens are then joined by spaces, re-constructing a string.

**Example 2: Handling Unknown Tokens**

This case illustrates handling situations where the input text contains words not present in the training vocabulary, often termed "out-of-vocabulary" (OOV) tokens. This is a common occurrence with real-world text data. The `TextVectorization` layer will typically assign a special index for these OOV tokens (usually index 1 if a standard vocabulary is used), which typically corresponds to the "[UNK]" token in the vocabulary. We explicitly check for this.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import TextVectorization
import numpy as np

# Hypothetical training data
training_data = ["the quick brown fox", "jumps over the lazy dog"]

# Initialize and adapt TextVectorization
vectorizer = TextVectorization(output_mode="int", output_sequence_length=10)
vectorizer.adapt(training_data)

# Vectorize sample input containing an OOV token
sample_input = ["the fox quickly leaps"]
vectorized_input = vectorizer(sample_input)
print(f"Vectorized input: {vectorized_input.numpy()}")


# Get vocabulary
vocabulary = vectorizer.get_vocabulary()


# Define a reverse lookup function that replaces OOV tokens with "<UNK>"
def vector_to_string_unk(vector, vocab):
    string_list = []
    for i in vector:
        if i == 0:
          continue # Skip padded zeros
        elif i == 1:
          string_list.append("<UNK>")  # handle OOV tokens explicitly
        elif i < len(vocab):
          string_list.append(vocab[i])
    return " ".join(string_list)


# Reconstruct string
reconstructed_string = vector_to_string_unk(vectorized_input.numpy()[0], vocabulary)
print(f"Reconstructed string: {reconstructed_string}")

# Expected output:
# Vectorized input: [[2 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
# Reconstructed string: the fox <UNK> <UNK>
```
In this modified example, the input contains "quickly" and "leaps," words absent from the training data. The vectorization process assigns the OOV index (1) to these. The `vector_to_string_unk` function explicitly checks if an index is the OOV index (1) and replaces it with "<UNK>" string. This indicates which tokens are unknown to the original trained model.

**Example 3: Handling Multiple Sequences**

This case expands upon the previous examples, demonstrating how to process a batch of vectors. In machine learning, models typically process sequences of samples and not single instances.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import TextVectorization
import numpy as np

# Hypothetical training data
training_data = ["the quick brown fox", "jumps over the lazy dog", "a fox jumps high"]

# Initialize and adapt TextVectorization
vectorizer = TextVectorization(output_mode="int", output_sequence_length=10)
vectorizer.adapt(training_data)

# Vectorize a batch of input sequences
sample_input = ["the fox jumps", "a lazy dog", "a quick brown rabbit"]
vectorized_input = vectorizer(sample_input)
print(f"Vectorized input batch:\n{vectorized_input.numpy()}")

# Get vocabulary
vocabulary = vectorizer.get_vocabulary()


# Define a reverse lookup function for processing multiple vectors
def vectors_to_strings(vectors, vocab):
  string_list = []
  for vector in vectors:
      string_list.append(vector_to_string_unk(vector, vocab))
  return string_list


# Reconstruct strings from batch
reconstructed_strings = vectors_to_strings(vectorized_input.numpy(), vocabulary)
print(f"Reconstructed string batch: {reconstructed_strings}")

# Expected output:
# Vectorized input batch:
# [[ 2  5  3  0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
#  [ 6  8  9  0  0  0  0  0  0  0]
#  [ 6  4  7  1  0  0  0  0  0  0]]
# Reconstructed string batch: ['the fox jumps', 'a lazy dog', 'a quick brown <UNK>']
```
Here, the input is a list of three text strings. These are vectorized, resulting in a 2D tensor. The `vectors_to_strings` function iterates through each sequence of integers in the 2D tensor and calls the `vector_to_string_unk` function to reconstruct the corresponding string, adding the result to a list. It handles both OOV tokens and multiple sequences, making it applicable in a typical deep learning context. Note that the `vector_to_string_unk` function, from the previous example is reused.
