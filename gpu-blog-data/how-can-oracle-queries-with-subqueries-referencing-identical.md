Subqueries referencing tables already present in the parent query often lead to performance bottlenecks in Oracle.  My experience optimizing database queries for high-volume financial transactions has shown that the primary culprit is typically the redundant processing inherent in these correlated subqueries.  The database engine doesn't automatically recognize the shared table context, leading to repeated table scans or index lookups, even when the same data is readily available within the parent query's scope.  Efficient optimization strategies focus on eliminating this redundancy, leveraging the power of set-based operations and avoiding row-by-row processing.

**1.  Explanation of Optimization Techniques**

The core principle lies in reformulating the query to express the logic using joins and analytic functions instead of correlated subqueries.  Correlated subqueries, where the inner query depends on each row of the outer query, impose a significant performance penalty. This is particularly true for large datasets, as each row in the outer query necessitates a separate execution of the inner query.  This translates directly to increased I/O operations, CPU cycles, and overall query execution time.

The most effective approach involves carefully analyzing the relationship between the parent query and its subqueries.  Identifying common predicates and replacing them with equivalent join conditions is critical.  This allows the database optimizer to create a single execution plan that efficiently processes all relevant data at once.  Furthermore,  analytic functions offer a powerful alternative to subqueries when calculating aggregate values or ranking within the context of a specific partition.  This is often preferable to correlated subqueries, especially when dealing with aggregates such as `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, or `MIN`.

Beyond joins and analytic functions, using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) enhances readability and allows the optimizer to better analyze the query's structure.  CTEs can effectively decompose complex queries, which can lead to more efficient execution plans.  They facilitate the reuse of intermediate results, minimizing redundant computations and enhancing overall query performance.  Finally, appropriate indexing remains crucial.  Ensuring that the tables involved in the query have indexes on the columns used in join conditions or filtering predicates significantly impacts query performance.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate with three examples, progressively demonstrating increasingly sophisticated optimization techniques.  Assume we have a table `ORDERS` with columns `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `order_total`, and a table `CUSTOMERS` with columns `customer_id`, `customer_name`, and `customer_city`.


**Example 1:  Inefficient Correlated Subquery**

```sql
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.order_total,
    (SELECT AVG(order_total) FROM ORDERS o2 WHERE o2.customer_id = o.customer_id) AS avg_customer_order
FROM
    ORDERS o;
```

This query calculates the average order total for each customer using a correlated subquery.  For each row in `ORDERS`, the subquery re-evaluates the average for that specific customer.  This is highly inefficient for large datasets.


**Example 2:  Optimized using an Analytic Function**

```sql
SELECT
    order_id,
    order_total,
    AVG(order_total) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) AS avg_customer_order
FROM
    ORDERS;
```

This revised query utilizes the `AVG()` analytic function. The `PARTITION BY` clause effectively groups the data by `customer_id`, calculating the average order total for each customer within a single scan of the `ORDERS` table.  This drastically improves performance compared to the correlated subquery approach.


**Example 3:  Complex Scenario with Join and CTE**

Let's assume we need the average order total for each customer, along with the customer's city, and only for customers who placed an order after a certain date.

**Inefficient Version (Correlated Subquery):**

```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    c.customer_city,
    (SELECT AVG(o.order_total) FROM ORDERS o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id AND o.order_date > '01-JAN-2023') AS avg_order_total
FROM
    CUSTOMERS c
WHERE
    EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ORDERS o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id AND o.order_date > '01-JAN-2023');
```

**Optimized Version (Join and CTE):**

```sql
WITH
    CustomerOrders AS (
        SELECT
            customer_id,
            AVG(order_total) AS avg_order_total
        FROM
            ORDERS
        WHERE
            order_date > '01-JAN-2023'
        GROUP BY
            customer_id
    )
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    c.customer_city,
    co.avg_order_total
FROM
    CUSTOMERS c
JOIN
    CustomerOrders co ON c.customer_id = co.customer_id;

```

This version employs a CTE, `CustomerOrders`, to pre-calculate the average order totals for customers who placed orders after January 1st, 2023.  The main query then performs a simple join with the `CUSTOMERS` table, eliminating the costly correlated subquery.  The CTE improves readability and allows the optimizer to handle the average calculation separately and efficiently.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

To further your understanding, I recommend reviewing Oracle's official documentation on query optimization, specifically focusing on the use of joins, analytic functions, and Common Table Expressions.  Consult advanced SQL textbooks covering performance tuning techniques.  Familiarize yourself with the Oracle execution plan analysis tools, which provide insight into how the database processes your queries.  Understanding execution plans is instrumental in identifying performance bottlenecks and refining your queries.  Finally, consider taking a course or attending a workshop specializing in Oracle performance tuning.  Practical exercises and hands-on experience solidify understanding.
