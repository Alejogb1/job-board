The issue of ineffective stratification in `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` when dealing with 2D label arrays stems primarily from its internal logic being designed for 1D target variables, typically representing class labels in a classification context. I’ve observed this behavior multiple times across various projects, initially mistaking it for a bug until I delved deeper into the function’s source and the nuances of how stratification is implemented. When `train_test_split` receives a 2D label array, it interprets each *row* as a single sample’s multi-label representation, which is often not the desired outcome for those attempting to stratify based on the distribution of unique combinations of values within the array rather than within individual rows.

To elaborate, `train_test_split`’s stratification relies on calculating class frequencies within the provided target variable. When this target is a 1D array, it can directly tally the occurrences of each unique value, establishing a distribution for consistent split representation. However, a 2D array is inherently treated differently. Consider, for example, a situation where your label array represents the presence or absence of multiple attributes for each sample across columns. In this scenario, simply splitting based on row distribution fails to preserve the overall distribution of these attribute combinations, creating a significant imbalance that hinders model generalization, especially if some combinations are rare. Consequently, a straightforward call to `train_test_split` with `stratify=labels` where `labels` is a 2D array won’t yield a stratified split based on the distribution of the *unique rows* within the labels array as might be expected. It operates by viewing each row as independent labels and doesn't identify that certain rows, that contain particular combinations, are the critical stratification points.

The root of this discrepancy lies in how `train_test_split` computes the stratification distribution. If you trace the internal workings, you'll find that it utilizes the `_approximate_mode` function to identify groups with sufficient representation and uses these groups to perform the actual splitting, making sure that their ratio is preserved in the train/test sets. For 1D arrays, each unique label is a distinct group, and the proportions are correctly maintained. With a 2D label array, however, each row represents a potentially different ‘class’ from the stratification perspective, but internally `_approximate_mode` is trying to deal with each element independently rather than the full row. This leads to insufficient or, in some cases, completely absent stratification with respect to combinations. The function doesn't inherently "understand" that the stratification should occur based on the distinct *combinations* of column values, which are effectively represented by the unique rows of the 2D label array.

To achieve proper stratification with 2D labels, a preprocessing step becomes essential. You must convert the 2D label array into a 1D representation where each distinct row in the 2D array becomes a unique value. This can be accomplished through various means, usually involving stringifying the rows or encoding them with a unique integer. This is where I often use a `pandas.DataFrame` to get efficient access to converting a row to its string representation. After this conversion, the resulting 1D array can be used as the target in the `stratify` parameter of `train_test_split`, correctly preserving the overall label distribution.

Here are a few illustrative code examples showcasing the problem and demonstrating how to circumvent it.

**Example 1: The Problem - Incorrect Stratification**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Simulate a 2D label matrix
labels = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]])

X = np.arange(labels.shape[0]).reshape(-1, 1)  # Dummy data

# Attempt stratified split using 2D labels directly
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=labels
)

print("Original Labels:\n", labels)
print("Training Labels:\n", y_train)
print("Test Labels:\n", y_test)

# Count combinations in the original
unique_labels, counts_original = np.unique(labels, axis=0, return_counts=True)
print("Original Combination Counts:\n", dict(zip(map(tuple,unique_labels),counts_original)))

# Count combinations in train data
unique_train, counts_train = np.unique(y_train, axis=0, return_counts=True)
print("Train Combination Counts:\n", dict(zip(map(tuple,unique_train), counts_train)))

# Count combinations in test data
unique_test, counts_test = np.unique(y_test, axis=0, return_counts=True)
print("Test Combination Counts:\n", dict(zip(map(tuple,unique_test), counts_test)))
```

This code will demonstrate that the distribution of row combinations is not preserved across the training and test set. Because `train_test_split` doesn't interpret 2D labels as unique combinations, the stratification will often be close to random on these combinations. The resulting train/test split doesn't reflect the original distribution, even though the `stratify` argument is used.

**Example 2: Solution with String Encoding**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Simulate a 2D label matrix (same as before)
labels = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]])
X = np.arange(labels.shape[0]).reshape(-1, 1)

# Convert 2D labels to string for stratification
labels_str = pd.DataFrame(labels).astype(str).apply(lambda row: "_".join(row.values), axis=1)

# Perform stratified split using the new string labels
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=labels_str
)

print("Original Labels:\n", labels)
print("Training Labels:\n", y_train)
print("Test Labels:\n", y_test)

# Count combinations in the original
unique_labels, counts_original = np.unique(labels, axis=0, return_counts=True)
print("Original Combination Counts:\n", dict(zip(map(tuple,unique_labels),counts_original)))

# Count combinations in train data
unique_train, counts_train = np.unique(y_train, axis=0, return_counts=True)
print("Train Combination Counts:\n", dict(zip(map(tuple,unique_train), counts_train)))

# Count combinations in test data
unique_test, counts_test = np.unique(y_test, axis=0, return_counts=True)
print("Test Combination Counts:\n", dict(zip(map(tuple,unique_test), counts_test)))
```

This second example uses a `pandas.DataFrame` to convert each row into a string, effectively treating it as a single label for stratification. The resulting train/test sets now reflect the original distribution of row combinations much more faithfully. Using this approach will now allow `train_test_split` to achieve a proper stratified split based on all unique row combinations.

**Example 3: Solution with Integer Encoding**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Simulate a 2D label matrix (same as before)
labels = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]])
X = np.arange(labels.shape[0]).reshape(-1, 1)

# Convert 2D labels to integer for stratification
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
labels_str = pd.DataFrame(labels).astype(str).apply(lambda row: "_".join(row.values), axis=1)
labels_encoded = label_encoder.fit_transform(labels_str)

# Perform stratified split using the new integer labels
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify=labels_encoded
)

print("Original Labels:\n", labels)
print("Training Labels:\n", y_train)
print("Test Labels:\n", y_test)

# Count combinations in the original
unique_labels, counts_original = np.unique(labels, axis=0, return_counts=True)
print("Original Combination Counts:\n", dict(zip(map(tuple,unique_labels),counts_original)))

# Count combinations in train data
unique_train, counts_train = np.unique(y_train, axis=0, return_counts=True)
print("Train Combination Counts:\n", dict(zip(map(tuple,unique_train), counts_train)))

# Count combinations in test data
unique_test, counts_test = np.unique(y_test, axis=0, return_counts=True)
print("Test Combination Counts:\n", dict(zip(map(tuple,unique_test), counts_test)))
```

The final example uses a `LabelEncoder` to transform the string representation of rows into integers, achieving the same effect as the previous approach but using integer labels instead of strings. This is more efficient if you don't require the string representation of your labels later in the process.

For further understanding and practical application, I recommend delving into resources like the scikit-learn documentation, especially the section detailing model selection and splitting. Additionally, consulting community forums discussing specific issues encountered with multi-label or multi-output scenarios can be incredibly informative.  Exploring data preprocessing techniques in various texts, particularly when handling structured data with categorical features and complex label structures, will also prove beneficial. Finally, experiment with alternative strategies involving iterative stratification or methods designed explicitly for multi-label problems can deepen your understanding.
