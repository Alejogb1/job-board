Structs, while often perceived as simple data containers, present specific challenges to pass-by-reference optimization in mainstream programming languages, and my experience developing embedded systems firmware for the past decade has made this clear. The key issue arises from the inherent design goals of struct data types: memory layout predictability, value semantics, and compile-time size determination, all of which become problematic when directly applying pass-by-reference paradigms intended for dynamically-sized objects.

The core concept of pass-by-reference optimization revolves around avoiding the potentially costly copy operation when passing a data structure to a function. Instead of creating a new copy of the struct on the function call stack, a pointer (or reference) to the original struct's memory location is passed. This significantly reduces overhead, particularly with larger data structures. However, when dealing with structs, the benefits of this approach are often outweighed by subtle complexities and potential drawbacks. These complexities stem from the fundamental expectation that structs operate with value semantics â€“ that is, assignment and passing them should inherently create copies and the function should have its own independent version of the data.

Firstly, consider the compile-time knowledge aspect. Compilers can often optimize struct manipulation, particularly when dealing with local variables, through techniques like register allocation or inline expansions. The sizes of structs are well known and often fixed, and they can often be optimized to fit directly into registers or be copied very efficiently. Introducing pass-by-reference complicates this picture. It forces the compiler to treat the struct as a memory location rather than an immediate value, which limits certain optimizations. Direct memory accesses incur more overhead compared to directly operating on register values. This trade-off can be counterproductive, diminishing any gains from avoiding the copy. Furthermore, some architectures, especially embedded ones where I have the most experience, have limitations on pointer arithmetic or access to specific memory regions which might hinder the use of pointers to pass data, while register access might be optimal.

Secondly, and critically, pass-by-reference can break the expected value semantics of structs, particularly when there's modification of a parameter within the passed-to function. If a function modifies a struct passed by reference, that change will be directly visible in the caller's scope. This breaks the local reasoning most developers expect and makes it harder to reason about data flow. This change would have implications especially if such structs are stored within larger data structures which would then be changed in place if passed-by-reference. This can lead to unexpected side effects and difficult debugging experiences, violating the fundamental principle of encapsulating operations within the function scope. Programmers usually rely on the fact that after passing a struct to a function by value, the original struct remains unchanged in the calling scope. This paradigm of value semantics, where modifications within a function do not affect the original data, is a crucial aspect of reliable software development.

Thirdly, consider the complexities associated with concurrency. When multiple threads access the same struct passed-by-reference, without proper synchronization, there will be data races. Copying structs by value is, in many ways, inherently safer for concurrent programming as each thread deals with its own copy. Although concurrency could also be implemented via reference using synchronization mechanisms, it adds another layer of complexity which might not be desired just to reduce copying overhead. Value semantics often provide an implicit safety net for multithreaded applications which pass struct variables.

Let's explore this with some practical examples. In the following C++ code snippets, assume a simple struct named `Point` which stores x and y coordinates.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Point {
  int x;
  int y;
};

void modifyPointByValue(Point p) {
  p.x += 10;
  p.y += 20;
}

void modifyPointByReference(Point &p) {
  p.x += 10;
  p.y += 20;
}

int main() {
  Point myPoint = {1, 2};
  std::cout << "Original Point: (" << myPoint.x << ", " << myPoint.y << ")\n";

  modifyPointByValue(myPoint);
  std::cout << "Point after modifyByValue: (" << myPoint.x << ", " << myPoint.y << ")\n";

  modifyPointByReference(myPoint);
    std::cout << "Point after modifyByReference: (" << myPoint.x << ", " << myPoint.y << ")\n";

  return 0;
}
```

In this first example, the `modifyPointByValue` function receives a copy of the struct. Changes to `p` within the function do not affect `myPoint` within the main function, thus maintaining the value semantics. However, `modifyPointByReference` operates directly on the memory location of `myPoint`, resulting in visible modifications. This showcases the risk of implicit side effects. The output will be:

```
Original Point: (1, 2)
Point after modifyByValue: (1, 2)
Point after modifyByReference: (11, 22)
```
The second code snippet looks at larger data structures.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

struct BigData {
    std::array<int, 100> data;
};

void modifyBigDataByValue(BigData data) {
    data.data[0] = 99;
}

void modifyBigDataByReference(BigData& data) {
  data.data[0] = 99;
}

int main() {
    BigData myData;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        myData.data[i] = i;
    }

    std::cout << "Before modifyByValue: " << myData.data[0] << "\n";
    modifyBigDataByValue(myData);
    std::cout << "After modifyByValue: " << myData.data[0] << "\n";

    std::cout << "Before modifyByReference: " << myData.data[0] << "\n";
    modifyBigDataByReference(myData);
    std::cout << "After modifyByReference: " << myData.data[0] << "\n";


    return 0;
}
```

This example, demonstrates a large struct and shows that even though the by value copy of `BigData` might be more costly in copying, it still maintains the original intended behavior, while passing-by-reference changes the calling function. The output will be:

```
Before modifyByValue: 0
After modifyByValue: 0
Before modifyByReference: 0
After modifyByReference: 99
```

Finally, let us look at how this might impact concurrency:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>

struct Counter {
    int value;
};

void incrementCounterByValue(Counter c) {
    for (int i=0; i<100000; ++i)
       c.value++;
}

void incrementCounterByReference(Counter& c) {
    for (int i=0; i<100000; ++i)
        c.value++;
}

int main() {
    Counter counter1{0};
    Counter counter2{0};

   std::thread t1(incrementCounterByValue, counter1);
   std::thread t2(incrementCounterByValue, counter1);

   t1.join();
   t2.join();

    std::cout << "Counter by Value final value: " << counter1.value << "\n";

    std::thread t3(incrementCounterByReference, std::ref(counter2));
    std::thread t4(incrementCounterByReference, std::ref(counter2));

    t3.join();
    t4.join();

    std::cout << "Counter by Reference final value: " << counter2.value << "\n";


    return 0;
}
```
In this last example, while the value passed by copy version gives a result of `0` because the counter is not shared across threads, the passed-by-reference version will give us a total count of 200000 as expected. Without proper synchronization, both of the threads might create data races that may lead to unexpected outcomes when operating on a reference instead of separate variables. This emphasizes the importance of considering concurrent operations when deciding between by-value and by-reference.

For further understanding and deeper study of struct handling and memory management within different languages, I suggest reviewing resources such as "Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied" by Andrei Alexandrescu, which delves into efficient coding techniques, and "Effective C++" by Scott Meyers which includes best practices for C++ design, particularly around value vs reference semantics. For language-agnostic understanding of memory structures and memory access, "Computer Organization and Design" by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy is also useful.

In conclusion, while pass-by-reference appears to offer potential performance gains for structs by avoiding data copying, its implementation often introduces subtle complications and breaks the expected value semantics and can introduce concurrency issues. The benefits are frequently counterbalanced by the loss of optimization opportunities and by compromising predictable program behavior. It is important to use it judiciously and only after carefully weighing the pros and cons, particularly with data structures that will be passed across multiple functions or in a multithreaded setting. While there may be specific performance critical cases where reference might be a choice to explore, the default design decision for structs would be to operate through copies and value semantics.
