The discrepancy between the expected weight tensor shape of [1000] and the observed shape of [5] stems from a misalignment between the model's architecture and the intended classification task.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous deep learning projects, particularly those involving custom loss functions or data preprocessing, this often points to an unintended reduction in dimensionality within the final layer.  The weight tensor, in this case, doesn't represent weights for all 1000 classes, but rather for a reduced set of 5 internal parameters influencing the final output.  This reduction likely occurs *before* the final prediction layer.

The fundamental problem is one of dimensionality mismatch.  The model architecture has, in effect, compressed the representation of the 1000 classes into a 5-dimensional space before the output layer produces a prediction. This can happen in several ways, each requiring a careful review of the model's design and associated data transformations.

**1.  Incorrect Output Layer Definition:**

The most common cause is an incorrectly configured output layer. If the final layer's weight matrix is not appropriately sized (meaning it does not have 1000 columns corresponding to the 1000 classes), the weight tensor will reflect this smaller dimension.  This misconfiguration often stems from using a fully connected layer with an incorrect number of output units.


**Code Example 1: Incorrect Output Layer**

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(1024, 512)  # Example intermediate layer
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, 5)    # Incorrect output layer: only 5 units

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = nn.functional.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x  # Output is 5-dimensional

model = MyModel()
print(model.fc2.weight.shape) # Output: torch.Size([5, 512])
```

In this example, `self.fc2` is defined with only 5 output units.  Regardless of the input data representing 1000 classes, the weight tensor associated with this layer will only have 5 rows, reflecting the reduced dimensionality.  The solution here is to adjust the `nn.Linear` layer's output size to 1000.


**2.  Hidden Dimensionality Reduction:**

Another possibility involves a dimensionality reduction technique earlier in the model, for instance, a bottleneck layer, or a principal component analysis (PCA) step applied to the features before the final classification layer.  If the dimensionality is reduced to 5 before the final layer receives the input, the final layer will only need 5 corresponding weights per class, resulting in the observed [5] shape.  This is a less obvious cause and often arises from overzealous feature engineering or model complexity reduction attempts.

**Code Example 2: PCA-based Dimensionality Reduction**

```python
import torch
import sklearn.decomposition as decomposition

# ... (Assume 'features' is a tensor of shape [batch_size, 1000]) ...

pca = decomposition.PCA(n_components=5)
reduced_features = pca.fit_transform(features.detach().numpy()) # Reduce to 5 components
reduced_features = torch.tensor(reduced_features, dtype=torch.float32)

# ... (Final layer processing reduced_features) ...

# Subsequent layer with weights of shape [1000, 5]
# This configuration would be incorrect, since PCA already reduced the dim
```

Here, PCA reduces the feature dimension to 5.  The subsequent classification layer needs to accommodate this and should not expect a 1000-dimensional input. The [5] weight tensor shape would then be correct within the context of this reduced representation, although the model's performance would likely suffer due to information loss. The solution lies in either removing the PCA or adapting the final layer to accept the reduced dimensionality if this dimensionality reduction is intentional.

**3.  Custom Loss Function Mismatch:**

Finally, a custom loss function could inadvertently introduce the [5] shape. A poorly designed custom loss function might only operate on a subset of the model's output, implicitly focusing on only 5 dimensions. This would manifest as a [5]-shaped weight tensor, even if the final layer's output theoretically considers 1000 classes.  This scenario requires a thorough understanding of the loss function's implementation and its interaction with the model's output.

**Code Example 3:  Custom Loss Function operating on a subset**


```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyLoss, self).__init__()
    def forward(self, output, target):
        #  Only considering first 5 elements of output
        return nn.functional.cross_entropy(output[:, :5], target[:, :5]) # Incorrect usage

model = MyModel() #MyModel defined as in example 1 but with 1000 output units in the last layer
criterion = MyLoss()
# ... (training loop) ...
```

Here, even if `model` outputs a 1000-dimensional vector, the loss function only considers the first 5 dimensions.  This would cause the optimizer to predominantly focus on these five dimensions, effectively ignoring the remaining 995. The weight tensor might show a [5] structure  (depending on the specifics of the optimizer and the model’s architecture), misleadingly suggesting a mismatch unrelated to the final layer. The solution would involve modifying the loss function to accurately encompass all 1000 classes.

**Resource Recommendations:**

*   Consult the official documentation for the deep learning framework being used (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).
*   Review relevant texts on deep learning architecture and loss functions.
*   Debugging tools provided by the deep learning framework.  These often include tools to inspect intermediate layer activations and gradients, allowing you to pinpoint exactly where the dimensionality reduction is occurring.
*   A comprehensive understanding of linear algebra and its application to neural networks.


In conclusion, a [5] shaped weight tensor when a [1000] shape is expected almost certainly points to a dimensionality reduction occurring within the model's architecture or within the loss function calculation itself, significantly before the final prediction. A methodical review of each layer’s configuration, the loss function, and any preprocessing steps involving dimensionality reduction is crucial to diagnose and correct this issue.  Careful attention to the dimensions of each tensor at every stage of the forward pass will usually reveal the source of the problem.
