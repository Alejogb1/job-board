The core challenge in reshaping a PyTorch tensor from (C, B, H) to (B, C*H) lies in understanding the inherent data organization and leveraging PyTorch's `view` or `reshape` functions correctly.  My experience working with large-scale image processing pipelines in medical imaging emphasized the importance of efficient tensor manipulation, and this specific transformation is frequently encountered when preparing data for recurrent neural networks or other architectures expecting a particular input format.  Improper handling can lead to data corruption or inefficient memory usage.

The original shape (C, B, H) likely represents data where 'C' denotes the number of channels (e.g., RGB in images), 'B' represents the batch size, and 'H' represents the height of a feature map (assuming a spatial dimension). The target shape (B, C*H) implies a reorganization where the batch dimension becomes the leading dimension, and the channel and height dimensions are concatenated into a single feature vector for each sample in the batch.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The transformation requires a reinterpretation of the memory layout.  The total number of elements must remain constant.  Therefore, the product of the dimensions in the source shape (C * B * H) must equal the product of the dimensions in the target shape (B * C * H).  This condition is inherently satisfied.  The crucial step is to rearrange the order of the dimensions and explicitly inform PyTorch about the desired new layout.  Simply multiplying C and H and then assigning it to a new dimension isn't sufficient;  PyTorch needs a detailed specification of the new ordering.  This is achieved using the `view` or `reshape` functions.  `view` returns a view of the original tensor, sharing the underlying data; changes to this view will be reflected in the original tensor. `reshape`, on the other hand, creates a copy, allowing independent modification without affecting the original.  Choosing between the two depends on memory considerations and the desired behavior.  For memory efficiency, `view` should be preferred when possible.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `view`**

```python
import torch

# Sample tensor with shape (C, B, H)
tensor = torch.randn(3, 2, 4)  # C=3, B=2, H=4

# Reshape using view
reshaped_tensor = tensor.view(2, 3 * 4) # B=2, C*H = 12

# Verify shape
print(reshaped_tensor.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([2, 12])

# Demonstrate that view shares memory
reshaped_tensor[0, 0] = 100
print(tensor[0,0,0]) # Output: 100
```

This example shows the basic application of `view`. The code creates a random tensor with the specified shape, then uses `view` to create a new tensor with the desired (B, C*H) shape. The final assertion confirms the shape and demonstrates the shared memory characteristic of `view`.

**Example 2: Using `reshape`**

```python
import torch

# Sample tensor with shape (C, B, H)
tensor = torch.randn(3, 2, 4)  # C=3, B=2, H=4

# Reshape using reshape
reshaped_tensor = tensor.reshape(2, 3 * 4)  # B=2, C*H = 12

# Verify shape
print(reshaped_tensor.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([2, 12])

# Demonstrate that reshape creates a copy
reshaped_tensor[0, 0] = 100
print(tensor[0,0,0]) # Output: (Original Value) - Not modified
```

This example is identical to the first except for the use of `reshape`.  The key difference is demonstrated in the final assertion, proving that modifications to `reshaped_tensor` do not affect the original `tensor`.

**Example 3: Handling potential errors and edge cases**

```python
import torch

# Sample tensor with shape (C, B, H)
tensor = torch.randn(3, 2, 4)  # C=3, B=2, H=4

try:
    #Attempting invalid reshape that would change the number of elements
    invalid_reshape = tensor.reshape(2,13)
    print(invalid_reshape)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Reshape failed: {e}")

#Correct reshape using -1 to automatically calculate one dimension
correct_reshape = tensor.reshape(2,-1)
print(f"Correct Reshape: {correct_reshape.shape}") #Output: Correct Reshape: torch.Size([2, 12])


```

This example highlights the importance of error handling. It demonstrates an attempt to reshape the tensor into an incompatible size, which will result in a `RuntimeError`. The use of `-1` as one of the dimensions is a powerful feature in PyTorch allowing automatic calculation of the size based on the remaining specified dimensions and the total number of elements. This is very useful for more complex reshaping scenarios and simplifies the code.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation is an indispensable resource.  Pay close attention to the sections on tensor manipulation and the detailed explanations of `view` and `reshape` functions.  A comprehensive guide on linear algebra would be beneficial in understanding the underlying principles of tensor reshaping and the implications of different dimension ordering.  Finally, a good introduction to numerical computing with Python would provide a broader context for the application of these techniques.
