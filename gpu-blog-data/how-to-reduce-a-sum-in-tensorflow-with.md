TensorFlow's `tf.reduce_sum` operates on all elements within a tensor by default.  Conditional summation necessitates a more nuanced approach, leveraging TensorFlow's conditional execution capabilities and potentially sparse tensor representations for efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets. My experience implementing high-performance recommendation systems highlighted this need repeatedly, specifically when calculating weighted sums based on user preferences and item relevance scores.  This often involved filtering tensors based on criteria before aggregation.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The core challenge lies in selecting a subset of tensor elements based on a predefined condition before performing the summation.  This cannot be directly achieved with `tf.reduce_sum` alone.  We must first generate a mask or indicator tensor based on the condition. This mask will be of the same shape as the input tensor, with 'True' values where the condition holds and 'False' otherwise. Subsequently, we use element-wise multiplication between this boolean mask (cast to a suitable numeric type) and the input tensor to effectively zero out elements that do not satisfy the condition. Finally, `tf.reduce_sum` can be applied to this filtered tensor.  For optimal performance with sparse conditions (where many elements fail the condition), leveraging sparse tensors offers significant computational advantages.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Conditional Summation using Boolean Masking**

This example demonstrates the fundamental approach using boolean masking.  We'll calculate the sum of positive elements in a tensor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
tensor = tf.constant([-1, 2, -3, 4, -5, 6])

# Condition: element > 0
condition = tensor > 0

# Cast boolean mask to float32 for element-wise multiplication
mask = tf.cast(condition, tf.float32)

# Apply mask and sum
conditional_sum = tf.reduce_sum(tensor * mask)

# Print the result
print(f"Conditional sum of positive elements: {conditional_sum.numpy()}") 
```

This code first defines a condition (`tensor > 0`) which results in a boolean tensor.  The `tf.cast` function converts this boolean tensor to a numeric type (here, `tf.float32`) enabling element-wise multiplication with the original tensor.  Elements where the condition is false become zero after multiplication, leaving only the positive elements to contribute to the final sum.


**Example 2: Conditional Summation with tf.where**

`tf.where` provides a more concise alternative for creating the mask, particularly helpful for more complex conditions. This example computes the sum of elements within a specific range.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([1, 5, 2, 8, 3, 6])

#Condition: 3 <= element <= 6
conditional_sum = tf.reduce_sum(tf.where((tensor >= 3) & (tensor <= 6), tensor, tf.zeros_like(tensor)))

print(f"Conditional sum of elements between 3 and 6: {conditional_sum.numpy()}")
```

Here, `tf.where` directly selects elements satisfying the condition (3 <= element <= 6) and replaces others with zeros. This simplifies the masking process compared to Example 1.  The `&` operator performs element-wise logical AND.


**Example 3:  Leveraging Sparse Tensors for Efficiency (Sparse Condition)**

This example demonstrates the benefit of sparse tensors when the condition is rarely met. This is crucial for scalability with large tensors.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor (replace with your large tensor)
dense_tensor = tf.random.normal([100000,100]) # Example large tensor
condition = tf.random.uniform([100000,100], maxval=100, dtype=tf.int32) > 95  #Sparse condition

#Convert to sparse tensor if condition is sparse
indices = tf.where(condition)
values = tf.gather_nd(dense_tensor, indices)
shape = tf.shape(dense_tensor, out_type=tf.int64)
sparse_tensor = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(indices, values, shape)

# Sum the sparse tensor
conditional_sum = tf.sparse.reduce_sum(sparse_tensor)

print(f"Conditional sum using sparse tensor: {conditional_sum.numpy()}")
```

In this scenario, we assume a sparsely satisfied condition.  The code explicitly converts the tensor and condition into a sparse representation (`tf.sparse.SparseTensor`).  `tf.sparse.reduce_sum` then efficiently sums only the non-zero elements, drastically reducing computational cost compared to operations on the dense tensor.  The indices and values represent the non-zero elements, and `shape` provides the dimensions of the original dense tensor.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive information on tensor manipulation, conditional operations, and sparse tensor usage.  Explore the sections on `tf.reduce_sum`, boolean masking, `tf.where`, and sparse tensor operations for a deeper understanding.  Furthermore, studying advanced TensorFlow techniques for optimized tensor manipulation would be beneficial.  Consult materials on numerical computation and linear algebra to better grasp the underlying mathematical principles involved in these operations.  Finally, reviewing best practices for efficient TensorFlow coding will improve code performance and readability.
