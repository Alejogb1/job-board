The core issue with using `make_tensor_proto` without the full TensorFlow installation hinges on its deep integration within the TensorFlow ecosystem.  While the function itself might appear modular, its dependencies—primarily protobuf serialization and internal TensorFlow data structures—are not readily available as standalone packages.  My experience working on large-scale data processing pipelines for several years, including extensive TensorFlow deployment within resource-constrained environments, has consistently reinforced this limitation.  Attempting to circumvent this through partial installation or manual dependency resolution is generally impractical and ultimately unreliable.

**1. Explanation:**

The `make_tensor_proto` function is not a freestanding utility. It's a function within the TensorFlow library specifically designed to convert various Python data structures (like NumPy arrays) into the `TensorProto` format used for serializing tensors. This format is fundamental to TensorFlow's internal representation and communication mechanisms.  Therefore, relying solely on this function implies access to the machinery that handles:

* **Protobuf Serialization:** The `TensorProto` itself is defined using Protocol Buffers (protobuf).  TensorFlow leverages protobuf for efficient data serialization and transfer.  While the protobuf library can be installed independently, the specific `TensorProto` definition used by TensorFlow is inextricably linked to the TensorFlow library itself.  Simply having the protobuf compiler and runtime is insufficient. The correct `TensorProto` message definition, specific to the TensorFlow version, needs to be available.

* **TensorFlow Data Structures:**  `make_tensor_proto` implicitly relies on TensorFlow's internal data structures and type handling.  These structures are integral to TensorFlow's tensor manipulation routines.  Trying to isolate `make_tensor_proto` necessarily involves extracting these dependencies as well, a task of significant complexity, and one that would ultimately break with minor TensorFlow updates.

* **Dependency Management:** Even if one were to successfully isolate the necessary dependencies, managing the versions of these dependencies to ensure compatibility with `make_tensor_proto` would pose a significant ongoing challenge.  The likelihood of encountering version conflicts or incompatibilities is high, leading to instability and runtime errors.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Attempting to use `make_tensor_proto` without the full TensorFlow installation will invariably result in `ImportError` exceptions.  The following examples illustrate this and highlight the necessary context.

**Example 1:  Direct Import (Fails):**

```python
# This will fail if TensorFlow is not installed.
import tensorflow as tf

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
tensor_proto = tf.make_tensor_proto(data, dtype=tf.int32)
print(tensor_proto)
```

This code snippet demonstrates the standard usage of `make_tensor_proto`. The import statement directly accesses the TensorFlow library.  Without the library installed, the `import tensorflow as tf` line will raise an `ImportError`.


**Example 2:  Simulated Partial Installation (Fails):**

```python
# This attempt to simulate extracting parts of TensorFlow will fail.
# It's for illustrative purposes only. This code will not work.
# Assume a hypothetical "tf_proto_utils" module existed (it doesn't)

try:
    import tf_proto_utils as tfp  # Hypothetical module, DOES NOT EXIST
    data = [10,20,30]
    tensor_proto = tfp.make_tensor_proto(data, dtype = tfp.int32) #Hypothetical
    print(tensor_proto)
except ImportError:
    print("Error: Missing required modules.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This example attempts to simulate a scenario where a hypothetical module `tf_proto_utils` contains only the necessary parts for `make_tensor_proto`. This is a highly unrealistic scenario.  Even if such a module were created (a monumental undertaking), maintaining its compatibility with future TensorFlow versions would be nearly impossible.


**Example 3:  Correct Installation (Works):**

```python
# This is the correct way to use make_tensor_proto, requiring a full TensorFlow installation.
import tensorflow as tf

numpy_array = tf.constant([[1,2],[3,4]])
tensor_proto = tf.make_tensor_proto(numpy_array.numpy(), shape=numpy_array.shape, dtype=numpy_array.dtype)
print(tensor_proto)
```

This code snippet showcases the proper and functional usage of `make_tensor_proto` within a properly installed TensorFlow environment.  This underscores the fact that the function is tightly bound to the complete library.  Note the use of `numpy_array.numpy()` to ensure that the input is a NumPy array which is handled more efficiently by `make_tensor_proto`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For serialization of tensor data outside the context of TensorFlow, consider exploring alternative serialization libraries.  Investigate the protobuf library directly to understand its capabilities for custom message definitions.  Exploring alternative deep learning frameworks and their respective serialization mechanisms would provide valuable comparative understanding.  Finally, a deep dive into the TensorFlow source code itself could shed light on the intricate dependencies involved in the `make_tensor_proto` function.  This will highlight the complexity of isolating this function from the rest of the library.  Refer to official TensorFlow documentation for complete and up-to-date information on tensor manipulation and serialization best practices.
