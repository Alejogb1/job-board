The fundamental misconception underlying the question stems from a misunderstanding of the `try...except` block's operational semantics in exception handling.  An exception, once raised, doesn't linger in some intermediate state awaiting handling; its propagation is immediate and unidirectional.  Therefore, attempting to handle an exception *after* a `try` block is inherently impossible within the established execution flow.  The `except` block is intrinsically linked to the preceding `try` block; it's the designated handler for exceptions raised *within* that specific `try` block's scope. My experience debugging large-scale data processing pipelines has repeatedly highlighted the importance of this precise relationship.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Exception handling is a crucial aspect of robust software design, enabling graceful responses to runtime errors.  The `try...except` construct operates on a defined scope. When an exception is raised inside the `try` block, the Python interpreter immediately searches for a matching `except` clause within the same `try...except` block.  If a matching handler is found, the code within that `except` block is executed.  If no matching handler is present, the exception propagates up the call stack, searching for an appropriate handler in the calling function, and so on.  If no handler is found anywhere along the call stack, the program terminates, typically displaying an error message.

Critically, the search for an exception handler is not a global, post-execution scan.  It's a local, immediate response within the context of the `try` block.  Once the `try` block’s execution completes either normally or via an exception’s handling, the flow of control continues to the statement immediately following the `try...except` block.  There is no mechanism for the interpreter to retroactively handle an exception that has already been raised and either handled or propagated beyond the `try...except` construct.  Attempting to do so will lead to either a runtime error (if the exception hasn't been handled by a preceding block) or simply continue execution as if the exception never occurred (if the exception was already handled).

This mechanism, although seemingly restrictive, promotes clarity and predictability.  It enforces a clear delineation of error handling logic, preventing ambiguous code where the handling of a specific exception is unclear. It also prevents unintended side effects where an exception, already addressed, might be mistakenly handled twice.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Correct Exception Handling**

```python
def process_data(data):
    try:
        result = int(data)  # Potential ValueError
        return result * 2
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error converting data: {e}")
        return None

data = "abc"
processed_data = process_data(data)
if processed_data is None:
    print("Data processing failed.")

```

In this example, the `ValueError` is handled directly within the `try...except` block.  The `except` block intercepts the exception, prints an error message, and returns `None` to signal failure. The subsequent conditional statement correctly checks the return value to manage the consequence of the exception.  This is the proper, established way to handle exceptions.


**Example 2: Illustrating the Problem**

```python
def process_data(data):
    try:
        result = int(data)  # Potential ValueError
        return result * 2
    except ValueError:
        pass # Exception handled here

    # Attempting to handle the exception *after* the try block – Incorrect
    if isinstance(result, ValueError): # This is incorrect. result will be an integer or None.
        print("ValueError occurred - This will not execute as intended")


data = "abc"
processed_data = process_data(data)
print(processed_data) # Output: None


```

This illustrates the flawed approach.  The `if isinstance(result, ValueError)` check is fundamentally incorrect.  After the `try` block, either `result` will have a valid integer value (if the conversion succeeded) or will be `None` (if the `ValueError` was caught within the `try...except`). `result` will never be a `ValueError` object itself. Attempting to catch the exception in this manner won't work.


**Example 3: Exception Propagation**

```python
def process_data(data):
    try:
        result = int(data)
        return result * 2
    except TypeError:
        print("TypeError occurred within process_data")
        raise # Re-raise the exception

def main():
    try:
        result = process_data("abc")  #ValueError will occur here, TypeError is not raised.
        print(f"Processed data: {result}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Caught ValueError in main: {e}")

main()
```

Here, `process_data` handles a `TypeError` but re-raises any other exceptions using `raise`. This allows the `ValueError` (raised when attempting to convert "abc" to an integer) to propagate up to `main`, where it's caught and handled.  This demonstrates the proper use of exception propagation – the handling occurs along the call stack, but still within the framework of structured exception handling and not after a `try` block has concluded.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I'd recommend consulting the official Python documentation on exception handling.  Exploring resources on structured exception handling in programming is also beneficial.  A thorough review of best practices in error handling and defensive programming will further solidify your understanding.  Studying advanced topics like custom exception classes and context managers will also enhance your capabilities.  Finally, practical experience, through diligent coding and debugging, is invaluable for mastering exception handling techniques.
