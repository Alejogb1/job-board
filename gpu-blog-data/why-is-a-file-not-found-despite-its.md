The apparent paradox of a file not being found despite its confirmed presence stems from a mismatch between the program's perceived file location and the actual location on the file system. In my experience developing cross-platform applications, I've frequently encountered this, and it almost invariably boils down to issues with the path resolution used by the application, which is often more intricate than simply typing the filename into a text editor.

At the core of this problem lies the distinction between absolute and relative paths. An absolute path defines the file's location from the root of the file system (e.g., `/home/user/documents/myfile.txt` on Linux or `C:\Users\User\Documents\myfile.txt` on Windows). A relative path, on the other hand, specifies the file location concerning the program's current working directory. This directory is not necessarily the same as the folder containing the program executable or source code. Failure to account for this fundamental difference leads to 'file not found' errors, even when the file is physically present.

The specific circumstances that cause path resolution issues are varied but often rooted in common mistakes. The most prevalent cause I've observed involves misinterpreting the application's current working directory. When an application runs, its working directory is set based on how it was launched. If you double-click an executable, the operating system usually sets the working directory to the folder containing the executable. If you execute it from a command prompt, the working directory is often the current directory of the command prompt. If a script is invoked from another script or service, its working directory may be even further removed from where you expect it.  Therefore, relying on relative paths without considering how the application is launched is a prime recipe for errors. Another contributing factor arises from unintentional path manipulation errors within the code itself, leading to incorrect path construction.

Let’s consider some practical code examples illustrating these concepts:

**Example 1: Relative Path Issue in Python**

```python
import os

def read_file(filename):
  try:
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
      content = file.read()
      print(content)
  except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: File '{filename}' not found.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
  # Scenario 1: File in the same directory as script
  read_file("my_data.txt")

  # Scenario 2: Explicit relative path (assuming a 'data' subfolder)
  read_file("data/my_data.txt")

  # Output depends on where the script was launched from
  print(f"Current working directory: {os.getcwd()}")
```

In this Python example, `read_file("my_data.txt")` assumes that `my_data.txt` exists in the same directory as the python script. If it does not, or if you run this script from a different directory via the command line, it will produce a `FileNotFoundError`. The second call `read_file("data/my_data.txt")` expects a subdirectory named `data` containing the file. It works if the relative path is valid, given the current working directory. Note that it does not check if the subfolder exists but will throw a FileNotFoundError if it doesn’t find the file.  The final print statement is included to help diagnose where the script is looking. This highlights how relative paths' behavior are sensitive to the context of execution. When working with Python, libraries such as `os.path` can be useful to construct paths more robustly.

**Example 2: Java Path Resolution Problem**

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class FileReader {

    public static void readFile(String filePath) {
        Path path = Paths.get(filePath);
        try {
            String content = Files.readString(path);
            System.out.println(content);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: File '" + filePath + "' not found or could not be read.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
       //Scenario 1: File in root level
       readFile("my_data.txt");

       //Scenario 2: File in the folder 'resources' under the project root
       readFile("resources/my_data.txt");
    }
}
```

This Java code demonstrates a similar issue. The `Paths.get(filePath)` method interprets the provided string as a relative path if it does not begin with a root path indicator (like `/` or `C:\`). Thus, if you launch the `FileReader.class` from the terminal without navigating to the folder containing the `my_data.txt` file, it will result in an `IOException`, indicating the file isn’t found, despite it existing in the project. The same applies to the 'resources/my_data.txt' scenario; if this folder structure doesn't exist relative to the execution location, it will fail. Like python, Java provides utilities (such as `getResourceAsStream`) for accessing files relative to the application code, which helps avoid absolute paths and reduces reliance on the working directory.

**Example 3: C++ Relative Path Issue**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <filesystem>

void readFile(const std::string& filename) {
    std::ifstream file(filename);
    if (file.is_open()) {
        std::string line;
        while (getline(file, line)) {
            std::cout << line << std::endl;
        }
        file.close();
    } else {
        std::cout << "Error: File '" << filename << "' not found." << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Scenario 1: File in the same directory as executable
    readFile("my_data.txt");

    // Scenario 2: File in a subdirectory called 'configs'
    readFile("configs/my_data.txt");

   std::cout << "Current working directory: " << std::filesystem::current_path() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In C++, the behavior mirrors the previous examples. The `std::ifstream` constructor interprets the filename as a path relative to the current working directory. If this directory doesn't contain the target file or its parent sub-directory the file will fail to open.  The `std::filesystem` library, introduced in C++17, provides the `current_path()` method which can provide debugging assistance. Again, a reliance on relative paths, without considering the context in which the program is run, leads to potentially difficult to trace errors.

To avoid these issues, I typically follow several best practices. Firstly, whenever possible, I utilize absolute paths, especially for critical resource files or configuration. This removes any ambiguity regarding the file location. When working with relative paths is unavoidable (such as when working with plugin systems) careful consideration of the current working directory in the documentation is paramount. Further, I incorporate robust error handling to gracefully handle file I/O failures. Rather than assuming a file will always be found, try catch or similar mechanisms should be used.  Moreover, I prefer path manipulation functions provided by the programming language (e.g., `os.path.join` in Python, `Path` and `Paths` in Java, `std::filesystem` in C++), which offers a level of abstraction and cross platform support. Hardcoded paths should be avoided wherever possible.

When debugging such issues, I use several strategies. Logging the application's current working directory helps pinpoint where the program is searching for the file. I verify file permissions as insufficient access to the file, despite the path being accurate, can also cause an error. I use system tools such as `ls -l` in Linux and `dir` in Windows to confirm the file's precise location and attributes. Additionally, I rely on debuggers to inspect program variables and file path construction at runtime. Finally, rigorous unit testing with varying working directory setups is useful to avoid regressions.

For further exploration, I recommend consulting operating system documentation concerning the process working directories. Resources detailing file system APIs for each programming language such as the official Python documentation for `os` and `os.path`, the Java documentation on the `java.nio.file` package, and the C++ documentation for the `<filesystem>` header are also extremely helpful. These resources provide a detailed understanding of how file path resolution is handled at the system level and how to effectively work with paths within each language.  Understanding these elements is crucial for developing robust and portable software.
