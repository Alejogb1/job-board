The discrepancy in size between logits and labels, frequently encountered in machine learning, stems from the fundamental difference in what they represent and how they are utilized during training. Logits, the raw, unnormalized output of a neural network’s final layer, provide a vector of scores for each class, while labels, in a classification task, typically denote the ground truth class through one-hot encoding or an integer index. This seemingly mismatched dimensionality is intentional and essential for the correct computation of loss and optimization of the model's parameters.

The primary reason for the mismatch is that logits are vectors whose size matches the number of *classes* in the classification problem, whereas labels, at least during training in a supervised setting, represent a single *instance* belonging to one of those classes. The network generates a prediction for each possible class, expressed as a score before activation, which is the logit. Labels, on the other hand, provide the definitive answer: which class the instance definitively belongs to. Loss functions, like cross-entropy, use these differing representations to quantify how well a prediction aligns with the ground truth. We use the logits (scores for each class) and the single true class label to calculate a loss; we're not comparing a vector to another vector. This allows the backpropagation to update network weights in the direction that improves classification accuracy.

A concrete example illustrates this point. Consider a multi-class classification task, say, classifying images of digits (0-9) using a neural network. The network, before activation (e.g., sigmoid or softmax), outputs a vector of ten logits. This vector contains scores – often large, signed numbers – corresponding to how strongly the model believes the input image belongs to each digit. The label, however, is a single integer (e.g. `5`) if it’s the case the image shows a five, or perhaps a one-hot vector (e.g., `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`) also representing class ‘5’. It's not that labels should be multi-class; instead, the problem dictates there are many classes, and thus multiple potential logit scores per input, from which one single label for each input instance emerges.

The training process therefore utilizes these structures in a specific way. Loss functions compare the probability distribution of the logits, usually after a softmax activation, to the single correct class indicated by the label. If the model is correctly predicting class ‘5’ from the previous example, then we might expect the fifth position in the probability distribution to have the highest value. In training, the backpropagation algorithm would work to ensure that the network produces higher scores (and corresponding probability) for the correct class label during future passes. The dimensional disparity of logits and labels is fundamental to enable the loss calculation and optimization.

Below are three code snippets, utilizing Python and PyTorch, demonstrating various situations where we see this mismatch in dimensionality:

**Example 1: Single Input, One-Hot Encoded Label**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define the number of classes
num_classes = 3

# Define the logits (raw output)
logits = torch.tensor([[0.5, 2.1, -1.3]]) # Shape: [1, 3] (batch of 1, 3 classes)

# Define the one-hot encoded label for the correct class (class index 1)
label = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 0]], dtype=torch.float32) # Shape: [1, 3]

# Define the cross entropy loss function
loss_function = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Calculate the loss. Note that CrossEntropyLoss expects logits as input
# and a single class label or one-hot vector as output
loss = loss_function(logits, label)

print(f"Logits Shape: {logits.shape}")
print(f"Label Shape: {label.shape}")
print(f"Loss: {loss}")
```

In this example, `logits` represents the raw output of a three-class classifier for a single instance. The `label` is a one-hot encoded representation of the true class for that single instance. Despite having the same shape, their meanings are very different. The `CrossEntropyLoss` would normally take class indices as labels, but it also accepts one-hot encoded labels, which are, fundamentally, still labels even though the tensor shape is the same as `logits`. This is a specific case which highlights that even if shapes are the same the meaning of tensors can vary substantially.

**Example 2: Single Input, Integer Label**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define the number of classes
num_classes = 3

# Define the logits (raw output)
logits = torch.tensor([[0.5, 2.1, -1.3]]) # Shape: [1, 3] (batch of 1, 3 classes)

# Define the integer label for the correct class (class index 1)
label = torch.tensor([1]) # Shape: [1] - only the single label index

# Define the cross entropy loss function
loss_function = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Calculate the loss. Here, the label is an integer
loss = loss_function(logits, label)

print(f"Logits Shape: {logits.shape}")
print(f"Label Shape: {label.shape}")
print(f"Loss: {loss}")

```

Here, `logits` remains the same, but the `label` is now an integer index pointing to the correct class. This is the most common use-case. The key difference is that `CrossEntropyLoss` can accept integer labels rather than needing a one-hot vector, since it will handle the one-hot transformation internally. The dimensional mismatch, where the logits are vectors of class scores and the labels are class indices, is clear.

**Example 3: Batch of Inputs, Integer Labels**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define the number of classes
num_classes = 3

# Define the logits for a batch of two inputs
logits = torch.tensor([[0.5, 2.1, -1.3], [0.2, -0.1, 1.7]]) # Shape: [2, 3] (batch of 2, 3 classes)

# Define the integer labels for each instance in the batch
labels = torch.tensor([1, 2]) # Shape: [2] - batch of two labels

# Define the cross entropy loss function
loss_function = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Calculate the loss.
loss = loss_function(logits, labels)

print(f"Logits Shape: {logits.shape}")
print(f"Label Shape: {labels.shape}")
print(f"Loss: {loss}")
```

In this last example, we introduce a batch of size 2. The `logits` now has a shape of `[2, 3]` representing scores for two inputs across the three classes. The `labels` have a shape of `[2]`, corresponding to the single correct class for each instance. The dimensional discrepancy highlights that the network predicts scores for all possible classes for each instance while the labels provide the single, correct answer to compare with.

In summary, the dimensional difference between logits and labels is not an error; it’s an essential design consideration to enable calculation of loss during supervised classification. Logits provide class-wise scores before activation, whereas labels indicate the correct class during training. Understanding this distinction, demonstrated in the code examples, allows us to correctly implement and interpret the training of classification models.

For further understanding, I would recommend exploring the documentation of commonly used loss functions such as *CrossEntropyLoss*. Textbooks focusing on deep learning, specifically covering classification tasks, and academic papers that cover fundamental concepts in supervised machine learning would also be beneficial. Online courses that provide hands-on experiences with deep learning models, particularly classification, would also be quite helpful. These resources offer deeper theoretical grounding and more practical applications of these concepts. The discrepancy between logits and labels, while seemingly imbalanced, is fundamental to training a classification model.
