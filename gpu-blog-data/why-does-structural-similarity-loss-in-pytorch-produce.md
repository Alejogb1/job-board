The root cause of NaN values arising from structural similarity loss (SSIM) in PyTorch, particularly when used as a training objective, stems from divisions by zero or extremely small values within the SSIM calculation itself, and the subsequent impact these infinitesimals have when gradients are computed for backpropagation. I've encountered this issue extensively while training generative models designed for image super-resolution and denoising, where SSIM served as a perceptual metric alongside pixel-based losses. The issue is not intrinsic to the concept of structural similarity; rather, it is a direct consequence of how SSIM is implemented and the nature of floating-point arithmetic.

SSIM, at its core, aims to capture perceptual similarity by analyzing three components: luminance, contrast, and structure. Each component involves computations using local statistics like the mean and variance of image patches. Specifically, the SSIM index between two patches *x* and *y* is calculated as:

```
SSIM(x, y) = ((2 * μx * μy + C1) * (2 * σxy + C2)) / ((μx^2 + μy^2 + C1) * (σx^2 + σy^2 + C2))
```

where *μx* and *μy* represent the mean of the patches, *σx^2* and *σy^2* denote their variances, *σxy* is their covariance, and *C1* and *C2* are small constants added to avoid division by zero. In practice, this formula is usually applied to entire images through a sliding window approach where the statistics are calculated locally in the image.

Problems occur when image patches contain constant or near-constant values. When a patch is uniform (all pixels have the same or nearly the same value), its variance becomes zero or extremely small. Furthermore, when considering two such uniform patches, the covariance will likewise be close to zero. These circumstances lead to several issues that ultimately produce NaN values. First, adding the constants *C1* and *C2* is a common practice, yet these constants can be overshadowed by the near-zero values in the denominator. When this occurs, the denominator can become a value that, while not zero, is so close to zero that dividing by it leads to exceedingly large values. During backpropagation, these large gradients can quickly overflow or become unstable, thus generating NaNs in the computed weights. Second, numerical underflow can occur when the variance and covariance are very small values that, when multiplied together in the numerator, could become zero, which can then create a 0/0 condition when the formula is computed. Although these problems are mathematically resolvable, they are challenging for computers to compute due to the limitations of floating-point representation.

The use of the mean squared error (MSE) or other simple losses can, paradoxically, exacerbate the NaN issue. When training with an MSE-based loss early in training, the network could quickly produce patches that are uniform in their pixel values. This is because MSE favors the average pixel value. SSIM, when applied to uniform patches, then runs directly into the described numerical stability issues leading to NaN gradients. In scenarios where the data itself contains regions of near uniformity, such as smooth areas in an image or periods of silence in an audio spectrogram, the problem will be even more prevalent.

Let's consider a few code snippets in PyTorch demonstrating different scenarios that result in NaN values when using SSIM.

**Example 1: Near-uniform input tensors**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torchmetrics.image import StructuralSimilarityIndexMeasure

def compute_ssim_loss(img1, img2, data_range=1.0):
    ssim = StructuralSimilarityIndexMeasure(data_range=data_range)
    return 1 - ssim(img1, img2)

# Example with near-uniform tensors
img1 = torch.ones(1, 1, 32, 32) * 0.501  # create a small difference for visualization purposes
img2 = torch.ones(1, 1, 32, 32) * 0.5
img1.requires_grad = True
loss = compute_ssim_loss(img1, img2)

print(f"SSIM loss: {loss}")
loss.backward()
print(f"Gradient of img1: {img1.grad}")

img3 = torch.ones(1,1,32,32) * 0.5
img4 = torch.ones(1,1,32,32) * 0.5
img3.requires_grad = True
loss2 = compute_ssim_loss(img3, img4)
loss2.backward()
print(f"Gradient of img3: {img3.grad}")
```
In this first example, I create tensors `img1` and `img2` that are nearly uniform. The small difference in pixel values is intentional because identical images can result in gradients of zero depending on the SSIM implementation. When computing the SSIM loss, even this small difference can cause numerical instability during backpropagation. The printed result for `loss` here will depend on whether the SSIM calculation includes an epsilon or not. With the PyTorch metric the gradient calculation will return NaN values, which can lead to training instability and eventual divergence. Notice also when the two images are exactly the same, the gradient is zero.

**Example 2: Adding noise to avoid near-uniform images**

```python
def compute_ssim_loss_perturbed(img1, img2, noise_level, data_range=1.0):
    ssim = StructuralSimilarityIndexMeasure(data_range=data_range)
    img1_noise = img1 + torch.randn_like(img1) * noise_level
    img2_noise = img2 + torch.randn_like(img2) * noise_level
    return 1 - ssim(img1_noise, img2_noise)

# Example with noise to attempt to fix zero-gradients problem.
img5 = torch.ones(1, 1, 32, 32) * 0.5
img6 = torch.ones(1, 1, 32, 32) * 0.5
img5.requires_grad = True

noise_level=1e-6 # small level of noise
loss3 = compute_ssim_loss_perturbed(img5, img6, noise_level)
loss3.backward()

print(f"Gradient of img5 (with noise): {img5.grad}")
```
Here, I introduce a small random perturbation to the tensors using Gaussian noise. While adding a minimal level of noise like 1e-6 can prevent completely uniform patches, it doesn't directly solve the numerical instability when the variances and covariances are small. Depending on the noise level added, you could either solve the issue by avoiding the edge case of completely uniform images or exacerbate the issue by reducing the pixel values so close to zero to the point that they overflow. As a result, the gradient will remain NaN, or become NaN if the noise level is large enough.

**Example 3: Using a custom SSIM implementation with an epsilon**

```python
def custom_ssim_loss(img1, img2, C1=0.01, C2=0.03, epsilon=1e-8):

    mu1 = F.avg_pool2d(img1, kernel_size=11, stride=1, padding=5)
    mu2 = F.avg_pool2d(img2, kernel_size=11, stride=1, padding=5)

    mu1_sq = mu1 * mu1
    mu2_sq = mu2 * mu2
    mu1_mu2 = mu1 * mu2

    sigma1_sq = F.avg_pool2d(img1 * img1, kernel_size=11, stride=1, padding=5) - mu1_sq
    sigma2_sq = F.avg_pool2d(img2 * img2, kernel_size=11, stride=1, padding=5) - mu2_sq
    sigma12 = F.avg_pool2d(img1 * img2, kernel_size=11, stride=1, padding=5) - mu1_mu2

    ssim_map = ((2 * mu1_mu2 + C1) * (2 * sigma12 + C2)) / \
             ((mu1_sq + mu2_sq + C1) * (sigma1_sq + sigma2_sq + C2) + epsilon)
    return torch.mean(1 - ssim_map)

img7 = torch.ones(1, 1, 32, 32) * 0.5
img8 = torch.ones(1, 1, 32, 32) * 0.5
img7.requires_grad=True
loss4 = custom_ssim_loss(img7,img8)
loss4.backward()
print(f"Gradient of img7: {img7.grad}")
```
Here, I've implemented a simplified custom SSIM calculation, including the addition of an *epsilon* term in the denominator to prevent division-by-zero errors. The addition of `epsilon` will prevent the NaN values, and will produce a zero gradient when using two identical images. However, while this approach mitigates some of the instability, it does not inherently prevent the zero gradient problem for uniform images or the gradients from growing too large.

These examples demonstrate how easily NaN gradients can arise when dealing with SSIM loss.

Several strategies are available to address these issues. The most effective approach is to use a combination of SSIM with other loss functions like MSE or L1 loss. Adding a small amount of a simpler loss function to the SSIM loss as a combined objective can encourage the network to escape regions where gradients are vanishing or exploding. An alternative is to clip the gradients during training to avoid extreme gradients. Another method is to modify the SSIM calculation itself, including adding a larger epsilon term in the denominator as demonstrated above, however you must still take into account that extremely small numerators could result in zero-gradients. Lastly, careful pre-processing of input data to minimize uniform regions is also essential.

For further exploration of loss functions and their behavior, I recommend resources that discuss the trade-offs between different perceptual and pixel-based loss functions, including theoretical discussions and implementation details for robust gradient calculation techniques. Look for discussions about gradient clipping and exploration of adaptive learning rate schedulers. Lastly, consult documentation on robust numerical computation that explain the nature of floating-point math, and discuss underflow and overflow.
