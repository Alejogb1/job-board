TensorFlow variables, specifically those used within custom loss functions, should typically be created *before* the first execution of the loss function during training. This behavior stems from how TensorFlow optimizes graph construction and resource management, particularly in eager execution and graph modes. Placing variable creation inside a custom loss function during a training loop often leads to a cascade of unintended consequences, including redundant variable creation and potential errors during the backward pass. I’ve encountered this issue several times during model development, most recently when working with a complex multi-output regression model. The following details the reasons behind this behavior, along with examples and practical recommendations.

The core problem is rooted in TensorFlow's execution model. In eager execution, operations are run immediately as they are called, while in graph mode, TensorFlow first constructs a computation graph before executing it. When a loss function is called for the first time, TensorFlow isn't just evaluating the loss. It's also tracing the operations required to compute it so it can build a derivative graph for backpropagation. If a variable is created *inside* the loss function, TensorFlow sees this creation as part of the operations required to compute the loss during that specific execution. During the next call, the same creation operation would be included again, leading to a new variable potentially being created every time.

This behavior directly contradicts the intended use of TensorFlow variables. Variables, especially those representing learnable model parameters, are intended to be persistent storage locations. They should be initialized once and their values updated during training, not re-created repeatedly. If you allow the creation of variables in the loss function you will not be training the parameters as expected and also likely cause performance and memory issues.

Let’s examine a hypothetical scenario using a simplified loss function example. Assume I am working on a model where we need to calculate a custom loss that involves a per-sample weighting determined by a trainable parameter. I might initially think to incorporate this trainable parameter directly inside the loss function as shown below:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class IncorrectLoss(tf.keras.losses.Loss):
    def __init__(self, name="incorrect_loss"):
      super().__init__(name=name)

    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        weight = tf.Variable(initial_value=1.0, trainable=True, name="sample_weight")
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred) * weight)
        return loss


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = IncorrectLoss()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn)

x_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 1))
y_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 1))

model.fit(x_data, y_data, epochs=3)

print("Number of variables in model:", len(model.trainable_variables))
```

In this code, `weight` is a `tf.Variable` initialized inside the `call` method. If you examine the output, especially if you place print statements inside the loss function, you’ll observe that `weight` is initialized with a value of 1 on every training step, regardless of what it was on the previous step, and also that its scope is local to each call of the loss function. This is not the intended usage and prevents the parameter from being properly trained. Further, the number of trainable parameters on the model will not accurately reflect the variables in the loss function because they are created during evaluation.

A more appropriate method involves defining the variable *outside* the `call` method of the loss, typically during the `__init__` stage of a custom class, making the loss parameter an attribute of the loss instance. Let’s examine how this would be implemented with a `CorrectLoss` class below:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CorrectLoss(tf.keras.losses.Loss):
    def __init__(self, name="correct_loss"):
        super().__init__(name=name)
        self.weight = tf.Variable(initial_value=1.0, trainable=True, name="sample_weight")

    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred) * self.weight)
        return loss

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = CorrectLoss()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn)

x_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 1))
y_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(100, 1))

model.fit(x_data, y_data, epochs=3)
print("Number of variables in model:", len(model.trainable_variables))
print("Value of 'weight':", loss_fn.weight.numpy())
```

Here, the `weight` variable is defined during the initialization, once, and its value is referenced in the `call` method. This ensures that a single variable is used throughout the training process and that it can be adjusted via backpropagation. The final print statement shows the final value of the `weight` parameter showing it has been trained and that the number of trainable variables is 2, including the weight parameter. This illustrates the expected behavior.

A less obvious case arises when one is trying to create a loss function that performs operations that may not be differentiable, for instance using a discrete output or using a while loop within a function in the loss calculation. Let's look at a more complicated example of this. Assume we have an image segmentation task and our loss function will try to reward pixel alignment during the loss calculation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class ComplexLoss(tf.keras.losses.Loss):
    def __init__(self, name="complex_loss"):
      super().__init__(name=name)
      self.counter = tf.Variable(initial_value=0, trainable=False, dtype=tf.int32, name="counter")

    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):

        shape = tf.shape(y_pred)
        batch_size = shape[0]
        height = shape[1]
        width = shape[2]
        channels = shape[3]

        mask = tf.zeros(shape=(batch_size, height, width, 1), dtype=tf.float32)
        i = tf.constant(0)
        
        def condition(i, mask):
           return tf.less(i, height)
        
        def body(i, mask):
             j = tf.constant(0)
             def inner_condition(j, mask):
                 return tf.less(j, width)

             def inner_body(j, mask):
                 if tf.random.uniform(()) < 0.3:
                  mask = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(mask, indices=tf.constant([[0,i,j,0]]), updates=tf.constant([1.0], dtype=tf.float32))
                 j = tf.add(j,1)
                 return (j,mask)

             _, mask  = tf.while_loop(inner_condition, inner_body, [j, mask])
             i = tf.add(i,1)
             return (i, mask)

        _, mask = tf.while_loop(condition, body, [i, mask])

        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_true - y_pred) * mask)
        self.counter.assign_add(1)
        tf.print("counter", self.counter)
        return loss


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(1, kernel_size=3, padding="same", activation="relu")])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_fn = ComplexLoss()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn)

x_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 64, 64, 3))
y_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 64, 64, 1))

model.fit(x_data, y_data, epochs=3)
print("Number of variables in model:", len(model.trainable_variables))
print("Value of counter:", loss_fn.counter.numpy())
```

In this example, while it might seem that the counter variable is being incremented on each call to the loss function, the random sampling inside the while loops has a tendency to lead to the computation graph being generated each call because it contains operations that are not purely differentiable with respect to the input. The counter variable still accumulates even if variables are not being recreated repeatedly; that this behavior does not throw errors is an implementation detail and not to be relied upon. Note the counter is not a trainable variable. The core issue is that these operations should be carefully considered, and if possible, refactored to remove nondifferentiable operations from the function itself and to pre-process the masks to a state where the loss function is purely differentiable with respect to the input.

In summary, creating TensorFlow variables inside the `call` method of a custom loss function should be avoided due to TensorFlow’s graph construction and resource management. Proper variable initialization requires their definition within the `__init__` method of custom loss class or outside of the function itself and passed as an argument. Nondifferentiable operations should be carefully considered for their implications in graph mode and avoided if possible. This practice ensures predictable variable behavior, allowing for robust and correct training of your models. For further study, I recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on custom layers and models, as well as the section on variables and automatic differentiation and consider reading articles that discuss the difference between graph mode and eager execution. These resources will provide a comprehensive background for implementing custom loss functions effectively.
