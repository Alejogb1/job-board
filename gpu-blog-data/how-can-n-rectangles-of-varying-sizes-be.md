The core challenge in distributing N rectangles of varying sizes while preserving aspect ratio lies in the inherent conflict between maintaining individual proportions and optimizing overall space utilization.  A naive approach, such as simple tiling, often leads to significant wasted space, particularly when dealing with rectangles of highly disparate aspect ratios.  My experience in developing layout algorithms for automated blueprint generation has highlighted the necessity of employing more sophisticated techniques to achieve both aesthetic appeal and efficient resource usage.  Effective solutions necessitate considering both the individual rectangle constraints and the global arrangement objectives.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The optimal distribution of rectangles with varying sizes while preserving aspect ratios is an NP-hard problem, meaning there's no known algorithm that solves it efficiently for all cases.  However, several heuristic approaches offer practical solutions, balancing computational cost with the quality of the resulting layout.  These approaches typically involve iterative refinement processes.

A common strategy is to begin with an initial placement, often a simple grid arrangement.  This initial placement is then iteratively improved by evaluating and adjusting the positions of individual rectangles.  The evaluation criteria typically incorporate both space utilization metrics (e.g., minimizing wasted space) and aesthetic considerations (e.g., ensuring a visually balanced arrangement).  Adjustments may involve shifting rectangles, swapping their positions, or rotating them (if rotations are permitted).  The process continues until a satisfactory solution is reached, or a predetermined iteration limit is exceeded.  The 'satisfactory' threshold often hinges on a cost function incorporating both space efficiency and visual appeal, determined by user-defined weights.

Different algorithms differ in their approaches to initial placement, adjustment strategies, and evaluation metrics.  For instance, simulated annealing can introduce stochastic elements to escape local optima, while genetic algorithms use evolutionary principles to explore the solution space.  However, simpler iterative approaches, even without advanced optimization techniques, can often yield satisfactory results for practical applications.  The optimal choice of algorithm depends heavily on the specific application requirements, the number of rectangles, and the acceptable computational cost.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different approaches, focusing on demonstrating the core concepts rather than implementing fully optimized algorithms.  These examples use Python and assume that rectangles are represented as tuples `(width, height)`.

**Example 1: Simple Grid-Based Placement**

This example demonstrates a basic approach, placing rectangles in a grid sequentially.  It's simple but inefficient for rectangles with highly diverse aspect ratios.

```python
def simple_grid_placement(rectangles):
    """Places rectangles in a simple grid."""
    rectangles.sort(key=lambda x: x[0] * x[1], reverse=True) # Sort by area, largest first
    x, y = 0, 0
    max_width, max_height = 0, 0
    layout = []

    for width, height in rectangles:
        layout.append(((x, y), (x + width, y + height)))
        x += width
        max_width = max(max_width, x)
        max_height = max(max_height, y + height)

    return layout, (max_width, max_height)

rectangles = [(10, 5), (5, 10), (20, 15), (15, 20), (8, 4)]
layout, size = simple_grid_placement(rectangles)
print(f"Layout: {layout}, Total Size: {size}")

```

This code prioritizes larger rectangles first to minimize wasted space, a common heuristic. However, this approach does not consider the aspect ratios or rotate rectangles, potentially leading to a suboptimal layout.


**Example 2:  Iterative Improvement with Shifting**

This example takes a more sophisticated approach by allowing the shifting of rectangles to improve the packing density. This is a simplified implementation that doesn't guarantee optimal results, demonstrating the fundamental principle of iterative refinement.

```python
import random

def iterative_improvement(rectangles, iterations=100):
    """Iteratively improves rectangle placement through shifting."""
    layout, size = simple_grid_placement(rectangles) # Initial layout
    for _ in range(iterations):
        i = random.randint(0, len(rectangles) - 1)
        dx, dy = random.randint(-10, 10), random.randint(-10,10)  # Random shifts
        old_x, old_y = layout[i][0]
        new_x, new_y = old_x + dx, old_y + dy

        # Check for overlap (simplified collision detection)
        # ... (Implementation for overlap checking omitted for brevity) ...

        if not overlap and new_x >= 0 and new_y >=0:  #Basic Collision check
          layout[i] = ((new_x, new_y), (new_x + rectangles[i][0], new_y + rectangles[i][1]))


    return layout, size

#Usage with same rectangles as previous example
rectangles = [(10, 5), (5, 10), (20, 15), (15, 20), (8, 4)]
layout, size = iterative_improvement(rectangles)
print(f"Improved Layout: {layout}, Total Size: {size}")
```

This code introduces randomness to explore possible improvements. The overlap checking and its implementation are crucial and are placeholders in this simplified example. A real-world implementation needs a robust overlap detection mechanism.


**Example 3:  Constraint Satisfaction (Conceptual)**

This example outlines a constraint satisfaction approach, where rectangle placement is treated as a constraint satisfaction problem.  A complete implementation would require a constraint solver library.

```python
#Conceptual Outline - Requires Constraint Solver Library
constraints = []
for i, (w1, h1) in enumerate(rectangles):
    for j, (w2, h2) in enumerate(rectangles):
        if i != j:
            # Add constraints to prevent overlap between rectangles i and j.
            #This would involve constraints on x and y coordinates of each rectangle
            constraints.append((f"rect_{i}_x", f"rect_{j}_x", "no_overlap"))
            constraints.append((f"rect_{i}_y", f"rect_{j}_y", "no_overlap"))

# Solve the constraint satisfaction problem using a suitable library (e.g., python-constraint)
# ... (Implementation using a constraint solver omitted for brevity) ...
```

This example highlights a more sophisticated approach.  A constraint solver would handle the complex interactions between rectangles and attempt to find a solution that satisfies all constraints.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further study, I recommend exploring textbooks on algorithms and data structures, focusing on chapters dealing with geometric algorithms, graph theory, and optimization techniques.  Additionally, research papers on packing problems, specifically rectangle packing, provide valuable insights into advanced algorithms and their performance characteristics.  Consider exploring publications on constraint satisfaction and heuristic optimization methods for practical implementations.  Examining source code of open-source layout engines can also provide practical learning opportunities.
