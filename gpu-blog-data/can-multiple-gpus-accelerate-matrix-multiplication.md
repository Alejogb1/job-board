Multiple GPUs can significantly accelerate matrix multiplication, but the effectiveness hinges on several factors, chief among them being efficient data distribution and parallel algorithm design.  In my experience optimizing high-performance computing applications for several years, I've observed that a naive approach to parallelization across multiple GPUs frequently leads to performance bottlenecks, severely diminishing, or even negating, the potential speedup.  Effective utilization necessitates a deep understanding of GPU architectures, memory bandwidth limitations, and communication overhead between devices.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Matrix multiplication, at its core, involves a series of nested loops.  The inherent structure lends itself well to parallelization, as each element in the resulting matrix can be calculated independently.  This independence allows for a straightforward distribution of workload across multiple cores within a single GPU. Extending this to multiple GPUs requires a more sophisticated strategy, however.  Simply splitting the matrices among the available GPUs is not optimal. This is because the computational gain is often offset by the substantial communication overhead incurred when transferring data between GPUs. The communication latency and bandwidth limitations significantly impact the overall performance.

To mitigate these challenges, several strategies are employed.  One common approach is to partition the matrices using techniques like block-cyclic distribution, aiming to balance computation across GPUs while minimizing inter-GPU communication. This involves dividing the matrices into blocks and assigning these blocks to different GPUs in a cyclical manner. This distribution minimizes data transfer by ensuring that each GPU has access to the necessary data for a substantial portion of the computation. Another crucial factor is the choice of algorithm.  While the standard algorithm is simple, algorithms like Strassen's algorithm, though more complex, can achieve better asymptotic performance and offer advantages when dealing with very large matrices, especially in a multi-GPU setting.  The optimal strategy depends heavily on the specific hardware configuration (GPU model, interconnect speed), matrix dimensions, and data types.

Furthermore, efficient use of GPU memory is paramount. Excessive data transfers between GPU memory and system memory (host memory) create significant bottlenecks.  Techniques such as pinned memory (page-locked memory) can minimize the overhead associated with data transfers.  Understanding and optimizing memory access patterns, minimizing memory fragmentation, and leveraging shared memory (within each GPU) are vital aspects of achieving optimal performance.  I've personally seen projects slowed down by orders of magnitude due to neglecting these memory-related considerations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate aspects of multi-GPU matrix multiplication using CUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA.  These examples are simplified for illustrative purposes and wouldn't necessarily be directly used in production systems without further optimization and error handling.  They aim to showcase fundamental principles.

**Example 1:  Simple Parallelism (Naive Approach)**

```c++
//This example demonstrates a naive approach, splitting the matrix along rows and assigning them to different GPUs. It neglects communication overhead.

#include <cuda.h>
// ... (Matrix and CUDA related functions omitted for brevity) ...

int main() {
    // Initialize matrices A, B, and C (on the host)
    // ...

    // Allocate memory on each GPU
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, size); //Allocate matrix A on each GPU
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, size); //Allocate matrix B on each GPU
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, size); //Allocate matrix C on each GPU

    //Split matrix across GPUs.  This is a VERY simplified example.  In reality, more sophisticated splitting would be needed.

    // Copy data to each GPU
    cudaMemcpy(d_A, A, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_B, B, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


    // Launch kernel on each GPU.
    // This kernel would perform a portion of the matrix multiplication for each GPU


    // Copy results back to host from each GPU
    cudaMemcpy(C, d_C, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // ... (Free memory and cleanup) ...
    return 0;
}
```


**Example 2: Block-Cyclic Distribution (More Realistic)**

This example illustrates a more realistic approach, using block-cyclic distribution to minimize communication.  The crucial detail, again, omitted for brevity, is the kernel that performs the block-cyclic multiplication.  This kernel would leverage shared memory effectively to reduce memory access latency.

```c++
#include <cuda.h>
// ... (Matrix and CUDA related functions omitted for brevity) ...

int main() {
    // Initialize matrices A, B, and C (on the host)
    // ...

    // Determine block size and number of blocks per GPU (based on matrix dimensions and GPU capabilities)
    int blockSize = 256; // Example block size
    int numBlocksPerGPU = 128; // Example number of blocks per GPU

    // Allocate memory on each GPU based on block-cyclic distribution
    // ... sophisticated allocation handling omitted for brevity...

    // Copy data to each GPU using block-cyclic distribution scheme.
    //  This involves careful splitting and copying of data.
    // ...sophisticated data copy methods omitted for brevity...

    // Launch kernel on each GPU with appropriate block and grid dimensions for block-cyclic distribution
    // ...kernel call omitted for brevity ...

    // Gather results from each GPU. This would involve a reduction operation.
    // ...result gathering methods omitted for brevity...

    // ... (Free memory and cleanup) ...
    return 0;
}
```

**Example 3:  Using a Communication Library (e.g., MPI)**

For a system with multiple nodes (each potentially with multiple GPUs), a message-passing interface like MPI is often necessary.  This example provides a high-level illustration and doesn't include the intricate details of MPI integration.

```c++
#include <mpi.h>
#include <cuda.h>
// ... (Matrix and CUDA related functions omitted for brevity) ...

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
    int rank, size;
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

    //Partition Matrix across nodes
    // ... (Matrix Partitioning and Data distribution using MPI_Scatter or similar) ...


    //Perform local matrix multiplication on each GPU using CUDA.
    // ... (CUDA-based matrix multiplication as in previous examples) ...

    //Communicate partial results using MPI_Gather or similar collective communication.
    // ... (MPI Collective communication for gathering the results) ...


    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
```
