The most common reason a CUDA "Hello World" program fails to execute correctly stems from a mismatch between the host code's expectations and the underlying CUDA runtime environment's capabilities.  This frequently manifests as silent failure, leaving the programmer to sift through cryptic error messages or seemingly correct code that produces unexpected results.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my years developing high-performance computing applications, often tracing it back to improper initialization, resource management, or a lack of error checking.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A successful CUDA program requires several crucial steps. First, the host code (typically written in C or C++) must initialize the CUDA runtime. This involves identifying available CUDA-capable devices, selecting a device for execution, and allocating memory on both the host (CPU) and the device (GPU).  Next, the kernel, a function executed on the GPU, must be compiled and launched.  Crucially, data must be transferred between the host and the device, ensuring the GPU has access to necessary inputs and the host receives processed outputs. Finally, the CUDA runtime should be properly shut down, releasing allocated resources.  Failure at any of these stages can lead to the program appearing to run without generating the expected output or terminating unexpectedly.  Specific error scenarios include:

* **Device Selection Failure:**  The program might fail to find or select a suitable CUDA-capable device. This can be due to an improperly installed CUDA toolkit, conflicting drivers, or the absence of a compatible GPU.
* **Memory Allocation Errors:** Insufficient memory on the host or device, or incorrect memory allocation calls, can cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.  CUDA memory management requires explicit allocation and deallocation.
* **Kernel Launch Failure:** Incorrect kernel launch parameters (e.g., incorrect grid and block dimensions) can prevent the kernel from executing correctly.  Furthermore, mismatched data types between host and device memory can lead to silent errors.
* **Data Transfer Errors:** Errors in transferring data between the host and the device (using `cudaMemcpy`) can result in the kernel operating on incorrect data, producing incorrect or unexpected output.  Insufficient error checking within the data transfer functions exacerbates this problem.
* **Kernel Execution Errors:**  Errors within the kernel itself, such as out-of-bounds memory access, can lead to crashes or corrupted results.
* **Runtime API Errors:** Improper use of CUDA runtime API calls (e.g., forgetting to synchronize streams or improperly handling events) can introduce subtle bugs.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating Proper Initialization and Error Checking:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int dev;
  cudaError_t err = cudaGetDevice(&dev); // Get the default device
  if (err != cudaSuccess) {
    fprintf(stderr, "cudaGetDevice failed: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
    return 1;
  }

  printf("Using device %d\n", dev);

  // ... rest of the code (kernel launch, etc.) ...

  cudaDeviceReset(); // Clean up after completion
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates crucial error checking after every CUDA API call.  `cudaGetDevice` retrieves the default device ID. The `cudaGetErrorString` function converts the error code into a human-readable string.  `cudaDeviceReset()` releases resources associated with the device.  This simple addition significantly enhances debugging capabilities.


**Example 2:  Correct Memory Allocation and Data Transfer:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void addKernel(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  int n = 1024;
  int *h_a, *h_b, *h_c;
  int *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

  // Allocate host memory
  h_a = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  h_b = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));
  h_c = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int));

  // Allocate device memory
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_a, n * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_b, n * sizeof(int));
  cudaMalloc((void **)&d_c, n * sizeof(int));

  // Initialize host memory
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    h_a[i] = i;
    h_b[i] = i * 2;
  }

  // Copy data from host to device
  cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // Launch kernel
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  addKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

  // Copy data from device to host
  cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, n * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // ... error checking and verification ...

  free(h_a);
  free(h_b);
  free(h_c);
  cudaFree(d_a);
  cudaFree(d_b);
  cudaFree(d_c);
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates proper memory allocation on both the host and device using `malloc` and `cudaMalloc`, respectively.  It also shows how to correctly copy data between host and device memory using `cudaMemcpy`.  Note that error checking after every CUDA API call is omitted for brevity but is crucial in production code.


**Example 3:  Addressing Kernel Launch Parameters:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void vectorAdd(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1024 * 1024;
    float *h_a, *h_b, *h_c;
    float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

    // Allocate memory on host
    h_a = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    h_b = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));
    h_c = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float));

    // Allocate memory on device
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, n * sizeof(float));
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, n * sizeof(float));

    // ... (Initialization and data transfer omitted for brevity) ...

    // Launch kernel.  Note careful calculation of grid and block dimensions
    dim3 blockSize(256);
    dim3 gridSize((n + blockSize.x - 1) / blockSize.x);
    vectorAdd<<<gridSize, blockSize>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

    // ... (Data transfer and cleanup omitted for brevity) ...

    return 0;
}
```

This example highlights the importance of correctly calculating the grid and block dimensions for kernel launch.  The `dim3` structure is used to define the block and grid dimensions.  The calculation ensures that all elements of the input vectors are processed by the kernel.  Improper calculation can lead to incomplete or incorrect results.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The CUDA Toolkit documentation is essential.  NVIDIA's programming guide provides detailed information on CUDA programming concepts, best practices, and error handling.  Numerous textbooks cover parallel programming and GPU computing;  finding one that specifically addresses CUDA programming is recommended. Finally, thorough familiarity with the C/C++ programming language itself remains paramount.  A deep understanding of memory management and pointers is crucial for effective CUDA development.
