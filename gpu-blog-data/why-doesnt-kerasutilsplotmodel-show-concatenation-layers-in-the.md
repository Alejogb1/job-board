The omission of concatenation layers in the visualization generated by `keras.utils.plot_model` stems from a fundamental limitation in its representation of complex layer interactions.  My experience debugging visualization issues in large-scale TensorFlow models built with Keras has consistently highlighted this shortcoming.  `plot_model` primarily focuses on a simplified, sequential depiction of the model architecture; it struggles to effectively capture the intricacies of operations that involve the merging of multiple tensor streams, such as concatenation. The visualization engine prioritizes a clear depiction of the primary data flow, often sacrificing the detailed representation of less-linear operations for the sake of readability.  This simplification leads to the apparent disappearance of concatenation layers.  The resulting graph accurately represents the overall model structure but lacks the granularity necessary to visualize all internal operations explicitly.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

`keras.utils.plot_model` relies on a graph representation that simplifies the underlying TensorFlow computational graph.  While it successfully maps layers to nodes and connections between layers to edges, its representation of multi-input layers, including `Concatenate` layers, is often incomplete.  The tool primarily illustrates the sequential flow of information through the model.  When a `Concatenate` layer receives inputs from multiple preceding layers, the visualization algorithm may choose to represent the concatenation implicitly, rather than explicitly showing the `Concatenate` layer as a distinct node in the graph.  The resulting visual effectively shows the combined output tensor emanating from the merged inputs but fails to visually represent the actual concatenation operation that produces it.  This behavior is not a bug but a consequence of the simplification choices made in the visualization algorithm to maintain clarity. The focus remains on representing the overall structure, potentially at the cost of detailed representation of lower-level operations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Concatenation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, concatenate
from keras.models import Model
from keras.utils import plot_model

input_a = Input(shape=(10,))
input_b = Input(shape=(15,))

dense_a = Dense(5, activation='relu')(input_a)
dense_b = Dense(5, activation='relu')(input_b)

merged = concatenate([dense_a, dense_b])
output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged)

model = Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=output)

plot_model(model, to_file='model_concat_simple.png', show_shapes=True)
```

In this simple example, the `plot_model` output will likely show `input_a` and `input_b` feeding directly into a single `Dense` layer representing the output. The `concatenate` layer is absent.  This directly illustrates the simplification.  The visualization prioritizes showing the final merged tensor as input to the output layer, implicitly indicating the concatenation operation without explicitly visualizing the `Concatenate` layer itself.

**Example 2: Multiple Concatenations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, concatenate, Activation
from keras.models import Model
from keras.utils import plot_model

input_a = Input(shape=(10,))
input_b = Input(shape=(15,))
input_c = Input(shape=(20,))

dense_a = Dense(5, activation='relu')(input_a)
dense_b = Dense(5, activation='relu')(input_b)
dense_c = Dense(5, activation='relu')(input_c)

merged1 = concatenate([dense_a, dense_b])
activation1 = Activation('relu')(merged1)
merged2 = concatenate([activation1, dense_c])
output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged2)

model = Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b, input_c], outputs=output)

plot_model(model, to_file='model_concat_multiple.png', show_shapes=True, expand_nested=True)


```

Adding multiple concatenations does not change the core issue. The generated image will likely still skip the explicit visualization of `Concatenate` layers.  The `expand_nested=True` argument might offer slightly more detail, but the omission remains a possibility, reflecting the intrinsic limitation of the visualization tool in this specific context.


**Example 3:  Concatenation within a Functional API Submodel**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, concatenate, Activation
from keras.models import Model
from keras.utils import plot_model

def create_submodel():
  input_layer = Input(shape=(10,))
  dense1 = Dense(5, activation='relu')(input_layer)
  dense2 = Dense(5, activation='relu')(input_layer)
  merged = concatenate([dense1, dense2])
  return Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=merged)

main_input = Input(shape=(10,))
submodel_output = create_submodel()(main_input)
output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(submodel_output)
model = Model(inputs=main_input, outputs=output)

plot_model(model, to_file='model_concat_submodel.png', show_shapes=True)
```

This example showcases the behavior within a submodel defined using the Keras Functional API. Even with a nested structure, the visualization frequently omits the internal `Concatenate` layers. The simplification strategy of `plot_model` often extends to the representation of submodels, emphasizing the overall input-output relationships over the complete display of internal operations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a more comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow model visualization, I would suggest exploring the TensorFlow documentation on graph visualization, specifically focusing on alternative visualization tools beyond `keras.utils.plot_model`.  Additionally, reviewing advanced debugging and model inspection techniques within TensorFlow would prove beneficial.  Finally, familiarizing yourself with the limitations of various model visualization tools and their capabilities is crucial for effective model analysis.  Understanding these limitations will help prevent misinterpretations of generated visualizations.
