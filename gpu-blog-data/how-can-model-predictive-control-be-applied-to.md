Model Predictive Control (MPC), characterized by its reliance on a system model to predict future behavior, finds significant application within electromechanical systems, particularly where precise and dynamic control is necessary. The core principle involves using this predictive capability to optimize control inputs over a receding horizon, allowing for handling of constraints and disturbances. I’ve encountered this firsthand across various projects, ranging from robotic manipulators to active suspension systems.

The essence of MPC lies in iteratively solving an optimization problem. At each control step, the current state of the electromechanical system is measured. This state, along with the model of the system, is used to predict the system’s future trajectory over a defined prediction horizon. A cost function, which typically penalizes deviations from desired behavior and excessive control effort, is then formulated. This cost function is minimized to find the optimal sequence of control inputs within the prediction horizon. Only the first control input from this optimal sequence is actually applied to the system. The process repeats at the next control step, using updated measurements. This “receding horizon” approach allows MPC to adapt to changes and disturbances in the system.

Applying MPC to electromechanical systems typically involves the following steps: 1) deriving a mathematical model of the system; 2) discretizing the model for digital implementation; 3) designing a cost function; 4) solving the optimization problem; 5) implementing the control loop.

The system model is paramount. Electromechanical systems are typically described using a combination of differential equations governing electrical circuits (e.g., Kirchhoff's laws) and mechanical motion (e.g., Newton’s laws). These equations can then be linearized around an operating point for easier computation, especially in the context of simple MPC formulations. State-space representation, where the system's behavior is characterized by state variables, control inputs, and outputs, is common. Consider, for instance, a direct current (DC) motor:

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.linalg

# System Parameters
R = 1.0 # Resistance (ohms)
L = 0.1 # Inductance (henries)
J = 0.01 # Inertia (kg m^2)
b = 0.1 # Damping (Nms)
Kt = 0.1 # Torque constant (Nm/A)
Kb = 0.1 # Back EMF constant (V/rad/s)

Ts = 0.01 # Sampling time (s)

# State-space matrices: x = [current, angular velocity]
A_c = np.array([[-R/L, -Kb/L],
                [Kt/J, -b/J]])

B_c = np.array([[1/L],
                [0]])

C = np.array([[0, 1]]) # Output is angular velocity

# Discretization using zero-order hold
A_d = scipy.linalg.expm(A_c*Ts)
B_d = np.dot(np.linalg.inv(A_c), (A_d - np.eye(2)) @ B_c)
```

Here, we represent a simplified DC motor in continuous-time state-space form and then discretize it for implementation in a digital controller. This example demonstrates the basic transformation of a continuous representation to a discrete representation, needed for digital controllers. This step is critical because MPC is typically solved numerically on a computer. Note the inclusion of common motor parameters and the use of matrix exponential function to perform the discretization.

The cost function plays a critical role in shaping the system response. It is often defined as a quadratic function penalizing both state deviations and control input magnitudes. For instance:

```python
# Cost Function parameters
Q = np.diag([1, 10])  # State weighting matrix (penalizes [current, angular velocity] deviations from setpoint)
R_cost = np.array([[0.1]]) # Control weighting matrix (penalizes control effort)

N = 20 # Prediction horizon

#Construct cost function
H = scipy.linalg.block_diag(*([R_cost] * N))
Q_big = scipy.linalg.block_diag(*([Q] * (N)))
H = np.concatenate((H, np.zeros((N,2*2))), axis=1)
H = np.concatenate((H, np.zeros((2*N,N+2*N)).transpose()), axis = 0)
```
This Python code shows the construction of the cost matrix `H` used within the quadratic programming solver.  `Q` penalizes deviations of current and angular velocity from the desired setpoint and `R` penalizes large control inputs. The structure reflects the stacked nature of MPC problems over the prediction horizon `N`. The matrix `Q_big` represents weights for the states throughout the prediction horizon. This specific definition penalizes both deviations in current and angular velocity, as well as the magnitude of the control input. The specific magnitudes are tuned during the design process, often through iterative simulation or experiments.

Solving the optimization problem is usually done numerically using quadratic programming (QP) solvers. These solvers calculate the optimal control inputs that minimize the cost function. The core idea is to express the MPC problem as a QP in the following form:

    min 0.5 * U.T * H * U + F.T * U,
   subject to:  A_ineq * U <= b_ineq; A_eq*U == b_eq

Here, U represents the sequence of control inputs over the prediction horizon, H is a matrix defining the quadratic part of the cost, F is vector containing initial state conditions, and A_ineq,b_ineq ,A_eq, and b_eq represent inequality and equality constraints.

Implementation involves continuously solving this optimization problem. As only the first calculated control input is applied at each step, computational speed is often a critical factor. Using a QP solver, such as those available in libraries like CVXPY or OSQP, significantly streamlines this step. Consider this snippet that shows how to formulate a linear MPC problem.

```python
import cvxpy as cp

x = cp.Variable((2,N+1))
u = cp.Variable((1,N))
u_initial = np.zeros((1,N))

# Define objective function
objective = cp.Minimize(cp.quad_form(u, H[0:N, 0:N]) + cp.sum(cp.quad_form(x[:, :-1], Q)))


constraints = [x[:,1:] == np.dot(A_d, x[:,0:-1]) + np.dot(B_d, u)]
constraints += [x[:, 0] == [0,0]]
constraints += [u <= 100]
constraints += [u >= -100]
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
problem.solve()
print(u.value)
```

This is an example of setting up a basic Linear MPC problem using cvxpy. Note that the model is a simple implementation of the one shown above. Here, the states are x and the control is u, both are declared as CVXPY variables. The `objective` implements the cost function described above, which has control effort penalties defined in H and state penalties defined by Q. The constraints ensure the states evolve according to our linearized discrete time model.

Important considerations during design of MPC for electromechanical systems include the selection of appropriate prediction and control horizons, the weighting parameters in the cost function (Q and R), and real-time computational performance. The model accuracy also critically impacts the closed-loop performance. A more accurate model will lead to better control. Inaccurate models or disturbances can lead to performance degradation or even instability.

For further study and practical understanding of MPC within the context of electromechanical systems, resources focused on control theory and optimization are useful. Specifically, texts covering linear system theory, state-space analysis, numerical optimization, and practical implementation techniques in control systems are beneficial. Books covering model predictive control and embedded control design are also recommended. I would further suggest exploring open-source libraries specifically for numerical optimization, as practical understanding requires hands-on experience.
