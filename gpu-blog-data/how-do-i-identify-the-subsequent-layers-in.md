In my experience building complex deep learning models for image segmentation, understanding the architectural layout, specifically identifying the subsequent layers, has been crucial for debugging, performance optimization, and even targeted knowledge extraction. TensorFlow Keras, while providing a high-level API for model construction, doesn’t inherently offer a direct "get subsequent layers" function. Instead, layer identification requires a nuanced approach, primarily relying on the `model.layers` attribute and sometimes, an iterative exploration of the model's computational graph.

Fundamentally, a Keras `Sequential` model arranges layers linearly, making identification quite straightforward. Each layer, an instance of a Keras layer class (e.g., `Conv2D`, `Dense`, `MaxPooling2D`), is stored in the `model.layers` list in the order they were added. For instance, if `layer[n]` is a convolutional layer, its "subsequent layer" would simply be `layer[n+1]`, assuming it exists (i.e., n+1 is within the bounds of the list). However, the situation becomes significantly more intricate with functional API models that may incorporate branches, merges, or skip connections. These models present a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, where a layer's outputs could feed into multiple subsequent layers, and conversely, a layer could receive input from multiple preceding layers.

The core challenge in identifying "subsequent layers" isn’t about extracting *immediate* successors in a list; it's about understanding the *data flow*, the connections defining the forward pass. The `model.get_config()` method can reveal these connections by providing a model representation in dictionary format, which reveals the input and output names of each layer. I have found that using `model.summary()` provides an easily interpretable overview of the graph structure, displaying the input and output shape of each layer, alongside its connections within the model. Nonetheless, for programmatically accessing the subsequent layers for targeted operations, I often revert to inspecting the input and output tensors, available using the `layer.input` and `layer.output` attributes, respectively, when combined with careful analysis of `model.layers`.

My go-to approach involves using these attributes to trace the flow. Each layer object, in most cases, has an `input` attribute pointing to the incoming tensor and an `output` attribute referring to its resulting tensor. I can locate subsequent layers by identifying which layer uses a given layer's output tensor as its input.

Here is the first code example demonstrating the approach for a sequential model, where the order implies the connectivity:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

print("Sequential Model:")
for i, layer in enumerate(model.layers):
    if i < len(model.layers) - 1:
        print(f"Layer {i}: {layer.name}, Subsequent Layer: {model.layers[i+1].name}")
    else:
        print(f"Layer {i}: {layer.name}, No Subsequent Layer")
```

This code iterates through the layers, printing each layer's name and the subsequent layer's name (using the layer's `name` attribute) for all layers except the last one. It's a direct mapping due to the nature of a `Sequential` model. This approach is suitable for simple, linear architectures, and is a foundational method for more complex scenarios.

However, for functional API models, I need to probe the connection topology explicitly. Here's a second code example to manage this scenario:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
y = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
z = layers.Dropout(0.5)(y)
concat = layers.concatenate([x, z])
outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(concat)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

print("\nFunctional Model:")
for layer in model.layers:
    if hasattr(layer, 'output'):
      output_tensor = layer.output
      print(f"Layer: {layer.name}")
      for next_layer in model.layers:
         if hasattr(next_layer, 'input'):
             if isinstance(next_layer.input, list):
                 if output_tensor in next_layer.input:
                     print(f"  Subsequent Layer: {next_layer.name}")
             elif output_tensor == next_layer.input:
                   print(f"  Subsequent Layer: {next_layer.name}")

```

This second example iterates through each layer, attempting to find subsequent layers by comparing its output tensor to the input tensors of all other layers. The check for `isinstance(next_layer.input, list)` accounts for layers like `concatenate` that receive multiple input tensors.  The key here is that, instead of relying on ordering, I'm examining tensor relationships. I've used `hasattr` with "output" and "input" to robustly handle cases where certain Keras objects (like the `Input` layer) may lack the expected attributes.  This more explicitly maps the tensor connections.

The previous approach also handles cases with layers such as skip connections, where a given layer's output tensor can be used by non-adjacent layers within the network. However, there is a corner case where a layer output is not the direct input to the subsequent layer but goes through a wrapper layer (e.g., a Lambda layer, or when a custom layer manipulates the tensor).  These cases require a more in-depth graph traversal, or rely on `get_config`, that I will cover in the last code example.

The third example showcases `get_config()` along with a modified approach for accessing layers in combination to detect the data flow in a functional API with such non-direct connections.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
y = layers.Lambda(lambda t: tf.math.square(t))(x) #Wrapper layer that modifies x output
z = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(y)
outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(z)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

config = model.get_config()
layer_map = {layer['name']: layer for layer in config['layers']}

print("\nFunctional Model with Lambda Layer:")
for layer in model.layers:
    if hasattr(layer, 'name'):
        layer_name = layer.name
        if layer_name in layer_map:
            layer_config = layer_map[layer_name]
            if 'inbound_nodes' in layer_config and layer_config['inbound_nodes']:
              for inbound in layer_config['inbound_nodes'][0]:
                  for input_node_layer in inbound:
                    if input_node_layer != 'input_1':
                        print(f"Layer: {layer_name} from input {input_node_layer}")
        if hasattr(layer,'output'):
            output_tensor=layer.output
            for next_layer in model.layers:
              if hasattr(next_layer,'input'):
                  if isinstance(next_layer.input, list):
                      if output_tensor in next_layer.input:
                          print(f"  Subsequent Layer: {next_layer.name}")
                  elif output_tensor == next_layer.input:
                      print(f"  Subsequent Layer: {next_layer.name}")
```

In this example, I introduce a lambda layer, which squares the tensor. Now the subsequent layer `z` is using the transformed data. By using the `get_config()` method and subsequently iterating over all inbound nodes for a given layer, we are able to analyze input layers even if it does not directly come from the adjacent layer. By additionally also iterating over the existing layer object outputs, we cover the use cases for both direct and indirect connections between layers.

For learning more about model architecture, I would recommend exploring official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the Keras API guide section on models, layers, and custom layer construction. Additionally, several resources exist covering model analysis, including techniques for visualizing the graph structure of TensorFlow models using tools like TensorBoard. Researching publications regarding graph analysis techniques is also useful for delving into graph theory which is important for large network architectures.  Examining code examples and tutorials for complex model structures within image processing, like U-Nets or ResNets, is a valuable approach to encountering practical use cases in real world projects.
