The relationship between output stride, atrous rate, and heatmap size in convolutional neural networks is not directly proportional, as intuition might initially suggest.  My experience optimizing object detection models for high-resolution satellite imagery revealed a subtle interplay between these hyperparameters.  While increasing the atrous rate *can* lead to larger effective receptive fields and thus potentially larger feature maps in intermediate layers, the final heatmap dimensions are primarily determined by the output stride. This is because the output stride dictates the downsampling factor applied throughout the network.  The atrous rate primarily affects the *resolution* of the feature maps within the network, not the overall spatial dimensions of the final output.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The output stride determines the ratio between the input image dimensions and the output heatmap dimensions.  A smaller output stride means less downsampling, resulting in a larger heatmap.  This is a direct consequence of the spatial convolution operation. For example, a stride of 1 preserves the spatial dimensions, while a stride of 2 halves them in each dimension.

The atrous convolution, on the other hand, introduces holes in the convolutional kernel. This increases the receptive field of the kernel without increasing the number of parameters or changing the output dimensions of a single convolutional layer.  In essence, it simulates a larger kernel with fewer computations.  However, multiple atrous convolutional layers, even with large atrous rates, do not directly impact the overall output stride set by the network architecture. They influence the feature map's granularity within the intermediate layers—the information density—but not the final heatmap's size.

Therefore, a larger atrous rate with a small output stride will lead to a high-resolution heatmap with a larger effective receptive field at each point.  This means each point in the heatmap incorporates information from a wider area in the input image. Conversely, a smaller atrous rate with a small output stride will still produce a large heatmap but with a smaller effective receptive field at each location.

The key takeaway is that the output stride is the dominant factor in determining the final heatmap size. The atrous rate affects the context captured by each heatmap element but not the overall heatmap dimensions.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate this using three simplified examples in Python using a hypothetical convolutional neural network architecture.  Note that these are illustrative and do not include activation functions, batch normalization, or other typical components for brevity.


**Example 1: Small Output Stride, Small Atrous Rate**

```python
import numpy as np

# Input image dimensions
input_size = (512, 512)

# Convolutional layer parameters
kernel_size = 3
stride = 1  # Small output stride
atrous_rate = 1  # Small atrous rate

# Simulate a convolutional layer
def conv_layer(input_tensor, kernel_size, stride, atrous_rate):
  # This simplified function only calculates output dimensions.
  output_size = ((input_tensor.shape[0] - kernel_size + 1) // stride, (input_tensor.shape[1] - kernel_size + 1) // stride)
  return output_size


input_tensor = np.zeros(input_size)
output_size = conv_layer(input_tensor, kernel_size, stride, atrous_rate)
print(f"Output size: {output_size}") # Output size will be close to the input size.

```

This example demonstrates a scenario with a small output stride and a small atrous rate. The output size will be very close to the input size, resulting in a large heatmap.  The small atrous rate indicates that each point in the heatmap represents information from a relatively small receptive field.


**Example 2: Small Output Stride, Large Atrous Rate**

```python
import numpy as np

# Input image dimensions
input_size = (512, 512)

# Convolutional layer parameters
kernel_size = 3
stride = 1  # Small output stride
atrous_rate = 4  # Large atrous rate

# Simulate a convolutional layer (same function as above)
def conv_layer(input_tensor, kernel_size, stride, atrous_rate):
  # This simplified function only calculates output dimensions.  Atrous rate is not directly included in the calculation of output size.
  output_size = ((input_tensor.shape[0] - kernel_size + 1) // stride, (input_tensor.shape[1] - kernel_size + 1) // stride)
  return output_size

input_tensor = np.zeros(input_size)
output_size = conv_layer(input_tensor, kernel_size, stride, atrous_rate)
print(f"Output size: {output_size}") # Output size will be close to the input size, regardless of atrous rate

```

Here, we maintain the small output stride but increase the atrous rate. The output size remains largely unchanged; however, the receptive field of each kernel has effectively expanded. Each point in the heatmap now encompasses a wider contextual area within the input image.


**Example 3: Large Output Stride, Large Atrous Rate**

```python
import numpy as np

# Input image dimensions
input_size = (512, 512)

# Convolutional layer parameters
kernel_size = 3
stride = 8  # Large output stride
atrous_rate = 4  # Large atrous rate

# Simulate a convolutional layer (same function as above)
def conv_layer(input_tensor, kernel_size, stride, atrous_rate):
    # This simplified function only calculates output dimensions.  Atrous rate is not directly included in the calculation of output size.
    output_size = ((input_tensor.shape[0] - kernel_size + 1) // stride, (input_tensor.shape[1] - kernel_size + 1) // stride)
    return output_size

input_tensor = np.zeros(input_size)
output_size = conv_layer(input_tensor, kernel_size, stride, atrous_rate)
print(f"Output size: {output_size}") # Output size is significantly smaller due to the large stride.

```

This example demonstrates the effect of a large output stride. Despite the large atrous rate, the heatmap's size is significantly reduced due to the aggressive downsampling.  The large atrous rate still expands the effective receptive field, but the overall heatmap spatial dimensions are small.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I suggest reviewing standard deep learning textbooks covering convolutional neural networks and their architectures.  Further study of papers on semantic segmentation and object detection focusing on atrous convolution will provide specific insights into implementation and applications.  Finally, thorough examination of various CNN architecture specifications will demonstrate the practical implementation of output stride and atrous rates within different model designs.
