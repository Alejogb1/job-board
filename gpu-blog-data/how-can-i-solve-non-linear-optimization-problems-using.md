The core challenge in applying Google CP-SAT to non-linear optimization problems involving `AddAbsEquality` and `AddMultiplicationEquality` constraints lies in the solver's inherent linearity.  CP-SAT is fundamentally a linear constraint solver;  these non-linear constructs necessitate careful reformulation to maintain solvability.  My experience optimizing complex logistics schedules, involving resource allocation and time-dependent constraints, highlighted this precisely.  Directly using these non-linear constraints often leads to infeasibility or suboptimal solutions.  The solution relies on a systematic transformation of the non-linear expressions into equivalent linear formulations.

**1.  Explanation of the Reformulation Strategy**

The key to successfully leveraging CP-SAT with `AddAbsEquality` and `AddMultiplicationEquality` lies in their linearization.  This involves introducing auxiliary variables and constraints that represent the non-linear expressions' behavior using only linear equations and inequalities.  The process varies slightly depending on the specific constraint.

For `AddAbsEquality`, which models the constraint |x| = y, we introduce a binary variable to represent the sign of x.  Let's call this binary variable `b`.  We can then express the absolute value as a linear system:

* `y >= x`
* `y >= -x`
* `y <= x + M(1-b)`
* `y <= -x + Mb`

where `M` is a sufficiently large constant, ensuring that the constraints are not overly restrictive.  The binary variable `b` is 0 if `x` is positive or zero, and 1 if `x` is negative. This formulation ensures that `y` is always equal to the absolute value of `x`.

For `AddMultiplicationEquality`, representing the constraint x * y = z, the approach depends on the nature of x and y. If x and y are binary variables, the multiplication can be directly represented using a linear constraint: `z == x * y`. If x and y are integer variables, the multiplication requires more sophisticated linearization techniques. One common approach involves leveraging piecewise-linear approximations or introducing auxiliary variables to represent the multiplication's outcome. For example, if both x and y are within a known bounded range [0, M], we can express the multiplication using a set of linear constraints based on discretization. A more precise but computationally more expensive method involves using McCormick envelopes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the application of these linearization techniques within a Python CP-SAT model.  These examples are simplified representations, but they demonstrate the core principles.

**Example 1: Linearizing `AddAbsEquality`**

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

model = cp_model.CpModel()

# Variables
x = model.NewIntVar(-10, 10, 'x')  # Example range for x
b = model.NewBoolVar('b')  # Binary variable for sign
y = model.NewIntVar(0, 20, 'y')  # Absolute value of x

# Constraints
model.Add(y >= x)
model.Add(y >= -x)
model.Add(y <= x + 20 * (1 - b)) # M = 20 (adjust as needed)
model.Add(y <= -x + 20 * b)     # M = 20 (adjust as needed)
model.Add(x == 5)

# Solver
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
status = solver.Solve(model)

if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE:
    print(f"x = {solver.Value(x)}")
    print(f"y = {solver.Value(y)}")
else:
    print("No solution found.")
```

This code demonstrates the linearization of `|x| = y`. The auxiliary binary variable `b` and the carefully constructed inequalities ensure that `y` correctly represents the absolute value of `x`. The `M` value (20 in this example) needs adjustment based on the expected range of `x` to guarantee correctness.

**Example 2: Linearizing `AddMultiplicationEquality` (Binary Variables)**

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

model = cp_model.CpModel()

# Variables (Binary)
x = model.NewBoolVar('x')
y = model.NewBoolVar('y')
z = model.NewIntVar(0, 1, 'z')

# Constraint (Direct Multiplication for binary variables)
model.Add(z == x * y)

# Solver
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
status = solver.Solve(model)

if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE:
    print(f"x = {solver.Value(x)}")
    print(f"y = {solver.Value(y)}")
    print(f"z = {solver.Value(z)}")
else:
    print("No solution found.")
```

This example directly handles the multiplication of binary variables, which CP-SAT supports natively. This eliminates the need for explicit linearization.

**Example 3: Linearizing `AddMultiplicationEquality` (Integer Variables - Simplified)**

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

model = cp_model.CpModel()

#Variables (Integer) - Simplified Example
x = model.NewIntVar(0, 5, 'x')
y = model.NewIntVar(0, 3, 'y')
z = model.NewIntVar(0, 15, 'z') # Upper bound is product of upper bounds of x and y


# Constraint (Linear Approximation - only suitable for small ranges)
model.Add(z == x * y) # This is a simplification! For larger ranges, a piecewise linear approximation would be needed.

# Solver
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
status = solver.Solve(model)

if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE:
    print(f"x = {solver.Value(x)}")
    print(f"y = {solver.Value(y)}")
    print(f"z = {solver.Value(z)}")
else:
    print("No solution found.")
```

This demonstrates a simplified approach for integer variables.  However, for larger ranges, a more robust piecewise-linear approximation or the McCormick envelope would be necessary to ensure accuracy.  This simplified example works due to the limited ranges of x and y.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I would advise consulting the official Google OR-Tools documentation for detailed explanations of the CP-SAT solver's capabilities and limitations.  Furthermore, textbooks on integer programming and optimization techniques provide valuable background on linearization strategies for non-linear problems.  Finally, reviewing research papers on CP-SAT applications to non-linear problems will expose more advanced reformulation techniques and their associated trade-offs in terms of solution quality and computational cost.  These resources will offer a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical principles and provide more sophisticated methodologies for tackling challenging non-linear optimization scenarios.
