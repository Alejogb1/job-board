Building TensorFlow with CUDA support on Windows using Bazel presents unique challenges stemming from the intricate interplay between Bazel's build system, TensorFlow's extensive codebase, and the CUDA toolkit's dependencies.  My experience with large-scale machine learning projects, specifically involving custom TensorFlow builds for specialized hardware acceleration, has highlighted the critical role of precise environment configuration in achieving successful compilation.  A commonly overlooked aspect is ensuring the correct CUDA toolkit version aligns not only with your NVIDIA driver but also with the specific TensorFlow version you intend to build.  Mismatches here often result in cryptic compiler errors difficult to diagnose.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves several distinct steps:  setting up the necessary prerequisites, configuring Bazel's build environment, and then invoking the Bazel build command with the appropriate flags.  Crucially, the success hinges on establishing consistent paths to your CUDA toolkit, cuDNN libraries, and other related components.  Windows' inherent path handling can be a source of errors if not managed meticulously.

Prerequisites include:

* **Visual Studio:**  A compatible version of Visual Studio with the necessary C++ build tools.  The exact version depends on your TensorFlow version; consult the TensorFlow build instructions for your target version.  This is non-negotiable, as Bazel relies heavily on the MSVC compiler.  Ensure the C++ workload is installed.

* **CUDA Toolkit:** The appropriate CUDA toolkit version must be installed and configured correctly.  Environment variables like `CUDA_PATH`, `CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR`, and `PATH` need to be adjusted to point to the installation directory.  Verification of the installation through `nvcc --version` is paramount.

* **cuDNN:**  The cuDNN library, NVIDIA's deep neural network library, provides accelerated operations for TensorFlow.  Download and install the appropriate cuDNN version corresponding to your CUDA toolkit.  Similar environment variable adjustments are required to ensure Bazel can locate it.

* **Bazel:** Install Bazel, following the official instructions for Windows.  Ensure it's added to your system's PATH environment variable.  Verify the installation by running `bazel version`.

* **Protobuf:** TensorFlow relies on Protocol Buffers. Install it; often a pre-built package for Windows is available.

* **Other Dependencies:** TensorFlow's build process necessitates other libraries, some of which might require separate downloads and installations. The official TensorFlow build instructions provide a comprehensive list.

Once the prerequisites are in place, configuring Bazel involves setting up environment variables for the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN as mentioned above. These variables will guide Bazel to the appropriate locations during the compilation process. Bazel's ability to locate these libraries is critical to avoid compilation failures. This step often requires restarting the command prompt or terminal for the changes to take effect.  Inconsistent environment variable settings are a significant source of build failures.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate aspects of the build process. Note that paths need to be adjusted to match your actual installation directories.

**Example 1: Setting up Environment Variables (Batch Script)**

```batch
@echo off
setx CUDA_PATH "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8"
setx CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8"
setx PATH "%PATH%;%CUDA_PATH%\bin;%CUDA_PATH%\lib\x64"
setx CUDNN_ROOT "C:\path\to\cuDNN"
setx PATH "%PATH%;%CUDNN_ROOT%\bin"
echo Environment variables set.  Restart your command prompt.
pause
```

This batch script sets crucial environment variables. Remember to replace placeholder paths with your actual paths.  The `setx` command permanently sets the environment variables.  Restarting the command prompt ensures the changes are reflected.


**Example 2: Bazel Build Command (Command Prompt)**

```bash
bazel build --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
```

This command instructs Bazel to build the pip package for TensorFlow with CUDA support.  The `--config=cuda` flag is essential; it enables the CUDA-specific build configurations within the TensorFlow build files. The target `//tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package` specifies building the pip installable package.  Alternative targets might exist depending on your build goals (e.g., building a specific TensorFlow library).


**Example 3:  Troubleshooting a Common Error (Command Prompt)**

Let's assume you encounter a linker error indicating that `cudart64_110.dll` cannot be found.  This points to an issue with the CUDA library path.  You can try to explicitly link the library in the Bazel build using a custom `BUILD` file (highly advanced and requires deep understanding of Bazel's build rules, and is beyond the scope of this simple solution), or more simply, verify that the `%CUDA_PATH%\bin` and `%CUDA_PATH%\lib\x64` directories are included in your `PATH` environment variable.  After adjusting the `PATH`, restarting the command prompt is vital.  Then, re-run the Bazel build command.

```bash
echo %PATH%  // Verify PATH includes CUDA directories
bazel build --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
```

This demonstrates how to check the `PATH` variable and re-run the build.  Careful examination of error messages is crucial in diagnosing issues.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow websiteâ€™s build instructions.  The Bazel documentation for Windows.  The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit documentation.  The NVIDIA cuDNN documentation.  A comprehensive C++ programming guide focusing on Windows development and linking external libraries.


By following these steps and carefully managing the environment, you can successfully build TensorFlow with CUDA support on Windows using Bazel.  Remember, precise attention to detail, particularly concerning path configurations and version compatibility, is crucial for a smooth build process.  The process involves a careful orchestration of environment variables, build flags, and a thorough understanding of Bazel's build mechanisms.  Thorough examination of error messages is key to debugging build failures.
