Keras custom layers inherently support both constants and variables through the `__init__` and `call` methods, leveraging TensorFlow or Theano's underlying tensor manipulation capabilities.  My experience optimizing deep learning models for image recognition tasks highlighted the necessity of this dual functionality for creating robust and adaptable layers.  Failure to properly distinguish between constant parameters and trainable variables often resulted in unexpected behavior during training, ranging from incorrect gradient calculations to complete model failure.

The core principle lies in how Keras manages the layer's weights and biases.  Weights are inherently variables; their values are updated during the backpropagation process to minimize the loss function.  Constants, on the other hand, remain fixed throughout training.  Effectively integrating both requires careful consideration of how these are defined and used within the layer's architecture.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A Keras custom layer is defined by subclassing the `Layer` class.  The `__init__` method initializes the layer's attributes, including both constants and variables.  Variables are created using `self.add_weight()`, specifying properties like initializer, trainability, and shape.  Constants can be assigned directly as attributes within `__init__`.  The crucial difference lies in how these are handled within the `call` method. The `call` method defines the layer's forward pass, where the input tensor is processed using these constants and variables to produce the output tensor.  Trainable variables are automatically tracked by Keras's optimizer during training, enabling gradient-based updates.  Constants remain untouched during this process.

The key to successfully implementing both is disciplined separation.  Clearly distinguish which attributes are trainable weights influencing the model's learning and which are fixed parameters integral to the layer's mathematical operation.  Poor separation will lead to unexpected behavior, particularly if constants are inadvertently updated or variables are incorrectly treated as constants.  Regular verification of variable properties and their interaction with the input tensor during the forward pass is essential.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Layer with a Trainable Weight and a Constant Scaling Factor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class ScaledLinearLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, scale_factor, **kwargs):
        super(ScaledLinearLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.scale_factor = tf.constant(scale_factor, dtype=tf.float32) # Constant
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(1,), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True) # Variable

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.scale_factor * tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

# Usage
layer = ScaledLinearLayer(scale_factor=2.0, input_shape=(10,))
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)

```
This example showcases a layer that performs a linear transformation scaled by a constant factor.  `scale_factor` remains constant during training, while `w` (weight) is a trainable variable updated by the optimizer.  The `tf.constant` function explicitly defines the constant, and the `self.add_weight` function adds the trainable weight, emphasizing the clear distinction.


**Example 2: Layer with a Constant Bias and Learnable Weights**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class BiasedDenseLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, bias_value, **kwargs):
        super(BiasedDenseLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.bias = tf.constant(bias_value, shape=(units,), dtype=tf.float32) #Constant bias
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(10, units), initializer='glorot_uniform', trainable=True) #Variable weights

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.bias

# Usage
layer = BiasedDenseLayer(units=5, bias_value=0.5, input_shape=(10,))
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)
```
This demonstrates a dense layer with a constant bias term.  The bias is set during initialization and remains fixed, whereas the weights are trainable. Note the explicit shape definition within `tf.constant` to ensure dimensional consistency with the output.

**Example 3:  Layer Incorporating a Pre-computed Lookup Table**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

class LookupLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, lookup_table, **kwargs):
        super(LookupLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.lookup_table = tf.constant(lookup_table, dtype=tf.float32)  # Constant Lookup Table

    def call(self, indices):
        return tf.gather(self.lookup_table, indices)

# Usage:
lookup_table = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5])
layer = LookupLayer(lookup_table)
indices = tf.constant([0, 2, 4])
output_tensor = layer(indices)
```
This example utilizes a pre-computed lookup table as a constant.  The `tf.gather` operation efficiently retrieves values from the table based on input indices.  The lookup table itself is not trainable; its values are fixed during the model's training process. This showcases a scenario where a pre-calculated resource efficiently enhances the layer functionality without requiring training.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official Keras documentation. Thoroughly examining the `Layer` class and related methods is crucial.
*   TensorFlow documentation, especially sections on tensor manipulation and constant creation.  Understanding TensorFlow's data structures is fundamental to effective custom layer development.
*   A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, focusing on the mathematical underpinnings of backpropagation and gradient descent. This allows a deeper appreciation of how Keras manages trainable variables.


By carefully following these principles and utilizing the `tf.constant` and `self.add_weight` methods appropriately, one can create highly flexible and efficient Keras custom layers that effectively integrate both constant parameters and trainable variables, resulting in more robust and adaptable deep learning models.  My extensive experience reinforces the importance of clarity and precision in defining the role of each attribute within the layer, preventing unexpected and often subtle errors during training and inference.
