A failure of the Sinkhorn algorithm to converge, particularly when dealing with highly skewed or sparse cost matrices, frequently stems from numerical instability arising during its iterative scaling process. I've personally encountered this issue on numerous occasions while implementing it for optimal transport problems, especially with high-dimensional datasets. The core problem isn't a flaw in the algorithm's logic, but rather the precision limits of floating-point arithmetic during its repeated computations.

The Sinkhorn algorithm is an iterative method that approximates the solution to the discrete optimal transport problem. Given two discrete probability measures represented as vectors, *a* and *b*, with *m* and *n* entries respectively (summing to 1), and a cost matrix *C* of size *m x n*, the objective is to find a transport plan, *P*, which is a non-negative matrix of the same dimensions, that minimizes the total cost, which is the element-wise product of *P* and *C*. The constraint is that the marginal sums of *P* must correspond to *a* and *b*.

The Sinkhorn algorithm introduces a regularization term, often with a parameter λ, to the optimal transport cost function, transforming it into a strictly convex problem. This allows for a faster iterative solution. The algorithm alternates scaling the rows and columns of a matrix derived from *C* and λ, aiming to converge to the desired solution *P*. The scaling steps involve taking the exponential of the cost matrix (or a transformed version of it) and multiplying it with diagonal matrices. However, without appropriate numerical handling, exponential values can easily become extremely small or excessively large, approaching zero or infinity in practical calculations, resulting in numerical underflow or overflow. This instability hinders the algorithm's convergence.

Here's a closer breakdown of the common failure points, illustrated with practical examples:

**1. Large or Small Cost Matrix Values:**

If the cost matrix *C* contains elements with extremely large magnitudes relative to λ, or close to zero, `exp(-C/λ)` can result in either numerical underflow (values too small to represent) or overflow (values too large to represent). Suppose, for instance, a section of the cost matrix *C* contains extremely large values, on the order of 10^10, and λ is set to 1. The term `exp(-C/λ)` will approach 0, which can lead to computational loss of information and a matrix filled with zeros, failing to converge.

```python
import numpy as np

def sinkhorn_iteration(K, a, b):
    m, n = K.shape
    u = np.ones(m)
    v = np.ones(n)
    
    for _ in range(20): # Assume 20 Iterations
        u = a / np.dot(K,v)
        v = b / np.dot(K.T,u)

    return u, v

# Example showing cost matrix issue
C = np.array([[1, 1e10], [1, 1]])
lam = 1
K = np.exp(-C/lam)
a = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
b = np.array([0.5, 0.5])

u,v = sinkhorn_iteration(K,a,b)
print(u, v)
#The result will be inconsistent as it loses information due to exp(-1e10)
```

In this example, the large value (10^10) in C causes extreme decay in the exponential, leading to a matrix K that is nearly zero in the specified entries, causing the scaling to stagnate or oscillate incorrectly.

**2. Ill-Conditioned Matrices Due to Sparse Entries:**

If the cost matrix has many zero or close-to-zero values, the resulting *K* matrix derived from *C* may also be highly sparse, causing numerical instability in the iterative scaling. During Sinkhorn's iterations, zero entries in the resulting scaling matrices can cause zero divisions and prevent the algorithm from converging as it divides by the sum of a scaled matrix column. If many entries become close to zero due to high cost values in *C*, the scaling vector update might lead to very large or unstable updates.

```python
import numpy as np

def sinkhorn_iteration(K, a, b):
    m, n = K.shape
    u = np.ones(m)
    v = np.ones(n)
    
    for _ in range(20): # Assume 20 Iterations
        u = a / np.dot(K,v)
        v = b / np.dot(K.T,u)

    return u, v
    
# Example demonstrating sparse entries cause instability
C = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]])
lam = 0.1
K = np.exp(-C/lam)
a = np.array([1/3, 1/3, 1/3])
b = np.array([1/3, 1/3, 1/3])

u,v = sinkhorn_iteration(K,a,b)
print(u, v)
# The result might not converge or diverge due to multiple zeros
```

In this second example, while the cost values aren't extremely large, the presence of many zeros leads to numerical issues with K and its subsequent scaling process.

**3. Incorrect Choice of Regularization Parameter (λ):**

The regularization parameter λ controls the trade-off between the original cost function and the entropy regularizer. A λ too large, pushes the solution towards a uniform matrix rather than an accurate optimal transport, preventing it from reaching convergence. In contrast, a λ too small might amplify any numerical errors present during iteration, due to very small values in the K matrix making it numerically unstable to divide by.

```python
import numpy as np

def sinkhorn_iteration(K, a, b):
    m, n = K.shape
    u = np.ones(m)
    v = np.ones(n)
    
    for _ in range(20): # Assume 20 Iterations
        u = a / np.dot(K,v)
        v = b / np.dot(K.T,u)

    return u, v

# Example demonstrating a small lam causes no convergence
C = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
lam = 0.0001
K = np.exp(-C/lam)
a = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
b = np.array([0.5, 0.5])
u,v = sinkhorn_iteration(K,a,b)
print(u, v)
# The result may be inconsistent due to very low lambda.
```

Here, a small lam leads to numerical instabilities in matrix K, preventing consistent updates on the scaling vectors.

To mitigate these convergence issues, several steps can be taken:

*   **Log-Domain Computations:** Instead of calculating `exp(-C/λ)` directly, I often work in the log-domain. This involves working with log(K), log(u) and log(v). The operations then become additions and subtractions instead of multiplications and divisions. This prevents the creation of extremely small or large values and increases numerical stability.

*   **Cost Matrix Scaling:** Scaling or normalization of the cost matrix, *C*, can be done to ensure the cost values have a reasonable range before exponentiation. Often, this involves standardizing the entries or taking the logarithm, depending on their distribution.

*   **Appropriate Lambda Selection:** Implementing a cross validation or adaptive way to select the regularization parameter lambda is essential. A fixed lamda might be suboptimal for different datasets. This often involves some trial and error and an initial assessment of the values in *C*.

*   **Early Stopping Criteria:** I often use an early stopping criterion to halt the Sinkhorn iterations. These include checking for small changes in the transport matrix or scaling vectors (using methods like Frobenius norm differences or absolute value change), which can help to prevent excessive calculations and improve efficiency.

*   **Use of High-Precision Floating-Point Numbers:** Sometimes, switching to 64-bit floats can help if 32-bit float precision results in underflow, while trading it with memory. However, this comes at a computational cost.

For resources, I would recommend consulting papers and books on optimal transport, particularly the theoretical foundations of the Sinkhorn algorithm and the numerical challenges. There are also publicly available implementations which highlight best practices when dealing with these numerical instabilities. Reviewing examples of the algorithm in different Python libraries can also provide some useful insight into how to mitigate the issues described above. Also, a good understanding of numerical computation and floating point arithmetic is indispensable.
