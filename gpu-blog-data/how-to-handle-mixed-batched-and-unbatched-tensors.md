The core challenge in managing mixed batched and unbatched tensors within TensorFlow stems from the inherent dimensionality mismatch.  Batched tensors possess an extra dimension representing the batch size, whereas unbatched tensors lack this dimension.  Direct operations between them will invariably result in shape mismatches and runtime errors.  My experience in developing large-scale recommendation systems heavily involved grappling with this very issue, particularly when integrating data from various sources with differing processing pipelines.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental approach to handling this involves ensuring dimensional consistency before performing any operations.  This can be achieved primarily through two strategies:  explicitly adding a batch dimension to the unbatched tensor or squeezing the batch dimension from the batched tensor when appropriate.  The choice between these strategies depends on the context of the operation and the desired output shape.  Critically, understanding the semantic meaning of the batch dimension is paramount.  Adding a batch dimension artificially should only occur when the unbatched tensor truly represents a single sample within a larger batch context.  Otherwise, it's crucial to reassess the data preprocessing steps to ensure consistency.

Furthermore, conditional logic, often implemented using TensorFlow's `tf.cond` or `tf.switch_case`, becomes necessary when dealing with scenarios where the presence or absence of the batch dimension is dynamic or determined at runtime. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with heterogeneous datasets where tensors can be batched or unbatched depending on factors like data source or preprocessing routines.  Failing to incorporate such conditionals may lead to runtime exceptions or incorrect computations.

Finally, efficient memory management is critical.  Unnecessary expansion of unbatched tensors into large batches can lead to significant memory overhead, especially in resource-constrained environments.  Thus, prioritizing the most memory-efficient approach is crucial for optimal performance.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Adding a Batch Dimension**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

unbatched_tensor = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0]) # Shape: (3,)
batched_tensor = tf.constant([[4.0, 5.0], [6.0, 7.0]]) # Shape: (2, 2)

# Add a batch dimension to the unbatched tensor
expanded_unbatched_tensor = tf.expand_dims(unbatched_tensor, axis=0) # Shape: (1, 3)

#Now perform element-wise addition, which is only possible with compatible shapes.
result = expanded_unbatched_tensor + batched_tensor # This will fail if we don't expand dimensions

#Reshape if needed for further operations
reshaped_result = tf.reshape(result, (2,3))

print(reshaped_result)
```

This example demonstrates how `tf.expand_dims` effectively adds a batch dimension (axis=0) to the unbatched tensor, making it compatible with the batched tensor for element-wise addition. The resulting tensor then can be further reshaped to a desired configuration.  Note that error handling mechanisms, not included here for brevity, should be added in production environments to gracefully manage potential shape mismatches.


**Example 2:  Squeezing the Batch Dimension**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

batched_tensor = tf.constant([[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]]) # Shape: (1, 2, 2)
unbatched_tensor = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]]) # Shape: (2,2)

#Remove the unnecessary batch dimension
squeezed_tensor = tf.squeeze(batched_tensor, axis=0) # Shape: (2, 2)

#Perform operations
result = squeezed_tensor + unbatched_tensor

print(result)
```

Here, `tf.squeeze` removes the superfluous batch dimension from `batched_tensor`, which often occurs when a single sample is accidentally batched. This aligns the shape for subsequent operations with the unbatched tensor.  Again, rigorous checks for appropriate shapes are needed in a robust system.


**Example 3: Conditional Handling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def process_tensor(tensor):
  if tensor.shape.rank == 2:  # Check if batched
    return tf.reduce_mean(tensor, axis=0) #Example operation on batched tensor
  else:
    return tf.reduce_sum(tensor) # Example operation on unbatched tensor

batched_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
unbatched_tensor = tf.constant([5.0, 6.0])

processed_batched = process_tensor(batched_tensor)
processed_unbatched = process_tensor(unbatched_tensor)

print(processed_batched)
print(processed_unbatched)
```

This example showcases how conditional logic using a simple `if` statement (which implicitly handles Tensor shapes) helps handle both batched and unbatched tensors appropriately.  More complex scenarios would require `tf.cond` or `tf.switch_case` for greater flexibility and control flow within the TensorFlow graph.  This is essential for handling dynamically shaped inputs, common in real-world applications where data pipelines may produce tensors of varying dimensionality.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guidance on tensor manipulation and shape management.  Thoroughly studying the sections on tensor reshaping, broadcasting, and conditional execution is highly recommended.  Furthermore,  textbooks on deep learning, particularly those covering practical aspects of model building and data preprocessing, offer valuable insights into handling diverse data formats and mitigating related challenges.  Finally, reviewing code examples from established open-source projects related to your specific application domain can provide practical strategies and best practices.
