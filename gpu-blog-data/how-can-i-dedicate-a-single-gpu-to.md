TensorFlow's GPU utilization, particularly on a multi-GPU system under Ubuntu, requires precise configuration.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across diverse projects, including a large-scale image recognition model and a real-time object detection pipeline, highlights the critical role of environment variables and CUDA visibility in achieving single-GPU dedication.  Ignoring these can lead to unexpected resource contention and performance degradation.  The key lies in controlling TensorFlow's visibility and access to specific GPU devices.

**1. Clear Explanation**

TensorFlow, by default, attempts to utilize all available CUDA-enabled GPUs. To restrict TensorFlow to a single GPU, we must explicitly specify the GPU index during session initialization.  This is achieved through environment variables, primarily `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.  This environment variable controls which GPUs are visible to CUDA-based applications, effectively limiting TensorFlow's access to the desired device.  It's crucial to understand that this isn't a "physical" dedication; it's a logical restriction of access.  The GPU itself remains accessible to other processes until explicitly reserved through other mechanisms like `nvidia-smi`. However, for TensorFlow,  `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` effectively dedicates the GPU for its exclusive use during the session's lifespan.

The GPU index starts at 0. Therefore, to use GPU 0, you set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0`.  To use GPU 1, you set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1`, and so forth.  Incorrectly specifying the index, or failing to set the variable, will lead to TensorFlow attempting to use all available devices, resulting in potential performance issues and resource conflicts, particularly if the system is performing other GPU-intensive tasks concurrently. Furthermore, confirming the correct GPU indices through tools like `nvidia-smi` before execution is a critical best practice.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate how to dedicate a single GPU to TensorFlow 2.2 on Ubuntu using Python.  Each example uses a different approach for context and clarity.

**Example 1: Utilizing `os.environ` for Environment Variable Setting**

```python
import os
import tensorflow as tf

# Specify the GPU index.  Change '0' to the desired GPU index.
os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = '0'

# Verify the GPU visibility.  This is crucial for debugging.
print(f"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: {os.environ.get('CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES')}")

# Initialize a TensorFlow session.  TensorFlow will now only use the specified GPU.
with tf.compat.v1.Session(config=tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto(allow_soft_placement=True, log_device_placement=True)) as sess:
    # Your TensorFlow code here... for instance, a simple tensor operation.
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], shape=[5])
    b = tf.constant([1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], shape=[5])
    c = a + b
    print(sess.run(c))
```

**Commentary:** This example uses the `os.environ` method to set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable before initializing the TensorFlow session. The `allow_soft_placement=True` flag allows TensorFlow to gracefully fall back to CPU if the specified GPU isn't available, while `log_device_placement=True` prints information about which device each operation is assigned to, aiding in debugging and verification.


**Example 2:  Using `tf.config.set_visible_devices` for Direct Control (TensorFlow 2.x)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Specify the GPU index.  Change '0' to the desired GPU index.
gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
        tf.config.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')
        logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
        print(e)


# Your TensorFlow code here...
a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], shape=[5])
b = tf.constant([1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], shape=[5])
c = a + b
print(c)

```

**Commentary:** This approach utilizes TensorFlow's built-in functions to manage GPU visibility directly.  The `tf.config.set_visible_devices` function restricts TensorFlow to see only the specified GPU. The inclusion of `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)` is crucial for managing GPU memory allocation dynamically, preventing out-of-memory errors, especially beneficial in scenarios with varying model sizes or data inputs.  Error handling is included to address potential runtime errors.


**Example 3:  Command-line Argument Setting**

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python your_tensorflow_script.py
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates setting the environment variable directly from the command line before executing the Python script.  This is a convenient approach for quick testing or when you need to easily switch between GPUs.  Remember to replace `0` with your desired GPU index and `your_tensorflow_script.py` with the name of your TensorFlow script.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on GPU usage and configuration, provides comprehensive information.  The CUDA Toolkit documentation is indispensable for understanding CUDA device management and configuration within the broader Ubuntu environment.  Additionally, the `nvidia-smi` command-line utility is crucial for monitoring GPU usage and identifying device indices.  Consulting these resources will greatly enhance your understanding and troubleshooting capabilities. Remember to verify your CUDA drivers are correctly installed and configured for your specific GPU model and Ubuntu version.  A thorough understanding of the CUDA architecture and its interaction with the operating system is also greatly beneficial.
