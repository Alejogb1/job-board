TensorFlow's dataset API, while powerful, does *not* inherently guarantee deterministic ordering when iterating through elements, particularly after transformations or shuffling. I've encountered this firsthand during training runs where inconsistent evaluation metrics arose from what I initially assumed was a static dataset. This variability is primarily due to the asynchronous nature of many dataset operations and the potential for parallel processing, which can introduce non-deterministic behavior.

Specifically, operations like `tf.data.Dataset.shuffle` and even certain `map` operations applied across multiple threads can lead to varying orderings of elements in successive iterations. The key issue is that TensorFlow often optimizes performance by prefetching data and parallelizing operations. This optimization can result in elements being processed or returned in a different sequence depending on the precise timing and scheduling of threads. This behavior is crucial to understand because it can directly impact the reproducibility of model training, particularly when evaluating on smaller datasets or with limited batch sizes.

Consider a basic example, loading a list into a dataset and applying a trivial map:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: x*2)

for element in dataset:
    print(element.numpy())
```

In this case, you'll observe that the output will consistently be `2, 4, 6, 8, 10`. The dataset has been built directly from a tensor slices and mapped with an operation that preserves order. However, this apparent determinism is an oversimplification, and this specific case might be predictable. The problem starts when we introduce operations that alter the order.

Let's demonstrate shuffling:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=len(data))
dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: x*2)

for element in dataset:
    print(element.numpy())
```

Here, `dataset.shuffle` introduces randomness, and each time you execute this script, you will likely obtain a different order of elements. The `buffer_size` argument dictates how many elements are pre-fetched and shuffled at each iteration. It's important to understand that the `shuffle` operation provides a pseudo-random shuffling, influenced by TensorFlowâ€™s internal seed generator.

To achieve a reproducible dataset order when shuffling is involved, it's crucial to manage the random seed:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
seed = 42 # Setting a specific seed
tf.random.set_seed(seed)
np.random.seed(seed)


dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=len(data), seed=seed)
dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: x*2)


for element in dataset:
    print(element.numpy())
```

By using `tf.random.set_seed(seed)` before the dataset creation, and specifying the `seed` within the `shuffle` operation, the order of shuffled elements becomes deterministic for a specific seed value. The same seed will now consistently yield the same ordering. The inclusion of `np.random.seed(seed)` is good practice, as some other parts of the model training might also rely on numpy's random functions.

Beyond shuffling, parallelism in dataset processing can also impact determinism. Operations like `map` with `num_parallel_calls` parameter (or even when no explicit parameter is used) can become non-deterministic without using the option `deterministic=True` for the `map`.  This can manifest as subtle variations in the element order. Consider the following example where a dummy computation that involves sleeping a bit to simulate work is performed:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

def slow_map_fn(x):
    time.sleep(0.01) # Simulate some computation
    return x * 2

data = list(range(10))
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
dataset = dataset.map(slow_map_fn)

for element in dataset:
  print(element.numpy())

```

This basic `map` operation, when executed, can exhibit slight non-deterministic behavior because of TensorFlow's inherent parallelism. Adding  `num_parallel_calls` exacerbates this effect, making the order even less predictable unless addressed, as mentioned above. Now, let's add it and make it deterministic:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

def slow_map_fn(x):
    time.sleep(0.01) # Simulate some computation
    return x * 2

data = list(range(10))
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)
dataset = dataset.map(slow_map_fn, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE, deterministic=True)

for element in dataset:
  print(element.numpy())
```

By specifying `deterministic=True` in the `map` operation, we ensure a deterministic order, even when utilizing parallel processing with `num_parallel_calls`. When not specified, the default behavior might be determined by other configuration options or internal defaults of TensorFlow.

While the examples focus on simple transformations, these concepts directly apply to more complex data pipelines. Any operation involving randomness or parallelism needs careful management of the seed or the `deterministic` parameter to guarantee reproducible results.

When constructing data pipelines for training or evaluation, especially when reproducibility is critical, consider these recommendations. First, if shuffling is used, specify a random seed consistently across dataset creation and model initialization. Use `tf.random.set_seed` at the start of the training run, and then specify the `seed` argument for the `shuffle` function. Second, whenever using the `map` operations, particularly with `num_parallel_calls`, always explicitly set `deterministic=True` for operations where order needs to be maintained. Third, avoid relying on default or implicit parallelism without a complete understanding of how it might affect the order. Finally, when debugging, explicitly iterate through datasets and analyze intermediate steps, and check the tensor shapes and types in every step of the data pipeline. These practices will aid in the diagnostic process.

Regarding additional learning resources, official TensorFlow documentation provides in-depth explanations about `tf.data.Dataset` functionality, specifically regarding transformations and performance. Tutorials related to reproducibility in machine learning and deep learning, available at multiple educational platforms, discuss the practical implications of determinism for your model. Furthermore, articles on distributed training often explain the nuances of data loading in parallel environments.
