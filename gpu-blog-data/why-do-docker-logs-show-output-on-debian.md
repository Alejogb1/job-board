The discrepancy in Docker log output between Debian and Ubuntu containers often stems from differences in how the respective systems handle journald, the systemd journaling service.  My experience troubleshooting containerized applications across various Linux distributions has highlighted this as a critical factor. While both utilize journald, the default configuration and interaction with Docker's logging mechanisms differ subtly, leading to the observed behavior.  This is not a fundamental Docker limitation, but rather a consequence of interacting with distinct system logging infrastructures.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

Docker, by default, uses the `json-file` logging driver.  This driver writes container logs to a JSON file within the container's filesystem.  However, the accessibility and visibility of these logs depend heavily on how the host operating system manages the container's filesystem and interacts with the journaling system.  In Debian-based systems, the default configuration often favors direct access to the container's file system, making the logs readily accessible via the `docker logs` command.  Ubuntu, on the other hand, employs a more robust and integrated approach with journald.  While container logs *are* written to the JSON file, the system's default logging pipeline might not automatically forward these logs to the journald daemon, resulting in the perceived absence of output from the `docker logs` command.  This doesn't mean the logs are lost; they simply require different access methods.  The issue lies not in the generation of logs, but rather in the pathway to their retrieval.  Furthermore, variations in the `systemd` configuration between different Ubuntu versions can exacerbate the problem.  Kernel version compatibility can also subtly alter how container logs are handled.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1: Demonstrating Log Output on Debian (Successful)**

```bash
# Dockerfile for a simple Debian-based container
FROM debian:bullseye-slim

# Install a utility for demonstration
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y busybox

# Run a command that generates logs
CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Log entry from Debian'; sleep 1; done"]
```

This Dockerfile builds a minimal Debian container.  The `CMD` instruction runs a simple loop that repeatedly writes "Log entry from Debian" to standard output.  On a Debian host, running `docker logs <container_id>` after starting the container will consistently show this output.  This is because the underlying filesystem structure and journald integration are favorable to the default Docker logging driver.


**Example 2: Log Output on Ubuntu (Unsuccessful - Default Behavior)**

```bash
# Dockerfile for a simple Ubuntu-based container
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install a utility for demonstration
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y busybox

# Run a command that generates logs
CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Log entry from Ubuntu'; sleep 1; done"]
```

This mirrors the Debian example but utilizes an Ubuntu base image.  When executed on an Ubuntu host system, simply running `docker logs <container_id>` might *not* display the expected output.  This reflects the aforementioned difference in how Ubuntu handles container logs in relation to journald, not necessarily a lack of log generation within the container itself.


**Example 3: Accessing Logs on Ubuntu via Journalctl (Successful)**

```bash
# Accessing logs using journalctl

# Find the container's journalctl identifier
docker inspect <container_id> | grep "SystemdSyslogIdentifier" | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '"'

# Use the identifier with journalctl
journalctl -u <container_identifier>
```

This demonstrates a workaround for retrieving logs on Ubuntu.  `docker inspect` provides metadata about the container, including a systemd identifier. This identifier acts as a key for querying the journald logs. Using `journalctl` with the appropriate identifier allows retrieving the output even if `docker logs` fails.  This approach bypasses the default Docker logging driver and directly accesses the journald logs where the container's output was likely forwarded, highlighting the crucial role of the system's logging infrastructure.  This illustrates that the logs exist, but require a different retrieval mechanism.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Docker logging, consult the official Docker documentation.  Understanding systemd and journald is crucial;  refer to the relevant systemd documentation and manuals for both Debian and Ubuntu.  Exploring the various Docker logging drivers – besides `json-file`, options exist such as `syslog` and `fluentd` – can offer alternative logging solutions for improved cross-distribution compatibility.  Examining the configuration files for journald on both Debian and Ubuntu systems will shed light on the underlying discrepancies.  Finally, thorough examination of container runtimes and their integration with the host system will prove beneficial in troubleshooting these issues.  These resources provide a comprehensive foundation to resolve similar inconsistencies in container logging across different Linux distributions.
