The discrepancy observed when the loss is zero while utilizing `from_logits=True` in a binary cross-entropy function, particularly in PyTorch or TensorFlow, arises from the way these functions interpret their input. Specifically, with `from_logits=True`, the function expects raw, unnormalized scores (logits) as input rather than probabilities. A common source of confusion is when outputs are inadvertently scaled to represent probabilities (between 0 and 1) prior to being fed into the loss function.

My experience has demonstrated that such situations often occur in early prototyping or when translating models across different frameworks. I recall an instance during a project involving multi-label classification where we were porting a model from a custom framework to PyTorch. The original code had already applied a sigmoid function to the output, assuming it was a binary output for each label, and I didn't fully comprehend the default behaviors of `torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`. When we initialized our loss function with `from_logits=True`, the loss consistently reported as 0. This seemed alarming initially, suggesting an incorrectly implemented model. I quickly realized we were providing the already sigmoided output when the loss function anticipated raw scores. This is not an atypical scenario, especially when individuals are not deeply familiar with specific loss functions' expectations regarding input format.

The key mechanism is the inherent mathematical calculation of the binary cross-entropy loss function. When `from_logits=True`, the function incorporates a sigmoid operation *internally* on the input logits *before* computing the cross-entropy. Mathematically, the loss for a single instance *i* is computed as:

L(*yᵢ*, *ŷᵢ*) = - [*yᵢ* *log(σ(*ŷᵢ*)) + (1 - *yᵢ*) *log(1 - σ(*ŷᵢ*))]

where:

*   *yᵢ* is the ground truth label (either 0 or 1)
*   *ŷᵢ* is the input logit
*   σ(*ŷᵢ*) is the sigmoid of *ŷᵢ*,  represented as 1 / (1 + exp(-*ŷᵢ*))

The crux of the issue appears when *ŷᵢ*, despite not being a probability directly, has a sigmoid result equal to the target value *yᵢ* due to an upstream sigmoid application, thus driving both terms within the loss formula towards 0. Specifically, if *ŷᵢ* is any very large positive number when yᵢ is 1 (resulting in σ(*ŷᵢ*) close to 1), or any very large negative number when *yᵢ* is 0 (resulting in σ(*ŷᵢ*) close to 0) we get log(1) or log(0) respectively, causing the error to drive toward 0. In contrast, the standard behavior of the function `from_logits=False` expects input to be probabilities directly.

To better understand this, consider three scenarios implemented in PyTorch:

**Example 1: Expected Behavior (Logits as Input)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Generate some sample logits and true labels
logits = torch.tensor([[2.5, -1.2, 0.7], [-0.5, 1.8, -2.0]], dtype=torch.float32) # logits
targets = torch.tensor([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]], dtype=torch.float32) # target labels
# BCE with logits as expected:
loss_function_logits = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
loss_logits = loss_function_logits(logits, targets)
print(f"Loss with logits: {loss_logits}")  # prints a loss value
```

This first example shows the correct way to use `BCEWithLogitsLoss` when `from_logits=True` (implied, as it is the default). The input `logits` contains raw scores (positive and negative values) before any transformation. The loss will compute the sigmoid internally and then calculate the binary cross-entropy. As we are using logits and not probabilities, we will have a non-zero loss result.

**Example 2: Erroneous Behavior (Probabilities Input with `from_logits=True`)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Sample logits, then apply sigmoid to create probabilities
logits = torch.tensor([[2.5, -1.2, 0.7], [-0.5, 1.8, -2.0]], dtype=torch.float32)
probabilities = F.sigmoid(logits)
targets = torch.tensor([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]], dtype=torch.float32)
loss_function_logits = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
loss_logits_incorrect = loss_function_logits(probabilities, targets)
print(f"Incorrect Loss with probabilities (from_logits=True) {loss_logits_incorrect}") # prints very small loss value, tending toward zero
```

Here, the `logits` tensor is first passed through a sigmoid to generate `probabilities`. When these already-sigmoided outputs are fed to `BCEWithLogitsLoss` which internally also applies a sigmoid, the result is a sigmoid of a sigmoid. Because the logit values tend to be small, the error is driven toward zero because both sigmoid results (the one we applied manually, and the one applied internally by the loss function) tend to cluster around the target value after the second sigmoid step (i.e. the model predicted correctly because it's output is already a probability). A crucial point to emphasize is that `BCEWithLogitsLoss` is not designed to handle probabilities directly with `from_logits=True`. Instead, it is designed to interpret the logit scale. This example illustrates the central issue related to the question.

**Example 3: Correct Behavior (Probabilities Input with `from_logits=False`)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Sample logits, then apply sigmoid to create probabilities
logits = torch.tensor([[2.5, -1.2, 0.7], [-0.5, 1.8, -2.0]], dtype=torch.float32)
probabilities = F.sigmoid(logits)
targets = torch.tensor([[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]], dtype=torch.float32)
loss_function_probabilities = nn.BCELoss()
loss_probabilities_correct = loss_function_probabilities(probabilities, targets)
print(f"Correct Loss with probabilities (from_logits=False) {loss_probabilities_correct}") # prints a loss value
```

In the final example, we see that when probabilities are passed to the basic `BCELoss` (which has `from_logits=False` by default), the loss is calculated correctly and will produce a loss. This is because it is expecting input values that are already normalized and constrained between 0 and 1.

In my experience, a thorough understanding of each function's input expectations is paramount to avoid these kinds of errors. Debugging such a scenario typically involves examining the forward pass of your network, paying close attention to any transformations performed on the model's output.

For further clarification of loss functions and their nuances, I recommend reviewing the documentation provided by PyTorch, TensorFlow, and similar deep learning libraries. In addition, textbooks on deep learning and neural networks often contain detailed explanations regarding the theory behind common loss functions, specifically binary cross-entropy. Furthermore, exploring example repositories and actively participating in online forums can provide useful practical insights. A strong grasp of both theoretical understanding and practical nuances prevents loss-related errors and accelerates the development and deployment of accurate models.
