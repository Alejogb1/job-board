Efficient data loading is crucial for training deep learning models, especially when dealing with large datasets.  My experience working on a large-scale image recognition project highlighted the critical need for conditional data loadingâ€”avoiding unnecessary processing of irrelevant data significantly improved training time and resource utilization.  This response will address how to load custom data in PyTorch only when it satisfies a predetermined condition.

The core strategy involves implementing custom data loaders leveraging PyTorch's `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes, combined with conditional logic within the `__getitem__` method of the custom dataset.  This allows for filtering data points *before* they are loaded into memory, preventing the overhead associated with loading and then discarding unsuitable examples.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process begins with creating a custom `Dataset` class inheriting from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.  This class will override the `__len__` and `__getitem__` methods. The `__len__` method returns the total number of data points, while `__getitem__` returns a single data point given an index. Crucially, the `__getitem__` method will incorporate the conditional logic. This condition checks whether a specific data point satisfies the requirements before returning it.  If the condition is not met, the method can either return `None` or raise a custom exception, which can be handled during data loading to prevent processing of invalid data.

The `DataLoader` class then uses this custom dataset to create batches of data.  Its `collate_fn` parameter can further be customized to handle potential inconsistencies resulting from conditional filtering.  For instance, a customized `collate_fn` could handle uneven batch sizes resulting from filtering.  Failing to account for this could lead to errors during model training.

Efficient data handling often necessitates pre-processing.  Consider storing pre-computed features or metadata alongside your raw data.  This avoids redundant computation within the `__getitem__` method, boosting loading efficiency.  This strategy is particularly beneficial when your condition involves computationally expensive operations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Filtering Images Based on Pixel Count**

This example demonstrates filtering images based on their total pixel count.  Images below a certain threshold are excluded.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from PIL import Image

class ImageDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, image_paths, pixel_threshold):
        self.image_paths = image_paths
        self.pixel_threshold = pixel_threshold

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.image_paths)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        try:
            img = Image.open(self.image_paths[idx]).convert('RGB')
            pixel_count = img.width * img.height
            if pixel_count >= self.pixel_threshold:
                transform = transforms.ToTensor() # Add necessary transformations here
                return transform(img)
            else:
                return None # Or raise an exception
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error loading image at index {idx}: {e}")
            return None

image_paths = ['path/to/image1.jpg', 'path/to/image2.png', ...] # Replace with your actual paths
dataset = ImageDataset(image_paths, 10000)  # 10000 pixel threshold
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, collate_fn=lambda batch: [x for x in batch if x is not None])

for batch in dataloader:
    # Process the batch
    pass
```

**Example 2: Conditional Loading Based on Metadata**

This example shows conditional loading based on metadata stored in a separate file.  Only images with a specific label are loaded.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import json
from PIL import Image

class MetadataDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, image_paths, metadata_path, required_label):
        self.image_paths = image_paths
        self.metadata = json.load(open(metadata_path))
        self.required_label = required_label

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.image_paths)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        try:
            image_name = self.image_paths[idx].split('/')[-1].split('.')[0]
            if self.metadata[image_name]['label'] == self.required_label:
                img = Image.open(self.image_paths[idx]).convert('RGB')
                transform = transforms.ToTensor() # Add transformations
                return transform(img)
            else:
                return None
        except (KeyError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
            print(f"Error loading image {self.image_paths[idx]}: {e}")
            return None


image_paths = ['path/to/image1.jpg', 'path/to/image2.png', ...]
metadata_path = 'path/to/metadata.json'
dataset = MetadataDataset(image_paths, metadata_path, 'cat') # Load only images labeled 'cat'
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, collate_fn=lambda batch: [x for x in batch if x is not None])

for batch in dataloader:
    pass
```


**Example 3:  Handling Exceptions During Conditional Loading**

This example demonstrates robust exception handling.  It shows how to manage situations where the condition check might fail, preventing crashes during data loading.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

class RobustDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data, condition_func):
        self.data = data
        self.condition_func = condition_func

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        try:
            item = self.data[idx]
            if self.condition_func(item):
                return item
            else:
                return None
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing item at index {idx}: {e}")
            return None

data = [{"value": i, "flag": i % 2 == 0} for i in range(100)]
def condition(item):
    return item['flag']

dataset = RobustDataset(data, condition)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, collate_fn=lambda batch: [x for x in batch if x is not None])

for batch in dataloader:
    pass
```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on `Dataset` and `DataLoader`, are indispensable.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning principles and practical implementations will prove useful.  Finally,  exploring relevant research papers on efficient data loading techniques for deep learning can provide valuable insights.  Careful study of these resources will significantly enhance your understanding of efficient data handling in PyTorch.
