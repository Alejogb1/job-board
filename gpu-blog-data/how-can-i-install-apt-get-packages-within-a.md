The `pytorch/manylinux-cpu` base image, while providing a pre-configured environment suitable for PyTorch development, does not include `apt-get` or similar package managers by default. This is because it's built on a minimal CentOS base to reduce size and potential dependency conflicts. Consequently, directly running `apt-get install <package>` within a Dockerfile based on this image will result in an error. To install packages using a Debian-based package manager within such a container, the most practical approach involves adding the necessary tools and configurations directly within the Dockerfile. My experience across multiple projects implementing similar dependency structures suggests that achieving this requires a phased process, starting from installing the fundamental tools, and progressing to system configuration specific to the manylinux environment.

The primary hurdle lies in the base image's design choice to not include package managers outside of `yum`. `yum`, however, does not have access to Debian-style packages, while `apt-get` typically does not exist in minimal CentOS installations. To overcome this, I have successfully used a two-pronged strategy: first, installing the needed `apt` tools, and then leveraging `apt` with a `debian` system base on an isolated build layer to install required packages in that environment, and finally copy them to the target environment. This strategy ensures compatibility and addresses dependency conflict possibilities.

My approach hinges on the multi-stage Docker build, which enables the creation of an isolated build environment that utilizes Debian-based tooling without contaminating the final production image. I typically proceed in three key steps: establishing an environment for package retrieval and unpacking; performing the installations within a Debian-based image, and copying the installed files to the target manylinux image, while taking into consideration necessary pathing and environment setup. This helps maintain the lean and clean nature of the final `pytorch/manylinux-cpu` image.

Here's an example Dockerfile demonstrating this technique:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build Environment (Debian-based)
FROM debian:bullseye-slim AS builder

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    rsync

# Copy helper files (if needed, see below)
COPY helper-scripts/* ./
RUN chmod +x ./install_libs.sh

# Example usage of helper script, can be replaced by direct package install
RUN ./install_libs.sh


# Stage 2: Final Image (pytorch/manylinux-cpu based)
FROM pytorch/manylinux-cpu:latest

COPY --from=builder /opt/installed_libs /opt/installed_libs
COPY --from=builder /opt/installed_bin /usr/bin # or a location as preferred.
COPY --from=builder /etc/ld.so.conf.d/additional_libs.conf /etc/ld.so.conf.d/

RUN ldconfig
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/installed_libs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
This dockerfile provides a general example, and its implementation requires one additional helper script described below to ensure that the installed packages are correctly placed during the build process. The first stage, denoted by the `AS builder` alias, uses a slim Debian image as its base. In this stage, I update the package list, install `rsync`, and any additional helper scripts, in this case a helper `install_libs.sh`. The `rsync` utility proves invaluable for reliably copying files across different file systems during the subsequent stage. I've had success in automating library installation by creating a `install_libs.sh` script, which I'll explain further. The script executes within the builder environment. The second stage starts with the provided `pytorch/manylinux-cpu` image, where the output of the builder stage is copied using the  `COPY --from=builder` command. Notably the `/opt/installed_libs` is copied, along with a `ld.so.conf.d` file that instructs `ldconfig` to find all libraries in the new location. This stage also sets the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, which is essential in informing the system where to look for shared libraries that may have been installed from the debian environment.

The `install_libs.sh` bash script, placed in a directory called `/helper-scripts/` and copied to the builder environment in the above Dockerfile, looks something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

apt-get update
apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends <package1> <package2> <package3>

mkdir -p /opt/installed_libs

cp -r /usr/lib/* /opt/installed_libs/
cp -r /usr/lib64/* /opt/installed_libs/

mkdir -p /opt/installed_bin

cp -r /usr/bin/* /opt/installed_bin/

echo "/opt/installed_libs" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/additional_libs.conf
```
The purpose of the `install_libs.sh` script is to perform package installation within the temporary Debian-based image. It updates the package list and installs placeholders for `<package1>`, `<package2>`, and `<package3>`. You'd replace these with the actual Debian package names needed. It creates a destination location, usually `/opt/installed_libs` to mirror a typical library location, and copies all installed library files. Similarly, it installs binaries in `/opt/installed_bin`. Finally, it writes a library path configuration file to `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/additional_libs.conf`, informing the system of the location of all installed libraries. This configuration file is then copied to the target environment in the last stage of the Dockerfile to make the libraries accessible.

The following is an example of a more specific implementation:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build Environment (Debian-based)
FROM debian:bullseye-slim AS builder

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    rsync

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    libgdal-dev

RUN mkdir -p /opt/installed_libs
RUN mkdir -p /opt/installed_bin

RUN cp -r /usr/lib/* /opt/installed_libs/
RUN cp -r /usr/lib64/* /opt/installed_libs/

RUN cp -r /usr/bin/* /opt/installed_bin/
RUN echo "/opt/installed_libs" > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/additional_libs.conf


# Stage 2: Final Image (pytorch/manylinux-cpu based)
FROM pytorch/manylinux-cpu:latest

COPY --from=builder /opt/installed_libs /opt/installed_libs
COPY --from=builder /opt/installed_bin /usr/bin
COPY --from=builder /etc/ld.so.conf.d/additional_libs.conf /etc/ld.so.conf.d/

RUN ldconfig
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/installed_libs:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

In this more specific implementation, I've directly installed the development headers for GDAL. This allows me to link libraries built from this image to the gdal package. The library is installed and placed in `/opt/installed_libs`, and all binaries are placed in `/opt/installed_bin` which is copied to `/usr/bin` on the target image. The library path is then set as in the previous example.

When implementing this, one needs to be wary of potential version incompatibilities. Specifically, some installed Debian packages may rely on other shared objects that are different from the ones already present in the `pytorch/manylinux-cpu` image. This has sometimes manifested in runtime errors when trying to execute scripts built on this image. These inconsistencies can often be resolved by building as many of the dependencies from source in the builder stage, or ensuring the versions of Debian packages are compatible with the target system. Using a very lightweight `debian:bullseye-slim` base image in the builder stage has also reduced the number of such inconsistencies.

When exploring more complex dependencies, utilizing tools like `ldd` within the builder stage on the installed libraries can give a better idea of all dependencies and the pathing for these libraries. Then, these dependencies can be included in the copy statements within the helper script. This is especially important for packages with native dependencies, and has helped debug dependency issues related to different glibc versions. Also, inspecting the `apt` package list in the build phase may give clues to any issues that may manifest in the runtime phase.

In conclusion, installing packages typically managed by `apt-get` within a Docker image built from the `pytorch/manylinux-cpu` base image requires a multi-stage approach. This involves creating a build environment, installing the necessary packages into a consistent directory, configuring the necessary environment variables, and copying the results to the final image. I've found that a good balance between flexibility and maintainability can be achieved using the techniques and examples mentioned in this response.

For further exploration of this subject, I recommend exploring the official Docker documentation, specifically the section on multi-stage builds. Also, referencing the documentation on the base image provided on the PyTorch website might also give valuable insight into some constraints and potential conflicts. Additionally, consulting the Debian package repository documentation and the documentation for the libraries you intend to install is valuable. These sources provide a thorough understanding of dependency management and the finer points of creating robust Docker images for scientific computing.
