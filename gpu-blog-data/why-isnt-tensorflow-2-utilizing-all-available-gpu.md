TensorFlow 2's apparent underutilization of available GPU memory often stems from a combination of factors, primarily related to memory allocation strategies and the interaction between TensorFlow's runtime and the CUDA driver.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale image recognition projects consistently pointed to three main culprits:  unnecessary memory fragmentation, insufficient configuration of memory growth, and the implicit memory management of TensorFlow's eager execution.


**1. Memory Fragmentation:** TensorFlow, like many deep learning frameworks, relies on dynamic memory allocation.  This means that memory is requested and released as needed during the training process. However, frequent allocation and deallocation of small memory blocks can lead to significant fragmentation.  This occurs when available memory is scattered across numerous small, non-contiguous chunks, rendering larger contiguous blocks unavailable, even if the total free memory is substantial.  This effect is particularly pronounced when dealing with large datasets or complex models, which tend to exhibit more dynamic memory usage patterns.  Over time, this fragmentation inhibits the framework from allocating the contiguous memory blocks required for larger operations, leading to out-of-memory errors or suboptimal utilization of the available GPU resources.


**2. Insufficient Memory Growth Configuration:** TensorFlow offers a mechanism for controlling GPU memory allocation through the `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` function.  This feature allows TensorFlow to dynamically grow its memory footprint as needed, rather than allocating a fixed amount upfront.  However, if this feature is not enabled or is not configured correctly, TensorFlow may allocate only a small portion of the GPU memory initially, leaving the remaining memory unused. This initial allocation might be sufficient for smaller tasks, but as the model grows or the dataset expands, TensorFlow might encounter out-of-memory errors, despite having substantial free memory.  Failure to explicitly enable this feature often results in the perception that TensorFlow is not utilizing all available GPU memory, when, in reality, it simply hasn't been given the permission to expand its usage.


**3. Eager Execution and Implicit Memory Management:**  TensorFlow's eager execution mode, while beneficial for debugging and interactive development, can contribute to less efficient memory management compared to graph mode. In eager execution, operations are executed immediately, and the memory management is less explicit.  Consequently, intermediate tensors and variables might occupy memory longer than necessary, leading to increased memory consumption and potential fragmentation.  This contrasts with graph mode, where the entire computation graph is built before execution, allowing for more optimized memory allocation and deallocation. Although eager execution simplifies development, its less precise memory control can lead to underutilization or inefficient use of GPU memory, especially in computationally intensive tasks.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**


**Example 1: Enabling Memory Growth:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  try:
    # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
    for gpu in gpus:
      tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
    logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
  except RuntimeError as e:
    # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
    print(e)

# Rest of your TensorFlow code...
```

This code snippet explicitly enables memory growth for all available GPUs.  The `try-except` block handles potential `RuntimeError` exceptions, which can occur if memory growth is set after GPUs have been initialized.  This is a crucial step to ensure TensorFlow dynamically allocates memory as required, avoiding the problem of insufficient initial allocation.


**Example 2: Monitoring GPU Memory Usage:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import psutil

# ... your TensorFlow code ...

# Monitor GPU memory usage using nvidia-smi (requires nvidia-smi to be installed)
import subprocess
process = subprocess.Popen(['nvidia-smi', '--query-gpu=memory.used', '--format=csv,noheader,nounits'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
output, error = process.communicate()
gpu_memory_used = int(output.decode('utf-8').strip())
print(f"GPU Memory Used: {gpu_memory_used} MB")


# Monitor overall system memory usage
mem = psutil.virtual_memory()
print(f"System Memory Usage: {mem.percent}%")
```

This example demonstrates how to monitor both GPU and system memory usage.  The use of `nvidia-smi` provides a direct measurement of the GPU memory utilization, while `psutil` tracks the overall system memory statistics.  Monitoring memory consumption during training is critical for identifying potential bottlenecks and optimizing memory management.


**Example 3:  Utilizing tf.function for improved memory management (Graph Mode):**


```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_computation(x):
  # Your computationally intensive operation here
  result = tf.reduce_sum(x)
  return result

# ... your TensorFlow code ...

#Example Usage
x = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
result = my_computation(x)
```

Decorating a function with `@tf.function` encourages TensorFlow to trace the function and execute it in graph mode. While eager execution facilitates debugging, graph mode provides better optimization opportunities, including more efficient memory management. By converting parts of your code to graph mode, you can potentially reduce memory fragmentation and improve resource utilization.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on memory management and GPU configuration.  Consult CUDA programming guides for a deeper understanding of GPU memory allocation and management.  Furthermore, examining performance profiling tools specifically designed for CUDA applications can offer valuable insight into memory usage patterns within TensorFlow operations.  Finally, exploring advanced techniques like memory pooling and custom memory allocation strategies may be necessary for highly memory-intensive workloads.
