The inherent immutability of a Keras SavedModel's architecture, specifically its input layer definitions, presents a significant challenge when modifying input shapes post-training. Attempting to directly alter the `input_shape` of a model loaded via `tf.keras.models.load_model()` will not affect the underlying computation graph; the model's input tensors remain tied to the shapes defined during its initial construction. Instead, a more nuanced approach is required, typically involving the reconstruction of a new model with the desired input specifications, while selectively transplanting weights from the pre-trained SavedModel.

The core issue resides in TensorFlow's graph-based execution paradigm. A SavedModel encapsulates the architecture of the model as a computational graph, where tensors are explicitly linked by shape and data type. Altering a layer's `input_shape` after model serialization would require fundamental re-wiring of this graph, a process TensorFlow does not permit through simple attribute assignment. Instead, the solution revolves around creating a new model framework with the target input shape and meticulously copying weights from the pre-trained model to the newly established corresponding layers. This process effectively recreates the functionality of the original model, albeit within a new architectural context featuring the adjusted input dimensions.

Consider a scenario where I've built a convolutional neural network for image classification with a fixed input size of 224x224 pixels. This model has been serialized into a SavedModel. Now, I want to adapt this same model for a use case where images are of size 128x128. Directly loading the model and attempting to modify the input shape will not work. I've encountered this directly in several projects involving real-time inference on embedded systems, where input resolutions were highly variable.

The procedure to successfully modify the input shape involves several steps: Firstly, you must define a new model, mirroring the architecture of the original model, but with the adjusted `input_shape`. Secondly, you iteratively transfer the weights from the corresponding layers of the loaded SavedModel. There might be layers that need special treatment if they depend directly on the input shape, such as the initial Convolutional layer. Therefore, careful weight transfer is mandatory.

Here's a code example demonstrating the process with a simplified convolutional neural network, assuming the original model was built using a Keras `Model` subclass:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume pre-trained model is stored at 'pretrained_model' directory.

# Helper function to build a similar architecture with desired input shape.
def build_model_with_input(original_model, target_input_shape):
  input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=target_input_shape)
  x = original_model.layers[1](input_tensor) #Assuming Layer at index 1 is first Conv2D
  for layer in original_model.layers[2:]:
    x = layer(x)
  return tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=x)

# Load the SavedModel.
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('pretrained_model')
print("Original model input shape:", loaded_model.layers[0].input_shape)

# Define the target input shape.
target_input_shape = (128, 128, 3)

# Build a new model with target input shape.
new_model = build_model_with_input(loaded_model, target_input_shape)

# Transfer weights from original model to new model.
for i, layer in enumerate(new_model.layers):
   if len(layer.weights) > 0:
    try:
        new_weights = loaded_model.layers[i].get_weights()
        layer.set_weights(new_weights)
        print(f"Transferred weights for layer: {layer.name}")
    except Exception as e:
         print(f"Layer {layer.name} could not get weights from original model because {e}")
         pass

print("New model input shape:", new_model.layers[0].input_shape)

# Now the new_model can be used with the modified input shape
```
This snippet first defines a utility function to construct a new model with the desired input shape. After loading the pre-trained model from disk, we create a new model using the defined function. Subsequently, we iterate through the layers of the new model, attempting to transfer weights from the equivalent layers of the loaded model via the `set_weights()` method. This approach ensures the new model retains the knowledge encoded in the weights of the pre-trained model while adapting to the new input dimensions. Handling of weight assignment errors is included to gracefully handle the case where layer mismatch occurs in names or size. It is crucial to remember the index of the new model and old model layers need to be matching. This may need further adjustments depending on the construction of the original model.

However, this approach has limitations. For highly specialized or non-sequential models, a direct transfer of weights by layer index might not be feasible. A more robust approach involves identifying layers by name and selectively transferring weights based on those names. This requires the original model to have explicitly named layers, and the names of the new model must correspond to these original layers. The following example demonstrates this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the pre-trained model.
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('pretrained_model')

# Define the new input shape.
target_input_shape = (128, 128, 3)

# Build the new model with the target input shape, ensuring layer names match
input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=target_input_shape, name='input_1')
x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', name='conv2d_1')(input_tensor)
x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name='max_pooling2d_1')(x)
x = tf.keras.layers.Flatten(name='flatten_1')(x)
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='dense_1')(x)
new_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=x)

# Transfer weights by matching layer names.
for new_layer in new_model.layers:
    for old_layer in loaded_model.layers:
       if new_layer.name == old_layer.name:
           try:
                new_weights = old_layer.get_weights()
                new_layer.set_weights(new_weights)
                print(f"Transferred weights from {old_layer.name} to {new_layer.name}")
           except Exception as e:
               print(f"Layer {new_layer.name} could not transfer weights because {e}")
               pass


print("New model input shape:", new_model.layers[0].input_shape)

# The new model can now be used with the specified input shape
```
In this improved version, I explicitly defined the architecture of the new model, assigning each layer the same name as its equivalent in the pre-trained model. By comparing layer names, I've made the weight transfer process robust to architectural changes, ensuring weights are placed correctly even if layers are re-ordered, or even if not all layers from the old model are needed in the new model. This approach is generally more reliable when models have complex internal structures.

Another, more streamlined, method is to utilize a functional API to construct the new model. The advantages to this approach include the fact that models are easy to specify, and it directly uses the pre-trained model layers. Note however that this might not be possible for all sub-classed models.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the pre-trained model.
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('pretrained_model')

# Define the new input shape.
target_input_shape = (128, 128, 3)

# Build a new model with target input shape.
input_tensor = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=target_input_shape)
x = loaded_model(input_tensor) # Reuse whole pre-trained model to build new model

new_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=x)

print("New model input shape:", new_model.layers[0].input_shape)

# The new model can be directly used with the specified input shape
```
This snippet directly reuses the pre-trained model by instantiating the whole model into the functional API, directly after specifying the Input Tensor. This approach is very straightforward and efficient, but as mentioned before, is not always an option.

For further in-depth understanding, I recommend consulting resources focusing on TensorFlowâ€™s Graph execution, SavedModel serialization, and the Keras API, particularly the Model subclassing and layer customization aspects. The official TensorFlow documentation provides very good insights into the inner workings of these elements. Exploring tutorials focused on transfer learning strategies can offer practical scenarios where these concepts are put into action. Reading relevant research papers related to model adaptation for different input domains can also help to solidify the underlying theories and motivations of such techniques. Finally, examining example code within the TensorFlow GitHub repository that covers these scenarios can offer further hands-on experience.
