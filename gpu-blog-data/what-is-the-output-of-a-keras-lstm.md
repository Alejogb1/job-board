The core output of a Keras LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cell, at its most granular level, is a vector representing the cell's hidden state. This hidden state is crucial; it encapsulates information from past timesteps and is passed forward for subsequent calculations. I’ve spent significant time debugging sequence models, and understanding this output is foundational for successful implementations. This vector isn't a final prediction, but a representation of the learned patterns within the sequence up to that point. The confusion often arises because, depending on the Keras layer configuration, you might observe a different shape or combination of outputs.

To explain further, an LSTM cell, unlike a simple recurrent neural network (RNN), maintains both a hidden state ($h_t$) and a cell state ($c_t$). The hidden state, $h_t$, is what the LSTM cell directly outputs at each timestep. This vector, by default, has a dimensionality equal to the number of units (or neurons) in the LSTM layer, determined during initialization. It's often misunderstood because when using `return_sequences=True`, Keras outputs a sequence of these hidden states rather than just the last one. However, internally, even with `return_sequences=True`, each cell computes its own $h_t$ based on its input and its past cell state.

The cell state, $c_t$, is an internal memory that is passed along through the sequence and adjusted by the forget, input, and output gates within the LSTM cell. Though not directly returned as the *output* of the layer, it plays a critical role in computing each hidden state, $h_t$.

The direct impact of this output is that, at each timestep, the LSTM cell is providing a context vector ($h_t$) that reflects its understanding of the input sequence so far. If the LSTM is used in an encoder-decoder scenario, the final hidden state of the encoder (or the sequence of hidden states if `return_sequences=True`) forms the input for the decoder. If you're working on sentiment analysis, for instance, this hidden state represents the cumulative sentiment derived from the sequence of words. In short, it’s an encoded representation of the sequence.

Let's illustrate this with some code examples using the Keras API.

**Example 1: Single LSTM Layer, No `return_sequences`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define input data: 3 sequences, each of length 5, with 2 features
input_data = np.random.rand(3, 5, 2)  # (batch_size, timesteps, features)

# Create an LSTM layer with 64 units
lstm_layer = keras.layers.LSTM(64)

# Pass data through the layer
output = lstm_layer(input_data)

# Display the shape of the output
print(output.shape) # Output: (3, 64)
```

*Commentary:* Here, we create an LSTM layer with 64 units. Because we haven't specified `return_sequences=True`, the layer returns only the hidden state from the final timestep of each sequence. The shape `(3, 64)` shows that we have 3 output vectors, each of dimension 64, one corresponding to each sequence in the batch. It is not the time dimension which is being omitted; it represents information aggregated across the time dimension. This is the typical output when you need a single vector to represent the entire input sequence, such as when performing sequence classification.

**Example 2: Single LSTM Layer, `return_sequences=True`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define input data (same as Example 1)
input_data = np.random.rand(3, 5, 2)

# Create an LSTM layer with 64 units, return_sequences=True
lstm_layer = keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)

# Pass data through the layer
output = lstm_layer(input_data)

# Display the shape of the output
print(output.shape) # Output: (3, 5, 64)
```

*Commentary:* In this example, the `return_sequences=True` parameter changes the behavior of the layer. Instead of returning only the final hidden state, the LSTM layer outputs *all* hidden states for each timestep in the sequence. This is essential when the output needs to be a sequence of the same length as the input sequence, such as with sequence labeling tasks. The shape `(3, 5, 64)` indicates that for each of the 3 input sequences, we now have 5 hidden state vectors, each of dimensionality 64, corresponding to the 5 timesteps.

**Example 3: Stacked LSTM Layers with and without `return_sequences`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define input data (same as Example 1)
input_data = np.random.rand(3, 5, 2)

# Create two LSTM layers
lstm_layer1 = keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)
lstm_layer2 = keras.layers.LSTM(32)

# Pass the input through the layers
output1 = lstm_layer1(input_data)
output2 = lstm_layer2(output1)

# Display the shapes of the outputs
print(output1.shape) # Output: (3, 5, 64)
print(output2.shape) # Output: (3, 32)
```

*Commentary:* This illustrates stacking multiple LSTM layers, a technique used in more complex sequence models. The first LSTM layer uses `return_sequences=True`, and thus it outputs a sequence of hidden states. These outputs are then passed as input to the second LSTM layer. Notice that the second LSTM layer does not have `return_sequences=True` , resulting in the final output being only the final hidden state, shaped as `(3, 32)`. This shows how `return_sequences` affects inter-layer data flow. It is common to have `return_sequences=True` for all but the last LSTM layer in a stack.

These code snippets highlight that the direct output of a Keras LSTM cell is always a vector representing its hidden state. The shape and behavior of the output depend on the `return_sequences` parameter. Understanding this fundamental output of each cell is critical for building robust models.

For further reading and more profound insight into recurrent neural networks and LSTMs, I would recommend reviewing standard texts on deep learning that cover sequence modeling, especially books which detail the mathematical formulation of the LSTM architecture. Additionally, the official Keras documentation provides thorough descriptions of the parameters and behaviors of all layers, including the LSTM layer. There are also multiple online courses covering recurrent networks which often delve into the inner workings of these layers. These sources will provide a broader foundation on which to base further exploration of the topics.
