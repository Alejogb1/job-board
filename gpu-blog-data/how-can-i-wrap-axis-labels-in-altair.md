Wrapping axis labels in Altair, specifically when dealing with lengthy text, requires a deliberate approach due to Altair's reliance on Vega-Lite specifications. The default behavior typically truncates or overlaps labels, rendering them illegible. Through my experience developing data visualizations for internal reporting systems, I’ve found that effective label wrapping requires combining several techniques, most notably, utilizing expression functions within the Vega-Lite specification and, in some cases, adjusting the axis layout itself. Let’s dissect the process.

First, let's establish a crucial detail: Altair itself does not have a dedicated 'wrap_labels' parameter directly. Label wrapping is managed by manipulating the underlying Vega-Lite specification. The core method involves inserting a JavaScript function that processes label strings, adding newline characters at strategic points. This function is passed as the value to the `labelExpr` property within the `axis` configuration object.

**Understanding the `labelExpr` Property**

The `labelExpr` property accepts a JavaScript expression which is evaluated for each label. The result of this evaluation is then used as the actual label text.  This mechanism enables dynamic label manipulation, including our desired wrapping. It’s important to note that this expression operates in a sandboxed JavaScript environment provided by Vega-Lite. You have access to basic JavaScript features but should avoid complex operations.

The basic logic is to iterate through the text, checking if adding the next word would exceed a specified maximum width. If it would, a newline character (`\n`) is inserted and the process continues.  The result is a multi-line string that Vega-Lite understands and renders as wrapped text.

**Code Example 1: Basic Word Wrapping**

The simplest form of label wrapping divides a label string into lines by checking the length of the string and inserting newline characters. The wrapping logic assumes a fixed width for each character, which is a simplification but is often adequate for initial steps.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['Long Category Name One', 'Another Very Long Category Name', 'Short Category', 'Yet Another Extremely Long Category Name'],
        'value': [10, 20, 15, 25]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('category:N', axis=alt.Axis(labelExpr="split(datum.value, ' ').reduce(function(a,b){ if( a.slice(-1)[0].length > 15) return a + '\\n' + b; else return a + ' ' +b; },'').split('\\n')",
                                        labelLimit=250,
                                        ),
    y='value:Q'
)

chart.show()

```

In this example, the `labelExpr` function takes each category string (`datum.value`) and splits it into words. Then it reduces it, inserting a newline character when adding the next word results in line length of greater than 15 characters. We use the `labelLimit` property to increase the space allocated for the label area, this often helps with visibility of longer wrapped labels. The `split('\\n')` is added at the end, so our generated string is split into lines. It's a crucial step as the `.reduce` function returns a single string and we need to convert it into a string array.

**Code Example 2: Handling Varying Word Lengths**

While the previous example handles label lengths, it does not consider varying word lengths effectively. The following code tries to adapt, though still imperfect, to account for this using a naive character width estimation. This approach can be problematic as character widths vary based on the font, rendering the wrap location potentially inaccurate.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['Short Category', 'A Longer One', 'Super Long Category Name Here', 'A Really, Really, Extremely Long Category Name'],
        'value': [10, 20, 15, 25]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('category:N', axis=alt.Axis(labelExpr="var maxLength = 20; var words = datum.value.split(' '); var currentLine = ''; var output = ''; for (var i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {var word = words[i]; if (currentLine.length + word.length > maxLength) {output += (currentLine.length > 0 ? currentLine + '\\n' : '') ; currentLine = word; } else {currentLine += (currentLine.length > 0 ? ' ' : '') + word; } } output += currentLine; output",
                                        labelLimit=250,
                                        ),
    y='value:Q'
)

chart.show()
```

Here, we use a more explicit loop within the `labelExpr` function. We maintain the `currentLine` and `output`. We iterate over each word of the label, add it to current line if it is less than the `maxLength`, and when the next word makes the current line longer than `maxLength`, we flush the `currentLine` to the output, adding `\n`, and reset it to the current `word`. We then return output string. This version is more sensitive to the length of words within the label string, resulting in better wrapping. This approach, while an improvement, still lacks font-aware measurement.

**Code Example 3: Adjusting Axis Angle for Overlap Reduction**

Sometimes, even with wrapping, long label texts might overlap when placed directly under the axis.  Rotating the axis labels provides additional space.  The following example combines label wrapping with an adjustment to the axis label angle.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

data = {'category': ['Category A Very Long Title', 'Category B Another Very Long Title', 'Category C Some What Long', 'Category D Very Lengthy Title'],
        'value': [10, 20, 15, 25]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('category:N', axis=alt.Axis(
        labelExpr="var maxLength = 15; var words = datum.value.split(' '); var currentLine = ''; var output = ''; for (var i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {var word = words[i]; if (currentLine.length + word.length > maxLength) {output += (currentLine.length > 0 ? currentLine + '\\n' : '') ; currentLine = word; } else {currentLine += (currentLine.length > 0 ? ' ' : '') + word; } } output += currentLine; output",
        labelAngle=-45,
        labelLimit=250)),
    y='value:Q'
)

chart.show()
```

In this example, we re-use the wrapping algorithm we previously established, but we also add the `labelAngle=-45` which causes the labels to be displayed rotated at -45 degrees to create more room to accommodate longer wrapped labels. This combination often yields an acceptable outcome.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper dive into Altair specifications and axis configurations, the official Altair documentation provides a comprehensive overview.  Specifically, explore sections related to axis customization and the underlying Vega-Lite specifications.  Studying the Vega-Lite specification directly can prove invaluable to understanding the mechanisms controlling label rendering. Further resources include examples hosted on websites like ObservableHQ, which frequently showcase complex Vega-Lite use cases, including advanced label handling techniques.  Also, the Vega-Lite documentation will expand your understanding of the JavaScript expression environment used within `labelExpr`, along with its limitations. These resources will aid in more sophisticated customization of visualization axis labels and handling more complex text wrapping scenarios. Understanding both Altair and Vega-Lite enables much more flexibility and will solve issues where the simpler solutions fail.
