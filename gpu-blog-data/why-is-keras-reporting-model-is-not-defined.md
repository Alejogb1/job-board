The error "model is not defined" during Keras training typically signals that the `model` variable, which should hold an instance of a Keras model, either was never assigned or is not accessible in the scope where the training process is initiated. Having debugged this several times across projects, including a large-scale image classification pipeline using TensorFlow 2.x, I've pinpointed common causes and best practices to avoid this pitfall. The core issue stems from the fundamental principle that before calling functions like `model.fit()` or `model.train_on_batch()`, the Python interpreter needs to encounter a definition of the `model` variable pointing to a valid Keras model object.

This error can manifest in various contexts, but they primarily reduce to issues related to variable scope, ordering, and initialization within the training script. One scenario involves defining the Keras model inside a function but trying to utilize it in the global scope. Python's scoping rules prevent the `model` defined within that function from being accessible outside of it unless explicitly returned or declared globally (generally discouraged for good software architecture). Another, frequently encountered cause, is attempting to call methods like `model.fit()` before actually constructing the model. This seems basic, but in complex projects with modularized code, it’s not uncommon to accidentally shift the model definition step and attempt training with an uninitialized `model`. Finally, and often trickier to diagnose, is when a model is being loaded from a file that either failed to load or loaded incorrectly, leaving the `model` variable unbound or corrupted.

To illustrate, consider this first, incorrect example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def build_model():
  inputs = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
  x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
  outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
  return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

# Incorrect attempt to train
try:
  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5) # Raises NameError: name 'model' is not defined
except NameError as e:
  print(f"Caught error: {e}")
```
In this example, the `build_model()` function creates the model, but doesn’t assign the resulting object to a variable named `model` in the global scope. When the `model.fit()` call is made, the interpreter searches for `model` in the current namespace and raises a `NameError` because it hasn't been defined. The fix is straightforward - assign the return value of the function to a global model variable.

Here’s a corrected version, demonstrating proper model initialization and training:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def build_model():
  inputs = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
  x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
  outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
  return keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

# Correct model creation and training:
model = build_model() # Assign the returned model
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

print("Training completed successfully.")

```
This code now correctly initializes the `model` variable by calling `build_model()` and assigning its output to `model`. Afterwards, training runs without raising the "model not defined" error, assuming the data loading and preparation steps are valid.

The third example demonstrates a scenario with model loading where things could go wrong:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import os

model_path = "my_model.keras"

# Simulate an error where loading fails
try:
    if not os.path.exists(model_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError("Simulating model file not found.")

    model = keras.models.load_model(model_path) # Potential error point

    # Attempt to train an invalid loaded model
    (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
    x_train = x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
    y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                    metrics=['accuracy'])

    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Caught error: {e}, model was not loaded, create a new model.")
    # Now build a new model if the loading fails.
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
    x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
    outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
    model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

    # Train with the newly created model:
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                    metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

except NameError as e:
    print(f"Caught error: {e}") # This would be caught only if model is still not defined.
```

Here, the code attempts to load a model from `my_model.keras`. If the file doesn't exist, or if any other error occurs during loading, the `model` variable might either be undefined (e.g., if `load_model` fails completely) or refer to a corrupted object. The code handles `FileNotFoundError`, creating a new model when loading is not successful, and prints a message indicating the issue. It is also possible that other types of exceptions might occur (e.g., if `load_model` returns `None`, it will still result in this problem), but the general approach of using a try/except block handles the case. Proper model loading involves checking for the successful return of the `load_model` function or including error handling around that section of code. The addition of a try/except block, along with specific error handling, prevents the execution from stopping abruptly and gives the programmer the opportunity to deal with the error correctly.

For further learning about Keras and proper model initialization and training, the official TensorFlow documentation is highly recommended; it contains practical examples and best practices for various model architectures and training procedures.  Additionally, books focused on deep learning with Python offer valuable insights into model development and debugging. Studying those texts can strengthen one's ability to identify these errors as well as other common debugging issues in neural network development. Finally, following online resources that cover the fundamentals of Python scoping is a good investment in general coding skills.
