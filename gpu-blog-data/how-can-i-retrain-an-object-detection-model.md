Fine-tuning a pre-trained object detection model within a Docker container using a GPU requires a carefully orchestrated setup, encompassing environment configuration, data management, and model retraining specifics. I've encountered this exact scenario numerous times while developing computer vision pipelines, and the challenges often revolve around GPU accessibility within the container and data consistency. Here's how I typically approach this.

First, the core issue centers on ensuring your Docker container can access the host machine's GPU resources. This isn’t automatic; Docker, by default, runs in isolation and doesn't inherently see the GPU. The solution involves using the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. This toolkit allows you to expose the GPU drivers and CUDA libraries within the container. Consequently, the deep learning frameworks within the container (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) can leverage the GPU for accelerated computations. Without this bridge, the retraining process will be significantly slower, if it works at all, as the computation will default to the CPU.

The first step is to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit on the host machine. The installation procedure varies depending on the operating system, but generally involves adding the NVIDIA package repository and installing the toolkit. Post-installation, verifying its success by running `nvidia-docker version` is crucial. It should return version information, indicating a correctly configured toolkit.

Next, we need to build a Docker image that includes the deep learning framework, the object detection model, and any necessary preprocessing scripts, all in a suitable configuration to leverage the GPU. This commonly involves deriving a custom Dockerfile from an existing base image that includes CUDA support from the deep learning framework. My experience leads me to typically build on base images tailored to the specific frameworks like `tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu` or `pytorch/pytorch:latest-cuda` for the latest stable versions. The `latest-gpu` and `latest-cuda` tags point to versions configured to use NVIDIA GPUs, simplifying the process immensely. Furthermore, the installation of python packages required like object detection libraries or data processing utilities must be considered.

Let’s consider a specific scenario, imagine I'm fine-tuning a Faster R-CNN model, written using TensorFlow. After determining the appropriate base image (`tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu`), I create the following Dockerfile.

```dockerfile
FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu

# Install necessary python packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir tensorflow-addons==0.21.0
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir pycocotools

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .

# Command to run training script. Adjust the file name as needed
CMD ["python", "train.py"]
```

This Dockerfile first inherits the TensorFlow GPU image with all dependencies, then it proceeds to install Python packages for the specific task (here we have `tensorflow-addons` for extensions, and `pycocotools` for data handling). Next, it establishes the `/app` directory as the working directory within the container. The requirements.txt file is then added and parsed before the rest of the project is copied over. Finally, the `CMD` command specifies the command to run when the container is launched - here we have `train.py` as the main training script.

With the Dockerfile configured, we need the training script (`train.py`), as well as the `requirements.txt`. A basic `requirements.txt` file in this case might include:
```text
numpy
opencv-python
Pillow
```
Now let's think about the `train.py` script which, for simplicity, will load a pre-trained model and do some dummy steps. Note, that this is intentionally simplified to demonstrate the concept, and more complex training processes will be required in practice.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from object_detection.utils import config_util #Assume this is a custom library that exists in project
from object_detection.builders import model_builder #Assume this is a custom library that exists in project


def load_model(config_path, checkpoint_path):
    configs = config_util.get_configs_from_pipeline_file(config_path)
    model_config = configs['model']
    detection_model = model_builder.build(model_config=model_config, is_training=True)

    #Dummy example of loading a checkpoint
    #replace with actual path
    checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=detection_model)
    checkpoint.restore(checkpoint_path).expect_partial()
    return detection_model

def train_step(model, images, labels):
    #Dummy example of training - adjust as needed
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(images)
        loss_value = tf.reduce_mean(tf.math.square(predictions - labels)) #Dummy loss
    grads = tape.gradient(loss_value, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss_value


if __name__ == "__main__":
  config_path = 'pipeline.config' #Assume this config file exists in the project
  checkpoint_path = 'checkpoint/ckpt-0' #Assume this checkpoint exists in the project
  model = load_model(config_path, checkpoint_path)

  #Dummy training loop
  for i in range(100):
        images = tf.random.normal((1, 224, 224, 3))
        labels = tf.random.normal((1, 10, 4)) #Dummy bounding box predictions
        loss = train_step(model, images, labels)
        print(f"Iteration {i}: Loss = {loss.numpy()}")

  #Dummy save the fine-tuned model.
  #replace with your actual model saving method
  tf.saved_model.save(model, 'fine_tuned_model')
```

This example loads a model based on the config and checkpoint file. These files are usually generated when pretraining models. It then carries out a simplified dummy training process and prints the loss at each step. Note, that the loading method, training step and saving mechanism may vary greatly depending on the models, and the implementation.

Now, to build the image, I execute the following in the same directory as the Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t object_detector .
```

This command builds the image using the Dockerfile and names it `object_detector`. Note the `.` which refers to the location of the Dockerfile. If your Dockerfile is in a different folder location, please specify that.

Once the image is built, you can then run a container from it, taking advantage of the GPU resources:

```bash
docker run --gpus all object_detector
```
This command executes the container with access to all available GPUs, enabling hardware-accelerated training.  The `--gpus all` flag is crucial, as it directs the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to expose the necessary drivers and libraries within the container.

Another aspect critical for successful retraining is data handling. When using a container, you need to ensure the container has access to the training and validation datasets, which are often on the host machine. Docker allows you to mount host machine directories into the container. I recommend using this approach rather than copying data into the image to avoid data redundancy and image bloat. This can be accomplished with the `-v` flag when starting the container.

```bash
docker run --gpus all -v /path/to/host/data:/app/data object_detector
```

Here, `/path/to/host/data` on your machine is mounted to `/app/data` inside the container. Therefore, any files in your host directory `/path/to/host/data` are accessible within the container at the location `/app/data`.

In summary, fine-tuning object detection models inside a docker container requires installing the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, building a custom Docker image that includes CUDA-enabled deep learning libraries and the necessary project files, and running the container with the `--gpus all` flag and mounting the data directories when training. It is important to ensure all dependencies are met and the training process is able to load data, fine-tune and save the models as required by the specific project.

For additional learning and guidance on these topics, consult the following resources: official NVIDIA documentation regarding the Container Toolkit, framework documentation for TensorFlow and PyTorch, and publications detailing the practical aspects of containerization in machine learning workflows. Furthermore, numerous blog posts and tutorials provide real-world examples that can illustrate implementation details further.
