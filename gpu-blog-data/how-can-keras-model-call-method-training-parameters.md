Keras' `call` method, especially when subclassing the `tf.keras.Model` class, is where the forward pass of a neural network is defined. However, its interaction with training parameters, particularly those that control behaviors like batch normalization or dropout, can be confusing. I've found that the key lies in understanding how Keras leverages the `training` argument within the `call` method, and how this impacts the internal state of certain layers.

When we build a custom model by inheriting from `tf.keras.Model`, we override its `call` method. This method receives input tensors and optionally a `training` boolean argument. The presence of this `training` flag is critical. Internally, Keras and TensorFlow utilize this boolean to control layer-specific behavior that differs between inference and training phases. Specifically, layers like `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization` and `tf.keras.layers.Dropout` exhibit distinct behaviors based on this argument. During training, batch normalization computes running means and variances, and dropout randomly masks units. During inference (when `training=False`), batch normalization uses the calculated running averages and variances, and dropout effectively acts as an identity layer.

The problem many encounter stems from not explicitly passing the `training` argument to layers within their custom `call` method. Without a consistent `training` argument, layers might behave inconsistently, leading to incorrect outputs during either training or inference. If you default to using the global Keras learning phase (obtained via `K.learning_phase()`) or, worse, not providing any argument, layers might not operate in the expected manner. This is particularly problematic for model reuse or saving/loading, as behavior might shift silently between different operational contexts.

Furthermore, the interaction with `fit` and `predict` methods is crucial. When you train your model using `model.fit`, Keras automatically sets `training=True` within the `call` method. Conversely, when you call `model.predict` or `model.evaluate`, Keras sets `training=False`. However, when you invoke the `call` method directly or need to execute your model outside of these contexts (for example, when creating a generative model's decoder), you're responsible for supplying the appropriate `training` boolean.

Here are three specific code examples to illustrate these concepts:

**Example 1: Incorrect handling of `training` flag**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class BadModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, units=32):
    super().__init__()
    self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)
    self.batch_norm = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
    self.dropout = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5)

  def call(self, inputs):
    x = self.dense(inputs)
    x = self.batch_norm(x)  # Missing the training argument
    x = self.dropout(x)   # Missing the training argument
    return x

model = BadModel()
x = tf.random.normal((10, 10))
_ = model(x, training=True)  # Training
output_training = model(x) # Will not correctly behave in training because it is not set
_ = model(x, training=False) # Inference
output_inference = model(x) # Will not behave correctly in inference because it is not set
print("Output training using call method without explicitly setting 'training' argument: ", output_training)
print("Output inference using call method without explicitly setting 'training' argument: ", output_inference)
```

In this example, I've created a `BadModel` that includes a dense layer, batch normalization, and dropout. Critically, the `call` method does *not* pass the `training` argument to `batch_norm` and `dropout`. This results in inconsistent behavior. The output produced when you invoke the call method directly without explicitly setting the training argument. As a result, the batchnorm will be operating with the running averages obtained in the first call regardless. This leads to inaccurate training and unreliable predictions because it doesn't know whether to compute and update internal statistics or use existing averages. You can observe the discrepancy, particularly when the model is used separately for training and inference. The values won't differ as they should.

**Example 2: Correct handling of `training` flag**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class GoodModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, units=32):
    super().__init__()
    self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)
    self.batch_norm = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
    self.dropout = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5)

  def call(self, inputs, training=False): # Added the training parameter to the call method
    x = self.dense(inputs)
    x = self.batch_norm(x, training=training) # Now the training argument is passed to the layer
    x = self.dropout(x, training=training) # Now the training argument is passed to the layer
    return x

model = GoodModel()
x = tf.random.normal((10, 10))
_ = model(x, training=True)  # Training
output_training = model(x, training=True)
_ = model(x, training=False) # Inference
output_inference = model(x, training=False)
print("Output training using call method with explicit 'training' argument: ", output_training)
print("Output inference using call method with explicit 'training' argument: ", output_inference)
```

Here, `GoodModel` correctly passes the `training` flag from the `call` method to the `batch_norm` and `dropout` layers. The explicit passing of the training flag ensure the model operates in the expected mode for each context. This results in appropriate batch normalization and dropout behavior during both training and inference. You will note that the output of the two call methods with and without setting the `training=True` are different, which implies the batchnorm layer is calculating its means and variances as it should. Additionally, note how when calling the model for inference, the result changes compared to the training one. This is as expected.

**Example 3: Using the `training` flag in a more complex scenario**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class ComplexModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units=64, num_layers=3):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers_list = []
        for _ in range(num_layers):
            self.layers_list.append(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units))
            self.layers_list.append(tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization())
            self.layers_list.append(tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2))

    def call(self, inputs, training=False):
        x = inputs
        for layer in self.layers_list:
            if isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization) or isinstance(layer, tf.keras.layers.Dropout):
                x = layer(x, training=training) # Explicitly pass 'training' to these layers
            else:
                x = layer(x)
        return x


model = ComplexModel()
x = tf.random.normal((10, 10))

_ = model(x, training=True)
output_training = model(x, training=True)
_ = model(x, training=False)
output_inference = model(x, training=False)
print("Output training using call method with explicit 'training' argument in a complex model: ", output_training)
print("Output inference using call method with explicit 'training' argument in a complex model: ", output_inference)
```

This example demonstrates a more complex model with multiple dense layers, batch normalizations, and dropout layers. It explicitly checks if a layer is either a batch normalization or a dropout layer and then passes the `training` flag to these layers while calling the others without the flag as they are not impacted by training or inference behavior. This approach ensures that each layer behaves correctly during training and inference. As before, observe that calling the model with and without the training flag results in different outcomes.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For deepening your understanding, consider exploring the official TensorFlow Keras documentation on custom layers and models, specifically focusing on the `tf.keras.Model` class and the `call` method.  The TensorFlow API documentation for `tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization` and `tf.keras.layers.Dropout` will also prove invaluable. Additionally, examining open-source examples of custom Keras models can provide practical insights into best practices. The tutorials on the TensorFlow website are a great place to start when understanding the principles behind neural networks and how they are implemented in practice with TensorFlow.
