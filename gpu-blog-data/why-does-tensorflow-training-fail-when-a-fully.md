TensorFlow training failure upon loss of a fully connected neural network typically stems from a mismatch between the expected input and output shapes of the subsequent layers, or from improper handling of the computational graph's dynamic nature.  In my experience debugging large-scale image recognition models, this manifested most frequently during model checkpoint restoration or when dynamically adjusting the network architecture during training.  The core issue lies in the rigid structure TensorFlow imposes on the data flow through the computational graph; any disruption to this flow, such as the removal of a layer, necessitates careful handling to avoid inconsistencies.


**1.  Explanation of the Failure Mechanism:**

TensorFlow constructs a computational graph representing the network architecture.  Each layer is a node in this graph, connected to its predecessors and successors through defined data flow paths. The shape of the tensor (multi-dimensional array) flowing between these layers is strictly enforced.  When a fully connected layer is removed, the subsequent layer expects an input tensor of a specific shape determined by the output of the removed layer.  If this shape is altered—due to the layer’s absence—the subsequent layer receives an input tensor of an incompatible shape, leading to a `ValueError` or `InvalidArgumentError` during execution. This often manifests as errors related to tensor dimensions during the forward or backward pass of the training process. The error might not immediately surface during model definition, but only become apparent once the execution reaches the affected layer(s) during the training loop.  Furthermore, the training optimizer relies on the integrity of the gradient calculations; a disrupted graph leads to incorrect gradient computations, preventing successful optimization.  Lastly, restoring a checkpoint from a model with a different architecture will also fail if the weights and biases in the checkpoint file don't match the current model's structure.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Improper Layer Removal:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'), # Layer to be removed
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Incorrect removal – direct modification leads to shape mismatch
model.layers.pop(1) # Removing the Dense layer

# Attempting to train will result in error
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10) #Error occurs here
```

In this example, directly removing a layer using `pop()` disrupts the tensor flow. The final Dense layer expects a tensor of shape (batch_size, 128), but after removing the preceding layer, it receives a tensor of shape (batch_size, 784).  This causes a shape mismatch error during the forward pass.


**Example 2: Conditional Layer Inclusion (using tf.cond):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_model(include_dense):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        tf.cond(include_dense, 
                lambda: tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
                lambda: tf.keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: x)) # Identity layer if False
    ])
    return model

# Dynamic model creation based on a condition
model = create_model(True)  #Include Dense layer
model.compile(...)
model.fit(...)

model = create_model(False) # Exclude Dense layer
model.compile(...)
model.fit(...)

```

This example demonstrates conditionally including a layer using `tf.cond`. This allows for more graceful handling of dynamic architecture changes. If `include_dense` is False, a lambda layer acts as an identity transformation, maintaining the tensor shape and allowing training to continue without errors.


**Example 3:  Checkpoint Restoration with Architectural Changes:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Original Model
model_original = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model_original.save_weights('original_weights.h5')


#Modified Model (Layer removed)
model_modified = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Attempting to load weights from a model with different architecture
try:
    model_modified.load_weights('original_weights.h5')
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Weight loading failed: {e}")
```

Here, loading weights from a model (`original_weights.h5`) with a different architecture into `model_modified` will result in an `InvalidArgumentError` because the number of weights and their shapes don't correspond.  This highlights the critical importance of maintaining architectural consistency during checkpoint loading.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding of TensorFlow's computational graph, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation's sections on custom layers, model saving and loading, and debugging techniques.  Further, a thorough grasp of tensor manipulation using NumPy will be incredibly beneficial in understanding and diagnosing shape-related errors. Lastly, familiarizing yourself with the error messages provided by TensorFlow, specifically those related to `ValueError`, `InvalidArgumentError`, and shape mismatches, will significantly improve debugging efficiency.  These resources will provide the fundamental knowledge required to effectively handle complex model architectures and avoid common pitfalls during training.
