Keras does not possess a direct, single-function equivalent to PyTorch's `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()`.  This stems from a fundamental difference in how Keras and PyTorch handle model construction and loss function application.  PyTorch's `nn.Module` paradigm allows for seamless integration of loss functions within the model definition itself, while Keras, with its functional and sequential APIs, typically handles loss function specification separately during model compilation.  My experience working with both frameworks across various image classification and natural language processing projects highlighted this distinction repeatedly.  Understanding this core difference is crucial for successful porting of code or concepts between the two frameworks.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` combines both the softmax function (for probability distribution calculation) and the negative log-likelihood loss (for measuring prediction accuracy).  This integration simplifies the process, reducing the need for explicit softmax application before loss calculation.  In Keras, this functionality is typically achieved by using a combination of layers and functions.  Specifically, one would use a `Softmax` activation layer within the model's output layer followed by the `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` or `CategoricalCrossentropy` loss function during model compilation. The choice depends on the nature of your target labels:  `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` expects integer labels, while `CategoricalCrossentropy` expects one-hot encoded labels.

The absence of a single, unified function like `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` in Keras is not a limitation; it's a consequence of differing design philosophies.  The separation of layers and loss functions in Keras provides greater flexibility in model architecture design and allows for more granular control over the training process. However, this flexibility necessitates a slightly more verbose implementation compared to PyTorch's concise approach.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Multi-class classification with SparseCategoricalCrossentropy**

This example showcases a simple multi-class classification task using Keras' sequential API, where integer labels are provided.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Softmax for probability distribution
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((100,), maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

*Commentary:*  Note the `softmax` activation in the final dense layer. This ensures the output is a probability distribution over the classes. The `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` loss function then directly calculates the loss based on the integer labels in `y_train`.  This approach mirrors the behavior of PyTorch's `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` but with separate components.

**Example 2: Multi-class classification with CategoricalCrossentropy**

This example demonstrates the use of `CategoricalCrossentropy` when one-hot encoded labels are employed.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Sample data with one-hot encoded labels
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(tf.random.uniform((100,), maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32), num_classes=10)

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

```

*Commentary:* The key difference here lies in the target variable `y_train`. It's now one-hot encoded using `tf.keras.utils.to_categorical`.  This necessitates the use of `CategoricalCrossentropy`.  The underlying mechanism, however, remains conceptually similar to PyTorch's integrated solution.  The `softmax` activation ensures a probability distribution, and the loss function calculates the negative log-likelihood.

**Example 3: Binary Classification**

For binary classification problems, Keras provides a simplified approach.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Sigmoid for binary classification
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy', # Directly use binary crossentropy
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Sample data for binary classification
x_train = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((100,), maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32) # 0 or 1

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

*Commentary:* In binary classification scenarios, the `sigmoid` activation function produces a probability between 0 and 1, representing the probability of belonging to the positive class.  The `binary_crossentropy` loss function is directly applicable, simplifying the process further. This mirrors the functionality achievable with `nn.BCELoss()` in PyTorch, though it's important to note that `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` can also handle binary classification in PyTorch by setting `num_classes=1`.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on loss functions and their usage within Keras.  The Keras API reference itself is an invaluable resource for exploring available layers and functions.  Finally, a strong understanding of probability theory and information theory will be helpful in grasping the underlying mathematical principles behind these loss functions.  Studying these resources will solidify your understanding of the differences and similarities between Keras and PyTorch's loss function implementations.
