The most straightforward approach to combining two independently trained BERT models hinges on the concept of ensemble learning, specifically focusing on output-level fusion.  While techniques exist for merging the internal layers, these often require extensive architectural modification and retraining, potentially losing the benefits of the pre-trained weights. My experience working on sentiment analysis for multilingual corpora demonstrated that output-level fusion offers a superior balance of simplicity and effectiveness.

This approach relies on treating each BERT model as an independent feature extractor.  Each model processes the input text independently, generating its own contextualized embeddings and subsequent classification predictions. These individual predictions are then aggregated using a simple ensemble method, such as averaging or weighted averaging.  The advantage of this lies in its minimal alteration to the existing models; we avoid the complexities of weight sharing or layer concatenation.  The drawback is that we sacrifice potential synergy from integrating the internal representations directly. However, for many downstream tasks, this trade-off is acceptable, given the relative ease of implementation and the generally robust performance achieved.

The choice of the fusion method depends on several factors, including the nature of the downstream task and the performance characteristics of the individual models. For instance, if one model consistently outperforms the other on a validation set, a weighted average, assigning higher weights to the better-performing model, might be beneficial. Conversely, a simple average could suffice if both models demonstrate comparable accuracy. Furthermore, more sophisticated ensemble methods, such as voting or stacking, could be considered for enhanced performance, but these increase complexity significantly.

Let's illustrate this with code examples.  In these examples, I'll assume the existence of two pre-trained BERT models, `model_a` and `model_b`, each capable of producing a probability distribution over the output classes.  I will be using Python with common deep learning libraries. The specifics of these libraries are left out for brevity and to avoid platform dependency.

**Example 1: Simple Averaging**

```python
import numpy as np

# Assume model_a and model_b predict probabilities for 'n_classes' classes.
# Example probabilities:
probs_a = np.array([0.1, 0.8, 0.1])
probs_b = np.array([0.2, 0.7, 0.1])

# Simple average of probabilities.
ensemble_probs = (probs_a + probs_b) / 2

# Predicted class is the one with maximum probability.
predicted_class = np.argmax(ensemble_probs)

print(f"Ensemble probabilities: {ensemble_probs}")
print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}")
```

This example showcases the simplest form of ensemble learning.  It directly averages the probability distributions from both models, leading to a more robust and potentially more accurate prediction.  The crucial aspect here is the independence of `model_a` and `model_b`.  Their internal operations remain separate.

**Example 2: Weighted Averaging**

```python
import numpy as np

# Assume model_a and model_b predict probabilities for 'n_classes' classes and have respective weights.
probs_a = np.array([0.1, 0.8, 0.1])
probs_b = np.array([0.2, 0.7, 0.1])
weights = np.array([0.6, 0.4])  # Model A has higher weight due to superior performance.

# Weighted average of probabilities.
ensemble_probs = weights[0] * probs_a + weights[1] * probs_b

# Predicted class is the one with maximum probability.
predicted_class = np.argmax(ensemble_probs)

print(f"Ensemble probabilities: {ensemble_probs}")
print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}")
```

Here, we incorporate weights to reflect the performance differences between the individual models.  The weights can be determined through a separate validation procedure. Assigning higher weights to a more accurate model emphasizes its predictions, potentially leading to an improved ensemble performance.  This approach is particularly useful when dealing with models exhibiting varying levels of accuracy.


**Example 3:  Concatenation and Linear Layer**

```python
import numpy as np
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume model_a and model_b output embeddings of size 'embedding_dim'.
embedding_a = np.random.rand(1, embedding_dim) #Example embedding
embedding_b = np.random.rand(1, embedding_dim) #Example embedding

#Concatenate embeddings.
concatenated_embedding = np.concatenate((embedding_a, embedding_b), axis = 1)

#Create linear layer for classification.
linear_layer = nn.Linear(2 * embedding_dim, n_classes)

#Pass through linear layer and softmax.
output = linear_layer(torch.from_numpy(concatenated_embedding).float())
probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(output, dim=1)

# Predicted class is the one with maximum probability.
predicted_class = torch.argmax(probabilities)


print(f"Ensemble probabilities: {probabilities}")
print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}")
```

This example demonstrates a more involved technique where we concatenate the final embeddings before feeding them into a new linear layer. This approach allows for a more intricate combination of the individual models' features. However, the additional layer requires training (backpropagation) to find optimal weights for the new layer, losing some of the benefits of pre-training.


In conclusion, combining independently trained BERT models effectively necessitates a careful consideration of the trade-off between complexity and performance. While output-level fusion methods offer a relatively straightforward approach, potentially achieving a good performance with minimal computational cost and modifications, other methods involving internal layer concatenation and retraining exist but are often more computationally intensive.  The optimal approach is highly dependent on the specific application and the characteristics of the individual BERT models.
