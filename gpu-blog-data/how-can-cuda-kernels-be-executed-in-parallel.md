The fundamental mechanism enabling parallel execution of CUDA kernels lies in the inherent architecture of the GPU.  Unlike CPUs, which typically feature a small number of powerful cores, GPUs possess thousands of smaller, more energy-efficient cores organized into Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs).  Effective parallel execution hinges on understanding and leveraging this massive parallelism through careful kernel design and data management.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications has consistently highlighted the importance of this understanding.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

CUDA kernels are executed in parallel through a process involving kernel launch configuration and the inherent parallel processing capabilities of the GPU.  A kernel launch initiates a massive number of threads, organized into blocks and grids.  Each thread executes the same kernel code but operates on different data elements, determined by its unique thread ID and block ID.  These thread IDs are crucial for accessing and processing data efficiently in parallel.  The GPU scheduler then assigns these threads to available SMs, distributing the workload across the numerous processing units.  Crucially, threads within a block execute cooperatively, allowing for synchronization and shared memory access, which are vital for optimizing performance. Threads in different blocks, however, execute independently.

The effective parallelism achieved depends significantly on several factors.  First, the granularity of the problem must be suitable for parallelization.  Problems with inherent dependencies between sequential steps are poorly suited for massive parallelization. Second, efficient data access patterns are essential.  Memory access bottlenecks can severely limit the performance gains achieved through parallel execution.  Coalesced memory access, where multiple threads access contiguous memory locations simultaneously, significantly improves bandwidth utilization.  Third, the amount of shared memory usage, and its organization, must be carefully planned.  Shared memory provides fast, on-chip access to data, reducing the latency associated with global memory access.

Another critical aspect is understanding thread divergence.  If threads within a single warp (a group of 32 threads executing concurrently on an SM) take different execution paths due to conditional statements, this results in thread divergence, reducing the efficiency of the parallel execution. Minimizing thread divergence is a key optimization technique. Finally, the CUDA runtime manages the execution of the kernel, including thread scheduling, memory management, and synchronization.  Understanding these aspects of the runtime is crucial for writing efficient and correctly functioning CUDA code.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Vector Addition**

```c++
__global__ void vectorAdd(const float *a, const float *b, float *c, int n) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... Memory allocation and data initialization ...

  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (n + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

  vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

  // ... Memory copy back to host and error checking ...

  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a simple vector addition.  Each thread adds a single pair of elements from input vectors `a` and `b` and stores the result in vector `c`. The `blockIdx` and `threadIdx` variables are used to determine the index of the element processed by each thread. The kernel launch configuration ensures that enough threads are launched to process the entire input vector.  The modulo operation in the grid dimension calculation ensures all elements are processed, irrespective of vector size.  In my experience, this basic structure provides a strong foundation for more complex parallel algorithms.

**Example 2: Matrix Multiplication (using shared memory)**

```c++
__global__ void matrixMultiplyShared(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int width) {
  __shared__ float sharedA[TILE_WIDTH][TILE_WIDTH];
  __shared__ float sharedB[TILE_WIDTH][TILE_WIDTH];

  int bx = blockIdx.x;
  int by = blockIdx.y;
  int tx = threadIdx.x;
  int ty = threadIdx.y;

  int row = by * TILE_WIDTH + ty;
  int col = bx * TILE_WIDTH + tx;

  float sum = 0.0f;
  for (int k = 0; k < width; k += TILE_WIDTH) {
    sharedA[ty][tx] = A[row * width + k + tx];
    sharedB[ty][tx] = B[(k + ty) * width + tx];
    __syncthreads();

    for (int i = 0; i < TILE_WIDTH; ++i) {
      sum += sharedA[ty][i] * sharedB[i][tx];
    }
    __syncthreads();
  }
  C[row * width + col] = sum;
}
```

This example showcases matrix multiplication, utilizing shared memory for improved performance. The matrix is divided into tiles of size `TILE_WIDTH x TILE_WIDTH`. Each tile is loaded into shared memory, allowing for efficient access by threads within a block.  The `__syncthreads()` function ensures that all threads within a block have loaded their data from global memory before performing calculations.  Using shared memory significantly reduces the number of global memory accesses, a common performance bottleneck in CUDA programming, a lesson learned through countless optimization cycles during my prior projects.

**Example 3:  Reduction Operation (Sum of Elements)**

```c++
__global__ void reduceKernel(const float *input, float *output, int n) {
  __shared__ float sharedData[BLOCK_SIZE];

  int i = threadIdx.x;
  int index = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + i;

  if (index < n) {
    sharedData[i] = input[index];
  } else {
    sharedData[i] = 0.0f;
  }

  for (int s = 1; s < BLOCK_SIZE; s *= 2) {
    if (i % (2 * s) == 0 && i + s < BLOCK_SIZE) {
      sharedData[i] += sharedData[i + s];
    }
    __syncthreads();
  }

  if (i == 0) {
    atomicAdd(output, sharedData[0]);
  }
}
```

This example demonstrates a parallel reduction operation, specifically summing all elements of an array.  The reduction is performed in two stages: within each block and then across blocks.  Within a block, a tree-based reduction is implemented using shared memory. The final result from each block is then added atomically to the global result. Atomic operations are essential for ensuring correct results when multiple threads access and modify the same memory location concurrently.  This approach, refined over numerous iterations in my own work, balances parallelization with the need for atomicity.
