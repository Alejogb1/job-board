A common point of confusion arises when new Julia users, particularly those transitioning from Python or MATLAB, expect automatic GPU utilization with CUDA packages. Often, simply loading `CUDA.jl` doesn’t mean that all computations will magically shift to the GPU. The Julia code must explicitly be structured and executed on the CUDA device through specific functions and data structures.

The fundamental reason for this behavior lies in Julia's design philosophy: it does not silently offload computations to the GPU. Instead, it provides a robust and flexible infrastructure to control the execution location, enabling fine-grained control over performance. This contrasts with some higher-level libraries in Python where a backend automatically handles GPU allocation, but often at the expense of performance or control. Julia’s approach requires the programmer to be deliberate about data placement and operations, which ultimately leads to optimized CUDA kernels. It avoids the inherent overhead of continuously transferring data between host CPU memory and the GPU.

To understand why a naive Julia CUDA script might not use the GPU, it is important to differentiate between host (CPU) and device (GPU) memory and execution contexts. When a Julia script initializes, it primarily works within the CPU's environment, which contains its own allocated memory space. Data structures like arrays reside in the CPU's memory by default. To use the GPU, the script must explicitly transfer data from the host to the device's global memory. Similarly, calculations must be performed using functions explicitly designated to execute on the GPU's compute units using CUDA kernels. Simply loading the `CUDA` package does not trigger any implicit data transfers or kernel executions; it only provides the tools necessary to manage and utilize CUDA devices.

Consider a scenario where I attempted to perform a simple element-wise addition on two arrays using the `CUDA` package:

```julia
using CUDA

function add_arrays(a::Array{Float32}, b::Array{Float32})
    c = a .+ b
    return c
end

a = rand(Float32, 1000)
b = rand(Float32, 1000)

result = add_arrays(a, b)
```

This code snippet, at first glance, might appear to utilize the GPU if one assumes that the `CUDA` package’s import would automatically move calculations onto a device. However, the `add_arrays` function utilizes broadcasting (`.`) which, by default, executes on the CPU using Julia’s built-in array operations. The `a` and `b` arrays are also, by default, allocated in the host's RAM. Therefore, regardless of whether you have a CUDA-enabled GPU, the computation in this example runs entirely on the CPU. The result, `c`, remains a CPU-resident array.

To enable the GPU in this context, one needs to move the input arrays to the GPU and perform the calculation using a CUDA-compatible function operating on CUDA arrays. Here's an altered version demonstrating the correct approach:

```julia
using CUDA

function add_arrays_gpu(a::CuArray{Float32}, b::CuArray{Float32})
    c = a .+ b
    return c
end

a = CUDA.rand(Float32, 1000)
b = CUDA.rand(Float32, 1000)

result = add_arrays_gpu(a, b)
```

Here, significant changes are present. First, `CUDA.rand()` is used to directly allocate random numbers on the GPU as `CuArray{Float32}` rather than the default `Array{Float32}`.  The `add_arrays_gpu` function is adjusted to take `CuArray` as input. Now the broadcasted addition is executed on the GPU, because CUDA.jl provides a customized broadcast overload for CuArrays. If any of the arrays are non-CuArray, the computation will fallback to the CPU. The result, `c`, is now a `CuArray{Float32}` and resides on the device.

It’s essential to note that even with this adjustment, the results are computed on the GPU but the resulting `CuArray` remains there. If it needs to be used on the host, a specific data transfer back to the CPU is necessary. If a `CuArray` is not moved back to the CPU, printing it will simply display the CuArray's description and not the data values. To display and further process the result on the host, use:

```julia
using CUDA

function add_arrays_gpu(a::CuArray{Float32}, b::CuArray{Float32})
    c = a .+ b
    return c
end

a = CUDA.rand(Float32, 1000)
b = CUDA.rand(Float32, 1000)

result_gpu = add_arrays_gpu(a, b)
result_cpu = Array(result_gpu)

println(result_cpu)

```

The crucial part here is the addition of `result_cpu = Array(result_gpu)`, which transfers data from the GPU memory to CPU memory. Only now can the values of the computation be displayed to the terminal or used in a program section running on the CPU.

Another illustrative example involves custom kernel implementations. The broadcast operator performs common element-wise operations on the GPU automatically, but for more complex operations, one might wish to write their own CUDA kernel. This is particularly true for operations where broadcasting might introduce an inefficiency. Let us consider a vectorized addition that adds a scalar to all the elements of the vector. Here's a naive implementation to illustrate the point, and I have previously made similar errors:

```julia
using CUDA

function add_scalar_bad!(a::CuArray{Float32}, scalar::Float32)
    for i in 1:length(a)
        a[i] += scalar
    end
    return nothing
end

a = CUDA.rand(Float32, 1000)
add_scalar_bad!(a, 5.0f0)

```

This appears to operate on a `CuArray`, and because the loop is within a function, one might assume it will automatically execute on the GPU. In reality, it will be executed on the CPU, because the loop is a part of the Julia code and not within a CUDA kernel. To write a correct CUDA kernel, it needs to be explicitly launched using the `@cuda` macro and `CUDA.launch`. A function must be declared as a kernel using the `@cuda.kernel` macro.

Here's the corrected approach:

```julia
using CUDA

@cuda.kernel function add_scalar_kernel!(a::CuDeviceArray{Float32}, scalar::Float32)
    index = (blockIdx().x - 1) * blockDim().x + threadIdx().x
    stride = gridDim().x * blockDim().x

    for i = index:stride:length(a)
      @inbounds a[i] += scalar
    end
    return nothing
end

function add_scalar_correct!(a::CuArray{Float32}, scalar::Float32)
    threads = 256
    blocks = cld(length(a), threads)
    @cuda threads=threads blocks=blocks add_scalar_kernel!(a, scalar)
    return nothing
end


a = CUDA.rand(Float32, 1000)
add_scalar_correct!(a, 5.0f0)
```

In this improved version,  `@cuda.kernel` is used to mark a kernel function. The `index` is calculated to uniquely identify each thread. `stride` indicates how many threads will pass before a given thread revisits the array. This setup enables parallel execution of the kernel, maximizing GPU utilization. The  `@cuda` macro launches the kernel. `cld` function is used to calculate the blocks necessary to cover the length of the array. A `CuDeviceArray` input type is used for `add_scalar_kernel!` to properly manage the memory access.

To summarize, using CUDA in Julia requires explicit control over data movement and execution locations. Naive approaches that omit the use of CUDA specific array types and operations on those types will result in computation happening on the CPU even when the `CUDA` package is loaded. This control gives the user more fine-grained options to optimize code for particular hardware. This also forces the user to explicitly declare where computations occur to ensure a proper understanding of what their program does.

For deeper understanding, I recommend exploring the official Julia CUDA documentation, focusing on `CuArray` handling, kernel writing, and memory management strategies. The JuliaGPU organization provides many practical examples, tutorials and presentations which illustrate various use cases with specific performance optimizations. Finally, the CUDA programming guide from Nvidia provides excellent resource for understanding general GPU programming practices which often carries over to CUDA.jl.
