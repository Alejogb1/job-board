TensorFlow’s flexibility allows for dynamic model manipulation, a crucial aspect of iterative model refinement where removing and adding layers can significantly alter performance and computational cost. From my experience training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for medical image analysis, I’ve found that precise layer surgery, rather than wholesale retraining, often yields faster convergence and better generalization. The core capability enabling this is TensorFlow's graph representation of neural networks, making layer manipulation a comparatively straightforward process.

Fundamentally, a TensorFlow model is constructed as a computational graph. Each layer, whether it's a convolutional, dense, or pooling layer, becomes a node in this graph, interconnected by tensors representing data flow. When you train a model, TensorFlow navigates this graph calculating gradients and adjusting weights. Crucially, this graph structure means layers can be detached and new layers inserted with relative ease. This allows for a very precise, surgical approach to model modifications.

The primary reasons for layer removal and addition fall into several categories: reducing overfitting, simplifying the model for deployment on resource-constrained devices, and exploring architectural variations. Overfitting might present when a deep, complex network learns noise in the training data, resulting in high performance on training sets but poor generalization. Removing specific layers can decrease network capacity, mitigating this issue. Conversely, adding layers, particularly bottleneck layers, can allow for greater feature extraction or non-linear transformations depending on the use case. Furthermore, adding regularizing layers like dropout or batch normalization is often required to improve convergence in more complex model structures.

Specifically, removing layers typically involves identifying sections of the model that are contributing negligibly to the overall performance or are causing over-parameterization. In practice, this can often be the result of empirical testing, using metrics such as validation loss and accuracy. I found that, during my research, the most common approach for this was iteratively testing model configurations based on performance indicators, which is more robust than arbitrary layer deletions. Adding layers, in contrast, usually arises from a need to increase model complexity, introduce new non-linearities, or to accommodate different data formats. Adding convolutional blocks or residual connections are common choices to improve the feature extraction capabilities of the model.

Let’s consider a few examples using TensorFlow code.

**Example 1: Removing a Dense Layer**

Let’s assume you have a sequential model defined like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(100,)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.summary()
```
This creates a simple model with an input layer followed by two dense layers and an output layer. Let's say after training, analysis indicates that the second dense layer (64 to 32 nodes) is not providing enough benefit and causes overfitting. To remove this layer, you can rebuild the model using the `pop()` function available in the sequential API.

```python
model_trimmed = tf.keras.Sequential()
for layer in model.layers:
    model_trimmed.add(layer)

model_trimmed.pop()

print("\nModel after removing layer:\n")
model_trimmed.summary()
```

This code creates a new model, copies all the existing layers and removes the last layer, effectively removing the targeted dense layer. Note that copying the layers and rebuilding is required due to the fact that direct layer removal from sequential models in tensorflow is not allowed. It demonstrates that the model graph can be constructed in a flexible manner. The pop function removes the last layer in the sequence, which can be used in many situations. However, it is critical to understand the model structure when using this function.

**Example 2: Adding a Convolutional Layer**

Now, consider a situation where you have an image classification model, and you need to add a convolutional layer to the model. This usually occurs when you realize that your current network lacks the capacity to learn meaningful features. Suppose the original model looks like this:

```python
model_conv = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model_conv.summary()
```
This is a basic model for an image classification problem, which flattens the image before processing with dense layers. After observing poor performance on a validation set, it might be determined that the model should be more capable to process the spatial structure of the image, and this can be achieved by adding a convolutional layer. To achieve that, we can again use the `pop()` function. In this case, the `pop()` is used to remove the flatten layer, so a convolution can be inserted. Then the layer we popped is added again.

```python
model_conv_add = tf.keras.Sequential()
for layer in model_conv.layers:
  model_conv_add.add(layer)

model_conv_add.pop()
model_conv_add.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same'))
model_conv_add.add(layers.Flatten())
model_conv_add.summary()

```

This code removes the flatten layer using `pop()`, adds a new 2D Convolutional layer, and then adds the flatten layer again. This demonstrates the capacity of tensorflow to modify the model structure dynamically.

**Example 3: Inserting a Regularization Layer**

Let's assume you have a model which is overfitting due to lack of regularization. Suppose that you have a base model like the following one:

```python
model_overfit = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(100,)),
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model_overfit.summary()
```

To add the dropout regularization layers, you need to insert it at different positions of the model, between some of the dense layers, to test which configuration helps. Here is the code to add dropout regularization.

```python
model_reg = tf.keras.Sequential()
for i, layer in enumerate(model_overfit.layers):
    model_reg.add(layer)
    if i == 1 or i == 2: #add the dropout layer after dense layer 1 and 2
      model_reg.add(layers.Dropout(0.25))

model_reg.summary()
```

This code shows how one can add the dropout regularization layers dynamically between other layers. The loop goes through the existing layers, adding them to the new model. When the index corresponds to the layer where a dropout layer is desired, the layer is added, together with the next original layer from the initial model. This shows the flexibility of using loops in conjunction with conditional statements to build a model.

These examples are not exhaustive but illustrate how to perform layer removal and addition in TensorFlow. Keep in mind that rebuilding the model using loops, copying the model, and adding layers programatically can also be combined with conditional statements, and variable parameter passing to create very flexible architectures for complex problems.

To further your understanding of these techniques, I strongly recommend exploring several resources focusing on neural network architecture design. In particular, several books and online publications detail the impact of various layer types and their arrangement on network performance. Research papers on network pruning and compression provide additional insights into the theoretical aspects of layer removal and efficient model design. Lastly, practical exercises using TensorFlow and model analysis tools can solidify your understanding.
