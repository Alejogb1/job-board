TensorFlow 2.7.0, in its restructuring from graph-based execution to eager execution, significantly altered its internal file system handling, leading to the removal of the top-level `tf.gfile` module. This change isn't a bug or an oversight, but a deliberate architectural shift aimed at simplifying the API and aligning it with standard Python file operations. Prior to version 2.0, TensorFlow relied heavily on the `tf.gfile` module for file I/O, particularly when dealing with different file systems such as local, HDFS, and Google Cloud Storage within TensorFlow graph computations. This abstracted approach was necessary for optimized prefetching and data transfer within the graph execution model. However, with the transition to eager execution, where operations are executed immediately and not within a static graph, the necessity for a custom file handling abstraction diminished. Consequently, the `tf.gfile` module was deprecated, and subsequently, removed. The file system interaction is now primarily expected to be handled by standard Python library functions and if required by specialized TensorFlow classes designed for data input (like `tf.data.Dataset`).

The shift away from `tf.gfile` means code reliant on it in older TensorFlow versions will generate `AttributeError` exceptions in 2.7.0 and later. Instead of directly using `tf.gfile.Exists()`, for example, one must now utilise Python's `os.path.exists()`. This change also extends to reading and writing files. Former functions like `tf.gfile.Open()` and `tf.gfile.MakeDirs()` are replaced by their standard Python counterparts, `open()` and `os.makedirs()`, respectively. This change simplifies development workflows, particularly for projects not solely reliant on large scale distributed computing. Data pipelines and resource handling are either left to lower level python libraries, or moved to specialized dataset classes. This design encourages a clearer separation between the high level machine learning tasks and the underlying data management, improving code clarity and maintainability.

The absence of `tf.gfile` simplifies the API, aligning TensorFlow's I/O handling with common Python practices. While this enhances consistency and intuitiveness for many use cases, it means existing workflows developed in older versions require adjustments. We can now accomplish tasks that previously required `tf.gfile` by leveraging Python's standard library. The following code examples demonstrate how to adapt old code to the updated TensorFlow approach.

**Code Example 1: Checking if a file exists**

```python
# Old TensorFlow (pre 2.0) using tf.gfile
# This code will fail in TensorFlow 2.7.0
# import tensorflow as tf
# file_path = "my_file.txt"
# if tf.gfile.Exists(file_path):
#     print(f"File '{file_path}' exists.")
# else:
#     print(f"File '{file_path}' does not exist.")

# New TensorFlow (2.7.0 and later) using os.path
import os
file_path = "my_file.txt"
if os.path.exists(file_path):
    print(f"File '{file_path}' exists.")
else:
    print(f"File '{file_path}' does not exist.")
```

*Commentary:* This example shows the shift from using `tf.gfile.Exists()` to `os.path.exists()`. This highlights the removal of the direct file system interface from TensorFlow's main API. The old commented-out code block demonstrates how the function was used before TF 2.0, which would now raise an `AttributeError` in versions 2.7.0 and later. The new approach uses the standard Python library module, providing a common pathing interface across code bases, leading to increased portability.

**Code Example 2: Reading a text file**

```python
# Old TensorFlow (pre 2.0) using tf.gfile
# This code will fail in TensorFlow 2.7.0
# import tensorflow as tf
# file_path = "my_file.txt"
# try:
#     with tf.gfile.Open(file_path, 'r') as f:
#        content = f.read()
#        print(f"File content: {content}")
# except tf.errors.NotFoundError:
#     print(f"Error: File '{file_path}' not found")


# New TensorFlow (2.7.0 and later) using Python's built in 'open'
file_path = "my_file.txt"
try:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
        print(f"File content: {content}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: File '{file_path}' not found")
```
*Commentary:* This example illustrates how to read the content of a file. The old code using `tf.gfile.Open()` and `tf.errors.NotFoundError` is now replaced by the built-in Python `open()` function and `FileNotFoundError` exception. This example serves to show another key function that moved out of tensorflow and became a native function in base python. Again, this promotes consistency and reduces the overhead from external libraries handling simple and universal operations.

**Code Example 3: Creating a directory**

```python
# Old TensorFlow (pre 2.0) using tf.gfile
# This code will fail in TensorFlow 2.7.0
# import tensorflow as tf
# directory_path = "my_directory"
# if not tf.gfile.Exists(directory_path):
#     tf.gfile.MakeDirs(directory_path)
#     print(f"Directory '{directory_path}' created.")
# else:
#     print(f"Directory '{directory_path}' already exists.")

# New TensorFlow (2.7.0 and later) using os.makedirs
import os
directory_path = "my_directory"
if not os.path.exists(directory_path):
    os.makedirs(directory_path)
    print(f"Directory '{directory_path}' created.")
else:
    print(f"Directory '{directory_path}' already exists.")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates how to create a directory. Similarly to the previous examples, we replace `tf.gfile.MakeDirs` with its python equivalent, `os.makedirs`. The example also demonstrates the replacement of `tf.gfile.Exists()` with `os.path.exists()`, and also incorporates error handling, showing a complete change of functionality. This consistency illustrates the core concept of migrating all basic file handling capabilities out of the TensorFlow API. This simplification not only makes code more maintainable but also removes the need to load all of the tensorflow overhead for simple filesystem interactions.

In conclusion, the absence of the `tf.gfile` module in TensorFlow 2.7.0 is not a deficiency, but rather the result of a deliberate design choice reflecting the change from static graph to eager execution. The change forces the use of standard Python libraries, which are generally better optimized and more consistent with a wider range of code environments. The transition requires adaptation of existing code, but benefits code clarity, portability, and reduces the TensorFlow API complexity. For those requiring more robust data loading pipelines, exploring TensorFlow's `tf.data` API is a good starting point. Further, for interactions with specific cloud storage providers, libraries from those specific providers (e.g., google cloud storage library) are recommended. For all non-tensorflow specific operations, the standard Python library should be favored to improve generality, portability, and overall best coding practices. Additional knowledge regarding file systems and library specific I/O functions can be further explored through Python's standard library documentation and through the documentation of specific data loading or cloud storage libraries.
