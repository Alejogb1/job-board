The most frequent reason for Keras' `load_weights()` failures stems from inconsistencies between the model's architecture at the time of weight loading and the architecture when the weights were saved.  This discrepancy, often subtle, manifests in various forms, ranging from minor differences in layer names to significant structural variations.  In my experience troubleshooting this across numerous deep learning projects, spanning image classification to time series forecasting, neglecting meticulous version control and rigorous architecture logging proves a significant pitfall.


**1.  Clear Explanation of Potential Causes:**

`load_weights()` relies on a precise mapping between the weights stored in the checkpoint file and the layers within the loaded model.  Any deviation from the original model's structure during checkpoint creation invalidates this mapping, causing the loading process to fail.  The failure may not always be explicitly flagged as a mismatch; rather, it can manifest as unexpected model behavior or silent errors further down the pipeline.  Let's delve into the common causes:

* **Mismatched Layer Names:**  Even a minor change in a layer's name – for instance, appending an index or a slight typo – can prevent `load_weights()` from correctly assigning weights.  Keras utilizes layer names as keys during weight allocation; a mismatch equates to a key not found in the weight dictionary.

* **Discrepancies in Layer Types or Configurations:**  Modifying a layer's type (e.g., changing a `Dense` layer's activation function or adding dropout) or altering its hyperparameters (e.g., changing the number of units in a `Dense` layer) will create an incompatibility. The saved weights are tailored to the specific layer configuration at the time of saving; altering this renders the weights unusable.

* **Added or Removed Layers:** Adding or removing layers before loading weights introduces an obvious architectural mismatch. The weight file contains weights for a specific number and arrangement of layers; loading it into a model with a different architecture is bound to fail.

* **Inconsistent Custom Layers:**  If your model incorporates custom layers, inconsistencies in their definitions between the saving and loading stages can be problematic.  Ensure that the custom layer class definition remains identical.  A change in the layer's internal workings, even if seemingly insignificant, might alter the weight structure.


* **Incorrect File Path:** A simple yet overlooked reason is specifying an incorrect path to the checkpoint file. Verify that the path is accurate and the file exists.


* **Checkpoint File Corruption:**  Though less common, the checkpoint file itself could be corrupted.  Attempting to load from a backup or regenerating the checkpoint might be necessary in such cases.  Employ robust data management practices to minimize this risk.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Mismatched Layer Names**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Model definition during training
model_train = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', name='dense_layer_1'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='dense_layer_2')
])
model_train.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_train.save_weights('model_weights.h5')

# Model definition during loading (incorrect layer name)
model_load = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', name='dense_layer_one'),  # Name mismatch
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='dense_layer_2')
])

try:
    model_load.load_weights('model_weights.h5')
    print("Weights loaded successfully.") #This will likely not be reached.
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading weights: {e}") # This will show the error explicitly
```

This demonstrates the error caused by a simple renaming of `dense_layer_1`. The `load_weights()` function will not find a match for `dense_layer_one` based on the structure in 'model_weights.h5'.


**Example 2: Discrepancies in Layer Configurations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Model definition during training
model_train = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model_train.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_train.save_weights('model_weights.h5')

# Model definition during loading (altered number of units)
model_load = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),  # Changed number of units
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

try:
    model_load.load_weights('model_weights.h5')
    print("Weights loaded successfully.") #This will likely not be reached.
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading weights: {e}") # This will show the error explicitly
```

Here, altering the number of units in the first `Dense` layer creates an incompatibility. The weight matrix saved for the 64-unit layer cannot be applied to a 128-unit layer.

**Example 3: Handling Custom Layers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Custom layer definition
class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(1, units), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

# Model definition during training
model_train = keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(64),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model_train.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_train.save_weights('model_weights.h5')

# Model definition during loading (ensure identical custom layer definition)
model_load = keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(64),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

try:
    model_load.load_weights('model_weights.h5')
    print("Weights loaded successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading weights: {e}")
```

This example highlights the importance of maintaining consistency in custom layer definitions.  Any change to the `MyCustomLayer` class between saving and loading will result in a weight loading failure.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections detailing Keras model saving and loading.  Consult advanced Keras tutorials and blog posts focusing on model persistence and best practices.  Explore dedicated deep learning books emphasizing model management and deployment.  Reviewing relevant Stack Overflow threads addressing specific error messages encountered during weight loading is invaluable.  Finally, mastering version control systems, such as Git, is crucial for tracking model architectures and ensuring reproducibility.
