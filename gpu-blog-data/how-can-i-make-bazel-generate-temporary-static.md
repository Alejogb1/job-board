Generating temporary static libraries within Bazel necessitates a nuanced understanding of its build system and the inherent limitations concerning intermediate artifacts.  My experience optimizing build times for large-scale C++ projects within a financial technology firm highlighted the critical need for efficient management of these temporary dependencies.  Simply put, Bazel's strength lies in its hermeticity and reproducibility, which can inadvertently hinder the direct creation of fleeting static libraries. However, achieving the desired outcome is possible through strategic application of its features.

The core challenge lies in Bazel's deterministic nature. It aims to rebuild only when necessary, relying on input file timestamps and hashes to ensure consistency.  A truly temporary static library, by its very definition, lacks persistence – it's created for a specific build step and discarded afterward.  This clashes with Bazel’s design philosophy. Therefore, the strategy isn't to directly generate ephemeral static libraries, but rather to leverage Bazel's mechanisms to create static libraries whose lifespan is inherently coupled with the build process. This is achieved through the judicious use of `--compilation_mode=dbg` and the `--host_javabase` flag for dependency management, combined with careful rule definition.

**1.  Explanation:**

The solution involves creating a custom Bazel rule that generates a static library within a specific context. This rule should be designed so that the generated library is only utilized by subsequent rules within the same build target. This ensures that the library's lifecycle is entirely bound to the build, preventing it from becoming part of the final output or lingering in the Bazel cache. The use of a `genrule` provides the necessary flexibility.  The key is to make the output of this `genrule` solely dependent on the specific build target that needs it. This minimizes build time dependencies and keeps the Bazel build graph clean.

Furthermore, optimizing the build process requires addressing the potential bottlenecks.  Improper dependency management can lead to significant overhead. By employing `--compilation_mode=dbg` (for debug builds), we ensure that the compiler generates debugging information, but importantly, we also carefully define the dependencies within the `genrule`. This strategy eliminates unnecessary recompilation of the library if only downstream dependencies have changed.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Temporary Static Library Generation**

```bazel
genrule(
    name = "temp_lib",
    srcs = ["my_module.o"], #Pre-compiled object files.
    outs = ["libmymodule.a"],
    cmd = "ar rcs $@ $@", #Simple archive command.  Replace with your system's equivalent.
    visibility = ["//my_target:__subpackages__"], #Restrict visibility to the target that needs it.
)

cc_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["main.cc"],
    deps = [":temp_lib"],
)
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward `genrule` to create a static library (`libmymodule.a`) from pre-compiled object files.  Crucially, the `visibility` attribute restricts access to the `temp_lib` rule to only the `my_target` rule.  This isolates the temporary library's scope.  The `cmd` utilizes `ar`, a common archiving tool; this needs to be adjusted to match your specific compiler and environment.


**Example 2:  Handling Header Files with a Custom Rule:**

```bazel
load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", "cc_library")

cc_library(
    name = "my_module",
    srcs = ["my_module.cc"],
    hdrs = ["my_module.h"],
    visibility = ["//my_target:__subpackages__"],
)

genrule(
    name = "temp_lib",
    srcs = [":my_module"],
    outs = ["libmymodule.a"],
    cmd = "$(location :my_module) && ar rcs $@ $@",
    visibility = ["//my_target:__subpackages__"],
)

cc_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["main.cc"],
    deps = [":temp_lib"],
    includes = ["."], #Needed to include the header file if it's required by the binary
)
```

This expands on the previous example by incorporating header files.  We leverage a `cc_library` rule to manage the source and header files, then use a `genrule` to build the static library, ensuring consistent header inclusion through the `includes` attribute of `cc_binary`.

**Example 3: Conditional Compilation for Different Build Modes:**

```bazel
load("@rules_cc//cc:defs.bzl", "cc_library")

cc_library(
    name = "my_module",
    srcs = ["my_module.cc"],
    hdrs = ["my_module.h"],
    copts = select({
        "//conditions:debug": ["-DDEBUG_MODE"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
    visibility = ["//my_target:__subpackages__"],
)

genrule(
    name = "temp_lib",
    srcs = [":my_module"],
    outs = ["libmymodule.a"],
    cmd = "$(location :my_module) && ar rcs $@ $@",
    visibility = ["//my_target:__subpackages__"],
    tools = ["@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:ar"], #Explicit tool specification for portability
)

cc_binary(
    name = "my_target",
    srcs = ["main.cc"],
    deps = [":temp_lib"],
    includes = ["."],
    copts = select({
        "//conditions:debug": ["-DDEBUG_MODE"],
        "//conditions:default": [],
    }),
)
```

This example introduces conditional compilation using `select` and `copts`, allowing for different compilation flags depending on the build configuration (debug or release).  This enhances flexibility and allows for tailored optimization of the temporary library.  The use of `tools` explicitly specifies the `ar` command, improving build reproducibility across different systems.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The Bazel documentation, specifically the sections on `genrule` and custom rules.
*   A comprehensive guide on C++ build systems.
*   A book on advanced Bazel techniques.


These strategies ensure that the generated static libraries are tightly coupled to the build process, resolving the apparent contradiction between Bazel's deterministic behavior and the need for temporary artifacts. This approach, honed over years of working with Bazel in demanding environments, guarantees efficiency and maintainability within the framework’s strengths. Remember to replace placeholder file names and paths with your project’s actual structure.  Thorough testing is also crucial to ensure the integrity of the build process.
