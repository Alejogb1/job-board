The crucial detail regarding reloading best weights in TensorFlow/Keras checkpoints lies not solely in the checkpoint's structure, but in the methodology employed to identify and load the "best" weights.  Simply loading the latest checkpoint often proves insufficient, as performance metrics are not intrinsically encoded within the checkpoint file itself.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects highlighted this repeatedly. I found that robust solutions require explicit tracking of validation performance during training and subsequently using this metadata to guide the weight-loading process.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow/Keras checkpoints typically save model weights, optimizer states, and potentially other training-related parameters at various intervals during the training process.  These are saved as a collection of files in a designated directory. While convenient for resuming training, selecting the "best" weights requires a supplementary mechanism to monitor performance and record the corresponding checkpoint. This is commonly achieved through callbacks during the training process.

A typical training loop involves evaluating the model on a validation dataset after each epoch (or at specific intervals).  A callback function monitors this validation performance (e.g., accuracy, loss) and saves the model weights only when a new best performance is achieved. This ensures that the checkpoint associated with the highest validation accuracy (or lowest validation loss, depending on the chosen metric) is explicitly identified and easily retrievable.

Without such a performance monitoring and checkpoint selection strategy, one might inadvertently load weights from a checkpoint that reflects a less optimal model state.  The seemingly straightforward act of loading the latest checkpoint could, therefore, be misleading.

The following process summarizes the steps involved:

1. **Define a performance metric:**  Determine the metric (e.g., validation accuracy, validation loss) that defines "best" weights.
2. **Implement a callback:**  Use a Keras callback (e.g., `ModelCheckpoint`) to monitor the defined metric and save the model weights only when the metric improves.  This callback typically requires a filename pattern incorporating the metric value for easy identification.
3. **Load the weights:** After training, locate the checkpoint file corresponding to the best performance (usually identifiable by the filename pattern) and load these weights into a new model instance.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `ModelCheckpoint` with validation accuracy:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... model definition ...

checkpoint_filepath = 'best_weights.{epoch:02d}-{val_accuracy:.4f}.hdf5'
model_checkpoint_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath=checkpoint_filepath,
    save_weights_only=True,
    monitor='val_accuracy',
    mode='max',
    save_best_only=True)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val),
          callbacks=[model_checkpoint_callback])

# Load best weights after training
latest_checkpoint = tf.train.latest_checkpoint('.') #Assumes checkpoints are in current directory. Adjust accordingly
model.load_weights(latest_checkpoint)
```

This example uses `ModelCheckpoint` to save only the weights when validation accuracy improves (`mode='max'`). The filename includes epoch and validation accuracy.  `save_best_only=True` ensures that only the best checkpoint is stored.  After training, `tf.train.latest_checkpoint()` finds the latest (and hence best) checkpoint.  Note the critical assumption that checkpoints are saved in the current working directory. Adjust accordingly for different directory structures.


**Example 2: Handling custom metrics:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... model definition ...

def custom_metric(y_true, y_pred):
    # ... your custom metric calculation ...
    return metric_value

checkpoint_filepath = 'best_weights.{epoch:02d}-{custom_metric:.4f}.hdf5'
model_checkpoint_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath=checkpoint_filepath,
    save_weights_only=True,
    monitor='custom_metric',
    mode='min', # Assumed custom metric is to be minimized
    save_best_only=True)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy', custom_metric])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val),
          callbacks=[model_checkpoint_callback])

# ... Load weights as in Example 1 ...
```

This expands on the first example to show how to track and save weights based on a custom metric.  The `mode` parameter is adjusted to `'min'` if the goal is to minimize the custom metric (e.g., validation loss).  Remember to define your custom metric function appropriately.


**Example 3:  Handling potential exceptions:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import os

# ... model definition ...

checkpoint_filepath = 'best_weights.{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.4f}.hdf5'
model_checkpoint_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath=checkpoint_filepath,
    save_weights_only=True,
    monitor='val_loss',
    mode='min',
    save_best_only=True)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

try:
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val),
              callbacks=[model_checkpoint_callback])
    latest_checkpoint = tf.train.latest_checkpoint('.')
    if latest_checkpoint:
        model.load_weights(latest_checkpoint)
    else:
        print("No checkpoints found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred during training or weight loading: {e}")

```

This example adds error handling.  It explicitly checks if a checkpoint exists after training and handles the case where no checkpoints are found.  A `try-except` block catches potential exceptions during training or weight loading, improving robustness.
