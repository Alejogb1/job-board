Python class methods, decorated with `@classmethod`, receive the class itself as the first argument (conventionally named `cls`), not an instance of the class.  This distinction allows for actions operating directly on the class, such as creating alternative constructors or accessing class-level attributes.  The inability to directly call these methods without explicitly naming them stems from their inherent design; they are not instance-bound.  However, indirect invocation is achievable through several techniques, which I will detail below.


**1.  Dynamic Method Lookup using `getattr()`:**

The `getattr()` function provides a powerful mechanism for accessing attributes, including methods, dynamically.  By providing the class and the method name as strings, we can achieve indirect invocation. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the method to be called is determined at runtime.  Over the course of my work developing a large-scale object-relational mapper (ORM), I frequently utilized this technique to handle database interactions based on user-defined configurations stored as strings.

```python
class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    def my_method(cls, arg1, arg2):
        print(f"Class method called with arguments: {arg1}, {arg2}")

    @classmethod
    def another_method(cls, arg):
        print(f"Another class method called with argument: {arg}")

method_name = "my_method"  # Could be obtained from user input or configuration
arguments = (10, 20)

method = getattr(MyClass, method_name)
result = method(*arguments) # The * unpacks the tuple into individual arguments.
# Output: Class method called with arguments: 10, 20

method_name = "another_method"
arguments = ("Hello, world!")

method = getattr(MyClass, method_name)
result = method(*arguments)
# Output: Another class method called with argument: Hello, world!

#Error handling:
try:
    method = getattr(MyClass, "nonexistent_method")
    method()
except AttributeError:
    print("Method not found.")

```

This example showcases how `getattr()` fetches the method dynamically based on the `method_name` variable.  The crucial point is the subsequent call using `method(*arguments)`, effectively invoking the class method indirectly. Robust error handling using a `try-except` block is recommended to manage scenarios where the specified method doesn't exist.


**2.  Function Pointers within a Dictionary:**

Another approach leverages dictionaries to map string keys to class methods.  This provides a structured way to manage a collection of class methods, accessible via their string representation.  During the development of a flexible event-handling system, this method proved invaluable in dynamically routing events to the appropriate handler methods.

```python
class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    def method_a(cls, x):
        print(f"Method A: {x}")

    @classmethod
    def method_b(cls, x, y):
        print(f"Method B: {x}, {y}")

method_map = {
    "a": MyClass.method_a,
    "b": MyClass.method_b
}

method_key = "a"
args = (10,)
method_map[method_key](*args) # Output: Method A: 10

method_key = "b"
args = (20, 30)
method_map[method_key](*args) # Output: Method B: 20, 30

#Handling missing keys:
try:
    method_map["c"]()
except KeyError:
    print("Method key not found in method_map")

```

This illustrates how a dictionary acts as a lookup table, facilitating indirect method calls using string keys.  The flexibility of this approach allows for easy modification and extension of available methods without altering the core class structure. Proper error handling for missing keys is essential to prevent runtime crashes.


**3.  Employing a Factory Pattern with a Class Method:**

The factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.  We can leverage a class method within a factory to indirectly invoke other class methods based on input parameters. This approach is especially beneficial when dealing with multiple object creation scenarios. I integrated this extensively into a project creating a simulation environment where different object types were constructed based on configuration files.

```python
class ObjectFactory:
    @classmethod
    def create_object(cls, object_type, *args, **kwargs):
        if object_type == "type_a":
            return cls._create_type_a(*args, **kwargs)
        elif object_type == "type_b":
            return cls._create_type_b(*args, **kwargs)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid object type")

    @classmethod
    def _create_type_a(cls, arg1):
        print(f"Creating Type A with arg: {arg1}")
        # ... object creation logic ...
        return "Type A Object"

    @classmethod
    def _create_type_b(cls, arg1, arg2):
        print(f"Creating Type B with args: {arg1}, {arg2}")
        # ... object creation logic ...
        return "Type B Object"

object_a = ObjectFactory.create_object("type_a", 10)
# Output: Creating Type A with arg: 10
object_b = ObjectFactory.create_object("type_b", 20, 30)
# Output: Creating Type B with args: 20, 30

try:
    object_c = ObjectFactory.create_object("type_c")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

```

In this instance, `create_object` acts as a factory method.  It doesnâ€™t directly call the type-specific creation methods; it dynamically chooses one based on the `object_type` parameter. This demonstrates the power of using a factory method to indirectly trigger other class methods. Comprehensive error handling is crucial for invalid object type inputs.
