Deep neural networks, specifically LSTMs, often require greater depth to effectively model complex sequential dependencies. Increasing the number of LSTM layers in PyTorch can indeed lead to errors if not managed carefully. The primary concern when adding layers is managing the shape and flow of tensor data, specifically input dimensionality across stacked layers and ensuring backward passes compute gradients correctly. I have personally encountered and resolved several issues related to multi-layer LSTM implementation during a time series forecasting project where shallow networks were insufficiently capturing nuanced patterns in the data, which forms the basis of this response.

The core issue arises from how LSTMs pass hidden states from one layer to the next. The output of an LSTM layer is comprised of two elements: the output sequence (often denoted as `out`) and the hidden state tuple consisting of the last hidden state (`h_n`) and the last cell state (`c_n`). When stacking LSTMs, the output sequence from one layer becomes the input sequence to the next. However, the hidden state tuple's dimensions must match the input dimensions expected by the subsequent layer. PyTorch’s LSTM, by default, returns these tuples in a way which must be handled correctly when stacking layers. The crux of the matter lies in understanding the expected input shapes at each level and how `h_n` and `c_n` should be initialized and managed if necessary.

The PyTorch `nn.LSTM` class expects a tensor of shape `(seq_len, batch_size, input_size)` as input. When stacking, each LSTM layer’s `input_size` parameter must match the `hidden_size` of the preceding layer. If these are misaligned, you will encounter shape mismatches. Furthermore, for each LSTM layer, initial hidden and cell state inputs are expected to be of the shape `(num_layers * num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)`, which are initialized to zero by default if not explicitly provided to each layer. When using a stacked approach, it's crucial that the initial states are constructed accordingly with `num_layers` for all the stacked LSTMs, or that the hidden and cell state from the previous layer in a sequence is passed correctly.

Let’s examine a scenario involving two stacked LSTM layers.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TwoLayerLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, output_size):
        super(TwoLayerLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers

        self.lstm1 = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.lstm2 = nn.LSTM(hidden_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)


    def forward(self, x):
        # x: (batch_size, seq_len, input_size)

        out1, _ = self.lstm1(x)
        # out1: (batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)

        out2, _ = self.lstm2(out1)
        # out2: (batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)

        out_last_timestep = out2[:, -1, :]  # Extract last timestep
        #out_last_timestep: (batch_size, hidden_size)
        output = self.fc(out_last_timestep)
        #output: (batch_size, output_size)

        return output

# Example usage
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
num_layers = 2  # Although this class only implements two layers explicitly, we will demonstrate how it connects to a more general scenario further on
output_size = 5
batch_size = 32
seq_len = 50

model = TwoLayerLSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, output_size)
dummy_input = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, input_size)
output = model(dummy_input)
print(output.shape) # Should output: torch.Size([32, 5])
```

This code demonstrates a basic two-layer stacked LSTM. The key here is that the `hidden_size` of `lstm1` becomes the `input_size` of `lstm2`. Note that I've set `batch_first=True`, which means the input tensors are shaped as `(batch_size, seq_len, features)` instead of `(seq_len, batch_size, features)` making it slightly more readable. The forward pass is straightforward, passing the output of the first layer as the input of the second. In this example, the hidden state outputs are ignored, and the final layer takes only the output of the last time step, as it is a classification problem at the sequence level.

Now consider a more general implementation that handles a configurable number of LSTM layers:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ConfigurableStackedLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, output_size):
        super(ConfigurableStackedLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers

        self.lstms = nn.ModuleList()  # use ModuleList
        for i in range(num_layers):
            layer_input_size = input_size if i == 0 else hidden_size
            self.lstms.append(nn.LSTM(layer_input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True))

        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)


    def forward(self, x):
      # x: (batch_size, seq_len, input_size)
      out = x
      for lstm in self.lstms:
        out, _ = lstm(out)
      # out: (batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)
      out_last_timestep = out[:, -1, :] # Extract last timestep
        # out_last_timestep: (batch_size, hidden_size)
      output = self.fc(out_last_timestep)
      #output: (batch_size, output_size)

      return output

# Example usage
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
num_layers = 4  # Increase to a higher number
output_size = 5
batch_size = 32
seq_len = 50

model = ConfigurableStackedLSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, output_size)
dummy_input = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, input_size)
output = model(dummy_input)
print(output.shape) # Should output: torch.Size([32, 5])

```

In this modified version, I've introduced `nn.ModuleList`. Using `ModuleList` ensures that PyTorch correctly identifies and registers each LSTM layer as part of the model's parameters. This is crucial when using an arbitrary number of layers, because it allows the backpropagation to work correctly across the stack. The loop constructs a list of LSTM layers, with `input_size` adapting to the `hidden_size` of the previous layer, as before. This is a more robust method that allows one to easily scale up layer counts as needed.

A critical issue is the need for explicit state initialization. If you're dealing with very long sequences or situations where the hidden state should not be automatically reset, you'll need to manage the hidden state and cell state outputs. You can modify the class above to provide initialization of hidden and cell states or correctly pass them between sequences. Here is an example where we will initialize the states to zero explicitly:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ConfigurableStackedLSTMWithState(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, output_size):
      super(ConfigurableStackedLSTMWithState, self).__init__()
      self.hidden_size = hidden_size
      self.num_layers = num_layers

      self.lstms = nn.ModuleList()
      for i in range(num_layers):
          layer_input_size = input_size if i == 0 else hidden_size
          self.lstms.append(nn.LSTM(layer_input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True))

      self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)


  def forward(self, x):
    # x: (batch_size, seq_len, input_size)
      batch_size = x.size(0)

      h_0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, batch_size, self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
      c_0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, batch_size, self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
    # h_0, c_0: (num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)


      out = x
      hidden_state = (h_0, c_0)
      for i, lstm in enumerate(self.lstms):
        out, hidden_state_layer = lstm(out, (hidden_state[0][i:i+1], hidden_state[1][i:i+1]))
    # out: (batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)


      out_last_timestep = out[:, -1, :]  # Extract last timestep
      #out_last_timestep: (batch_size, hidden_size)
      output = self.fc(out_last_timestep)
      #output: (batch_size, output_size)
      return output

# Example usage
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
num_layers = 4  # Increase to a higher number
output_size = 5
batch_size = 32
seq_len = 50

model = ConfigurableStackedLSTMWithState(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, output_size)
dummy_input = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, input_size)
output = model(dummy_input)
print(output.shape) # Should output: torch.Size([32, 5])
```
In this final version, I have explicitly defined the hidden and cell states of the network which we've initialized to 0 using `torch.zeros` with the appropriate shape.  Notice here that we also extract the hidden and cell states only for the particular LSTM layer in the loop, allowing for proper independent management.

To continue learning, I recommend consulting PyTorch's official documentation on `nn.LSTM`, specifically focusing on the input and output tensor shapes. Also, consider studying examples of sequence-to-sequence models as they often involve multi-layered LSTMs. The practical aspects of handling hidden state initialization and management are best understood through examples and careful examination of tensor dimensions. Furthermore, reviewing literature on best practices for training deep recurrent neural networks will aid in effectively utilizing stacked LSTMs.
