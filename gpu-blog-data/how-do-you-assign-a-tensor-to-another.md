Tensor assignment via array indexing in TensorFlow hinges on the crucial understanding that TensorFlow tensors, unlike NumPy arrays, are not always mutable in place.  Direct assignment often creates a *copy*, not a view, resulting in unintended behavior if modification is anticipated.  This behavior stems from TensorFlow's graph execution model and its optimized operations for distributed and GPU computation. My experience working on large-scale image recognition models highlighted this distinction numerous times, leading to significant debugging headaches initially.  Properly managing tensor assignments necessitates careful consideration of the `tf.identity` operation and potential use of `tf.Variable` objects where in-place modification is desired.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's array indexing utilizes standard Python slicing and indexing techniques. However, the behavior of assignment differs depending on the context.  Assigning a slice of one tensor to another tensor slice does not, by default, modify the original tensor in place. Instead, a new tensor is generated containing the assigned values and the result of the assignment operation is this new tensor. To achieve in-place modification, one must employ TensorFlow's mutable `tf.Variable` class or use `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` for selective updates.

The lack of in-place mutation is a design choice aimed at facilitating automatic differentiation and optimization within the TensorFlow graph. In-place modifications can complicate these processes, particularly when dealing with distributed computation or gradient calculations. This necessitates an understanding of TensorFlow's computational graph and how operations are scheduled and executed.

Using `tf.identity` can sometimes be misinterpreted as in-place assignment. While it creates a new tensor with the same values as the source tensor, it's distinct and doesn't reflect modifications to the original. If `tf.identity`'s output is modified and reassigned, it only affects this *copy*. Therefore, for true in-place modification, the use of `tf.Variable` objects or `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` is usually recommended, depending on the nature of the assignment.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating the default copy behavior:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_a = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
tensor_b = tf.constant([[7, 8, 9]])

# Incorrect assignment – creates a copy, not a view
tensor_a[0] = tensor_b

print("Tensor A after attempted assignment:\n", tensor_a)
print("Tensor B:\n", tensor_b)

#Output will show tensor_a unchanged, demonstrating copy behavior.
```

This example demonstrates the default behavior. Attempting a direct assignment via indexing creates a new tensor, leaving `tensor_a` unmodified. The assignment operation itself returns a new tensor, which is not assigned back to any variable.


**Example 2:  Using `tf.Variable` for in-place modification:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_a = tf.Variable([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
tensor_b = tf.constant([[7, 8, 9]])

# Correct assignment using tf.Variable – in-place modification
tensor_a[0].assign(tensor_b)

print("Tensor A after assignment:\n", tensor_a)
print("Tensor B:\n", tensor_b)

#Output shows tensor_a modified, demonstrating in-place modification via tf.Variable.
```

This example uses `tf.Variable`.  The `assign` method explicitly modifies the underlying tensor in place.  This is essential for scenarios where modifying a tensor during iterative processes, like training a neural network, is needed.


**Example 3:  Selective update using `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor_a = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
indices = tf.constant([[0, 0], [1, 1]]) #Row, column index for update
updates = tf.constant([10, 20])

# Selective update using tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update
tensor_c = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(tensor_a, indices, updates)

print("Original Tensor A:\n", tensor_a)
print("Updated Tensor C:\n", tensor_c)

#Output shows tensor_a unchanged, while tensor_c reflects selective updates.
```

This example showcases `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update`, ideal for updating specific elements without creating a complete copy.  It's highly efficient for sparse updates within large tensors. Note that `tensor_a` remains unchanged; `tensor_c` holds the updated tensor.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation is the primary resource.  Thorough study of the documentation on `tf.Variable`, tensor manipulation functions, and the concept of TensorFlow graphs is crucial.  Working through TensorFlow's introductory tutorials and exploring advanced tutorials focused on custom training loops or distributed training will further solidify understanding.  Finally, a solid grasp of linear algebra fundamentals, especially matrix operations, will significantly benefit comprehension of tensor manipulation.  These combined resources provide a comprehensive learning path for mastering tensor manipulation within TensorFlow.
