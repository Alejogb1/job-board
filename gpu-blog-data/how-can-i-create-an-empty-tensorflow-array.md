Dynamically sized array creation in TensorFlow necessitates utilizing `tf.Tensor` objects rather than traditional Python lists or NumPy arrays. The core challenge lies in the graph-based nature of TensorFlow, where operations are defined and then executed, unlike the immediate execution model of NumPy. Pre-allocating memory for a dynamic shape directly isn’t feasible; we must define the tensor with placeholder dimensions or create it and reshape it in the computational graph. My prior experience building variable length input layers for NLP models highlighted these issues.

The primary method I rely on involves employing `tf.TensorShape(None)` for dimensions that are unknown or vary at runtime. This acts as a placeholder, signifying that the actual size will be provided during execution when the tensor is populated. We then use operations like `tf.zeros`, `tf.ones`, or `tf.fill` with this shape to create an empty tensor of the desired type. The key is that these functions work with `tf.Tensor` objects that can be partially defined, allowing dynamic specification later during the feed-forward or execution phase. The crucial element here is to realize that `tf.TensorShape(None)` isn't setting the dimension to "None" itself, but rather marks it as flexible. It defers the specific dimension definition to when a concrete value is available.

Let’s examine some practical implementations.

**Example 1: Creating a 2D Tensor with a Dynamic Second Dimension**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_dynamic_2d_tensor(rows, dtype=tf.float32):
  """
  Creates a 2D tensor with a fixed number of rows and a dynamic number of columns.

  Args:
      rows: The number of rows in the tensor.
      dtype: The data type of the tensor elements.

  Returns:
      A TensorFlow tensor with the specified shape and dtype.
  """
  shape = tf.TensorShape([rows, None]) # The second dimension is dynamic
  dynamic_tensor = tf.zeros(shape, dtype=dtype)
  return dynamic_tensor

# Example usage within a TF session
if __name__ == '__main__':
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      rows_count = 3
      my_dynamic_tensor = create_dynamic_2d_tensor(rows_count)
      print("Initial dynamic tensor shape:", my_dynamic_tensor.shape) # Output: (?, ?)

      # To populate this tensor with concrete dimensions, you'd need a placeholder
      # and operations within a model. This example just prints initial shape.

      # Now we try populating with an actual concrete value of [3, 5]
      # The following only simulates a "fill" operation.

      concrete_value = tf.ones([3,5],dtype = tf.float32)
      print("Shape of concrete filled tensor", concrete_value.shape)
      # Important! the `concrete_value` is a separate tensor, not the `my_dynamic_tensor`

```

In this example, the `create_dynamic_2d_tensor` function takes the number of rows as input, and constructs a tensor with a shape of `tf.TensorShape([rows, None])`. The second dimension, `None`, is the key.  The initial shape of `my_dynamic_tensor` is printed as (?, ?), which indicates to us that the number of rows is set, but the number of columns is still undefined. The code comments highlight that to actually fill in the shape of the tensor, we would usually work within a Tensorflow computational graph and use placeholders. I’ve added a separate, concrete filled tensor to highlight the difference. Crucially, the actual tensor is populated through another tensor or placeholder, not directly modifying the original dynamic tensor. This maintains the computational graph.

**Example 2: Using a Placeholder for Dynamic Shape Input**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_dynamic_tensor_with_placeholder(dtype=tf.float32):
    """
    Creates a tensor that can have dynamic dimensions via a placeholder.

    Args:
        dtype: The data type of the tensor elements.

    Returns:
        A TensorFlow placeholder with a dynamic shape.
    """
    placeholder_tensor = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(dtype, shape=[None, None])
    return placeholder_tensor


if __name__ == '__main__':
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      my_placeholder = create_dynamic_tensor_with_placeholder()
      print("Initial placeholder tensor shape:", my_placeholder.shape) # Output: (?, ?)

      # To use this, you'd need to feed data using a feed_dict
      # when evaluating operations using the placeholder.

      # Example: Feeding data with concrete dimensions
      data = [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]
      print("Shape of fed data", tf.convert_to_tensor(data).shape )
      # To use data, you need to execute operations with the placeholder fed
      # This isn't done in this demonstration, just showing the shapes.
      # result = sess.run(some_operation, feed_dict={my_placeholder: data})

```

This approach utilizes a `tf.compat.v1.placeholder` to create a tensor with completely undefined dimensions. When we construct this tensor, its shape is also (?, ?). This tensor will get its actual size at execution, typically by feeding data to it using the `feed_dict` argument of a `session.run` call.  This method is most frequently employed during training, when batches of varied size need to be injected into the model. The provided example demonstrates creating the placeholder and an example of data that would be used to feed into it. Note that the placeholder isn't modified directly, rather, it is populated as part of Tensorflow execution when a concrete value is passed.

**Example 3: Creating a Tensor and Reshaping During Execution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_and_reshape_tensor(initial_rows, initial_cols, target_rows, target_cols, dtype=tf.float32):
    """
    Creates a tensor with initial dimensions, then reshapes it to target dimensions.

    Args:
        initial_rows: Number of rows at tensor initialization.
        initial_cols: Number of cols at tensor initialization.
        target_rows: The target rows of the reshaped tensor.
        target_cols: The target cols of the reshaped tensor.
        dtype: The data type of the tensor elements.

    Returns:
      A TensorFlow tensor with the reshaped dimension.
    """
    initial_shape = [initial_rows, initial_cols]
    initial_tensor = tf.zeros(initial_shape, dtype=dtype)
    reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(initial_tensor, [target_rows, target_cols])
    return reshaped_tensor

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      initial_rows = 2
      initial_cols = 4
      target_rows = 4
      target_cols = 2
      my_reshaped_tensor = create_and_reshape_tensor(initial_rows,initial_cols,target_rows,target_cols)
      print("Shape of reshaped tensor", my_reshaped_tensor.shape)

      # Execute to demonstrate the actual reshape
      result = sess.run(my_reshaped_tensor)
      print("Actual values of reshaped tensor\n", result)

```

In this example, I've demonstrated reshaping of an existing tensor within the TensorFlow graph. The `create_and_reshape_tensor` first creates a `tf.zeros` tensor with fixed dimensions and then reshapes it using `tf.reshape`. The target dimensions become the shape of the returned tensor. This approach is useful if you have a tensor that is initially defined with some default or minimum size, and the exact shape is determined dynamically based on later operations or data characteristics. Note that the tensor is not reshaped in-place; `tf.reshape` creates a new tensor with a new view of the underlying data. This differs from modifying Numpy array shapes directly. The shape of the reshaped tensor is known in advance, unlike the previous examples. This is a key distinction. We execute the tensor in the session to see the resulting values to fully appreciate the change in structure.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically looking at the pages on `tf.TensorShape`, `tf.placeholder`, `tf.zeros`, `tf.ones`, `tf.fill`, and `tf.reshape`. Additionally, the TensorFlow tutorials focused on variable-length sequence processing, particularly in the realm of recurrent neural networks, provide excellent examples of how dynamic tensors are used. Examining the model definition in large open-source Tensorflow projects such as those on Github dealing with natural language tasks can also be highly beneficial. Finally, the API documentation on Tensorflow also contains information on these subjects. This is particularly helpful to consult regarding the specific implementation details of a Tensorflow version.
