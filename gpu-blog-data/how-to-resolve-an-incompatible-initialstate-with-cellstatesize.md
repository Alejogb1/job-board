The core issue of an incompatible `initial_state` with `cell.state_size` in TensorFlow/Keras RNN layers stems from a mismatch in the dimensionality of the provided initial state and the expected state size of the underlying recurrent cell.  This discrepancy often arises from a misunderstanding of the structure of the recurrent cell's internal state and the expected input format of the `initial_state` argument.  During my years developing and deploying deep learning models, I've encountered this problem numerous times, invariably tracing it back to this fundamental incompatibility.  Let's examine the correct procedure and demonstrate through examples.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras RNN layers, such as `LSTM` and `GRU`, utilize recurrent cells as their building blocks.  These cells maintain an internal state that is updated at each time step. The `cell.state_size` attribute reflects the dimensionality of this internal state.  Itâ€™s crucial to understand that this dimensionality isn't always a single integer. For many cells, the state is composed of two tensors: the *hidden state* and the *cell state* (specifically for LSTMs).

Therefore, when providing an `initial_state` to an RNN layer, you must supply a list or tuple containing tensors whose shapes match the structure and dimensionality defined by `cell.state_size`.  The failure to accurately reflect this structure leads to the shape mismatch error.  The exact structure of `cell.state_size` will depend on the specific recurrent cell used.  For a simple recurrent cell, it's a single integer representing the hidden state's dimensionality. However, for LSTMs and GRUs, it's more complex, typically a tuple of two integers, representing the hidden state and cell state dimensions (or hidden states if multiple are used). Incorrectly specifying the `initial_state` results in an incompatibility, causing the model to fail during compilation or execution.

To correctly set the `initial_state`, you first need to determine the `cell.state_size` of your chosen cell. Then, construct your `initial_state` as a list or tuple of NumPy arrays (or TensorFlow tensors) matching the size and number of tensors specified by `cell.state_size`.  Ensure that the data type of these arrays also matches the expected data type of your model.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: SimpleRNN**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a SimpleRNN cell with a hidden state size of 32
simple_rnn_cell = tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNNCell(units=32)

# Determine the state size
state_size = simple_rnn_cell.state_size

# Create an initial state with the correct shape and data type
initial_state = [np.zeros((1, state_size), dtype=np.float32)]

# Build the RNN layer. Note that we explicitly provide the initial_state.
simple_rnn_layer = tf.keras.layers.RNN(simple_rnn_cell, return_sequences=True, return_state=True, stateful=False)

# Example input (batch_size=1, time_steps=5, input_dim=10)
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 5, 10).astype(np.float32)

# Run the RNN layer with the initial state
output, final_state = simple_rnn_layer(input_data, initial_state=initial_state)

print(output.shape) # (1, 5, 32)
print(final_state[0].shape) # (1, 32)
```

This demonstrates how to handle the simpler case of a `SimpleRNNCell` where `state_size` is a single integer. The `initial_state` is a list containing a single NumPy array of the appropriate shape and data type.  The `stateful=False` argument indicates that the layer's state will be reset for each batch; the `initial_state` is used only for this initial batch.

**Example 2: LSTM**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define an LSTM cell with a hidden state size of 64
lstm_cell = tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(units=64)

# Determine the state size (this will be a tuple for LSTM)
state_size = lstm_cell.state_size

# Create initial state; the structure must match the state size which is a tuple (h, c)
initial_state = [np.zeros((1, state_size[0]), dtype=np.float32), np.zeros((1, state_size[1]), dtype=np.float32)]

# Build the LSTM layer
lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.RNN(lstm_cell, return_sequences=True, return_state=True, stateful=False)

# Example input (batch_size=1, time_steps=5, input_dim=10)
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 5, 10).astype(np.float32)

# Run the LSTM layer with the initial state
output, hidden_state, cell_state = lstm_layer(input_data, initial_state=initial_state)

print(output.shape) # (1, 5, 64)
print(hidden_state.shape) # (1, 64)
print(cell_state.shape) # (1, 64)
```

This illustrates the case with an LSTM cell, where the `state_size` is a tuple. The `initial_state` is a list with two NumPy arrays, one for the hidden state and one for the cell state, both matching the respective dimensions from `state_size`.

**Example 3: Stacked RNN**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define two stacked LSTM cells
lstm_cell_1 = tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(units=64)
lstm_cell_2 = tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell(units=32)
stacked_lstm = tf.keras.layers.StackedRNNCells([lstm_cell_1, lstm_cell_2])

# State size is a tuple of tuples when the cells are stacked
state_size = stacked_lstm.state_size

# Create initial state - it will be a list with two tuples, representing the state of the two stacked cells
initial_state = ([np.zeros((1, state_size[0][0]), dtype=np.float32), np.zeros((1, state_size[0][1]), dtype=np.float32)],
                [np.zeros((1, state_size[1][0]), dtype=np.float32), np.zeros((1, state_size[1][1]), dtype=np.float32)])


# Build the stacked LSTM layer
stacked_lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.RNN(stacked_lstm, return_sequences=True, return_state=True, stateful=False)

# Example input (batch_size=1, time_steps=5, input_dim=10)
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 5, 10).astype(np.float32)

# Run the stacked LSTM layer with the initial state
output, state_tuple_1, state_tuple_2 = stacked_lstm_layer(input_data, initial_state=initial_state)

print(output.shape) # (1, 5, 32)
print(state_tuple_1[0].shape) # (1,64)
print(state_tuple_1[1].shape) # (1,64)
print(state_tuple_2[0].shape) # (1,32)
print(state_tuple_2[1].shape) # (1,32)
```

This complex example showcases stacked RNN layers.  The `initial_state` must be a nested list of NumPy arrays, corresponding precisely to the state sizes of each cell in the stack.  This carefully structured `initial_state` prevents any mismatch errors.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on RNN layers and their configurations.  Examining the source code of the Keras RNN layers is beneficial for understanding the internal workings. A well-structured deep learning textbook covering recurrent neural networks will offer valuable theoretical background and practical implementation advice.  Finally, exploring relevant research papers on advanced RNN architectures can provide further insight.
