The application of a sigmoid activation function is not inherently restricted to post-dense-layer scenarios.  While frequently paired with dense layers in neural networks, its utility extends to other architectural contexts, depending on the specific design goals and data characteristics.  My experience working on large-scale image classification and time-series forecasting projects has demonstrated this versatility.  The key lies in understanding the functional properties of the sigmoid – its range, differentiability, and suitability for specific probability estimations – and how these align with the desired output of a particular layer or network segment.

**1. Explanation:**

The sigmoid function, defined as σ(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)), outputs a value between 0 and 1, making it naturally suited for representing probabilities or binary classifications.  This is why its prevalence is high following dense layers in the final output layer of a classifier.  However, intermediate layers often benefit from activation functions with a wider range and different saturation properties, such as ReLU or tanh.  The choice depends on the desired gradient characteristics for efficient backpropagation.  A sigmoid in an intermediate layer might lead to the vanishing gradient problem, particularly in deep networks, where gradients become increasingly small during backpropagation, hindering learning.

A misconception arises from the common practice of using sigmoids in binary classification tasks.  The sigmoid activation on the final output neuron readily provides a probability score for the positive class. This doesn't necessitate the sigmoid being *exclusively* after a dense layer.  Consider a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification: the final convolutional layer might output feature maps representing different aspects of the input image.  A global average pooling layer could then reduce these maps to vectors, followed by a dense layer.  While a sigmoid on the output of the dense layer is common, it's equally valid—and sometimes beneficial—to apply a sigmoid to the output of the global average pooling layer directly, depending on the design of the network and the dimensionality reduction properties of the pooling operation.  The global average pooling layer itself could be viewed as a form of dimensionality reduction that simplifies the subsequent classification task. This approach can be particularly advantageous in situations where a direct probability estimation is desired from the pooled features, avoiding the additional computational cost and potential overfitting introduced by an unnecessary dense layer.

Furthermore, in certain generative models, a sigmoid might be used after a layer designed to generate features, not necessarily a densely connected one.  For example, in a variational autoencoder (VAE), the decoder network might use a sigmoid activation function at its output to generate probabilities for pixel values in an image. The layers preceding this sigmoid could include convolutional or deconvolutional layers, depending on the architecture's specific design.  The critical factor is the output's intended interpretation: a probability distribution over pixel values, perfectly handled by the sigmoid's 0-1 range.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Sigmoid after a Dense Layer (Standard Binary Classification):**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# ... previous layers ...

dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation=None)(previous_layer)
sigmoid_layer = tf.keras.layers.Activation('sigmoid')(dense_layer)

# sigmoid_layer now contains probabilities between 0 and 1
```

This illustrates the typical usage, where a dense layer provides the input to the sigmoid activation, producing a probability for binary classification.  The `activation=None` in the dense layer is crucial; otherwise, applying another activation would be redundant and might lead to unexpected behavior.

**Example 2: Sigmoid after Global Average Pooling (CNN):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... convolutional layers ...

gap_layer = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(conv_layer)
sigmoid_layer = tf.keras.layers.Activation('sigmoid')(gap_layer)

# sigmoid_layer directly provides probabilities from feature maps
```

Here, the global average pooling layer summarizes the convolutional features, and the sigmoid directly converts these summarized features into probabilities.  This bypasses the need for an intermediate dense layer, potentially improving efficiency and reducing overfitting if the dimensionality reduction achieved by the pooling is sufficient.

**Example 3: Sigmoid in a Generative Model (VAE Decoder):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... decoder layers (e.g., transposed convolutions) ...

final_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(3, (3,3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same')(previous_layer)

# final_layer outputs an image with pixel values between 0 and 1 representing probabilities
```

This example showcases the sigmoid's application in a generative model.  The sigmoid applied to the output of a convolutional layer generates an image whose pixel values represent probabilities.  This differs significantly from the previous examples, highlighting the broader applicability of the sigmoid beyond its common pairing with dense layers.  The number 3 in the `Conv2DTranspose` represents the number of output channels (RGB in this case).


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I suggest consulting comprehensive texts on neural network architectures and activation functions.  Look for detailed explanations of backpropagation, the vanishing gradient problem, and the characteristics of different activation functions.  Further research into variational autoencoders and convolutional neural networks will provide valuable context for the diverse applications illustrated in the code examples.  Finally, exploring advanced topics like residual connections and normalization techniques will further enhance your understanding of how activation functions impact network performance.  These resources will offer a deeper understanding of the nuances of activation function selection and the broader design considerations of neural network architectures.
