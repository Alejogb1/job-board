Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) transfer learning, while often significantly faster than training from scratch, can still be computationally expensive, particularly with large models and datasets. My experience building image classifiers for medical imaging has highlighted several strategies to accelerate this process, all focusing on minimizing unnecessary computations and leveraging hardware capabilities effectively.

The most significant gains in transfer learning speed typically come from a judicious selection of which layers to fine-tune, coupled with optimizations to the underlying training pipeline. Simply fine-tuning the entire pre-trained network, even with a small learning rate, can be redundant when the initial layers have already learned robust, low-level features that are broadly applicable across tasks. Therefore, freezing early layers is a primary strategy for speedup.

The rationale for this is rooted in the feature hierarchy of CNNs. Early layers, those closer to the input, detect basic features like edges and corners, which are often universally relevant across different image domains. Later layers, conversely, extract higher-level, task-specific features. When adapting a pre-trained model, it's generally more efficient to freeze the early layers, preserving their learned representations, and focus the training effort on the layers that are likely to require adaptation to the new target domain. This approach reduces the number of trainable parameters, thereby decreasing the computational cost of each training iteration.

Secondly, judicious use of optimized libraries and hardware acceleration is crucial. Leveraging frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which have been designed for efficient computation, is paramount. These libraries can leverage available hardware acceleration like GPUs or TPUs, and automatically optimize tensor operations. Furthermore, data loading can also be a bottleneck. Optimized data pipelines, which use multi-threading or other parallel processing techniques to load and prepare data for each batch can reduce GPU idle time and thus increase overall speed.

Finally, careful attention to hyperparameters can also influence training times. While often subtle, choices such as batch size and learning rates can dramatically impact speed. Larger batch sizes can increase computational efficiency by processing more data in parallel, although it must be balanced against potential memory limitations and the increased training variance from using fewer update steps. Similarly, learning rate schedulers can help guide training to optimal convergence, which can ultimately reduce training times. A rate that's too high, might make the process unstable, and one that is too low would slow down convergence, so a scheduler that adapts can be optimal.

Now, letâ€™s illustrate these strategies with code examples.

**Example 1: Freezing Early Layers in PyTorch**

This code demonstrates how to freeze the initial layers of a pre-trained ResNet-50 model during fine-tuning.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models
import torch.optim as optim

# Load a pre-trained ResNet-50 model
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)

# Freeze all parameters initially
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Unfreeze the last few layers (e.g., the final layer and the last few block layers)
for param in model.layer4.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True
for param in model.fc.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True

# Modify the fully connected layer for new number of classes (e.g., 10 instead of 1000)
num_ftrs = model.fc.in_features
model.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 10)

# Define optimizer - only optimize over the unfrozen params
optimizer = optim.Adam(filter(lambda p: p.requires_grad, model.parameters()), lr=0.001)

#Print parameters to verify that only the desired ones are trainable
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if param.requires_grad:
       print("Trainable parameter:", name)
```
In this example, after loading the ResNet-50 model, we initially freeze all its layers by setting `requires_grad = False`. Then, we selectively unfreeze the final fully connected layer and layer4, making these parameters trainable. We then define an optimizer that only optimizes the parameters that require gradient computation, saving time by not computing gradients for all parameters. The printed names verify that only the desired parameters are trainable.

**Example 2: Optimized Data Loading in TensorFlow**

This example uses TensorFlow's `tf.data` API for efficient data loading, including prefetching for parallel processing.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data generation (replace with your actual data loading)
def generate_dummy_data(num_samples, image_size=224):
    images = np.random.rand(num_samples, image_size, image_size, 3)
    labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=num_samples)
    return images, labels

images, labels = generate_dummy_data(1000)

def preprocess_image(image, label):
    image = tf.convert_to_tensor(image, dtype=tf.float32)  #Ensure the correct datatype
    # Add any additional preprocessing steps here, e.g., resizing, normalization.
    return image, label


# Create TensorFlow dataset with optimization.
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((images, labels))
dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_image).batch(64).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

#Example of iterating through dataset
for images_batch, labels_batch in dataset:
    # Do something with batch
    pass

```

Here, we create a TensorFlow dataset from a dummy NumPy array. We then apply a pre-processing step and batch the dataset for training.  `prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)` is crucial for performance; it allows the CPU to prepare the next batch of data while the GPU is processing the current one, minimizing GPU idle time. You will want to replace the sample dataset with your actual dataset.

**Example 3:  Adaptive Learning Rate in PyTorch**

This example demonstrates how to use a learning rate scheduler to adapt the learning rate during training.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision.models as models
import torch.optim as optim

# Load a pre-trained ResNet-50 model and modify it as in example 1 (omitted for brevity)
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
# Freeze early layers
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
for param in model.layer4.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True
for param in model.fc.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True
num_ftrs = model.fc.in_features
model.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 10)

# Define optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam(filter(lambda p: p.requires_grad, model.parameters()), lr=0.001)

#Define learning rate scheduler
scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=5, gamma=0.1)

# Assume training loop here
for epoch in range(10):
    #Training pass (omitted for brevity)
    for i in range(50):
        loss = torch.rand(1).item()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, loss: {loss}, lr: {optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr']}")
    scheduler.step()  # Adjust the learning rate after an epoch

```
This example shows the use of a StepLR scheduler from PyTorch. It reduces the learning rate by a factor of `gamma` every `step_size` epochs. As training progresses, reducing the learning rate can allow the model to better converge. Multiple schedulers exist that can be used. In this example we use a basic one, but in practice using other strategies might yield better results, such as exponential decay or cosine annealing.

In summary, to accelerate CNN transfer learning, we should prioritize freezing early layers to reduce the trainable parameters, implement an optimized data loading pipeline that minimizes GPU idle time, and use adaptive learning rates to converge faster. These techniques, combined with the optimized tensor operations of popular deep learning frameworks, can significantly reduce the required training time.

For further study, I recommend reviewing literature on efficient deep learning, particularly techniques for network pruning, quantization and knowledge distillation, which can reduce the size and complexity of the trained model. Additionally, detailed documentation for TensorFlow and PyTorch can provide deep insights into optimized data loading strategies and scheduling.  Textbooks and courses on deep learning often also cover these optimization techniques in considerable depth. Resources explaining hardware acceleration will also be highly informative.
