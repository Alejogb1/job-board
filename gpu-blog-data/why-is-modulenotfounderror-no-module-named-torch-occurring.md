The `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'` error after a seemingly successful PyTorch 1.3.0 installation via conda on Ubuntu 18.04 almost invariably stems from environment inconsistencies, particularly concerning Python versions and conda environments.  My experience troubleshooting this across numerous projects, ranging from deep learning model deployments to high-throughput scientific computing tasks, points to this core issue.  The error rarely indicates a failed PyTorch installation itself; instead, it signifies that the Python interpreter your application uses cannot locate the PyTorch package within its accessible paths.


**1. Explanation of the Error and Contributing Factors**

The Python interpreter searches for modules within a series of directories specified in the `sys.path` variable.  If PyTorch is installed within a conda environment, that environment's specific Python installation must be activated, ensuring its associated `site-packages` directory (containing the installed PyTorch package) is included in `sys.path`.  Failure to activate the correct conda environment is the single most common cause of this error.

Other contributing factors include:

* **Multiple Python installations:**  If multiple versions of Python exist on the system (e.g., a system-wide Python installation and one managed by conda), the incorrect interpreter might be invoked, leading to the `ModuleNotFoundError`.
* **Incorrect conda environment activation:** While seemingly straightforward, activating the correct conda environment is crucial. Even a slight typo in the environment name can cause this problem.
* **Clashes with system-wide packages:** If a system-wide Python installation has a conflicting package that interferes with PyTorch's dependencies, the module import might fail.
* **Corrupted conda environment:**  Rarely, the conda environment itself might become corrupted, rendering installed packages inaccessible.  This necessitates environment recreation.
* **Insufficient permissions:** In some cases, especially when installing PyTorch to system-protected directories without elevated privileges, the installation might be incomplete or inaccessible to the current user.

Therefore, resolving this requires a systematic approach verifying each of these potential issues.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate potential scenarios and their solutions. Assume the PyTorch 1.3.0 environment is named `pytorch130`.

**Example 1: Incorrect Environment Activation**

```python
# Incorrect:  Trying to import torch without activating the environment
import torch

# Output: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'

# Correct: Activating the environment before importing
conda activate pytorch130
python
>>> import torch
>>> # PyTorch is now accessible
```

This illustrates the fundamental necessity of activating the correct conda environment before running any code relying on PyTorch. The first attempt fails due to the absence of PyTorch in the currently active environmentâ€™s `sys.path`.  The second attempt correctly activates the environment, making PyTorch available to the Python interpreter.


**Example 2: Verifying `sys.path`**

```python
import sys
print(sys.path)

# Examine the output to confirm the presence of the PyTorch installation path.
# This path should include the 'site-packages' directory within the 'pytorch130' environment.
# Absence of this path confirms the environment is not activated or incorrectly configured.
```

This code snippet directly inspects `sys.path`, allowing for explicit verification of the PyTorch installation location.  If the path to the `pytorch130` environment's `site-packages` directory is missing, the source of the error is clear.


**Example 3:  Handling Potential Conflicts**

```python
# Scenario: Conflicting package (hypothetical example)
# If you suspect a system-wide package conflict with a PyTorch dependency, try creating a new clean environment:
conda create -n pytorch130_clean python=3.7 # Adjust Python version as needed
conda activate pytorch130_clean
conda install pytorch==1.3.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 # Adjust CUDA toolkit version as needed
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install additional project-specific packages. Ensure this does not conflict with PyTorch.


import torch
# Verify that PyTorch imports successfully within this isolated environment.
```

This example demonstrates a proactive approach to resolving potential conflicts by creating a completely new conda environment.  This isolates the PyTorch installation from any pre-existing system-wide packages or environment inconsistencies, providing a clean slate for successful installation and module import.  The `requirements.txt` file should list any additional project dependencies; careful review is necessary to avoid conflicts.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

To delve deeper, I would recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation on installation and troubleshooting, specifically focusing on conda-based installations and environment management.  Familiarize yourself with the conda documentation regarding environment creation, activation, and management. Understanding the concepts of virtual environments and package management within Python is essential. Additionally, explore the Python documentation concerning the `sys.path` variable and module import mechanisms.  These resources provide comprehensive guidance for handling such issues.
