The question of whether to mark intermediate tensors in custom layers as non-trainable significantly impacts model training efficiency and performance.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition models, specifically those leveraging advanced convolutional architectures, has shown that the decision is nuanced and depends heavily on the layer's function and the overall training strategy.  Simply declaring all intermediate tensors as non-trainable is rarely optimal.

The key consideration is the layer's role in the computation graph.  If an intermediate tensor represents a purely intermediate result – a step in a larger computation, and not a learned feature representation – then marking it as non-trainable is appropriate.  However, if the intermediate tensor embodies learned features, even implicitly, excluding it from the training process can severely limit the model's capacity for optimization.

This distinction is crucial.  Consider a custom layer performing a complex normalization or feature fusion operation.  Multiple intermediate tensors might be generated during this process.  While some might represent temporary variables solely used for computation, others may contain meaningful feature representations that the model could learn from.  Forcing these latter tensors to remain constant during backpropagation prevents the model from optimizing its feature extraction capabilities.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental principle is that gradients should only flow through parameters that directly contribute to the model's learning objective.  Parameters include the layer's weights and biases.  Intermediate tensors, by definition, are not parameters.  However, the *values* within these tensors can indirectly influence the learning process.  If these values are derived through a series of operations involving trainable weights, the gradient can still be backpropagated through them *implicitly*.  This implicit gradient flow, often mediated through the chain rule, adjusts the trainable weights to refine the intermediate tensor values indirectly.

Explicitly marking intermediate tensors as non-trainable prevents this indirect gradient flow.  This has two main consequences.  Firstly, it can reduce memory consumption during backpropagation, as these tensors are not included in the computation of gradients. This is beneficial for memory-constrained environments.  Secondly, it removes the model's capacity to learn from the information encoded within these intermediate tensors, which might lead to suboptimal performance.

Consequently, a careful analysis of each intermediate tensor is required.  This analysis should consider whether the tensor's values reflect learned features or simply act as computational steps.  If it's the latter, marking it as non-trainable is justified for efficiency reasons.  If it's the former, leaving it trainable allows for more efficient and potentially more accurate model learning.

**2. Code Examples:**

These examples illustrate three different scenarios using a hypothetical custom layer in TensorFlow/Keras:

**Example 1: Non-trainable intermediate tensor (purely computational)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Intermediate tensor purely for computation
        intermediate = tf.math.sqrt(inputs)  
        output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(self.units)(intermediate)
        return output

# ... model definition using MyCustomLayer ...
```

In this example, `intermediate` is a purely computational step.  The square root operation doesn't learn any features; it simply transforms the input.  Therefore, there's no need for gradient flow through it, hence no need to make it trainable. TensorFlow automatically handles this; the gradient will propagate through the `Dense` layer's weights, implicitly impacting the output indirectly.

**Example 2: Trainable intermediate tensor (learned feature representation)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class FeatureExtractionLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(FeatureExtractionLayer, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')
        self.conv2 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.conv1(inputs)
        # Intermediate tensor representing learned features
        intermediate_features = x
        x = self.conv2(intermediate_features)
        return x

# ... model definition using FeatureExtractionLayer ...
```

Here, `intermediate_features` acts as a learned feature representation.  The gradients should backpropagate through `conv1`'s weights, implicitly refining `intermediate_features` and leading to improved performance.  No explicit manipulation is needed to make this trainable; it is by default.

**Example 3:  Partially trainable intermediate tensor (hybrid approach)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class HybridLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(HybridLayer, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        # Intermediate tensor with trainable and non-trainable parts
        intermediate = tf.concat([x, tf.stop_gradient(tf.math.sin(x))], axis=-1)
        output = self.dense2(intermediate)
        return output

# ... model definition using HybridLayer ...
```


This example demonstrates selective gradient blocking.  `tf.stop_gradient` prevents gradients from flowing through the sine calculation applied to a part of the intermediate tensor `intermediate`.  This allows for the learning of features encoded in the other part (output from `dense1`) while potentially improving efficiency by ignoring gradients from the less impactful sine transformation.  This hybrid approach illustrates the selective application of non-trainable parameters rather than blanket application across all intermediate tensors.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of automatic differentiation and gradient flow within deep learning frameworks, I recommend consulting the official documentation of the framework you are using (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).  In addition, advanced texts on deep learning, specifically those covering custom layer implementation and backpropagation, would be invaluable resources.  Finally, carefully examining the source code of well-established custom layer implementations in open-source projects can offer valuable insights and best practices.  These resources provide a thorough grounding in the mathematical and practical aspects of implementing and training custom layers.
