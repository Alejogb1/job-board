Discrepancies between Keras sequential model outputs and expected labels stem fundamentally from a mismatch between the model's architecture, training data, and the evaluation metric employed.  During my years developing deep learning solutions for medical image analysis, I've encountered this issue frequently, tracing it back to several common sources.  Let's analyze these and illustrate with examples.


**1. Incorrect Output Layer Activation Function:** The most frequent cause is an inappropriate activation function in the final layer.  The choice of activation function dictates the range and interpretation of the model's output.  For example, a binary classification problem requires a sigmoid activation (outputting probabilities between 0 and 1), while a multi-class classification problem necessitates a softmax activation (outputting a probability distribution across all classes).  Using a linear activation for a classification task will produce unbounded outputs that are neither probabilities nor easily interpretable class assignments.  Using a sigmoid for a multi-class problem will yield individual probabilities for each class, without ensuring their sum equals one, leading to inconsistent predictions.


**2. Data Preprocessing Discrepancies:** The way input data is preprocessed significantly impacts model performance and output interpretation.  Inconsistencies between preprocessing steps applied during training and prediction will directly lead to prediction errors.  This includes inconsistencies in scaling (e.g., min-max normalization, standardization), handling missing values, and data encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding for categorical features).  If the training data is standardized to have zero mean and unit variance, but the prediction data is not, the model's weights will be operating on a different scale, potentially leading to incorrect predictions.  Similar problems arise if categorical features are encoded differently.


**3. Insufficient Training or Overfitting:**  An undertrained model hasn't learned the underlying patterns in the data effectively, leading to poor predictions.  Conversely, an overfit model has learned the training data too well, including its noise, rendering it unable to generalize to unseen data.  This often manifests as high accuracy on the training set but poor performance on a held-out validation or test set.  The symptoms might manifest as outputs far from the expected labels, or as high variance in predictions.  Careful evaluation of training and validation loss curves can highlight these issues.


**4. Inappropriate Loss Function:** The loss function quantifies the difference between the model's predictions and the true labels.  Using an inappropriate loss function can negatively influence training and lead to unexpected outputs.  For example, using mean squared error (MSE) for binary classification tasks will generally yield suboptimal results compared to binary cross-entropy, which is tailored for probabilistic outputs.  Similarly, categorical cross-entropy is better suited for multi-class classification problems than MSE. The choice of loss function must align with the nature of the prediction task and the output activation function.


**5. Incorrect Label Encoding:**  The labels themselves must be correctly encoded.  For instance, in binary classification, labels might be represented as 0 and 1, or as -1 and 1.  In multi-class classification, they might be represented through one-hot encoding or integer encoding.  Inconsistencies between the label encoding during training and prediction will clearly produce mismatches between model output and expected labels.



**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Activation Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Incorrect: Using linear activation for binary classification
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear') # Incorrect activation
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Correct: Using sigmoid activation for binary classification
model_correct = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Correct activation
])
model_correct.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... training and evaluation code ...
```

This example highlights the crucial role of the activation function.  The `linear` activation in the first model yields unbounded outputs unsuitable for binary classification, while the `sigmoid` activation in the second model provides probabilities, as expected.


**Example 2: Data Scaling Discrepancy**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow import keras

# Training data
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Scaling training data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

# Model training (using scaled data)
model = keras.Sequential([...]) # Define your model here
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, ...)

# Prediction data (unscaled)
X_test = np.random.rand(20, 10)

# Prediction (incorrect: unscaled data)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Prediction (correct: scaled data)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
predictions_correct = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
```

Here, the discrepancy lies in the scaling of the test data.  Failing to scale the test data using the same `StandardScaler` fitted on the training data leads to incorrect predictions.


**Example 3: Inappropriate Loss Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Incorrect: Using MSE for binary classification
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['accuracy']) # Incorrect loss function

# Correct: Using binary cross-entropy for binary classification
model_correct = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model_correct.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) # Correct loss function

# ... training and evaluation code ...
```

This example illustrates the importance of choosing the appropriate loss function.  `mse` is not ideal for binary classification, while `binary_crossentropy` is specifically designed for probabilistic outputs.



**Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend reviewing the Keras documentation thoroughly.  Pay close attention to the sections on sequential models, activation functions, loss functions, and data preprocessing.  A good understanding of these concepts is fundamental to building effective deep learning models.  Further, studying introductory materials on deep learning principles and best practices would be valuable.  Finally, exploring practical examples and tutorials would aid in solidifying your understanding and developing practical skills.  Remember that consistent experimentation and rigorous evaluation are key to debugging and improving model performance.
