TensorFlow's eager execution fundamentally alters the gradient computation process compared to the graph-based execution mode.  My experience debugging complex reinforcement learning models heavily reliant on custom loss functions highlighted the crucial distinction:  in eager execution, gradients are computed *immediately* after the operation generating them, eliminating the need for a separate graph construction and execution phase.  This impacts how we approach gradient calculation, primarily shifting the responsibility from TensorFlow's automatic differentiation system to a more direct interaction with individual tensor operations.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Eager execution's immediate computation nature necessitates leveraging TensorFlow's `tf.GradientTape` context manager.  This context manager records all operations performed within its scope, enabling the subsequent computation of gradients with respect to specified tensors.  Crucially, this recording happens *during* the forward pass, not as a separate step.  The `GradientTape`'s `gradient()` method then uses this recorded information to calculate gradients efficiently.  This is in contrast to graph mode where the graph is built, optimized, and then executed separately, often with separate gradient computation passes.

Understanding the `GradientTape`'s behaviour with respect to resource management is vital. The tape keeps track of the computational history of tensors;  however, this history is discarded once `gradient()` is called.  Multiple gradient computations from a single tape are generally discouraged unless specifically managing resource usage with `persistent=True`.  Even then, this approach should be used cautiously, as it increases memory consumption proportionally to the complexity of the recorded computations.  In most scenarios, creating a new `GradientTape` for each gradient computation represents the best practice.

Furthermore, the `watch()` method allows explicitly specifying which tensors should be tracked for gradient computation. This optimization prevents unnecessary tracking and enhances computational efficiency.  While not strictly necessary for simple computations, it becomes indispensable in scenarios involving numerous tensors, particularly when dealing with large-scale models or computations where the forward pass is computationally expensive. Ignoring tensors that do not contribute to the final gradients saves considerable time and memory.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Gradient Calculation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(3.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y = x**2

dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(dy_dx)  # Output: <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=6.0>
```

This example demonstrates a fundamental gradient calculation. The `tf.GradientTape()` context manager records the `y = x**2` operation.  `tape.gradient(y, x)` then computes the derivative of `y` with respect to `x`, which is 2x, evaluated at x=3.0, resulting in 6.0.

**Example 2: Gradient with Multiple Variables and Watch()**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
y = tf.Variable(3.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch(x) # Explicitly watch x for gradient computation
  z = x * y**2

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
dz_dy = tape.gradient(z, y)
print(dz_dx)  # Output: <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=9.0>
print(dz_dy)  # Output: <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=12.0>

```

Here, we demonstrate gradient computation with respect to multiple variables (`x` and `y`).  Notice the explicit use of `tape.watch(x)`. While `y` is a `tf.Variable`, and would be automatically watched,  this illustrates the control granted by `watch()` which is especially helpful when dealing with many tensors. The gradients `dz_dx` (9.0) and `dz_dy` (12.0) are correctly computed based on the partial derivatives of `z = x * y**2`.


**Example 3: Gradient with Custom Loss Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss(predictions, targets):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(predictions - targets))  # Mean Absolute Error

predictions = tf.Variable([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
targets = tf.constant([1.5, 2.5, 3.5])

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  loss = custom_loss(predictions, targets)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, predictions)
print(gradients) # Output: <tf.Tensor: shape=(3,), dtype=float32, numpy=array([-0.5, -0.5, -0.5], dtype=float32)>
```

This showcases the flexibility of `tf.GradientTape` with custom functions. A mean absolute error loss is defined and applied. The gradient calculation correctly computes the gradient of the loss with respect to each element in the `predictions` tensor.  This is critical in developing and training custom neural network architectures.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation offers comprehensive guidance on automatic differentiation and eager execution.  A deep understanding of calculus, particularly partial derivatives and chain rule, is essential for interpreting the results of gradient computations.  Familiarity with linear algebra is also beneficial, particularly when dealing with higher-dimensional tensors and complex model architectures.  Finally, textbooks focusing on numerical optimization techniques provide valuable context for understanding the broader implications of gradient-based methods in machine learning.  I found these resources invaluable during my work on high-dimensional optimization problems involving custom differentiable layers within TensorFlow.
