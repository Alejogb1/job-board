Mean Average Precision (mAP), when computed using object detection evaluation metrics like those applied to the VisDrone dataset, should ideally reside between 0 and 1, or, when expressed as a percentage, between 0% and 100%. Observing negative mAP values indicates a critical flaw in the evaluation pipeline, typically stemming from mismatches between predicted bounding boxes and ground truth annotations, but occasionally related to subtle issues in the implementation of the evaluation logic. Having debugged similar issues countless times in prior projects focusing on aerial imagery analysis, I've developed a fairly robust strategy for diagnosing and correcting these problems.

The core issue usually arises when the evaluation algorithm, specifically regarding intersection over union (IoU) calculations and the subsequent thresholding used to determine true positives, is improperly configured or when the prediction data has significant deviations from expected formats.  When IoU values are not correctly computed, you will observe issues with your mAP. It isn't directly possible for IoU itself to be negative, however, if, for example, you subtract intersection in the formula instead of dividing then you would get a negative IoU that would propagate to negative precision and recall values, ultimately influencing mAP calculations. In addition to incorrect formulas, an offset prediction box could produce the same behavior. If there are no predicted boxes and the algorithm assumes that there are, the division would be by 0 and you'd see NAN or infinity, never a negative.

To understand the root cause, I'll outline the typical debugging process, complemented with code examples and explain what potential errors may be. I'll start with the IoU calculation, move to confidence thresholds, and then examine common data preparation issues that can contribute to the negative mAP.

**1. IoU Calculation and Implementation Flaws**

The Intersection over Union (IoU) is the fundamental component to evaluating object detection, measuring the overlap between a predicted bounding box and a ground truth bounding box. A high IoU signifies good detection; a low IoU indicates a weak one, or no detection. Incorrect IoU calculation implementations are often the origin of negative mAPs.

Consider this basic Python function for calculating the IoU:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_iou(box1, box2):
    """Calculates the Intersection over Union (IoU) of two bounding boxes.

    Args:
        box1: A list or tuple representing the first bounding box [x1, y1, x2, y2].
        box2: A list or tuple representing the second bounding box [x1, y1, x2, y2].

    Returns:
        The IoU value (float) between 0 and 1, or 0 if boxes do not overlap.
    """
    x1_1, y1_1, x2_1, y2_1 = box1
    x1_2, y1_2, x2_2, y2_2 = box2

    # Determine the (x, y)-coordinates of the intersection rectangle
    x_left = max(x1_1, x1_2)
    y_top = max(y1_1, y1_2)
    x_right = min(x2_1, x2_2)
    y_bottom = min(y2_1, y2_2)

    if x_right < x_left or y_bottom < y_top:
        return 0.0 # no overlap

    intersection_area = (x_right - x_left) * (y_bottom - y_top)

    box1_area = (x2_1 - x1_1) * (y2_1 - y1_1)
    box2_area = (x2_2 - x1_2) * (y2_2 - y1_2)

    iou = intersection_area / float(box1_area + box2_area - intersection_area)

    return iou
```

**Code Commentary:**

This `calculate_iou` function follows a standard implementation. However, errors can still creep in:

*   **Boundary Checks**: Incorrect `min`/`max` usage could lead to a negative `intersection_area`. This code guards against that, but an alternative implementation may not.
*   **Box Representation**: The function assumes bounding boxes are provided in `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` format. Incompatibility with other formats (like `[x1, y1, width, height]`) will cause issues. Ensure consistency with the bounding box format used during training and the evaluation process.
*   **Zero Areas**: Handling of zero-area bounding boxes (where `x1 == x2` or `y1 == y2`) needs to be explicit, often by returning 0. This is handled implicitly by the logic above, but if you calculate the area separately it's important.

**2. Confidence Thresholding and Mismatched Predictions**

After computing IoU, predicted bounding boxes are usually filtered based on a confidence score assigned by the model. This threshold dictates which predictions are considered "true" positives or false. An incorrect threshold (or no threshold at all) can have a profound impact on mAP. You must also be careful of cases where the model is detecting the background and assigns a low confidence, these may contribute as well.

Here's a snippet illustrating confidence filtering and the generation of true/false positive lists:

```python
def evaluate_detections(predictions, ground_truths, iou_threshold=0.5, confidence_threshold=0.5):
    """Evaluates object detections by comparing predictions to ground truths.

    Args:
        predictions: A list of tuples where each tuple represents a predicted bounding box with
                   format (image_id, class_id, confidence, x1, y1, x2, y2).
        ground_truths: A dictionary with image_ids as keys, where each key maps to a list of
                      ground truth bounding boxes with format (class_id, x1, y1, x2, y2).
        iou_threshold: The IoU threshold to consider a detection a true positive.
        confidence_threshold: The minimum confidence score for a prediction to be considered.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing true positive detections (list), false positive detections (list) and the total number of ground truth objects
    """
    true_positives = []
    false_positives = []
    total_ground_truths = 0

    for image_id, ground_truth_boxes in ground_truths.items():
        total_ground_truths += len(ground_truth_boxes)
        # Sort predictions for current image by confidence
        image_predictions = [p for p in predictions if p[0] == image_id]
        image_predictions.sort(key = lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

        # Keep track of ground truth boxes to avoid double counting
        used_ground_truths = [False]*len(ground_truth_boxes)
        for image_id, class_id, confidence, pred_x1, pred_y1, pred_x2, pred_y2 in image_predictions:
            if confidence < confidence_threshold:
              false_positives.append( (image_id, class_id, confidence, pred_x1, pred_y1, pred_x2, pred_y2) )
              continue;

            predicted_box = [pred_x1, pred_y1, pred_x2, pred_y2]
            best_iou = 0
            best_gt_index = -1
            for gt_index, (gt_class_id, gt_x1, gt_y1, gt_x2, gt_y2) in enumerate(ground_truth_boxes):
                if class_id == gt_class_id and not used_ground_truths[gt_index]:
                  gt_box = [gt_x1, gt_y1, gt_x2, gt_y2]
                  iou = calculate_iou(predicted_box, gt_box)
                  if iou > best_iou:
                      best_iou = iou
                      best_gt_index = gt_index

            if best_iou >= iou_threshold:
              true_positives.append((image_id, class_id, confidence, pred_x1, pred_y1, pred_x2, pred_y2))
              if best_gt_index >= 0:
                  used_ground_truths[best_gt_index]=True # Avoid double counting
            else:
              false_positives.append( (image_id, class_id, confidence, pred_x1, pred_y1, pred_x2, pred_y2) )

    return true_positives, false_positives, total_ground_truths
```

**Code Commentary:**

*   **Confidence Filtering**: Low confidence scores are filtered out before any IoU check is conducted. This is vital to ensure a realistic evaluation of the system. A default threshold may need to be adjusted depending on model confidence behavior.
*  **Ground Truth Matching:** The code ensures that each ground truth box is matched to at most one predicted box to avoid double-counting true positives.
*   **Double counting**. This code avoids double counting by keeping track of used ground truth boxes. Not doing so can lead to an incorrect value for precision.

**3. Data Format and Data Loading Issues**

Inconsistencies in data formats and loading are some of the most insidious sources of negative mAP. A data format that includes normalized values between 0 and 1, for example, must match with data that is un-normalized or values that are pixels on the image. Ensure that you are using the same format between predictions and ground truths. This is a common gotcha.

Here's an example of a simple routine that could cause problems if the labels and predictions are in different formats:

```python
import random

def generate_predictions(num_images = 5, num_detections_per_image = 3, classes=10, image_size = 640):
    """Generates random predictions for testing purposes.
    These are in format (image_id, class_id, confidence, x1, y1, x2, y2).
    """
    predictions = []
    for image_id in range(num_images):
        for _ in range(num_detections_per_image):
            class_id = random.randint(0, classes)
            confidence = random.random()
            x1 = random.randint(0,image_size)
            y1 = random.randint(0,image_size)
            x2 = random.randint(x1, image_size)
            y2 = random.randint(y1, image_size)

            predictions.append((image_id, class_id, confidence, x1, y1, x2, y2))
    return predictions


def generate_ground_truths(num_images = 5, num_ground_truths_per_image = 2, classes=10, image_size = 640):
    """Generates random ground truths for testing purposes.
    These are in format dict[image_id] = [(class_id, x1, y1, x2, y2) ]
    """
    ground_truths = {}
    for image_id in range(num_images):
      image_boxes = []
      for _ in range(num_ground_truths_per_image):
          class_id = random.randint(0, classes)
          x1 = random.random()
          y1 = random.random()
          x2 = random.random()
          y2 = random.random()

          image_boxes.append((class_id, x1, y1, x2, y2))
      ground_truths[image_id] = image_boxes
    return ground_truths

# Main:
predictions = generate_predictions()
ground_truths = generate_ground_truths()

true_positives, false_positives, total_ground_truths = evaluate_detections(predictions, ground_truths)

print(f"True Positives: {len(true_positives)}, False Positives: {len(false_positives)}, Total Ground Truths: {total_ground_truths}")
```

**Code Commentary:**

*   **Inconsistent Formats**: This code generates random data, but it showcases the importance of understanding the data types. The prediction generation generates pixel level data and the ground truths generate float data. This is a severe mismatch and will likely cause an issue.
*   **File Path Issues**: When handling real datasets, incorrect file paths to labels or images will cause problems during data loading and can lead to mAP scores of 0 or NaN. Ensure that these are accurate and that your code is reading labels correctly.
*   **Label Mismatches**: Label files should precisely match the predicted classes; any label mismatches or format errors lead to a negative mAP.

**Recommendations for Further Debugging**

*   **Dataset Analysis**: Thoroughly inspect a subset of your dataset annotations and predicted boxes.  Visualize them side-by-side to confirm correct bounding box coordinates.
*   **Logging**: Add detailed logging at each stage of the IoU calculation and matching process to capture any unexpected values or behavior. Be sure to log things before any thresholds are applied as well.
*   **Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests for your IoU calculations using several edge cases (e.g., non-overlapping boxes, exactly overlapping boxes, etc).
*  **Precision/Recall Curves**: If you are using a custom mAP calculator, check your calculation for precision and recall. These must be between 0 and 1.

**Summary**

Negative mAP scores are typically caused by inconsistencies in the format of your ground truth or predicted data, by flaws in IoU calculations or the matching of true/false positives, or by simple data loading issues. By carefully examining each stage of the evaluation pipeline, specifically double-checking the IoU function, confidence threshold settings, and data loading logic, it is possible to systematically find and resolve issues causing negative mAP scores. Attention to data format consistency, correct implementation of IoU calculations, and a careful check of your precision and recall is paramount in the evaluation of your object detection model.

To further deepen your understanding of evaluation metrics in object detection, I recommend reviewing papers and documentation on the COCO evaluation metric, or the original PASCAL VOC evaluation metric which are some of the most commonly used methodologies for evaluating object detectors. Research papers and educational blogs that focus on object detection evaluation metrics will also provide additional clarity.
