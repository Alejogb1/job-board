Pixel displacement after grid sampling in PyTorch requires a nuanced understanding of how `torch.nn.functional.grid_sample` interpolates input features based on a normalized grid. The crucial point is that the `grid` tensor passed to `grid_sample` isn't a direct coordinate map of pixel locations, but rather a normalized coordinate system ranging from -1 to 1 for each spatial dimension, irrespective of the input's actual pixel dimensions. I have encountered this directly in projects involving deformable convolutions and image transformations, where understanding this displacement mapping was essential for both debugging and feature analysis.

To determine the precise displacement of each pixel, we must first convert the normalized grid coordinates back to pixel coordinates within the input feature map. This involves reversing the normalization applied by PyTorch when interpreting the `grid` tensor. The following explains the process:

The `grid` tensor, with shape `(N, H_out, W_out, 2)` for 2D images, where N is batch size, H_out and W_out are the output height and width, and 2 indicates (x, y) coordinates, represents where to sample from the input. These values are normalized: (-1, -1) corresponds to the top-left corner of the input feature map, while (1, 1) corresponds to the bottom-right corner. The normalization is done relative to the input size, meaning the effective pixel locations are dependent upon the input image's dimensions. Therefore, the conversion from normalized grid coordinates (gx, gy) to pixel coordinates (px, py) within the input feature map (with input height H_in and input width W_in) can be expressed as:

px = ((gx + 1) * W_in -1) / 2
py = ((gy + 1) * H_in -1) / 2

This conversion effectively maps the normalized range [-1, 1] onto the input image's spatial dimensions. Let’s break this down. First, we translate the range from [-1, 1] to [0, 2] by adding 1. Next, we scale this range to match the original dimensions of the image which effectively stretches this range from [0, 2] to [0, 2W_in] for x or [0, 2H_in] for y. Finally, the -1 shifts the origin from the 0 index to -0.5 and the division by 2 then converts the final range from [0, 2W_in] to [0, W_in] and from [0, 2H_in] to [0, H_in] in a way that is indexed starting from 0, which aligns with PyTorch tensor indices. This operation is performed separately for x and y, resulting in pixel coordinates representing a continuous space, enabling interpolation. These pixel coordinates, often not integers, define the location within the input feature map from which interpolation is performed to generate output pixel values. Because the locations are not integers, it’s important to remember that grid_sample will interpolate using a specified method, typically bilinear.

Therefore, to obtain pixel displacements, you would compute pixel coordinates *before* applying grid_sample, and *after* grid_sample, then take the difference. This difference vector yields the displacement. The original pixel locations correspond to a grid of `x` from `0` to `W_in - 1` and `y` from `0` to `H_in - 1`.

Here are some Python code examples that illustrate this process, leveraging PyTorch:

**Example 1: Basic displacement for a single pixel**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def compute_pixel_displacement(input_height, input_width, grid):
    """Computes pixel displacement given an input size and normalized grid."""
    batch_size, output_height, output_width, _ = grid.shape
    grid_x = grid[:, :, :, 0]
    grid_y = grid[:, :, :, 1]

    # Calculate pixel coordinates in the input space
    px = ((grid_x + 1) * input_width - 1) / 2
    py = ((grid_y + 1) * input_height - 1) / 2

    # Pre grid_sampling pixel locations
    base_x = torch.arange(0, input_width, dtype=torch.float).reshape(1,1,-1).repeat(batch_size, output_height, 1)
    base_y = torch.arange(0, input_height, dtype=torch.float).reshape(1,-1,1).repeat(batch_size, 1, output_width)

    # This displacement is not actually based on the sampling location but the location of pixels in the output grid after warping
    displacement_x = px - base_x[:, :output_height, :output_width]
    displacement_y = py - base_y[:, :output_height, :output_width]
    return torch.stack((displacement_x, displacement_y), dim=-1)

# Example usage:
input_height = 5
input_width = 5
output_height = 3
output_width = 3

# Create a sample grid (using a simple transformation for illustration)
grid_x = torch.linspace(-1, 1, output_width)
grid_y = torch.linspace(-1, 1, output_height)
grid_xx, grid_yy = torch.meshgrid(grid_x, grid_y, indexing='xy')
grid = torch.stack((grid_xx, grid_yy), dim=-1).unsqueeze(0) # Batch size of 1

displacement = compute_pixel_displacement(input_height, input_width, grid)
print("Displacement shape: ", displacement.shape)
print("Displacement example at position (1, 1) of the output grid:", displacement[0,1,1])
```
In this example, the `compute_pixel_displacement` function converts the normalized grid to pixel coordinates using the formula discussed. Then base pixel coordinates are created. These differences become the final pixel displacement. The example illustrates the process for a single transformation example and shows the displacement of the single pixel at location (1, 1) of the output grid.

**Example 2: Applying to a feature map and then computing displacement**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def compute_pixel_displacement_from_sample(input_feature_map, grid):
    """Computes pixel displacement given input feature map and normalized grid."""
    batch_size, _, input_height, input_width = input_feature_map.shape
    _, output_height, output_width, _ = grid.shape

    grid_x = grid[:, :, :, 0]
    grid_y = grid[:, :, :, 1]

    # Calculate pixel coordinates in the input space based on grid sampling
    px = ((grid_x + 1) * input_width - 1) / 2
    py = ((grid_y + 1) * input_height - 1) / 2

    # Pre grid_sampling pixel locations
    base_x = torch.arange(0, input_width, dtype=torch.float).reshape(1,1,-1).repeat(batch_size, output_height, 1)
    base_y = torch.arange(0, input_height, dtype=torch.float).reshape(1,-1,1).repeat(batch_size, 1, output_width)

    # This displacement is not actually based on the sampling location but the location of pixels in the output grid after warping
    displacement_x = px - base_x[:, :output_height, :output_width]
    displacement_y = py - base_y[:, :output_height, :output_width]
    return torch.stack((displacement_x, displacement_y), dim=-1)

# Example usage:
batch_size = 2
input_channels = 3
input_height = 10
input_width = 10
output_height = 5
output_width = 5

# Create a sample input feature map
input_feature_map = torch.rand(batch_size, input_channels, input_height, input_width)

# Create a sample grid (using a simple random transformation for illustration)
grid = (torch.rand(batch_size, output_height, output_width, 2) * 2 - 1) # Normalized between [-1,1]

#Apply grid sample
output_feature_map = F.grid_sample(input_feature_map, grid, align_corners=True)

displacement = compute_pixel_displacement_from_sample(input_feature_map, grid)
print("Displacement shape: ", displacement.shape)
print("Displacement example at location (0, 2, 2) from batch 0:", displacement[0, 2, 2])
print("Displacement example at location (1, 3, 3) from batch 1:", displacement[1, 3, 3])

```
This example introduces a more realistic scenario. It first creates a sample input feature map, applies `grid_sample` using a random grid, and then computes pixel displacement for each position after the transformation. The output then shows an example of the displacement for both example batches.

**Example 3: Visualizing Displacement**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np


def compute_pixel_displacement_from_sample(input_feature_map, grid):
    """Computes pixel displacement given input feature map and normalized grid."""
    batch_size, _, input_height, input_width = input_feature_map.shape
    _, output_height, output_width, _ = grid.shape

    grid_x = grid[:, :, :, 0]
    grid_y = grid[:, :, :, 1]

    # Calculate pixel coordinates in the input space based on grid sampling
    px = ((grid_x + 1) * input_width - 1) / 2
    py = ((grid_y + 1) * input_height - 1) / 2

    # Pre grid_sampling pixel locations
    base_x = torch.arange(0, input_width, dtype=torch.float).reshape(1,1,-1).repeat(batch_size, output_height, 1)
    base_y = torch.arange(0, input_height, dtype=torch.float).reshape(1,-1,1).repeat(batch_size, 1, output_width)

    # This displacement is not actually based on the sampling location but the location of pixels in the output grid after warping
    displacement_x = px - base_x[:, :output_height, :output_width]
    displacement_y = py - base_y[:, :output_height, :output_width]
    return torch.stack((displacement_x, displacement_y), dim=-1)

# Example usage:
batch_size = 1
input_channels = 3
input_height = 20
input_width = 20
output_height = 20
output_width = 20

# Create a sample input feature map
input_feature_map = torch.rand(batch_size, input_channels, input_height, input_width)

# Create a sample grid (using a simple random transformation for illustration)
grid = torch.zeros((batch_size, output_height, output_width, 2))
grid[:,:,:,0] = torch.linspace(-1, 1, output_width) * 0.5 + torch.sin(torch.arange(0, output_height) / (output_height / (2 * np.pi))).reshape(-1, 1) * 0.2
grid[:,:,:,1] = torch.linspace(-1, 1, output_height) * 0.5 + torch.cos(torch.arange(0, output_width) / (output_width / (2 * np.pi))).reshape(1,-1) * 0.2

#Apply grid sample
output_feature_map = F.grid_sample(input_feature_map, grid, align_corners=True)

displacement = compute_pixel_displacement_from_sample(input_feature_map, grid)
displacement_x = displacement[0,:,:,0].detach().numpy()
displacement_y = displacement[0,:,:,1].detach().numpy()
# Plot as a vector field
x = np.arange(0, output_width)
y = np.arange(0, output_height)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
plt.quiver(X, Y, displacement_x, displacement_y, scale=20)
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
plt.xlabel("Output x Coordinate")
plt.ylabel("Output y Coordinate")
plt.title("Displacement Field Visualization")
plt.show()
```
This example visualizes the displacement field using Matplotlib. A sine and cosine wave is used for the grid warping, which then generates a displacement field that is plotted using quiver. This example provides insight into how grid warping results in different displacements in the output feature map.

For further understanding of grid sampling and relevant topics within computer vision, I would recommend exploring resources discussing concepts like deformable convolutions, thin-plate splines (as they are used in image warping), and more broadly, image resampling methods. Texts and tutorials focusing on the theory of image transformations can provide crucial insight into the operations happening behind the scenes in functions like `grid_sample`. Additionally, examining the source code for libraries that implement image manipulation operations can solidify conceptual knowledge and build a practical understanding. These resources often contain explanations of how interpolation and resampling work in practice, providing a solid foundation for understanding pixel displacement.
