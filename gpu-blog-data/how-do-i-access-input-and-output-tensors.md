Accessing input and output tensors within a PyTorch network requires understanding the model's forward pass and utilizing PyTorch's tensor manipulation capabilities.  My experience debugging complex, multi-GPU training pipelines for large-scale image recognition models has highlighted the crucial role of precise tensor access for monitoring model behavior, implementing custom loss functions, and performing gradient-based analysis.  Directly accessing these tensors isn't always straightforward, particularly in scenarios involving modules with multiple inputs or outputs.  The core principle rests on leveraging hooks and the `register_forward_hook` and `register_backward_hook` methods.

**1.  Explanation:**

PyTorch's `nn.Module` provides the fundamental building block for neural networks.  The forward pass, defined by the `forward` method within a custom module or through the composition of existing modules, determines the network's computational flow.  Input tensors are passed into the `forward` method as arguments, while output tensors are returned from it.  However, accessing intermediate tensors requires a different strategy. This is where hooks come in.

Hooks are functions that are called at specific points during the forward or backward pass of a module.  They provide a mechanism to intercept and manipulate tensors before or after they pass through a given module.  `register_forward_hook` allows attaching a function that will execute after a module's forward pass is complete, providing access to the input and output tensors of that specific module.  Similarly, `register_backward_hook` provides access to gradients during the backward pass.  Crucially, these hooks provide access to tensors *within* the computational graph, allowing inspection and manipulation without breaking the automatic differentiation capabilities of PyTorch.

The function passed to `register_forward_hook` receives three arguments: the module, the input tensor(s) (a tuple), and the output tensor(s) (a tuple).  Careful handling of these tuples, especially for modules with multiple inputs or outputs, is crucial. The function should not modify the input or output tensors in-place, as this can lead to unpredictable behavior and disrupt the computational graph. Instead,  it should perform operations on copies or utilize the information within these tensors for logging, analysis, or manipulation of other parts of the network.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Accessing Input and Output Tensors of a Single Linear Layer:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Initialize model and input
model = MyLinear(10, 5)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Register a forward hook
def hook_fn(module, input, output):
    print("Input tensor shape:", input[0].shape)  # Accessing input tensor
    print("Output tensor shape:", output.shape)    # Accessing output tensor
    # Further processing of input and output tensors can be added here
    return None # Returning None is crucial to avoid altering the graph


hook = model.linear.register_forward_hook(hook_fn)

# Perform forward pass
output_tensor = model(input_tensor)

# Remove the hook after use (good practice)
hook.remove()
```

This example demonstrates a simple hook function accessing input and output tensors of a single linear layer.  The `hook_fn` prints the shape information.  Removing the hook after use prevents potential memory leaks or unexpected behavior in subsequent computations.


**Example 2: Handling Multiple Inputs and Outputs:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x1, x2):
        out1 = self.linear1(x1)
        out2 = self.linear2(x2)
        return out1, out2


# Initialize model and inputs
model = MyNetwork()
input1 = torch.randn(1, 10)
input2 = torch.randn(1, 5)


# Register hook to access multiple outputs
def hook_fn_multiple(module, input, output):
    print("Input tensor shapes:")
    for i in input:
        print(i.shape)
    print("Output tensor shapes:")
    for o in output:
        print(o.shape)
    return None

hook = model.linear2.register_forward_hook(hook_fn_multiple)

# Perform forward pass
output1, output2 = model(input1, input2)

hook.remove()
```

This example showcases the handling of multiple inputs and outputs.  Note how the hook function iterates through the tuples `input` and `output` to access each tensor's shape.  This adaptability is crucial when working with more intricate architectures.


**Example 3:  Accessing Intermediate Activations for Analysis:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import numpy as np

class MyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x

model = MyNetwork()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)

#Hook to capture ReLU output for analysis
def activation_analysis_hook(module, input, output):
    activation_values = output.detach().cpu().numpy() #detach from computation graph for analysis
    #Perform analysis e.g., compute the percentage of zeros
    zero_percentage = np.mean(activation_values==0)
    print(f"Percentage of zero activations: {zero_percentage}")
    return None

hook = model.relu.register_forward_hook(activation_analysis_hook)

output_tensor = model(input_tensor)

hook.remove()

```

This example demonstrates accessing an intermediate activation (ReLU output) to perform a specific analysis, namely, determining the percentage of zero activations.  The `detach()` method creates a copy that is separated from the computational graph, avoiding unnecessary computations during analysis.  This approach highlights the power of hooks for examining the internal behavior of your models.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation,  a well-structured deep learning textbook focusing on PyTorch implementation, and a practical guide to PyTorch for production environments are excellent resources.  Furthermore, reviewing example code from published research papers that utilize similar architectures can provide invaluable insights.  Familiarization with NumPy for tensor manipulation outside the PyTorch graph is also beneficial.
