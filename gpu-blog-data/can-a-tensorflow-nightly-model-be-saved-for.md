The core issue with attempting to load a TensorFlow nightly build model into a TensorFlow 2.2.0 environment stems from the inherent instability and evolving nature of nightly builds.  Nightly builds incorporate the latest developments, often including breaking changes and experimental features not yet fully integrated into stable releases.  Therefore, direct compatibility is not guaranteed, and attempting such loading often results in errors. My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects over the past five years has consistently highlighted this challenge.  While certain elements might be compatible, reliance on this assumption is risky and can lead to significant debugging time.

**1. Explanation of Compatibility Issues:**

TensorFlow's architecture, particularly its saving and loading mechanisms, undergoes modifications between releases.  A nightly build might utilize internal data structures, function signatures, or serialization formats that are different from those present in TensorFlow 2.2.0. These discrepancies manifest in several ways:

* **Version Mismatch Errors:** The most common issue is a straightforward version incompatibility detected during the `tf.saved_model.load` process.  The loader identifies discrepancies in the model's metadata, indicating that it was generated with a different TensorFlow version and refusing to proceed.

* **Function Definition Discrepancies:** Custom functions or layers defined within the nightly build model might employ functionalities introduced after the 2.2.0 release. These functions may no longer exist or have significantly altered signatures, leading to `AttributeError` or `NameError` exceptions during execution.

* **Serialization Format Changes:** TensorFlow's internal representation of models can change between releases. The nightly build might use a newer serialization protocol that the 2.2.0 version of `tf.saved_model` is unable to parse. This can lead to cryptic errors related to deserialization failures.

* **Dependency Conflicts:** Nightly builds often incorporate experimental dependencies or updated versions of existing libraries.  These dependencies may conflict with the dependencies installed within the TensorFlow 2.2.0 environment, leading to import failures or runtime crashes.

Attempting to resolve these incompatibilities through ad-hoc modifications is extremely difficult and prone to further errors.  The optimal solution is to retrain the model using TensorFlow 2.2.0.  This guarantees compatibility and eliminates the inherent risks associated with using nightly builds in production environments.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential scenarios and their outcomes.  I've included error handling for demonstration, although in a production setting, more robust exception handling would be necessary.

**Example 1:  Simple Model Loading Failure**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    model = tf.saved_model.load("nightly_model")  # Assuming "nightly_model" is the saved model
    print("Model loaded successfully.")
    # Further operations with the model
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Import Error: {e}.  Check TensorFlow version compatibility.")
except OSError as e:
    print(f"OS Error: {e}. Check if the saved model file exists and is accessible.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```

This example demonstrates a basic attempt to load a model.  The `try-except` block is crucial for handling potential errors.  Import errors often indicate version mismatches. OS errors signify file access problems.


**Example 2:  Function Definition Mismatch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    model = tf.saved_model.load("nightly_model")
    model.my_custom_layer(tf.constant([1.0])) # Example custom layer
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"AttributeError: {e}. Check if the custom layer definition is compatible.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

Here, a custom layer (`my_custom_layer`) is called. If this layer's definition differs between the nightly build and 2.2.0, an `AttributeError` will likely occur because the loaded model doesn't contain the expected function.


**Example 3:  Handling potential Keras layer incompatibility**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    model = tf.saved_model.load("nightly_model")
    model.summary() # check model architecture
    # Verify specific layer exists and is usable
    layer_name = 'my_specific_layer'
    if layer_name in [layer.name for layer in model.layers]:
        specific_layer = model.get_layer(layer_name)
        #Perform operations with specific_layer.  This would fail if the layer doesn't exist or is incompatible
        print(f"Layer '{layer_name}' found and accessible")
    else:
        print(f"Layer '{layer_name}' not found in the loaded model")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

This example highlights the importance of inspecting model architecture. If a custom layer used in the nightly build is removed or altered in a later version, it may lead to a failure.  This example demonstrates how to check for a specific layer's existence and handle it accordingly.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is paramount.  Specifically, the sections detailing model saving and loading, versioning, and the intricacies of the `tf.saved_model` API are crucial for understanding the underlying mechanics.  Furthermore, review the release notes for TensorFlow 2.2.0 and any subsequent releases relevant to your nightly build's timeframe. This will shed light on the changes introduced that might cause incompatibilities.  Finally, leverage the TensorFlow community forums and Stack Overflow for insights into similar challenges faced by other developers.  Careful examination of error messages is crucial for pinpointing the precise source of the problem.  Understanding the interplay between different TensorFlow versions and their respective dependencies is key to avoiding future issues.
