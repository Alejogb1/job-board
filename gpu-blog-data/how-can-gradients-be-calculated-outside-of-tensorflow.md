Understanding how to calculate gradients outside of TensorFlow’s automatic differentiation framework is critical for scenarios demanding fine-grained control, optimization of memory resources, or integration with legacy systems. Manually deriving and implementing gradients, while often more complex, grants a profound understanding of the underlying mechanics of backpropagation and unlocks possibilities not readily available with pre-built libraries.

The core challenge lies in applying the chain rule from calculus iteratively across the computational graph that represents a given function. When forward propagating data through the function, we need to simultaneously maintain a trace of each operation’s partial derivative with respect to its inputs. These partial derivatives then form the basis for backward propagating the gradient, accumulating the derivatives appropriately along the computational path. This process requires explicit management of these derivatives and the associated computational graph.

Let’s start with a fundamental example: a simple scalar function, f(x) = x². Here, the forward pass involves computing x², and the derivative, which is 2x, needs to be computed in the forward pass and retained for backward propagation. This is a straightforward case since the graph is shallow.

```python
import numpy as np

class ScalarFunction:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = None
        self.dx = None  # Stores partial derivative w.r.t x

    def forward(self, x):
        self.x = x
        output = x * x
        self.dx = 2 * x
        return output

    def backward(self, dout):
      # dout is the derivative of the loss with respect to this node's output
        dx_final = dout * self.dx
        return dx_final

# Example usage:
func = ScalarFunction()
x_value = 3.0
forward_output = func.forward(x_value)
print(f"Forward Output: {forward_output}")  # Output: 9.0

dout = 1.0 # Assume a loss of L and derivative dL/df(x) is 1.0
gradient = func.backward(dout)
print(f"Gradient dL/dx: {gradient}") # Output: 6.0
```

This example illustrates the structure of a basic function class that stores the input and partial derivative during the forward pass, then employs that information during the backward pass using the chain rule. The `dout` value, here assumed to be 1.0, would actually come from upstream layers in a larger network. The key step is that during the backward pass the derivative of the output of this node with respect to it's input, `self.dx` which was calculated during the forward pass, is multiplied by the gradient of the loss with respect to the output of this node, `dout`. This `dout` value has been passed through from the next layer by backpropagation.

Now consider a slightly more complex function involving multiple operations: f(x, y) = x * y + x². We need to create a separate class for each of the operations: multiplication and addition. This is essential for tracking derivatives of operations that have more than one input.

```python
import numpy as np

class Multiply:
    def __init__(self):
      self.x = None
      self.y = None
      self.dx = None # Partial derivatives w.r.t x
      self.dy = None  # Partial derivatives w.r.t y

    def forward(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        output = x * y
        self.dx = y
        self.dy = x
        return output

    def backward(self, dout):
        dx_final = dout * self.dx
        dy_final = dout * self.dy
        return dx_final, dy_final

class Add:
    def __init__(self):
       self.x = None
       self.y = None

    def forward(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        return x + y

    def backward(self, dout):
        dx_final = dout
        dy_final = dout
        return dx_final, dy_final

class Square:
    def __init__(self):
      self.x = None
      self.dx = None

    def forward(self, x):
        self.x = x
        output = x * x
        self.dx = 2 * x
        return output

    def backward(self, dout):
        dx_final = dout * self.dx
        return dx_final

# Example usage: f(x, y) = x * y + x²
x_value = 2.0
y_value = 3.0

multiply_op = Multiply()
square_op = Square()
add_op = Add()

# Forward pass
mult_output = multiply_op.forward(x_value, y_value)
square_output = square_op.forward(x_value)
final_output = add_op.forward(mult_output, square_output)
print(f"Forward Output: {final_output}") #Output: 10.0

# Backward pass
dout = 1.0 # Assume dL/df(x,y) = 1.0
dmult, dsquare = add_op.backward(dout)
dx_sq = square_op.backward(dsquare)
dx_mult, dy_mult = multiply_op.backward(dmult)

dx = dx_sq + dx_mult #Accumulate the derivative of x
dy = dy_mult # Derivative with respect to y only passed through multiply node

print(f"Gradient dL/dx: {dx}") # Output: 7.0 (x*y + x**2 => 1*y + 2x = 3 + 4 = 7)
print(f"Gradient dL/dy: {dy}") # Output: 2.0 (x*y + x**2 => x = 2)
```

In this more complex example, we see that each operation stores the intermediate values needed to calculate the partial derivatives in it's forward pass, which are used in the backward pass. It is crucial to propagate the gradient through the graph in reverse order, which requires accumulating the derivatives of `x` since it was present in two operations. The `dout` is then split into contributions for each input, using the appropriate partial derivatives that were calculated during the forward pass.

Finally, let’s consider a basic matrix multiplication example. Matrix multiplication requires a slightly more sophisticated approach to handle the shapes correctly. Instead of single scalars, each parameter is now a matrix.

```python
import numpy as np

class MatrixMultiply:
    def __init__(self):
      self.A = None
      self.B = None

    def forward(self, A, B):
        self.A = A
        self.B = B
        return np.dot(A, B)


    def backward(self, dout):
        dA = np.dot(dout, self.B.T)
        dB = np.dot(self.A.T, dout)
        return dA, dB

# Example usage
A_matrix = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
B_matrix = np.array([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

matmul = MatrixMultiply()

#Forward Pass
output = matmul.forward(A_matrix, B_matrix)
print(f"Forward Output:\n {output}")
# Output: [[19. 22.] [43. 50.]]

dout = np.ones_like(output) #Assume all outputs have a gradient of 1

dA, dB = matmul.backward(dout)
print(f"Gradient dL/dA:\n {dA}")
print(f"Gradient dL/dB:\n {dB}")
# Output dL/dA: [[13. 15.] [13. 15.]]
# Output dL/dB: [[ 4.  6.] [ 4.  6.]]
```

The matrix multiplication backward pass involves the transposition of the matrices and dot products. This example showcases how the gradient of matrix multiplication is dependent on the transpose of the other input. The key here is that the chain rule still applies, but the partial derivatives are matrices. When backpropagating the gradient, we must perform matrix multiplications that conform to the required dimensions. Note that a loss function that sums all of the elements of a matrix is assumed here to generate the upstream gradient.

Implementing gradients manually, as seen in these examples, requires a detailed understanding of the chain rule and partial derivatives. The computational graph must be explicitly maintained as a series of operations where each operation knows how to compute its own partial derivatives. Furthermore, for complex neural networks, one must manage the accumulation of gradients through backpropagation and handle the tensor shapes correctly to prevent dimensional errors.

For additional study I would recommend focusing on calculus textbooks that cover vector calculus and the chain rule in depth. Resources explaining the mathematical foundations of backpropagation will also prove beneficial. Exploring literature on implementations of deep learning frameworks can also be useful.  Finally, working through various examples of backpropagation from scratch in an iterative fashion will be most impactful for building an intuitive understanding of the mechanics of manual gradient calculation.
