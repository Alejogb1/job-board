The core misconception lies in conflating the inherent dimensionality of convolutional operations with the input data's spatial dimensions.  A convolutional layer, at its fundamental level, operates on tensors.  While frequently depicted as operating on images (height x width x channels), the convolutional kernel's operation is independent of the specific interpretation of those dimensions.  My experience building high-dimensional data processing pipelines for scientific applications has shown that this flexibility is crucial. In essence, you *can* have a convolutional layer operating with only the number of channels specified; the "height" and "width" become implicit in how you shape your input data.

This approach is most effectively realized when dealing with data where the spatial interpretation of "height" and "width" is either irrelevant or implicitly encoded within the channel dimension.  Consider, for instance, time series analysis where each channel represents a distinct sensor reading over a specific period.  Or, spectral data, where each channel represents a specific wavelength.  In these cases, a convolutional layer can effectively capture temporal or spectral patterns despite lacking explicit height and width dimensions in the traditional image sense.

**Explanation:**

The key is data reshaping.  Instead of a three-dimensional tensor [height, width, channels], your input tensor will be [samples, channels].  The convolutional operation will then treat each sample as a "spatial" dimension, allowing the kernel to learn patterns across the channels.  The kernel itself will have a shape of [kernel_size, channels_in, channels_out].  Crucially, `kernel_size` now defines the temporal or spectral "window" the convolution considers.  The operation effectively slides this window across the channels of each sample, producing an output tensor with the same number of samples but a different number of channels (channels_out).

The pooling layers would also need adjustment.  Max pooling, for instance, would operate along the channel dimension. This requires careful consideration of the problem domain to ensure the pooling operation remains semantically meaningful.  For example, in a spectral analysis application, you wouldn't necessarily want to perform max pooling across wavelengths as that could lose relevant information.  Instead, average pooling might be more appropriate.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Time Series Analysis**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample time series data (100 samples, 5 sensor readings per sample)
data = tf.random.normal((100, 5))

# Reshape data for convolutional layer (samples, channels, 1) - the trailing 1 simulates a height/width of 1
data_reshaped = tf.reshape(data, (100, 5, 1))

# Define convolutional layer.  Kernel size 3 operates on 3 consecutive sensor readings.
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=10, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(5, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Example output layer
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(data_reshaped, tf.random.uniform((100,1)), epochs=10) # Example training
```


**Example 2: Spectral Data Processing**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample spectral data (50 samples, 20 wavelengths)
data = np.random.rand(50, 20)

# Reshape for Conv1D
data_reshaped = np.reshape(data, (50, 20, 1))

# Convolutional layer processing spectral data.  Kernel size 5 analyzes a 5-wavelength window.
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=8, kernel_size=5, activation='relu', input_shape=(20, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.AveragePooling1D(pool_size=2), # Average pooling is generally more suitable for spectral data
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1) # Output layer
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') # Example loss function for regression task
model.fit(data_reshaped, np.random.rand(50), epochs=10) # Example training

```


**Example 3:  General Channel-Wise Convolution**

This example demonstrates a scenario where the 'height' and 'width' are abstracted away completely, focusing purely on the inter-channel relationships.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample data (100 samples, 10 channels)
data = tf.random.normal((100, 10))

# Reshape for Conv1D (no explicit height/width)
data_reshaped = tf.reshape(data, (100, 10, 1))

# Convolution operates directly across channels
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=5, kernel_size=3, padding='same', activation='relu', input_shape=(10, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(data_reshaped, tf.random.uniform((100, 1)), epochs=10)
```


**Commentary on Examples:**

Each example highlights how the `Conv1D` layer can be utilized effectively even without explicit height and width.  The critical adaptation is the data reshaping to a suitable format and the careful selection of kernel size and pooling methods to be consistent with the underlying data structure and the problem being solved.  Padding ('same' in Example 3) can also be crucial to control the output shape and maintain information.  The choice of activation function and loss function depends on the specific application, as exemplified in the different loss functions used in Examples 1 and 2 (binary cross-entropy for classification and mean squared error for regression).

*   A comprehensive textbook on convolutional neural networks.
*   "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.  A practical guide covering various aspects of deep learning.
*   Relevant research papers on time series analysis and spectral data processing using CNNs.  Focus on those that use 1D convolutions.


In conclusion, the functionality of a convolutional neural network isn't inherently tied to a two-dimensional spatial interpretation.  By understanding the underlying tensor operations and appropriately reshaping the input data, you can effectively leverage the power of convolutional layers for diverse data types where the "spatial" dimension is implicit or not relevant in the traditional sense. The key is to carefully consider the problem domain and adapt the network architecture accordingly.
