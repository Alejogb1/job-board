The crucial aspect of implementing separate LSTM layers for distinct tasks within a multi-task PyTorch model lies in managing the independent parameter updates and preventing unwanted information flow between the specialized LSTM units dedicated to each task.  Failing to properly isolate these layers can lead to catastrophic interference, where the model's performance on one task negatively impacts its performance on others.  My experience developing a multi-modal sentiment analysis system reinforced this understanding. I observed significant performance degradation when using shared LSTM weights across emotion (joy, sadness, anger) detection tasks.  Proper separation and selective parameter updates were paramount to success.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core strategy involves creating distinct LSTM modules for each task.  These modules maintain their own weights, biases, and internal state.  The input data is fed independently to each LSTM; the outputs are then processed through task-specific dense layers.  While the initial embedding layers might be shared (if appropriate for the data), maintaining independent LSTM layers is essential for preventing interference.  The training process must then be carefully managed to update the parameters of each LSTM and its associated layers independently.  This can be achieved through distinct loss functions for each task and an aggregate loss (e.g., a weighted sum) to optimize the overall model performance.  Backpropagation then appropriately adjusts the weights for each task.  This contrasts with methods that share LSTM layers across tasks, which can lead to suboptimal results.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Multi-Task LSTM with Separate Layers**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MultiTaskLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dims):
        super(MultiTaskLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.lstm1 = nn.LSTM(input_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dims[0])  # Task 1
        self.lstm2 = nn.LSTM(input_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dims[1])  # Task 2

    def forward(self, x):
        # Task 1
        out1, _ = self.lstm1(x)
        out1 = out1[:, -1, :] # Take last hidden state
        out1 = self.fc1(out1)

        # Task 2
        out2, _ = self.lstm2(x)
        out2 = out2[:, -1, :] # Take last hidden state
        out2 = self.fc2(out2)

        return out1, out2

# Example usage
input_dim = 100
hidden_dim = 50
output_dims = [2, 3] # 2 classes for Task 1, 3 for Task 2
model = MultiTaskLSTM(input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dims)
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 10, 100)  # Batch size 32, sequence length 10
output1, output2 = model(input_tensor)
print(output1.shape, output2.shape)
```

This example demonstrates two separate LSTMs, `lstm1` and `lstm2`, each followed by its task-specific fully connected layer (`fc1` and `fc2`).  The `forward` method processes the input `x` independently through each LSTM branch.  Note the use of `batch_first=True` which is essential for efficient processing of batched data. The last hidden state is taken, this choice depends on the task.  Alternatives include using attention mechanisms or pooling across the entire sequence.

**Example 2: Shared Embedding, Separate LSTMs**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MultiTaskLSTMSharedEmbedding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, output_dims):
        super(MultiTaskLSTMSharedEmbedding, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm1 = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dims[0])
        self.lstm2 = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dims[1])

    def forward(self, x):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        out1, _ = self.lstm1(embedded)
        out1 = out1[:, -1, :]
        out1 = self.fc1(out1)
        out2, _ = self.lstm2(embedded)
        out2 = out2[:, -1, :]
        out2 = self.fc2(out2)
        return out1, out2

# Example Usage
vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 100
hidden_dim = 50
output_dims = [2, 3]
model = MultiTaskLSTMSharedEmbedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, output_dims)
input_tensor = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (32, 10)) # Batch of sequences of indices
output1, output2 = model(input_tensor)
print(output1.shape, output2.shape)
```

This example demonstrates sharing an embedding layer (`embedding`) across tasks but maintaining separate LSTM and fully connected layers for each task.  This is a common approach when dealing with text data, where the embedding layer learns a common representation for words used across tasks.

**Example 3: Handling Variable-Length Sequences with Packed Sequences**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.utils.rnn as rnn_utils

class MultiTaskLSTMPacked(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dims):
        super(MultiTaskLSTMPacked, self).__init__()
        self.lstm1 = nn.LSTM(input_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dims[0])
        self.lstm2 = nn.LSTM(input_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dims[1])

    def forward(self, x, lengths):
        # Pack padded sequences
        packed_x = rnn_utils.pack_padded_sequence(x, lengths, batch_first=True, enforce_sorted=False)
        # Process packed sequences through LSTMs
        packed_out1, _ = self.lstm1(packed_x)
        packed_out2, _ = self.lstm2(packed_x)
        # Unpack sequences
        out1, _ = rnn_utils.pad_packed_sequence(packed_out1, batch_first=True)
        out2, _ = rnn_utils.pad_packed_sequence(packed_out2, batch_first=True)
        # Take last hidden state for each sequence
        out1 = out1[torch.arange(out1.size(0)), lengths - 1, :]
        out2 = out2[torch.arange(out2.size(0)), lengths - 1, :]
        out1 = self.fc1(out1)
        out2 = self.fc2(out2)
        return out1, out2

#Example Usage
input_dim = 100
hidden_dim = 50
output_dims = [2, 3]
model = MultiTaskLSTMPacked(input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dims)
input_tensor = torch.randn(32, 15, 100) # Example with variable-length sequences
lengths = torch.randint(5, 16, (32,)) #Sequence Lengths for each sequence in the batch.
output1, output2 = model(input_tensor, lengths)
print(output1.shape, output2.shape)
```

Example 3 demonstrates how to handle variable-length sequences using PyTorch's `pack_padded_sequence` and `pad_packed_sequence` functions. This is crucial for real-world applications where input sequences often have different lengths.  Note the `enforce_sorted=False` parameter, enabling flexibility in sequence ordering.
