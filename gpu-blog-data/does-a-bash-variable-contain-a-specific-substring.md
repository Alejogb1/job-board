A common requirement in shell scripting involves determining if a particular substring exists within a Bash variable. I’ve encountered this situation frequently while managing server configurations and automating deployments, particularly when validating input data or parsing log files. The straightforward approach utilizes Bash's built-in string manipulation capabilities, primarily through the `[[ ... ]]` conditional expression and its associated operators. There are multiple techniques for achieving this, each with its strengths and nuances, and understanding them is crucial for robust and efficient scripting.

Fundamentally, the `[[ ... ]]` construct, being a more modern and powerful alternative to the older `[ ... ]` test, provides the necessary mechanisms. We are not strictly limited to exact string matching but can leverage pattern matching, including wildcards and regular expressions. This flexibility makes `[[ ... ]]` superior for this specific task. Crucially, the substring itself does not necessarily need to be a fixed string; it can also be a variable, which often occurs when checking against user-defined parameters or programmatically extracted values.

The simplest check involves using the `*` wildcard within the `[[ ... ]]` conditional. This allows us to test if the variable contains the substring anywhere within it. For example, if we want to see if a variable `FILE_PATH` contains the string "config," we would use `[[ "$FILE_PATH" == *config* ]]`. The asterisks function as wildcards, matching any character sequence before and after “config”. This method is easy to read and works well for simple checks. However, it's essential to note that this utilizes globbing patterns and not regular expressions.

An alternative, and often preferred method, relies on the `=~` operator which enables regular expression matching within `[[ ... ]]`. While the wildcard technique suffices for basic substring inclusion tests, regular expressions provide greater control, allowing us to match specific patterns or enforce location requirements (such as beginning or ending substrings). A regular expression check would look like `[[ "$FILE_PATH" =~ config ]]`. Notably, when using the `=~` operator, the pattern to the right of the operator is interpreted as a regular expression and does not use globbing.

Another method, less commonly used for simple inclusion tests but valuable in other contexts, is the `grep` command. When dealing with variables, we can pipe the variable’s value to `grep` and check its exit status. A zero exit status indicates that the substring was found, a non-zero status indicates that it was not. This approach might be chosen when, for example, we're already using `grep` to search files, or if we need to utilize `grep`'s full feature set.

Here are three illustrative examples.

**Example 1: Basic Wildcard Substring Check**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

FILE_PATH="/home/user/project/config.ini"
SUBSTRING="config"

if [[ "$FILE_PATH" == *"$SUBSTRING"* ]]; then
  echo "The file path contains the substring: $SUBSTRING"
else
  echo "The file path does not contain the substring: $SUBSTRING"
fi

FILE_PATH="/home/user/project/data.txt"

if [[ "$FILE_PATH" == *"$SUBSTRING"* ]]; then
  echo "The file path contains the substring: $SUBSTRING"
else
    echo "The file path does not contain the substring: $SUBSTRING"
fi
```

*Commentary:* This script first assigns a value to `FILE_PATH` and `SUBSTRING`. It then uses the wildcard method, `== *"$SUBSTRING"*`, within the `[[ ... ]]` to check if `FILE_PATH` contains `SUBSTRING`. It outputs a corresponding message based on the result. Subsequently, the value of `FILE_PATH` is changed, and the process is repeated to exemplify how the check works when the substring isn't present, highlighting the conditional logic. The use of double quotes ensures proper handling of spaces and other special characters that might be present in the variable value. The core focus is demonstrating the syntax for basic inclusion using wildcards and an explicit variable substring.

**Example 2: Regular Expression Substring Check**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

FILE_PATH="test_configuration_123.cfg"
SUBSTRING="[0-9]+"

if [[ "$FILE_PATH" =~ $SUBSTRING ]]; then
  echo "The file path contains at least one number."
else
    echo "The file path does not contain any numbers."
fi

FILE_PATH="test_configuration.cfg"

if [[ "$FILE_PATH" =~ $SUBSTRING ]]; then
  echo "The file path contains at least one number."
else
    echo "The file path does not contain any numbers."
fi
```

*Commentary:* This example uses the `=~` operator to perform a regular expression check. Instead of a simple substring, we are now searching for the pattern `[0-9]+` within the `FILE_PATH`, which translates to "one or more digits". The variable `SUBSTRING` contains this regular expression, allowing dynamic matching. It demonstrates the power of regular expressions for identifying complex patterns within strings. It showcases how the regex is used to find a sequence of digits and prints an according message. Changing the input string to one without digits shows how it correctly detects no match. This exemplifies the application of regular expression matching for substring identification using `=~`.

**Example 3: Using Grep for Substring Check**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

MESSAGE="This is a log message with an error code: ERR123."
SUBSTRING="ERR[0-9]+"

if echo "$MESSAGE" | grep -q "$SUBSTRING"; then
  echo "The log message contains an error code."
else
    echo "The log message does not contain an error code."
fi

MESSAGE="This is a log message without any errors."

if echo "$MESSAGE" | grep -q "$SUBSTRING"; then
    echo "The log message contains an error code."
else
    echo "The log message does not contain an error code."
fi

```

*Commentary:* This script demonstrates the usage of `grep` for substring detection. First, the variable `MESSAGE` is piped to `grep`. The `-q` option suppresses output, making `grep` return an exit status only. Again, the substring to search for is provided as a variable, in this case a regular expression string pattern which looks for an `ERR` followed by one or more digits. This method is useful when we need `grep`'s advanced pattern matching capabilities or if we are already using `grep` for other tasks within the script. The second part demonstrates a message that does not contain the error code to highlight that `grep` correctly identifies if there's no match. This is an alternative to using the built-in features of bash’s `[[ ]]`, where `grep` becomes the actual logic for evaluating if a match exists.

For further investigation, the Bash documentation itself should always be the first stop. The `man bash` command on a Unix-like system provides a thorough explanation of all Bash constructs, including the `[[ ... ]]` conditional, its operators, and regular expression matching. Additionally, resources which focus on shell scripting best practices can provide context on efficient usage, security considerations and common pitfalls when using regular expressions within shell scripts. Finally, understanding the basics of regular expression syntax is critical for anyone using the `=~` operator or `grep` with patterns. Regular expression tutorials are readily available online, which helps to build a solid base for pattern matching with strings.
