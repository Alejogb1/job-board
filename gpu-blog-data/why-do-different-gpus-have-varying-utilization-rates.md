GPU utilization discrepancies when processing identical datasets stem fundamentally from differing architectural characteristics and driver optimizations, not solely raw compute power.  In my experience optimizing deep learning workloads across diverse hardware, I've observed that seemingly minor architectural variations can significantly impact parallel processing efficiency, resulting in fluctuating utilization percentages even with identical input data.

**1. Architectural Differences and their Impact on Utilization:**

The core reason for varying utilization lies in the internal architecture of the GPU.  While raw specifications like CUDA core count or memory bandwidth provide a high-level overview, crucial details like the memory hierarchy (cache sizes and bandwidths), interconnect topology (NVLink vs. PCIe), and the specific implementation of instruction scheduling units drastically affect performance.  Consider two GPUs with similar CUDA core counts: one might possess a more sophisticated L2 cache system, leading to fewer memory accesses and higher occupancy (the percentage of active CUDA cores).  This improved cache efficiency translates to reduced data transfer overhead and thus higher utilization, even when dealing with the same dataset.  Conversely, a GPU with a less efficient memory subsystem will experience more frequent memory stalls, resulting in lower utilization despite performing the same computations.  The interconnect topology also influences performance:  NVLink offers significantly higher bandwidth than PCIe, minimizing data transfer bottlenecks between GPUs in multi-GPU configurations.  This architectural advantage can lead to substantial utilization improvements in parallel processing scenarios.

Furthermore, the microarchitecture –  the specific design of the individual processing units (SMs or Streaming Multiprocessors) – plays a critical role.  Variations in instruction scheduling, register allocation, and warp divergence handling significantly influence the overall throughput.  A GPU with a superior instruction scheduler can better manage concurrent tasks, leading to higher utilization rates compared to a GPU with a less sophisticated scheduler, even under identical workloads.  Differences in the design of memory controllers and their interaction with the processing units also contribute to utilization differences.  A more efficient memory controller can minimize latency and improve data throughput, increasing overall utilization.

**2. Driver Optimization and its Role:**

GPU drivers are not mere conduits for transferring instructions; they are sophisticated pieces of software that heavily influence performance.  Different GPUs may have varying levels of driver maturity and optimization, impacting their efficiency in handling specific tasks and datasets.  A well-optimized driver for a specific GPU architecture can significantly improve utilization by effectively managing resources, optimizing memory access patterns, and handling concurrency issues.  In my experience, using a driver that's not optimized for a particular GPU can lead to significantly lower utilization rates compared to a fully-optimized counterpart. This is especially pertinent when dealing with libraries such as CUDA or OpenCL, where the driver's ability to translate and execute code efficiently directly impacts the GPU's performance.  Out-of-date or poorly-maintained drivers can fail to fully leverage the hardware's capabilities, leading to lower utilization.  This often manifests as higher memory latency, increased thread divergence, and ultimately reduced core occupancy.

**3. Code Examples Demonstrating Utilization Discrepancies:**

The following examples illustrate how different GPUs might handle the same code with varying levels of utilization, highlighting the impact of architecture and driver optimization:

**Example 1: Matrix Multiplication (CUDA)**

```c++
// CUDA kernel for matrix multiplication
__global__ void matrixMultiply(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int width) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (row < width && col < width) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int k = 0; k < width; ++k) {
            sum += A[row * width + k] * B[k * width + col];
        }
        C[row * width + col] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    // ... (Data initialization, memory allocation, kernel launch) ...
    // Measure GPU utilization here using CUDA profiling tools (nvprof)
    // ... (Data retrieval, memory deallocation) ...
    return 0;
}
```

This simple matrix multiplication kernel will demonstrate different utilization levels on various GPUs due to differences in memory access patterns and the efficiency of the underlying hardware. A GPU with a larger and faster shared memory will likely exhibit higher utilization than one with a smaller shared memory, due to reduced global memory accesses.

**Example 2: Image Processing (OpenCL)**

```c++
// OpenCL kernel for image filtering
__kernel void imageFilter(read_only image2d_t input, write_only image2d_t output) {
    int2 coord = {get_global_id(0), get_global_id(1)};
    // ... (Image filtering operation) ...
}

int main() {
    // ... (Context and command queue creation, kernel compilation) ...
    // Enqueue the kernel to the command queue for execution.
    // Measure GPU utilization using OpenCL profiling tools (clGetDeviceInfo with CL_DEVICE_PROFILING_TIMER_RESOLUTION)
    // ... (Data retrieval, cleanup) ...
    return 0;
}
```

Here, the utilization differences are influenced by the GPU's ability to efficiently handle the texture operations inherent in image processing.  A GPU with dedicated texture units and optimized texture sampling mechanisms will likely demonstrate higher utilization.  Variations in the implementation of memory accesses within the image processing kernel can also lead to utilization discrepancies across different GPUs.

**Example 3: Deep Learning Inference (TensorFlow/PyTorch)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.load_model("my_model.h5")
# Assuming 'data' contains your input data
predictions = model.predict(data)
```

Even using high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, underlying hardware limitations will still influence utilization.   Different GPUs may exhibit different levels of parallelism and memory bandwidth during the inference phase, leading to varying utilization percentages. Using tools like NVIDIA's Nsight Compute, the utilization of various GPU units can be profiled and analyzed. Differences might stem from the efficiency of TensorFlow's or PyTorch's back-end handling of matrix operations on a specific GPU architecture, influenced by driver support.

**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For in-depth understanding, I recommend exploring GPU architecture documentation from manufacturers, studying advanced parallel programming concepts (including memory management and thread scheduling), and utilizing GPU profiling tools to analyze performance bottlenecks.  Furthermore, consulting research papers on GPU optimization techniques can provide valuable insights.

In conclusion,  GPU utilization variation, when processing the same data, is a multi-faceted issue not solely dictated by raw specifications.  Architectural nuances, driver optimization levels, and the specifics of the implemented code significantly impact the extent to which the GPU's processing capabilities are fully utilized.  Through careful analysis and the application of appropriate optimization techniques, one can minimize these discrepancies and enhance overall performance.
