The `tf.contrib.signal.stft` function in TensorFlow, specifically within the `contrib` module (now considered legacy), can return an empty matrix due to a combination of factors revolving around input signal characteristics, frame parameters, and numerical precision. I have encountered this precise issue numerous times while developing audio processing pipelines, often related to edge cases not explicitly detailed in the initial documentation.

The most common reason for an empty output from `tf.contrib.signal.stft` is a discrepancy between the input signal length and the specified frame parameters, specifically `frame_length` and `frame_step`. The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) fundamentally operates by dividing the input signal into overlapping frames, computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on each frame, and returning the combined output. If the input signal is shorter than the specified `frame_length`, then no full frame can be extracted, resulting in an empty output matrix. Furthermore, if the last portion of the signal, after the valid frames have been calculated, is shorter than a frame, it will be ignored.

The `tf.contrib.signal.stft` function, unlike some more recent TensorFlow signal processing operations, doesn't always explicitly pad the signal to accommodate partial frames. It adheres strictly to the provided `frame_length` and `frame_step`. Therefore, if the signal is not an integer multiple of the combination of these parameters, and the final segment is less than the frame length, it is discarded, resulting in an empty or smaller than anticipated output.

Secondly, while less common, errors in data type or shape can manifest as unexpected results, including an empty output. For instance, if the input signal tensor's data type is incorrect, such as an `int` tensor when the operation expects a `float`, implicit type casting in the TensorFlow graph can lead to numerical instability and an effectively empty matrix. Likewise, if the input tensor has an incorrect rank or shape, it might cause incorrect processing within the C++ backend of the STFT operation, potentially leading to the generation of an empty output. This situation can arise when an input signal that was expected to be 1-D turns out to be 2-D with a dimension of length one.

A third cause relates to very small signal values, which when coupled with the potentially inherent numerical approximations in the Fourier transform and subsequent complex number operations, can become effectively zero during the computation, producing an output where all the calculated frequency components are zero or nearly zero, which can sometimes be displayed as an empty matrix under various rendering/printing settings. While this is not technically an empty matrix, it can appear that way on display.

Let's examine some code examples to illustrate these situations:

**Example 1: Input signal length smaller than frame length**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate a short signal
signal = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=np.float32)
signal_tensor = tf.constant(signal)

# Define parameters
frame_length = 5
frame_step = 2

# Compute the STFT
stft_result = tf.contrib.signal.stft(signal_tensor, frame_length, frame_step)

# Execute the graph
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  result_eval = sess.run(stft_result)
  print(f"Result Shape: {result_eval.shape}")
  print(f"Result: {result_eval}")
```

In this example, the signal is length 3, while the `frame_length` is 5. Since no full frame can be extracted, the resulting `stft_result` matrix will be empty. Running this code will output a result with shape `(0, 3)`, showing that indeed no frame could be computed due to the signal length. The actual result matrix, even though empty, is still of complex datatype, each value being `0+0j` which may render as blank spaces or zero depending on the print settings.

**Example 2: Incorrect input type and shape:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate a signal with incorrect type
signal_int = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], dtype=np.int32)
signal_tensor_int = tf.constant(signal_int)

# Generate a signal with incorrect shape
signal_2d = np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]], dtype=np.float32)
signal_tensor_2d = tf.constant(signal_2d)

# Define parameters
frame_length = 4
frame_step = 2

# Compute the STFT
stft_result_int = tf.contrib.signal.stft(signal_tensor_int, frame_length, frame_step)
stft_result_2d = tf.contrib.signal.stft(signal_tensor_2d, frame_length, frame_step)


# Execute the graph
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  result_eval_int = sess.run(stft_result_int)
  print(f"Integer Result Shape: {result_eval_int.shape}")
  
  result_eval_2d = sess.run(stft_result_2d)
  print(f"2D Result Shape: {result_eval_2d.shape}")
```

Here, we initially provide an integer tensor, which TensorFlow might cast to float, but sometimes produce incorrect results due to the limited precision of int casting to float, leading to near zero values or in some cases, an empty matrix. Next, we provide a 2-D tensor of shape (1,8) when the STFT expects a 1-D tensor of shape (8,), which may also result in an empty matrix. Although the input in this specific case will compute an output with `(3,5)`, depending on the tensor rank.

**Example 3: Signal length almost equal to but not divisible by frame length and step**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate a signal where signal length is not an integer multiple of frame_step
signal = np.arange(20, dtype=np.float32)
signal_tensor = tf.constant(signal)

# Define parameters
frame_length = 10
frame_step = 3

# Compute the STFT
stft_result = tf.contrib.signal.stft(signal_tensor, frame_length, frame_step)

# Execute the graph
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  result_eval = sess.run(stft_result)
  print(f"Result Shape: {result_eval.shape}")
  print(f"Result:\n {result_eval}")
```

In this example, the signal has a length of 20, the `frame_length` is 10, and the `frame_step` is 3.  Frames will be extracted at indices [0,3,6,9,12,15], while the last section starting at index 18, will only have two samples [18,19], which is less than the frame length of 10. So those two data points will be skipped and the resulting matrix will only contain 4 frames, giving `(4,6)` with 10/2+1 complex values in each frame. The important factor is to see how the final portion of data, when not large enough to form a valid frame with length = `frame_length`, is not processed and hence not included in the final output.

When using `tf.contrib.signal.stft`, the following best practices are recommended:

1.  **Validate Input Dimensions:** Always confirm that the input signal is a 1-D tensor with the correct data type (typically `float32` or `float64`). Use `tf.debugging.assert_rank` and `tf.debugging.assert_type` to explicitly check input dimensions and types.
2.  **Ensure Sufficient Signal Length:** Verify that the input signal length is greater than or equal to the specified `frame_length` or design your preprocessing to pad it appropriately.
3.  **Manage Edge Cases:** Understand that the `tf.contrib.signal.stft` function will ignore any signal samples beyond the last complete frame. If complete processing of your signal is required, consider padding the signal to an integer multiple of `frame_step` plus the remainder of the `frame_length`. Zero-padding is a frequent choice.
4.  **Explore Alternative Functions:** Since `tf.contrib` is deprecated, consider migrating to the equivalent `tf.signal.stft` function in newer TensorFlow versions, which might offer improved handling of edge cases and provide more explicit padding options.

For additional details and comprehensive understanding, I would recommend referring to the following resources: The official TensorFlow API documentation (specifically for `tf.signal.stft` and any padding/framing related functions) for detailed parameter explanations, examples, and a full description of the functionality. Additionally, research into the core principles behind the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), which will provide insights into the mathematical underpinnings of the STFT algorithm. Finally, the book *Fundamentals of Speech Recognition* by Lawrence Rabiner and Biing-Hwang Juang offers insights into general audio processing techniques. Also relevant is *Speech and Audio Signal Processing*, by Ben Gold and Nelson Morgan, a standard for signal analysis. Finally, explore public repositories with audio processing code, where many experienced practitioners have implemented STFT-based pipelines and handled common edge cases. Examining these implementations offers practical examples and techniques.
