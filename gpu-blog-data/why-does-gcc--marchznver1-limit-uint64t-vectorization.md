The performance impact of `-march=znver1` on `uint64_t` vectorization stems directly from the architectural capabilities and limitations of AMD's first-generation Zen microarchitecture, specifically its 128-bit wide SIMD units and associated instruction set. Zen, denoted by `znver1` in GCC, lacks direct hardware support for 512-bit or even 256-bit vector operations on general-purpose registers, and the compiler's strategy for emulating wider vectors using multiple 128-bit operations often falls short of achieving optimal performance with 64-bit integers.

Fundamentally, when compiling for a target that directly supports a wide vector instruction set like AVX-512, operations on `uint64_t` can be processed in parallel using 512-bit registers. This dramatically increases throughput. However, when compiling for `znver1`, the compiler must adapt to the hardware constraints of 128-bit wide SIMD registers, primarily the XMM registers. While Zen does support 256-bit AVX registers (YMM), these are not utilized for optimal 64-bit integer vector operations in most cases, as they often require additional moves and shuffles, negating much of the expected performance gain.

The core issue arises when attempting to vectorize operations on `uint64_t` with these limitations. For operations like additions, multiplications, and bitwise operations, the compiler must split a 64-bit integer vector into multiple 128-bit XMM register operations. This process incurs extra overhead in terms of register moves, shuffles, and increased instruction count. This is in contrast to targets that feature native 256-bit (AVX2) or 512-bit (AVX-512) registers for integer vector processing where the compiler can more easily map higher data width operations to single or fewer wide register instructions, achieving greater parallelism.

Consider the following synthetic function operating on a `uint64_t` array:

```c
void add_arrays(uint64_t *a, uint64_t *b, uint64_t *c, size_t size) {
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}
```

If we compile this with `-march=znver1` using a fairly recent version of GCC (e.g., GCC 12 or later), we observe that it will often be vectorized utilizing 128-bit SIMD instructions operating on pairs of 64-bit integers (effectively a vector of two `uint64_t` elements). The compiler leverages SSE2/SSE4 instructions to implement the addition in parallel on these pairs. While vectorized, it does not achieve the potential throughput of processing four or eight `uint64_t` values in parallel as might be achieved on architectures featuring larger vector registers.

Here is a disassembly snippet (simplified for clarity) illustrating this, assuming a loop unrolling factor of two (based on a `-O2` or higher optimization level) taken from compiler explorer with target `znver1`:

```assembly
.L3:
   movdqa xmm0, [rsi+r11*8]  // Load 2 * uint64_t from a into xmm0
   movdqa xmm1, [rdi+r11*8]  // Load 2 * uint64_t from b into xmm1
   paddq xmm0, xmm1          // Add 2 * uint64_t pairs in xmm0
   movdqa [rdx+r11*8], xmm0  // Store 2 * uint64_t to c
   add r11, 2              // Increment loop counter by 2
   cmp r11, r10            // Compare against limit
   jl .L3                   // Jump if less
```

Notice the usage of `movdqa` (move double quadword aligned) to load 128 bits and `paddq` to add 128-bit vectors of 64-bit integers. This is limited to two 64-bit values in parallel due to `znver1` not natively supporting wider operations on 64-bit integer vectors without resorting to a complex sequence of multiple 128-bit SIMD instructions.

Now, contrast this with a compilation for a target with AVX2 capabilities using `-march=haswell` (for illustrative purposes):

```assembly
.L3:
  vmovdqa ymm0, [rsi+r10*8]   // Load 4 * uint64_t from a into ymm0
  vmovdqa ymm1, [rdi+r10*8]   // Load 4 * uint64_t from b into ymm1
  vpaddq ymm0, ymm0, ymm1     // Add 4 * uint64_t pairs in ymm0
  vmovdqa [rdx+r10*8], ymm0    // Store 4 * uint64_t to c
  add r10, 4                // Increment loop counter by 4
  cmp r10, r11              // Compare against limit
  jl .L3                    // Jump if less
```

Here, the `vmovdqa` (vector move double quadword aligned) and `vpaddq` (vector add quadword) operations are utilizing 256-bit YMM registers, enabling four `uint64_t` operations in a single instruction and effectively doubling the throughput compared to the `znver1` example.

Finally, consider a more complex example involving a bitwise operation and conditional logic:

```c
void process_arrays(uint64_t *a, uint64_t *b, uint64_t *c, size_t size) {
  for (size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
     if (a[i] > 10) {
       c[i] = a[i] & b[i];
     } else {
       c[i] = a[i] | b[i];
     }
  }
}
```

Compilation with `-march=znver1` will again be limited to processing pairs of `uint64_t` at a time using XMM registers. The conditional logic will likely result in masked operations or a sequence of conditional moves to accommodate the different execution paths. The vectorization effort becomes more complex and often less efficient due to the need for branch emulation using vector masks and other conditional move instructions within the 128-bit SIMD context, which will include packing, unpacking, and potentially multiple operations for each condition. In contrast, a target with larger registers and AVX-512 can utilize more advanced mask registers to efficiently handle such conditional operations directly on wider vector registers, minimizing the overhead.

The performance disparity is not solely due to the limitations of the hardware itself. The compiler's code generation is also influenced by the specified target architecture, and while GCC attempts to optimize the vectorized code as best it can within these constraints, the need to work with narrower registers ultimately imposes a performance bottleneck. Future architectures like Zen 2 and beyond addressed this limitation through various approaches including improved instruction set support and wider internal data paths, allowing better vectorization strategies for larger integer types.

To understand the intricacies of how SIMD capabilities affect code performance, resources providing in-depth discussions of CPU microarchitectures, instruction set architectures (ISAs) for various processors and instruction encodings are invaluable. Additionally, documentation on compiler intrinsics and compiler optimization strategies would further clarify the impact of target architecture settings on vectorization efficiency. Intel's optimization guides and similar resources from AMD often include detailed sections on microarchitectural features, including information on how instruction width impacts performance. Lastly, experimentations using compiler explorers or similar tools, where the source code can be compiled for different targets and inspected, is a valuable approach to see the immediate effect of different architecture targets on compiled code.
