Redis key disappearance, particularly soon after addition, often stems from a confluence of factors directly related to eviction policies, data types, and server configurations, not necessarily an inherent instability in the database itself. My experience managing high-throughput applications backed by Redis has highlighted these areas repeatedly. A key symptom is rapid, seemingly inexplicable data loss of recently created keys. This is rarely indicative of underlying corruption or critical software defects, but instead, it almost always points to a misconfiguration or an overlooked operational detail within the Redis environment or client application.

One of the primary drivers of this behavior is the configured eviction policy. By default, when Redis reaches its `maxmemory` limit, it begins to discard keys based on this pre-set policy. This safeguard prevents Redis from exhausting server resources, ultimately causing a crash. These policies encompass actions like `noeviction` which blocks write operations upon reaching the memory limit, `allkeys-lru` which evicts the least recently used key across all keys, `volatile-lru` evicts the least recently used key with an expiration set, and other related variations based on random selection, TTL, or other parameters. If the application creates keys without setting appropriate expirations in a system running with a policy that permits eviction, it’s highly probable that a new key might be evicted if the memory limit is reached and it falls under the criteria of the selected policy. This is especially true if the application has a high volume of writes and reads or is storing significant volume of data in memory. I recall one incident where a caching layer used an incorrect eviction policy, causing cached data to vanish rapidly under load.

A secondary, but no less important, consideration is the choice of Redis data type. While string key-value pairs are fundamental, more complex data types like sets, lists, hashes, and sorted sets have unique characteristics impacting memory usage and potential volatility. An unexpectedly large list, or a hash map with numerous fields, can quickly consume memory, pushing the system closer to `maxmemory` limitations and triggering evictions sooner than anticipated. Furthermore, an incorrect API call could lead to accidental modification or deletion of a key, which sometimes can be difficult to trace without detailed logging. If `SET` command is used with an existing key, it overwrites the old value, potentially causing the effect of disappearing key if you have not stored that original value elsewhere.

Expiration mechanisms also play a part. Redis allows for setting expiry times on keys using commands like `EXPIRE` and `SETEX`. An aggressively short expiration could create an illusion of key disappearance. If keys are being created with unexpectedly low TTLs (time to live), they might vanish before the application has a chance to access them. A key might expire correctly within the normal behavior of the database, but from the application point of view it can be perceived as a disappearance of recently added key. I have personally made that mistake when testing TTL functionality with very low values for debugging and forgetting to raise them when switching to production environment.

Finally, server-side configurations beyond the eviction policy can influence key behavior. Issues related to replication or cluster configurations could result in disparities between different nodes in a clustered Redis environment. If a write is made to one node but the replication process fails, or there’s a partitioning problem, that data might not propagate to all nodes, causing apparent inconsistencies. This could also happen due to network issues between client and server or between Redis instances in a cluster. These are typically harder to pinpoint and requires closer monitoring of Redis instance logs, and underlying infrastructure.

Here are three code examples demonstrating potential causes of key disappearance, and the steps that you can use to troubleshoot them:

```python
# Example 1: Incorrect Expiration (Python with redis-py)
import redis

r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Set a key with a very short expiration (1 second)
r.setex('mykey', 1, 'myvalue')

# Attempt to get the key after a short delay
import time
time.sleep(2)
value = r.get('mykey')

if value:
    print(f"Key found: {value.decode()}")
else:
    print("Key not found (expired)")

# Explanation: The key will likely be unavailable due to the
# short expiration time of 1 second. Verify the use of `SETEX` or `EXPIRE`
# operations in your application and confirm the expiry value is appropriate.
```

In this first example, the `SETEX` command is used to set a key with an expiry time of 1 second. When the key is retrieved after a delay of two seconds, it is not found due to expiry, simulating the disappearance of a recently added key. This demonstrates how very short expiration times can create the illusion of data loss.

```python
# Example 2: Eviction under memory pressure (Python with redis-py)
import redis

r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Assuming maxmemory is small enough for demonstration
# Ensure maxmemory is configured for eviction on the Redis server
# Example: maxmemory 1mb in redis.conf

# Fill Redis with enough data to reach the maxmemory limit (example)
for i in range(10000):
    r.set(f"key_{i}", "some_value" * 100)  # create many keys with value

# Add a new key (this might be evicted under certain policies)
r.set('new_key', 'new_value')

# Attempt to retrieve this newly added key
new_value = r.get('new_key')
if new_value:
    print(f"New key value: {new_value.decode()}")
else:
    print("New key not found (evicted)")

# Explanation: If the server reaches `maxmemory`, the 'new_key' might
# be evicted based on the configured policy. Check Redis configuration for
# the eviction policy used with `config get maxmemory-policy` and `config get maxmemory`.
```

Here, I use the code to rapidly fill the Redis database with a large number of key-value pairs. After that, I am adding a `new_key`. The likelihood of `new_key` being evicted depends on how much data you're inserting into the server, and if the server has reached maxmemory limit. I encourage you to test this example to observe the behavior in your environment. I used this code to recreate similar issues in a development environment.

```python
# Example 3: Data type misuse/overwrite (Python with redis-py)
import redis

r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Store the initial key and value.
r.set('data_key','original_data')
print(f"Initial key value: {r.get('data_key').decode()}")

# Use SET command to overwrite an existing key (unintentionally)
r.set('data_key', 12345) # This overwrites original value
print(f"Overwritten key value: {r.get('data_key').decode()}")

# Explanation: This illustrates how an accidental overwriting of
# the value can be interpreted as key disappearance. Monitor usage of
# the SET command especially within complex logic where you might inadvertently overwrite existing keys.
```
In the final example, I have used the `SET` command to overwrite existing key's value. While technically the key has not disappeared, the original data is not longer available under that key, which can be perceived as disappearance of the key if the application was not expecting that behavior. Ensure your usage of the `SET` command considers that possible overwrite.

For further investigation and monitoring, I would recommend consulting the official Redis documentation on memory management and eviction policies. Resources like the Redis command reference and tutorials covering common operational patterns are very helpful in building a deeper understanding of the tool. Review of server configurations using `CONFIG GET` command to inspect parameters related to `maxmemory`, `maxmemory-policy`, and `timeout`, is also necessary. Monitoring tools that track Redis usage and performance, such as RedisInsight, is incredibly beneficial. Logs created by Redis server can provide more detailed information, and they can help identify potential misconfigurations or server-side issues. These resources, in my experience, provide the most crucial information for identifying and preventing these key disappearing issues. Careful monitoring, code review, and a clear understanding of Redis' operational mechanics are essential for preventing data loss in production environments.
