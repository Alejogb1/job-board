Generating large datasets is often more memory-efficient than loading entire datasets into memory, especially in machine learning. However, the need to split this dynamically generated data into training and testing sets poses a unique challenge, as we aim to avoid materializing the full dataset as a dense array. This response details techniques to achieve this division while leveraging the generator paradigm and its inherent memory benefits.

When working with generators, we don't have random access to the data. Instead, data is yielded sequentially. This prevents directly indexing into a dataset as you would with a NumPy array or a Pandas DataFrame. To address this, we must approach the problem by introducing a mechanism to conditionally route each generated data point into either the training or testing set based on a deterministic rule without losing the advantages of a memory-efficient stream. This is often achieved using a splitting criterion. This criterion must be consistent throughout the generation process, so the composition of training and testing data is representative of the overall data distribution.

The fundamental idea is to incorporate a deterministic split based on some inherent feature within the generated data or on an externally available counter or hash. This avoids the need to store the generated data in a single container before performing the split. This allows us to maintain the stream-like property of the generator and avoid memory bottlenecks when dealing with large data.

Let's consider several ways to approach this, beginning with a random split based on a hash. This approach assigns each generated sample to either the training or test set probabilistically.

**Code Example 1: Hashed Split**

```python
import hashlib

def generate_data(num_samples):
  """Example generator simulating data production."""
  for i in range(num_samples):
    yield {"id": str(i), "data": i * 2}

def hashed_split(data_generator, split_ratio=0.8):
    """Splits a generator based on a hash of the id."""
    training_set = []
    testing_set = []

    for item in data_generator:
        hash_value = int(hashlib.sha256(item["id"].encode()).hexdigest(), 16)
        if (hash_value % 100) / 100 < split_ratio:
          training_set.append(item)
        else:
          testing_set.append(item)

    return training_set, testing_set

if __name__ == '__main__':
  data_gen = generate_data(1000)
  training, testing = hashed_split(data_gen)
  print(f"Training set size: {len(training)}")
  print(f"Testing set size: {len(testing)}")
```
In this example, we use the `id` field of our yielded data to generate a hash. This hash is then used to make a deterministic decision of where to place the given data point. We map the hash to a 0 to 1 range then use this value to determine whether the data should be in the training or test set, according to `split_ratio`. It is crucial to use a hashing algorithm with good distribution properties; the default Python `hash()` function is unsuitable for this purpose as it is not designed to be consistent across program runs. The `hashlib` library ensures consistent outputs across runs. The use of `sha256` with hexadecimal conversion yields an effectively random distribution for the split decision.  Note that this example collects the samples into lists for ease of demonstration; for true memory efficiency, you would process each training and test split independently without the need to store the full sample in memory at any single time.

For cases where we have more structure to our generated data, we can split based on some specific feature. For example, if we're generating synthetic patient records, we might want to split based on the patient ID.

**Code Example 2: Split on Feature**
```python
import random

def generate_patient_data(num_patients, samples_per_patient):
    for patient_id in range(num_patients):
      for sample_num in range(samples_per_patient):
        yield {"patient_id": patient_id, "reading": random.uniform(50,150)}


def feature_split(data_generator, split_feature="patient_id", split_ids = None):
  """Splits a generator based on patient ID."""
  training_set = []
  testing_set = []
  if split_ids is None:
     # For example, split the first 80% of patients to training
     unique_ids = set(item[split_feature] for item in data_generator)
     split_size = int(len(unique_ids) * 0.8)
     split_ids = list(unique_ids)[:split_size]
     data_generator = generate_patient_data(100, 10)
  for item in data_generator:
    if item[split_feature] in split_ids:
        training_set.append(item)
    else:
        testing_set.append(item)
  return training_set, testing_set

if __name__ == '__main__':
    data_gen_patient = generate_patient_data(100, 10)
    training_patient, testing_patient = feature_split(data_gen_patient)
    print(f"Patient Training set size: {len(training_patient)}")
    print(f"Patient Testing set size: {len(testing_patient)}")
```
In this second example, `feature_split` first calculates the set of unique patient IDs from the data generator (only the first iteration is used for the patient IDs). The first `80%` of these IDs are selected for training. The generator is then created again to regenerate the data. This approach ensures all data associated with a specific patient is routed to a single split, which is important when you want to avoid data leakage from training to testing. By having the `split_ids` be a parameter, this ensures that the splitting criteria can be applied consistently to new generated data. While this avoids storing the entire dataset at once, one caveat is that the generator function has to be run multiple times which may be computationally costly depending on the data generation process.

Finally, a simpler split approach, especially when you have a very large set of data, can be done via modulus indexing over each element in the dataset.

**Code Example 3: Modulus Split**

```python
def modulus_split(data_generator, split_ratio=0.8):
  """Splits a generator based on modulus of a counter."""
  training_set = []
  testing_set = []
  i = 0
  for item in data_generator:
    if (i % 100) / 100 < split_ratio:
        training_set.append(item)
    else:
        testing_set.append(item)
    i += 1
  return training_set, testing_set

if __name__ == '__main__':
    data_gen_mod = generate_data(1000)
    training_mod, testing_mod = modulus_split(data_gen_mod)
    print(f"Modulus Training set size: {len(training_mod)}")
    print(f"Modulus Testing set size: {len(testing_mod)}")
```
In the third example, each yielded item is directed into either the training or testing set based on the modulus of the counter i. This is simpler than using a hash and quicker to compute for a very large dataset where you might not be able to process the dataset twice without memory constraint issues. However, this method introduces a positional dependence. With modulus indexing, training and testing data are interleaved. If there is any sequential trend in your generator, this approach could potentially bias your training and testing sets.

When choosing a method for splitting a generator's output, the key factor to consider is the structure of the generated data and the desired properties of the training and testing sets. If the generator produces data points in a random fashion, using a modulus index or hash provides a good choice. If it contains some groupings, it is better to use a feature-based split to avoid biased splits.

Resources focusing on data generators, including those found in Python's standard library (`collections.abc` and `itertools`), offer a deeper dive into efficient data processing without full materialization. Furthermore, studying data sampling and splitting techniques in machine learning textbooks provides necessary theoretical background. Finally, considering the performance of various hashing algorithms could lead to optimized solutions when a hash-based split is required.
