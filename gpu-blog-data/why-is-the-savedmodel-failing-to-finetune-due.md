The root cause of missing gradients during SavedModel finetuning often stems from a mismatch between the model's architecture as defined during training and how it's being utilized during the finetuning process.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous TensorFlow and PyTorch projects points towards several common culprits: improperly configured layers, incorrect variable scope management, and unintentional freezing of trainable parameters.  Let's systematically investigate these areas.

**1. Layer Mismatches and Incorrect Variable Sharing:**

A frequently encountered problem arises when the SavedModel's architecture doesn't perfectly align with the model architecture used for finetuning.  This can manifest in subtle ways, such as discrepancies in layer names, types, or even the order of layers.  If the finetuning process attempts to access layers that weren't saved within the SavedModel, or if it expects layers with different characteristics, the gradient computation will fail.  This is particularly true when dealing with custom layers or complex model structures.  I once spent a week tracing a seemingly inexplicable issue to a minor typo in the custom layer's name, leading to the optimizer failing to find the corresponding variables.

This issue is exacerbated by the lack of explicit variable scope control.  In TensorFlow, using `tf.compat.v1.variable_scope` (or its equivalent in newer versions) properly is crucial for clear variable management.  Without it, variables may unintentionally overwrite each other, leading to inconsistencies between training and finetuning.  Similarly, in PyTorch, ensuring correct module naming and organization within a `nn.Module` is paramount.

**2. Accidental Freezing of Trainable Parameters:**

During the finetuning stage, it's imperative that the intended layers are marked as trainable.  Unintentionally freezing layers – rendering them non-trainable – directly prevents gradient calculations for those parameters.  This can happen explicitly through methods like setting `requires_grad=False` in PyTorch or utilizing `tf.compat.v1.stop_gradient` in TensorFlow.  It can also happen implicitly if layers are accidentally excluded from the optimizer's parameter list.  A careless modification to the optimizer configuration, such as excluding a specific layer’s weights or biases from its parameter list, could be the culprit.

**3. Data Pipeline Inconsistencies:**

While less directly related to the model itself, issues with the data pipeline can indirectly lead to missing gradients.  Consider scenarios where the input data during finetuning doesn't match the data used during training, leading to unexpected input shapes or values.  This misalignment might trigger internal checks or numerical instability within certain layers, effectively preventing backpropagation.  Another frequent issue is incorrect data preprocessing; if the normalization, scaling, or augmentation strategies differ between training and finetuning, the model’s internal representations can change sufficiently to disrupt gradient flow.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1 (TensorFlow - Incorrect Layer Name):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Training
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', name='dense_1'), # Correct name
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='dense_2')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
model.fit(...)
tf.saved_model.save(model, 'my_model')

# Finetuning (Incorrect Layer Name)
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load('my_model')
new_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', name='dense_layer_1'), # Incorrect name!
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='dense_2')
])
# Gradients will be missing because 'dense_layer_1' doesn't match 'dense_1'
new_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
new_model.fit(...)
```

**Example 2 (PyTorch - Frozen Layers):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Training
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(784, 128),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(128, 10)
)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())
# ...Training loop...
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'my_model.pth')


# Finetuning (Layers Frozen)
loaded_model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(784, 128),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(128, 10)
)
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('my_model.pth'))
for param in loaded_model[0].parameters():  # Freezing the first layer!
    param.requires_grad = False
optimizer = optim.Adam(loaded_model.parameters()) # optimizer won't update frozen layers
# ...Finetuning loop...  Gradients will be missing for the first layer.
```

**Example 3 (TensorFlow - Incorrect Optimizer Configuration):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Training
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', name='dense_1'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='dense_2')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
model.fit(...)
tf.saved_model.save(model, 'my_model')

# Finetuning (Optimizer excluding layers)
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load('my_model')
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(clipnorm=1.0) # optimizer configuration
optimizer.minimize(lambda: loaded_model.layers[1](tf.ones([10, 64])), var_list=[loaded_model.layers[1].trainable_variables]) #only trains 2nd layer

# Gradients will be missing for the first layer because it's not included in var_list
loaded_model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy')
loaded_model.fit(...)
```


**Resource Recommendations:**

For more in-depth understanding of TensorFlow's variable scope and SavedModel mechanisms, consult the official TensorFlow documentation.  Similarly, the PyTorch documentation provides extensive details on modules, optimizers, and model saving.  Furthermore, studying advanced debugging techniques for deep learning frameworks is invaluable in pinpointing such issues.  Understanding the concept of computational graphs and how they relate to gradient calculations is crucial.  Finally, carefully reviewing examples of finetuning provided in the official documentation of the respective deep learning libraries will significantly aid understanding.
