The `kohonen` package in R, fundamental for Self-Organizing Map (SOM) implementation, is not part of the core R distribution and thus requires explicit installation before use. My experience over several projects, particularly in geospatial data analysis and customer segmentation, has highlighted the criticality of this step, often a stumbling block for newcomers to SOMs in R.

The primary method for installing packages in R relies on the `install.packages()` function. This function interacts with the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) or other repositories to download and install the specified package and its dependencies. Specifically for `kohonen`, we utilize this mechanism directly from CRAN, the primary repository for R packages.

The straightforward installation using `install.packages("kohonen")` assumes that your R environment is correctly configured to access CRAN. Common issues leading to installation failures typically involve network connectivity problems, firewall restrictions, or incorrect repository configurations. Occasionally, conflicts with existing packages or outdated R versions can interfere with the installation process. Before attempting installation, ensure that your R installation is current; this generally resolves many underlying dependency conflicts. If installing on a server, ensure that the system has write permissions in the appropriate R library location.

Once the `kohonen` package is installed, it must be explicitly loaded into your current R session using the `library()` function to make its functions and data structures available for use. Failure to do so will result in errors when attempting to call the package’s functions. This loading mechanism ensures that only the packages required for a given session are loaded, reducing memory footprint and avoiding potential conflicts between different libraries. It’s also worth noting that updating R can sometimes invalidate previously installed packages, necessitating reinstallation.

Let’s move to specific examples.

**Example 1: Basic Installation and Verification**

The initial step involves attempting to install `kohonen`. After installation, confirming its availability is essential.

```R
# Attempt to install the kohonen package
install.packages("kohonen")

# Load the kohonen package to confirm successful installation
library(kohonen)

# Check version and confirm load
packageVersion("kohonen")
```

In the first line, `install.packages("kohonen")` executes the installation process. This will download the package and its associated dependencies. Assuming this is successful, the output typically displays progress messages, including which packages have been downloaded and unpacked. It is possible that the installation will not succeed if any dependencies are missing and, if so, the console will display an error message stating the problematic dependency. In this case, the suggested strategy is to identify the missing dependency and install that first. Following successful installation, `library(kohonen)` loads the installed package into the current R session. If loaded successfully there will be no output from this command, if the package was not installed or if you typed the name incorrectly the console will display an error message. Finally, `packageVersion("kohonen")` retrieves the version number of the installed package, which confirms not only that the package is installed but also that it was loaded into the current environment. A failed install will result in errors in all subsequent commands.

**Example 2: Handling Installation Errors**

Suppose the installation fails, as occasionally happens due to network issues. The following demonstrates handling the potential issue.

```R
# Try installing kohonen, catch errors
tryCatch(
  {
    install.packages("kohonen")
    library(kohonen)
    cat("Package installed successfully.\n")
  },
  error = function(e) {
    cat("Error installing package:", conditionMessage(e), "\n")
    cat("Please check your network connection and try again.\n")
    #Additional error handling steps can be placed here if needed
    #For example, attempting a different mirror
    #install.packages("kohonen", repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
    }
)
```

In this case, a `tryCatch` block is utilized to gracefully manage installation errors. The `try` portion of the code includes the installation and loading of `kohonen`. Should either of these steps fail, the error message is captured by the `catch` portion. The `conditionMessage(e)` provides specific details about the nature of the error. Here I’ve also included a suggestion about a potential cause, network issues, and have commented out a way of specifying a particular mirror in case the default mirror is causing errors. This method ensures the program does not halt abruptly on encountering an installation issue and provides the user with guidance on troubleshooting the problem. This is particularly useful in automated scripts where user interaction is not possible.

**Example 3: Installing from a Different Repository**

In cases where the default CRAN mirror is unavailable or unstable, an alternate repository can be specified. I have previously experienced difficulties installing from certain locations, a strategy that was effective in circumventing problems.

```R
# Attempt installation from an alternate repository
tryCatch({
  install.packages("kohonen", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")
  library(kohonen)
    cat("Package installed from cloud successfully.\n")
  },
  error = function(e){
      cat("Failed to install from cloud, falling back to default.\n")
      install.packages("kohonen")
      library(kohonen)
  }
)

# Check package was installed
packageVersion("kohonen")
```

Here, the `install.packages` function is used with the `repos` argument to specify the cloud CRAN mirror rather than the default mirror (this would be the mirror that R was previously configured to use). This is one of many available mirror sites. In the `tryCatch` block, if the install from cloud fails, the code gracefully attempts install from the default mirror location before proceeding. Finally, to ensure the process completed successfully, the package version is output. The error handling code here again provides flexibility for automated scripts, especially when the availability of specific CRAN mirrors can vary depending on location or network configuration.

The R documentation offers extensive information about package management and is a primary source for resolving installation issues. The CRAN website itself provides a list of available mirrors which are helpful for specifying alternate locations when the default does not work. There is a wealth of user guides and tutorials provided by R’s vibrant online community, and these often contain specific troubleshooting steps related to package installation which, while not covering every edge case, often help to clarify issues. Finally, examining the output of error messages carefully often highlights the key problem (e.g. that a particular dependency is missing) and, through a systematic process of error management, facilitates successful installation of the `kohonen` package and others in R.
