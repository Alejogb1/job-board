Accessing the weights of a subclassed model in TensorFlow/Keras requires a nuanced understanding of the model's architecture and the framework's internal mechanisms.  My experience debugging complex neural networks, particularly those employing custom layers and intricate architectures, has highlighted the necessity of directly accessing the `trainable_variables` attribute.  Simply relying on pre-built functions or relying on assumptions about layer naming can lead to unexpected errors, especially when dealing with subclassed models where the layer structure isn't explicitly defined in the same manner as models built using the sequential or functional APIs.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core challenge in retrieving weights from a subclassed Keras model stems from the increased flexibility this approach offers.  Unlike the sequential or functional APIs where layers are explicitly added and named, subclassed models define their forward pass within a `call` method. This means the internal structure and variable naming are not inherently predefined, and relying on generic methods to access weights may prove unreliable.  Instead, a direct and robust approach necessitates leveraging the `trainable_variables` attribute of the model instance.  This attribute returns a list of all trainable variables within the model's graph, including weights and biases.  However, simply accessing this list doesn't directly provide information on *which* variable corresponds to *which* layer.  Careful consideration of the order of variables within the list, combined with knowledge of the model's architecture, is crucial for correct interpretation.

Furthermore, the structure of the weight tensors themselves should be anticipated.  Convolutional layers will have weight tensors representing the convolutional filters, followed by bias vectors. Dense layers will have a weight matrix and a bias vector.  Understanding the shape and dimensionality of these tensors is vital to properly interpreting the numerical values extracted.  Finally, it's crucial to distinguish between `trainable_variables` and `non_trainable_variables`.  The former includes weights that are updated during training; the latter encompass variables that remain fixed.  Depending on the objective, one might need to retrieve only the trainable variables or both trainable and non-trainable variables.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Subclassed Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(MyModel, self).__init__()
    self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
    self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

  def call(self, inputs):
    x = self.dense1(inputs)
    return self.dense2(x)

model = MyModel()
weights = model.trainable_variables

for i, weight in enumerate(weights):
  print(f"Weight {i+1}: Shape = {weight.shape}, Name = {weight.name}")

```

This example demonstrates a basic subclassed model with two dense layers.  The loop iterates through `trainable_variables`, printing the shape and name of each weight tensor. The name usually incorporates the layer name, enabling identification.


**Example 2: Model with Custom Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, units):
    super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
    self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
    self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='zeros', trainable=True)

  def call(self, inputs):
    return inputs + self.w + self.b


class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self):
    super(MyModel, self).__init__()
    self.custom_layer = MyCustomLayer(64)
    self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

  def call(self, inputs):
    x = self.custom_layer(inputs)
    return self.dense(x)

model = MyModel()
weights = model.trainable_variables

for i, weight in enumerate(weights):
  print(f"Weight {i+1}: Shape = {weight.shape}, Name = {weight.name}")
```

This example introduces a custom layer, emphasizing that the `add_weight` method within a custom layer correctly adds the weights to the `trainable_variables` list.  Observing the output shows how weights from the custom layer are integrated.

**Example 3:  Model with Multiple Input Branches**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu')
        self.dense3 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)


    def call(self, inputs):
        branch1 = self.dense1(inputs[0])
        branch2 = self.dense2(inputs[1])
        merged = tf.concat([branch1, branch2], axis=1)
        return self.dense3(merged)

model = MyModel()
input1 = tf.random.normal((10, 20))
input2 = tf.random.normal((10, 10))
model([input1,input2]) #This call is necessary for variable creation

weights = model.trainable_variables
for i, weight in enumerate(weights):
  print(f"Weight {i+1}: Shape = {weight.shape}, Name = {weight.name}")

```

This example shows a more complex model with multiple inputs.  This highlights the robustness of directly accessing `trainable_variables` even when the model's data flow isn't as straightforward.  Note the need to call the model with sample inputs *before* accessing `trainable_variables` to ensure variable creation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow/Keras documentation provides comprehensive guides on model subclassing, layer creation, and variable management.  Exploring the documentation on custom layers and the `tf.keras.Model` class is essential.  Additionally, reviewing the TensorFlow API reference for in-depth information on the specific functions and attributes mentioned is highly advisable.  Finally, textbooks focusing on deep learning frameworks and architectures offer valuable contextual understanding.  Careful study of these resources will equip you with the necessary knowledge to handle more complex scenarios involving weight extraction and manipulation.
