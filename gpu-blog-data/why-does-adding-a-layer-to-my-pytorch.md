The observed stagnation in accuracy after adding a single layer to a PyTorch model is frequently attributable to a mismatch between model capacity and the dataset's inherent complexity, often exacerbated by suboptimal training hyperparameters or an inadequate regularization strategy.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects—ranging from image classification to time series forecasting—I've identified three primary culprits: insufficient data, inappropriate layer choice, and ineffective optimization.


**1. Data Limitations:**

The most common cause for this type of performance plateau is a lack of sufficient data to effectively train a deeper model.  A deeper network with a larger number of parameters necessitates a considerably larger dataset to avoid overfitting.  With limited data, the added complexity of the extra layer leads to the model memorizing the training set, performing well on it, but generalizing poorly to unseen data.  The model effectively "learns the noise" rather than the underlying patterns.  Adding further layers only amplifies this effect, resulting in no improvement, or even a decrease, in accuracy on the validation set.

This situation is easily diagnosed by monitoring the training and validation loss curves.  A large gap between these curves, particularly after adding a layer, indicates overfitting.  Furthermore, examining the training and validation accuracy metrics reveals if the model is merely memorizing the training data without generalizing well.  If the training accuracy increases significantly while the validation accuracy stagnates or decreases after adding a layer, this is a strong indicator of overfitting due to data limitations.


**2. Inappropriate Layer Choice:**

The selection of the added layer itself is crucial.  Adding a layer that is not suited to the task or the architecture's existing structure can negatively impact performance. For instance, adding a convolutional layer to a predominantly fully connected network might be ineffective, or adding a dense layer with too many neurons might introduce unnecessary complexity. The layer's activation function also plays a significant role. Using an inappropriate activation function, such as a sigmoid in a deep network, can lead to vanishing or exploding gradients, preventing effective training of the deeper layers.  The interplay between layer type and activation function, alongside the initialization strategy for the layer's weights, significantly impacts gradient flow and overall learning efficacy.


**3. Ineffective Optimization:**

The optimization process, governed by the choice of optimizer and its hyperparameters (learning rate, momentum, etc.), is paramount.  A learning rate that is too high can cause the optimization algorithm to overshoot the optimal weights, while a learning rate that is too low can result in slow convergence and the algorithm getting stuck in local minima.  In the context of adding a layer, the existing optimizer may not be adequately configured to handle the increased model complexity.  This often necessitates adjustments to the learning rate or the exploration of alternative optimizers (e.g., switching from SGD to Adam or RMSprop).


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate these points using PyTorch.  Note that these are simplified illustrations for clarity; real-world scenarios often involve significantly more complex architectures and data preprocessing.


**Example 1: Overfitting due to insufficient data**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

#Simple Model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.fc1(x)
        out = self.relu(out)
        out = self.fc2(out)
        return out

#Insufficient Data Simulation
X_train = torch.randn(100, 10)
y_train = torch.randn(100, 1)

model = SimpleModel(10, 50, 1) #Overparameterized for small dataset
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

#Training loop (simplified for brevity)
for epoch in range(100):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  outputs = model(X_train)
  loss = criterion(outputs, y_train)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()

# Adding a layer without sufficient data will likely worsen performance due to overfitting
class DeeperModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size1, hidden_size2, output_size):
        super(DeeperModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size1)
        self.relu1 = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size1, hidden_size2)
        self.relu2 = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size2, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.fc1(x)
        out = self.relu1(out)
        out = self.fc2(out)
        out = self.relu2(out)
        out = self.fc3(out)
        return out

deeper_model = DeeperModel(10, 50, 50, 1)
# Training deeper_model will likely lead to little or no improvement, potentially worse results.

```

This example showcases how an overparameterized model trained on limited data will overfit, highlighting the importance of data quantity when increasing model complexity.


**Example 2: Inappropriate Layer Choice**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

#Assume a sequential model for image classification
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.MaxPool2d(2,2),
    nn.Flatten(),
    nn.Linear(16*14*14, 10) #Incorrect - Should handle the output of previous layer appropriately
)

#Adding a layer without considering the input shape
model.add_module("fc2", nn.Linear(10, 2)) #Example of an inappropriate addition
```

This example demonstrates the importance of matching layer input and output dimensions; a failure to do so will result in errors.  More subtly, adding a layer that is semantically inappropriate for the task (e.g., adding a convolutional layer when dealing with tabular data) would similarly hinder performance.


**Example 3: Ineffective Optimization**


```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# A simple linear regression model
model = nn.Linear(1, 1)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=10.0) #Excessively high learning rate

#Training with a high learning rate will lead to instability and hinder performance.
#Appropriate learning rate tuning is crucial when adding layers.  A learning rate scheduler can be beneficial.
```

This showcases the negative impact of an inappropriately high learning rate.  In complex models, this becomes more critical, and  fine-tuning the learning rate or using learning rate schedulers often becomes necessary to optimize training after adding layers.

By carefully considering the interplay between data availability, model architecture design, and the optimization process, one can effectively mitigate the issues that prevent accuracy improvements beyond a single layer addition. My experience demonstrates that a methodical investigation into these factors is crucial for building robust and effective deep learning models.
