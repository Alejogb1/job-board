The discrepancy between shapes (1, 400) and (10000, 10) during operations like matrix multiplication or reshaping typically arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of dimensionality and data interpretation within numerical computation, specifically in contexts like linear algebra and machine learning where NumPy or similar libraries are prevalent. My experience, spanning several years developing signal processing algorithms, has repeatedly highlighted that these seemingly simple shape disagreements are often the root cause of cryptic runtime errors and silent computational mistakes.

The core issue stems from the distinct meaning of each dimension. In the shape (1, 400), we have what is often represented as a "row vector" or a 2D array with a single row and 400 columns. Conversely, (10000, 10) indicates a matrix with 10000 rows and 10 columns. The problem occurs when we attempt an operation that implicitly expects a certain shape alignment for its operands, like matrix multiplication. For multiplication, the inner dimensions must match; that is, if we’re multiplying A with shape (m, n) by B with shape (p, q), ‘n’ must equal ‘p’. Trying to multiply (1, 400) with (10000, 10) is not possible using standard matrix multiplication rules, because the inner dimensions (400 and 10000) do not align. Furthermore, other operations, like directly reshaping or broadcasting, are similarly affected by these dimensional mismatches. These operations rely on the understanding of how to map elements across arrays with different shapes.

Let’s illustrate the nature of this misalignment through several practical scenarios with Python and NumPy:

**Scenario 1: Attempted Matrix Multiplication**

```python
import numpy as np

# Data with shape (1, 400)
vector_a = np.random.rand(1, 400)

# Data with shape (10000, 10)
matrix_b = np.random.rand(10000, 10)

try:
    # Attempt to multiply
    result = np.dot(vector_a, matrix_b)
    print("Result shape:", result.shape)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This code block first generates a random vector, `vector_a`, with shape (1, 400), representing a row vector and a random matrix, `matrix_b`, with shape (10000, 10). The `np.dot()` function is then used to attempt matrix multiplication. However, this results in a `ValueError` because the inner dimensions are 400 and 10000, respectively. They are not equal, rendering the standard matrix multiplication operation undefined. This illustrates the core problem of shape misalignment. The error message will generally indicate that the dimensions are not aligned, emphasizing that compatibility between shapes is essential for linear algebra operations. This is a direct manifestation of the rule where inner dimensions must be equal for matrix multiplication.

**Scenario 2: Reshaping for Compatibility**

```python
import numpy as np

# Data with shape (1, 400)
vector_a = np.random.rand(1, 400)

# Data with shape (10000, 10)
matrix_b = np.random.rand(10000, 10)

try:
    # Attempt to reshape vector_a to (400, 1) and multiply
    vector_a_reshaped = vector_a.reshape(400, 1)
    result_reshaped = np.dot(vector_a_reshaped.T, matrix_b)
    print("Result Reshaped Shape:", result_reshaped.shape)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error during reshaping: {e}")
```

Here we attempt to solve the misalignment issue by reshaping `vector_a` to (400, 1) using `.reshape()`. This creates a column vector from our initial row vector and, before multiplying, we apply the transpose `T` of the column vector. The transpose of shape (400, 1) is (1, 400) making this operation compatible for multiplication with the original `matrix_b`, using a dot product between a (1, 400) matrix and a (10000, 10) matrix would still produce an error.  As a correction, the multiplication is now performed as `np.dot(vector_a_reshaped.T, matrix_b)` where `vector_a_reshaped.T` has shape (1, 400). It still would not be correct since `matrix_b` has a shape of (10000, 10). This showcases that reshaping can enable matrix operations, but is not the right approach when trying to work with these specific shapes using matrix multiplication. To use dot multiplication, we must transpose `matrix_b` to have the right orientation so the inner dimensions would match. The shape would need to be (10, 10000) making the `dot` product result in shape (1, 10).

**Scenario 3: Reshaping for Data Manipulation**

```python
import numpy as np

# Data with shape (1, 400)
vector_a = np.random.rand(1, 400)
# Data with shape (10000, 10)
matrix_b = np.random.rand(10000, 10)

try:
     # Reshaping for concatenation
    matrix_a = vector_a.reshape(1, 400)
    result_concat = np.concatenate((matrix_a, np.random.rand(1, 400)), axis=0)
    print("Concatenated shape:", result_concat.shape)


except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error during concatenation: {e}")

try:
    #Reshaping for data processing
    matrix_b_resized = matrix_b.reshape(1000, 100)
    print("Resized matrix b shape: ", matrix_b_resized.shape)

except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error during resizing: {e}")
```

Here, we highlight the importance of reshaping when handling data for specific tasks. For example we first reshape `vector_a` to have a shape of (1, 400), although it originally had the same shape. We reshape to demonstrate a common practice, when needing to perform operations like concatenation with other matrices or arrays. The `np.concatenate()` function concatenates arrays along a specified axis. In our case, we are concatenating with another (1,400) shaped array along the vertical axis (axis=0), resulting in shape (2, 400). The second `try` block is an example of how reshaping is fundamental for data transformation. The original `matrix_b` has shape (10000, 10). In order to correctly reshape, one must always understand the total number of elements, in this case it's 100000. When reshaping, the new shape must also have a product that results in 100000, therefore the operation `matrix_b.reshape(1000,100)` will work without errors.  These examples highlight that the appropriate reshaping is essential for processing data correctly. The need to reshape can stem from specific needs of the task at hand like data arrangement, concatenation, and processing. However, the underlying principle is always consistency in how the data's dimensions are arranged and interpreted.

To enhance understanding and problem-solving skills concerning array shapes, I recommend the following resources. Firstly, focus on the NumPy documentation itself, particularly the sections concerning array creation, manipulation, and broadcasting. Second, numerous educational platforms offer courses and tutorials on linear algebra concepts, specifically how they relate to matrix and vector operations. Finally, textbooks dedicated to the fundamentals of numerical computation can provide a more rigorous theoretical foundation. Utilizing these sources, coupled with continued practice, will improve one’s grasp of how shapes are critical to computation.
