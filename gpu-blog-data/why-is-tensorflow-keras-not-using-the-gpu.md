TensorFlow Keras’s failure to utilize a GPU, despite system availability, primarily stems from incorrect configuration at several levels, ranging from software dependencies to the way the framework is initiated. Overcoming this requires a systematic investigation into these potential bottlenecks. I've personally spent considerable time troubleshooting this across varied systems, from personal workstations to cloud-based instances, and these recurring issues consistently point to specific root causes.

Fundamentally, TensorFlow relies on CUDA libraries and compatible NVIDIA drivers to access the GPU. The absence of either, or any version mismatch between them, immediately renders GPU acceleration unavailable. The process is not automatic; TensorFlow must be explicitly configured to use these resources. It will, by default, fall back to CPU computation unless explicitly directed. This implicit fallback often leads to user confusion, as the program will still execute, albeit with severely degraded performance. The issue isn't a core flaw in TensorFlow, but rather a lack of proper setup.

Let's examine several key factors and how to approach them systematically:

**1. Driver and CUDA Compatibility:**
The foremost step involves verifying the correct installation of NVIDIA GPU drivers and a matching CUDA Toolkit version. The TensorFlow documentation provides a compatibility matrix detailing supported versions. Incorrect pairings are a common source of failure. For instance, using a CUDA Toolkit built for an earlier driver version on a system with the latest drivers results in TensorFlow reverting to CPU. I’ve encountered this situation multiple times where simply updating or downgrading the CUDA Toolkit to match the installed driver remedied the issue.

**2. TensorFlow Installation and Configuration:**
TensorFlow offers two primary builds: CPU-only and GPU-enabled. A CPU-only version will never utilize the GPU, regardless of the underlying system configuration. The GPU version needs to be explicitly installed via pip, typically named `tensorflow-gpu` or simply `tensorflow` for modern versions which handle both. It is necessary to verify that the correct TensorFlow variant is installed via `pip list`.

Further, even with a GPU-enabled build, TensorFlow’s default behavior might not immediately utilize the GPU. The `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` function is crucial. This command lists available GPUs that TensorFlow can access. An empty list implies that TensorFlow hasn't detected a usable GPU. If a GPU is detected, the function output will include details of the physical device and its properties. This is the first diagnostic to run and if it fails, you must look towards your installation configuration of the NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit.

**3. Resource Allocation:**
Even when TensorFlow detects a GPU, the program may still not effectively use it if it is not allocated properly. TensorFlow, by default, attempts to utilize all available GPU memory, which might be sub-optimal. This can lead to out-of-memory errors or cause TensorFlow to fall back to CPU execution. You can implement `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` in order to manage how memory is used on the GPU dynamically.

Let’s illustrate with examples that emphasize each point:

**Code Example 1: Identifying Available GPUs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Check for available devices. If there are no GPUs this method will return []
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
print("Available GPUs:", gpus)

if gpus:
  # If GPUs are available, print details of the first one
  gpu_details = tf.config.get_device_details(gpus[0])
  print("GPU details:", gpu_details)
else:
  print("No GPU detected by TensorFlow.")

```

*Commentary:* This snippet first checks for any recognized GPUs, confirming that TensorFlow has access to one or more devices. If GPUs are found, it prints their details including the driver and name. If the output indicates ‘No GPU detected by TensorFlow.’, then the root cause of the problem is a lack of proper driver installation or TensorFlow is configured to utilize the CPU only variant. This is the initial diagnostic and is critical to confirm before moving further.

**Code Example 2:  Configuring Memory Growth**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # This configures TensorFlow to use memory growth, meaning it will only allocate as much GPU memory as needed.
        # Useful when you have other processes utilizing the GPU simultaneously.
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
        print("Memory growth configured for GPUs.")

    except RuntimeError as e:
        # Memory growth must be configured before GPUs are initialized.
        print(f"Error configuring memory growth: {e}")
else:
  print("No GPUs detected, skipping memory config.")

```
*Commentary:*  This example addresses resource allocation. The `set_memory_growth` function allows TensorFlow to dynamically allocate memory rather than trying to consume all GPU memory upfront. This is particularly important in environments with multiple GPU-intensive processes, avoiding clashes and improving overall GPU efficiency. I regularly deploy this in cloud environments and found it effective at reducing memory conflicts. If an error occurs, this is another indication that a GPU is not accessible or the TensorFlow setup is not correct.

**Code Example 3: Explicit Device Placement**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a simple tensor on the CPU.
with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
  cpu_tensor = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if gpus:
    # If a GPU is available, create a tensor there.
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        gpu_tensor = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000))
    print("Operations are explicitly placed on GPU.")
    print("CPU Tensor device:", cpu_tensor.device)
    print("GPU Tensor device:", gpu_tensor.device)
else:
  print("No GPU, operations will happen on CPU.")
  print("Tensor device:", cpu_tensor.device)

```
*Commentary:* In this example we are explicitly specifying the device used for operations. By using `tf.device('/GPU:0')` operations and tensors will be placed on the first available GPU. If you have multiple GPUs you can specify '/GPU:1' for the second GPU etc. Without specifying, TensorFlow might not utilize the GPU and default to the CPU and thus this explicitly highlights the device that will be used. This method gives you more granular control over where computations occur. If the GPU is not being used, then the outputs will show that both `cpu_tensor` and `gpu_tensor` are placed on the CPU. This can serve as another diagnostic tool.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding and troubleshooting, consult official documentation which includes:
1. NVIDIA driver documentation and release notes on the NVIDIA developer website.
2. CUDA Toolkit documentation, also on the NVIDIA developer website, outlining the API and compatible driver versions.
3. The TensorFlow website provides comprehensive guides on installation, configuration, and debugging, covering GPU-specific setups.

In summary, GPU unavailability in TensorFlow Keras is seldom a framework issue, instead most often it stems from issues with incorrect or missing driver and toolkit versions, improperly installed TensorFlow builds or inadequate GPU resource configurations. A systematic approach using the diagnostics provided and the proper tools for the given environment are vital to resolving these issues and harnessing the full power of GPU acceleration in your deep learning workflows.
