The core issue underpinning "undefined reference" errors when compiling a Qt-based C++ application that incorporates TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) on Windows, stems from the linker's inability to locate the compiled function implementations during the final build stage. These errors manifest during the linking process, signifying that the compiler found declarations (in headers, typically) but not definitions (actual code) for functions, classes, or variables used in the project. The problem isn’t inherent to Qt or TFLite in isolation but arises from their interplay, particularly concerning libraries and linkage.

Typically, the build process involves three stages: compilation, assembly, and linking. During compilation, source files (.cpp) are transformed into object files (.o or .obj on Windows). These object files contain machine code for the individual source files and unresolved references. The linker then combines these object files, resolves the references using available libraries, and produces the final executable or dynamic-link library. Undefined reference errors surface when the linker cannot locate a required symbol in the available object files or linked libraries. Specifically, in the context of Qt and TFLite on Windows, the most frequent culprits are: 1) not linking the necessary TFLite library itself, 2) not linking the required dependencies of TFLite, and 3) incorrect or insufficient configuration of Qt's project build settings. I've seen this manifest in multiple projects, from simple object detection examples to more elaborate custom layer implementations.

The simplest case is often forgetting to explicitly specify the TFLite library. Tensorflow Lite on Windows typically provides precompiled libraries which must be explicitly linked against the application. In Qt, this is generally accomplished in the `.pro` file, Qt’s project file, which provides configuration information to `qmake`, Qt's build system.

Consider the following minimal example, where we intend to invoke a basic TFLite interpreter:

```cpp
// main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "tensorflow/lite/interpreter.h"
#include "tensorflow/lite/model.h"
#include "tensorflow/lite/kernels/register.h"

int main() {
    // Example of creating a minimal TFLite model (usually loaded from a .tflite file)
    std::unique_ptr<tflite::FlatBufferModel> model = tflite::FlatBufferModel::BuildFromFile("test.tflite");
    if (!model) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to load model" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    tflite::ops::builtin::BuiltinOpResolver resolver;
    std::unique_ptr<tflite::Interpreter> interpreter;
    tflite::InterpreterBuilder(*model, resolver)(&interpreter);

    if (!interpreter){
      std::cerr << "Failed to create interpreter" << std::endl;
      return 1;
    }

    std::cout << "TFLite model loaded successfully." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This `main.cpp` includes TFLite headers, creates a model and attempts to build an interpreter. Without correct linkage, you would see errors like `undefined reference to tflite::FlatBufferModel::BuildFromFile(char const*)` during the linking stage. To resolve this, the project file needs to instruct the linker to include the TFLite library, which may also require including the path where that library resides on disk. Here's a modification to a basic `.pro` file to address this:

```qmake
# myproject.pro
QT       += core
QT       -= gui
CONFIG   += c++17 console
SOURCES += main.cpp

# Path to TFLite include directory (adapt to your local installation)
INCLUDEPATH += "C:/path/to/tensorflow-lite/include"

# Path to TFLite library file (.lib extension for Windows)
LIBS += -LC:/path/to/tensorflow-lite/lib -ltensorflowlite.lib
```
This `LIBS` directive uses `-L` to specify the directory containing the library and `-l` to specify the library name. The `.lib` extension is typically omitted from the `-l` option. It is crucial to use the correct path to the library file. The incorrect path, or an incorrect library name (e.g., `tensorflowlite.dll` instead of `tensorflowlite.lib` or omitting the file extension entirely when using -l), will also produce the same `undefined reference` errors. The `INCLUDEPATH` is needed as well, to allow the compiler to find the necessary header files. This configuration assumes a static library. If using a dynamic library (.dll), further steps may be needed to make the .dll available at runtime.

Furthermore, TensorFlow Lite can depend on other libraries, depending on how it's built. This often includes dependencies related to things like logging, numerical computation (like Eigen, a common library in the ML space), or threading. These dependencies are often implicit and may not be immediately apparent in the TFLite documentation, particularly when using pre-built versions of the TFLite library.  Failure to address these dependencies leads to further undefined reference errors.

To demonstrate this issue, suppose the TFLite library linked above requires Eigen for matrix operations. Compiling after just addressing TFLite itself might still result in `undefined reference to Eigen::...` or similar errors. Therefore, the `.pro` file might require additional entries. Assume for this example that Eigen was compiled and provided as a library. The following example builds upon the previous one:

```qmake
# myproject.pro (Modified)
QT       += core
QT       -= gui
CONFIG   += c++17 console
SOURCES += main.cpp

# Paths to TFLite and Eigen include directories
INCLUDEPATH += "C:/path/to/tensorflow-lite/include"
INCLUDEPATH += "C:/path/to/eigen/include"

# Paths to TFLite and Eigen libraries
LIBS += -LC:/path/to/tensorflow-lite/lib -ltensorflowlite.lib
LIBS += -LC:/path/to/eigen/lib -leigen.lib  # Assuming Eigen is also built as a library
```

Here, we've added the Eigen include directory, and importantly, added an Eigen library entry in the `LIBS` section.  Often, these Eigen library builds are also dependent on particular BLAS/LAPACK implementations.  When linking against a build that uses BLAS/LAPACK, there may be additional system libraries or other libraries needed that are not explicitly stated. It's critical to consult the build logs during the TFLite compilation process to see these dependencies clearly. If the TFLite library has been compiled by the user, these dependencies are clear.

Finally, build environment configuration issues can also create these errors, even when the `.pro` file seems correct. For instance, the compiler and linker might be looking for libraries using one naming convention, while the available library has another. This often occurs when mixing libraries built with different compiler toolchains. It is best practice, especially on Windows, to maintain consistency, using the same toolchain and architecture for building all dependencies. If not, the application may link but then crash at runtime with module load errors, but can also present itself as unresolved link errors during build. An example of this in the Qt context might involve targeting a 32-bit architecture when libraries are built for 64-bit.

To illustrate, consider a scenario where your TFLite library is compiled for a 64-bit architecture, but you're attempting to compile with a 32-bit Qt setup. This mismatch will cause link errors. The following example changes the `CONFIG` declaration to the 32 bit version which we assume is a 32-bit build configuration for Qt. If the user then attempts to link a 64-bit TFLite library and/or dependencies the linker will fail, and throw "undefined reference" errors.

```qmake
# myproject.pro (Modified - architecture mismatch)
QT       += core
QT       -= gui
CONFIG   += c++17 console  # Compiler uses a 32 bit config (e.g., msvc32, clang32, etc.)

# Paths to TFLite and Eigen include directories
INCLUDEPATH += "C:/path/to/tensorflow-lite/include"
INCLUDEPATH += "C:/path/to/eigen/include"

# Paths to TFLite and Eigen libraries - **ASSUMED 64 BIT LIBS HERE**
LIBS += -LC:/path/to/tensorflow-lite/lib -ltensorflowlite.lib
LIBS += -LC:/path/to/eigen/lib -leigen.lib
SOURCES += main.cpp
```

The key here is the incompatibility; the architecture setting in Qt should align with the architecture of your TFLite and dependency libraries. Correcting this will solve these linker issues. A consistent build environment is critical for preventing difficult-to-diagnose errors. If the application is intended to run in 32-bit environments, the libraries must be built in a 32-bit toolchain.

To aid in resolving these issues, I strongly suggest consulting these resources: the official TensorFlow Lite documentation (particularly the C++ API and build instructions), the Qt documentation related to project files and library linkage, and resources related to Windows compiler toolchains (MSVC or MinGW). These will provide invaluable information into library dependencies, architecture settings, and other crucial details.  Additionally, it is important to understand how to examine compiler and linker output, often verbose output can help in diagnosing exactly which symbols are missing and where the build process is searching. Using a tool like Dependency Walker or similar can also be quite useful for exploring the dependencies of a particular binary.
