The assertion that `Conv2DCustomBackpropInputOp` exclusively supports the NHWC data format is inaccurate.  My experience working on several large-scale image recognition projects, particularly those involving custom convolutional kernels and optimized backpropagation implementations, has demonstrated its flexibility across different data formats.  While NHWC (N - batch size, H - height, W - width, C - channels) is frequently the default and often the most efficient choice due to hardware optimizations, the underlying operation itself is not inherently constrained to this arrangement.  The support for alternative formats like NCHW (N - batch size, C - channels, H - height, W - width) depends primarily on the implementation details of the `Conv2DCustomBackpropInputOp` and the underlying deep learning framework.

The key factor determining format compatibility is the careful handling of data reshaping and transposition during both the forward and backward passes.  A correctly implemented `Conv2DCustomBackpropInputOp` will incorporate logic to:

1. **Detect the input data format:**  This might involve parsing metadata associated with the input tensor or relying on explicit format specifications provided during operation initialization.

2. **Perform necessary transpositions:** If the input format deviates from the internal processing format (often NHWC for optimized convolution kernels), the operation must efficiently transpose the input data to the internal format before performing the computation.

3. **Transpose the output:** After the backpropagation calculation, the result must be transposed back to the original input format to maintain consistency with the rest of the computational graph.

Failure to correctly manage these transpositions will lead to incorrect gradients and ultimately, model training instability or failure.  It's also important to note that while the underlying algorithm is format-agnostic, performance can vary significantly depending on the chosen format and the hardware architecture.  NHWC generally benefits from memory access patterns optimized for modern hardware, potentially leading to faster computation.

Let's illustrate this with code examples.  These examples will be simplified representations focusing on the core transposition logic; a production-ready implementation would require considerably more error handling and integration with a larger deep learning framework.

**Example 1:  NHWC Input and Output**

```python
import numpy as np

def conv2d_backprop_input_nhwc(input_shape, filter_shape, out_backprop, strides):
    # Simulate the core convolution backpropagation operation assuming NHWC
    # In a real implementation, this would involve optimized kernels
    # This is a placeholder for the actual computation
    input_data = np.zeros(input_shape)
    # ... Complex convolution backpropagation calculation using input_shape, filter_shape, out_backprop, strides ...
    return input_data

# Example usage with NHWC format
input_shape_nhwc = (1, 28, 28, 1)  # Batch, Height, Width, Channels
filter_shape = (3, 3, 1, 32) # filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels
out_backprop_nhwc = np.random.rand(1, 26, 26, 32) # Example backpropagated output
strides = (1, 1)
grad_input_nhwc = conv2d_backprop_input_nhwc(input_shape_nhwc, filter_shape, out_backprop_nhwc, strides)
```

**Example 2: NCHW Input, NHWC Internal Processing**

```python
import numpy as np

def conv2d_backprop_input_nchw_to_nhwc(input_shape_nchw, filter_shape, out_backprop_nhwc, strides):
    # Transpose input to NHWC
    input_shape_nhwc = (input_shape_nchw[0], input_shape_nchw[2], input_shape_nchw[3], input_shape_nchw[1])
    input_data_nchw = np.random.rand(*input_shape_nchw)
    input_data_nhwc = np.transpose(input_data_nchw, (0, 2, 3, 1))

    # Simulate backpropagation in NHWC (as in Example 1)
    # ... Complex convolution backpropagation calculation ...
    grad_input_nhwc = conv2d_backprop_input_nhwc(input_shape_nhwc, filter_shape, out_backprop_nhwc, strides)

    # Transpose back to NCHW
    grad_input_nchw = np.transpose(grad_input_nhwc, (0, 3, 1, 2))
    return grad_input_nchw

# Example usage with NCHW input
input_shape_nchw = (1, 1, 28, 28)  # Batch, Channels, Height, Width
out_backprop_nhwc = np.random.rand(1, 26, 26, 32) # Example backpropagated output
grad_input_nchw = conv2d_backprop_input_nchw_to_nhwc(input_shape_nchw, filter_shape, out_backprop_nhwc, strides)
```

**Example 3:  Custom Format Handling**

```python
import numpy as np

def conv2d_backprop_input_custom(input_data, filter_shape, out_backprop, strides, input_format):
    # Implement format detection and handling
    if input_format == "NHWC":
        input_shape = input_data.shape
        # ... Direct NHWC processing as in Example 1 ...
    elif input_format == "NCHW":
        input_shape = (input_data.shape[0], input_data.shape[2], input_data.shape[3], input_data.shape[1])
        input_data = np.transpose(input_data, (0, 2, 3, 1))
        # ... Processing with transposition as in Example 2 ...
    # Add support for other formats here...
    else:
      raise ValueError("Unsupported input format.")
    # ... Backpropagation calculation ...
    # ... Transpose back to original format if needed ...
    return grad_input #Return in the original format

# Example usage: Custom format support
input_data_nchw = np.random.rand(1, 1, 28, 28)
grad_input_nchw = conv2d_backprop_input_custom(input_data_nchw, filter_shape, out_backprop_nhwc, strides, "NCHW")
```

These examples highlight that while internal optimizations might favor NHWC, the capability to support other formats rests on efficient data manipulation.  The key is diligent handling of transpositions to maintain data integrity and computational accuracy throughout the process.

For further understanding, I recommend consulting advanced texts on deep learning frameworks, specifically those covering custom operator implementations and low-level optimization techniques for convolutional neural networks.  A thorough grasp of linear algebra, particularly matrix transformations, is also crucial.  Finally, studying the source code of popular deep learning frameworks' convolutional implementations will provide valuable insight into real-world solutions for handling different data formats.
