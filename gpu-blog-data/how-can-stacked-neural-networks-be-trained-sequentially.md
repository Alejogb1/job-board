Sequential training of stacked neural networks in Keras, while seemingly straightforward, presents several nuances when aiming for optimal performance. Unlike training a monolithic model, the strategy involves training individual layers or sub-networks, often with specific objectives, before connecting them into a larger architecture. My own experience, specifically working on a complex anomaly detection system for telemetry data, highlighted the importance of this technique for handling models that are not readily learned end-to-end. This response outlines the process, demonstrates practical implementation, and provides recommendations for further study.

The core concept lies in training one layer or component network at a time while holding the preceding layers fixed, or in some cases, using outputs from the previous layers as input for the next. This iterative approach can mitigate issues like vanishing gradients in deep networks and facilitates modular construction, allowing for experimentation with diverse network architectures and pre-trained models within the stack. Each stage may involve a different learning rate, loss function, or optimization method tailored to its specific task, which increases the flexibility. The output of each stage is either the final prediction, or, in most cases, the feature extraction required for the subsequent stage. This iterative process provides a level of granularity and control not typically available with standard end-to-end training.

**Code Example 1: Basic Sequential Stack**

This example demonstrates a simple sequential stacking of three dense layers, trained using a generated dataset.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate synthetic data
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Layer 1 model (Feature extraction)
input_layer = keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,))
layer1 = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_layer)
model1 = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=layer1)

# Layer 1 Training
model1.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model1.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0) # Train the feature extractor
model1.trainable = False # Freeze the Layer 1 weights

# Layer 2 model (Classification)
layer2 = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(layer1)
layer3 = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(layer2)
model2 = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=layer3)

# Layer 2 Training
model2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model2.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Evaluation (on Model2 with layers 1 and 2)
_, accuracy = model2.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f'Test accuracy: {accuracy}')
```
In this first example, we generate random binary classification data. The process begins with defining and training 'model1' which contains a single dense layer for feature extraction. After the training, weights are frozen using `model1.trainable = False`. This action is crucial, because it allows us to leverage that feature extraction to inform 'model2,' the subsequent classification stage. Note that `model2` has `input_layer` as an input, allowing it to utilize the trained layers from `model1`. This is a common but crucial detail. `model2` contains `layer2` and `layer3` which take the output from `layer1` and create a more nuanced classification on top of the features learned in the first stage. Finally, `model2` is evaluated for overall accuracy.

**Code Example 2: Sequential Training with Intermediate Outputs**

This example illustrates a slightly more complex scenario involving intermediate feature transformations and the use of the functional Keras API.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate synthetic data
X = np.random.rand(1000, 20)
y = np.random.randint(0, 5, 1000)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Layer 1 model
input_layer = keras.layers.Input(shape=(20,))
layer1 = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_layer)
output_layer1 = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(layer1)
model1 = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer1)

# Layer 1 Training
model1.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) # Modified loss
model1.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=15, verbose=0)
for layer in model1.layers: # Freeze Layer 1 Weights
    layer.trainable = False

# Layer 2 model - consumes intermediate output
output_layer1_input = keras.layers.Input(shape=(64,)) # New input layer for stage 2
layer2 = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(output_layer1_input)
layer3 = keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax')(layer2)
model2_no_input = keras.Model(inputs=output_layer1_input, outputs=layer3) # Model based on stage 1 feature map
model2 = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs = model2_no_input(model1(input_layer))) # Combined model

# Layer 2 Training
model2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model2.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=15, verbose=0)

# Evaluation
_, accuracy = model2.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f'Test accuracy: {accuracy}')
```
Here, the first stage (`model1`) processes input data, reduces dimensionality, and creates a 64-dimensional output feature map, which becomes the input for the second stage. `model2`â€™s initial definition only contains the network architecture with the input of the `output_layer1`. Then, the complete `model2` is created, concatenating the layers from `model1` and `model2_no_input`. This highlights the fact that, in the sequential process, stages often have their own input layer and we must chain those using the functional API.  The use of different layers, loss functions, and metrics demonstrate the flexibility provided by sequentially training.

**Code Example 3: Sequential Training with Pre-trained Layers**

This example shows how a pre-trained feature extractor can be leveraged in a sequential fashion. In practice, transfer learning is an indispensable part of model building and is a natural case for the methods discussed.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate synthetic data
X = np.random.rand(1000, 784)
y = np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)
X_test = X_test.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)

# Pre-trained convolutional base (using VGG16)
vgg16_base = keras.applications.VGG16(include_top=False, input_shape=(28, 28, 1))
for layer in vgg16_base.layers:
    layer.trainable = False # Freeze initial layers

# Layer 1 model (Feature extraction)
input_layer = keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
output_layer1 = vgg16_base(input_layer) # Modified to include pre-trained model
model1 = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer1) # Use the base as a feature extraction model

# Layer 2 model (Classification)
layer2 = keras.layers.Flatten()(output_layer1)
layer3 = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(layer2)
layer4 = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(layer3)
model2 = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=layer4) # Combined model
model2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model2.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)

# Evaluation
_, accuracy = model2.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f'Test accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

This example utilizes a pre-trained VGG16 model as the base for feature extraction. The weights of the VGG16 model are explicitly frozen, a common and crucial step, ensuring that the model does not update during training of the new layers. This approach provides a significant boost in training efficiency, especially when working with small datasets. The remaining layers are trained with an appropriate loss function for classification.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a more theoretical understanding of neural network training and optimization techniques, I suggest exploring resources that cover topics like gradient descent variants, backpropagation, and regularization. Texts focusing on deep learning from a mathematical perspective can be particularly helpful. Practical knowledge can be enhanced by researching the intricacies of the Keras API, specifically around layer freezing, custom model building, and using functional API for complex architectures. Furthermore, reviewing papers on transfer learning and techniques like fine-tuning will also provide a stronger theoretical foundation to the presented approach. Finally, hands-on experience is indispensable. Working on diverse datasets and model architectures provides practical insights that may not be apparent from theoretical explorations alone.
