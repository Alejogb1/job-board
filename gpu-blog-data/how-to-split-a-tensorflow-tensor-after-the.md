TensorFlow, unlike array-centric libraries, does not offer a direct, built-in method to split tensors based on the *first* occurrence of a specific value. Standard splitting methods like `tf.split` operate on a fixed axis and number of parts, requiring a more procedural approach to achieve this outcome. My experience working with sequence modeling, particularly in areas like text processing and time series analysis, repeatedly encountered this problem, often necessitating custom solutions.

The fundamental challenge arises from the tensor’s immutable nature within TensorFlow graphs and the framework’s preference for batch operations. Directly modifying tensor shapes based on conditional evaluations is not easily achievable during graph construction. We must therefore work with TensorFlow's conditional operators and indexing capabilities to simulate the desired split. The primary strategy involves identifying the index of the first occurrence, then leveraging tensor slicing based on this index.

Here's a breakdown of the necessary steps:

1.  **Find the Index:** We need to locate the index of the first element matching our target value within the relevant tensor dimension. TensorFlow’s `tf.where` operation can identify all indices matching the condition. However, `tf.where` returns a list of *all* matching indices, not just the first. To extract the first, we take the first element of the `tf.where` output. If no matching value is found, a default value for splitting (such as the tensor length itself) needs to be utilized.
2.  **Tensor Slicing:** Once the index is located, we use standard TensorFlow tensor slicing operations (`tf.slice` or its shorthand indexing) to divide the input tensor at the calculated index. The first tensor slice will contain elements before the identified index (up to but excluding it). The second slice will contain the elements starting at that index until the end of the tensor.
3.  **Handling Empty Results:** It is critical to address the possibility of empty tensors. If the target value is at the beginning, the first split slice could be empty. Similarly, if the target value doesn't exist, the first slice might be the entire tensor, and the second slice would be empty. It is important to design the algorithm with the required behavior for both cases.

The approach described is vectorized; it can process multiple tensors (along the batch dimension) simultaneously. The critical section for finding the first matching index is inherently sequential because we need the *first* matching position, therefore loop-based solutions might be required when this cannot be avoided. However, I advise to minimize the use of loops, maximizing the use of vectorized operations, to fully realize the performance of TensorFlow’s architecture.

Let me illustrate this with code examples:

**Example 1: 1D Tensor Splitting**

This example demonstrates splitting a simple 1D tensor. The example assumes only one tensor for demonstration purposes.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def split_tensor_first_occurrence(tensor, target_value):
    """Splits a 1D tensor after the first occurrence of a value.
    Args:
        tensor: A 1D TensorFlow tensor.
        target_value: The value to find.
    Returns:
        A tuple of two tensors.
    """
    indices = tf.where(tf.equal(tensor, target_value))
    first_index = tf.cond(tf.size(indices) > 0, 
                          lambda: tf.cast(indices[0][0], tf.int32), 
                          lambda: tf.size(tensor))
    
    first_part = tensor[:first_index]
    second_part = tensor[first_index:]
    return first_part, second_part

# Test Case
test_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6])
target = 2
first, second = split_tensor_first_occurrence(test_tensor, target)
print("First part:", first)
print("Second part:", second)
```

In this example, `tf.where` locates the indices where the tensor equals the target value. A conditional statement using `tf.cond` ensures that, if no matching element is found, `first_index` defaults to the tensor's size, effectively resulting in no split. Slicing then generates the two tensors.

**Example 2: Batch Processing**

Now let's consider a scenario where we have a batch of tensors, this time we will process the tensors row by row by looping through the tensors at the first dimension.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def split_tensor_batch_first_occurrence(tensor_batch, target_value):
    """Splits a batch of 1D tensors after the first occurrence of a value.
       Args:
        tensor_batch: A 2D TensorFlow tensor where each row is to be splitted.
        target_value: The value to find.
        Returns:
        A tuple of two lists of tensors, representing splitted first parts and second parts respectively.
    """
    first_parts = []
    second_parts = []
    for tensor in tf.unstack(tensor_batch):
       indices = tf.where(tf.equal(tensor, target_value))
       first_index = tf.cond(tf.size(indices) > 0, 
                           lambda: tf.cast(indices[0][0], tf.int32), 
                           lambda: tf.size(tensor))

       first_part = tensor[:first_index]
       second_part = tensor[first_index:]
       first_parts.append(first_part)
       second_parts.append(second_part)
    return first_parts, second_parts

# Test Case
batch_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 4, 2], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 11, 13]])
target = 11
firsts, seconds = split_tensor_batch_first_occurrence(batch_tensor, target)
print("First Parts:", firsts)
print("Second Parts:", seconds)

```

In this case, we process a 2D tensor representing a batch of 1D tensors. By using `tf.unstack`, we loop each tensor and apply the same logic as in Example 1, creating a list of first parts and second parts as outputs. This is not the ideal solution from performance and vectorization perspective but is a good intermediate approach.

**Example 3: Handling Multi-Dimensional Tensors**

For higher dimensional tensors, the principle remains the same, but we need to define on which axis we want to apply the slicing, we can add this extra parameter to the function. In the current approach, it requires that a reduction in dimensions to 1D is possible. In the current version, a reduce along all axes is applied, and the resulting output is used to extract the index, and then apply the split on the initial multi dimensional tensor. This might not be always the desired case, but serves to exemplify that the approach can be easily adapted.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def split_multidim_tensor_first_occurrence(tensor, target_value, split_axis=0):
    """Splits a tensor after the first occurrence of a value along one axis.
    Args:
        tensor: A TensorFlow tensor.
        target_value: The value to find.
        split_axis: The axis along which to perform the split.
    Returns:
        A tuple of two tensors, representing splitted first part and second part.
    """
    flat_tensor = tf.reshape(tensor, [-1])
    indices = tf.where(tf.equal(flat_tensor, target_value))
    first_index = tf.cond(tf.size(indices) > 0, 
                            lambda: tf.cast(indices[0][0], tf.int32), 
                            lambda: tf.size(flat_tensor))
    
    
    first_shape = tf.concat([tf.shape(tensor)[:split_axis], [first_index] ,tf.shape(tensor)[split_axis + 1:]], axis=0)
    first_part = tf.slice(tensor, [0] * len(tf.shape(tensor)), first_shape)
    second_start = tf.concat([[0] * split_axis, [first_index] , [0] * (len(tf.shape(tensor)) - split_axis -1) ], axis=0)
    second_shape = tf.shape(tensor) - second_start
    second_part = tf.slice(tensor, second_start ,second_shape)

    return first_part, second_part

# Test Case
test_tensor = tf.constant([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 2]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])
target = 2
split_axis = 1
first, second = split_multidim_tensor_first_occurrence(test_tensor, target, split_axis)
print("First part:", first)
print("Second part:", second)
```

Here, flattening the tensor allows us to extract the index as before, and the extracted index is used in `tf.slice` to apply the split operation along the defined axis. This example demonstrates a naive implementation for slicing, but showcases that the solution can be applied to multidimensional tensors.

For further exploration and deeper understanding of the concepts involved in the examples provided, I would recommend consulting the TensorFlow documentation directly. The following areas are highly beneficial:
*   Tensor Transformations: Focus on methods like `tf.reshape`, `tf.slice`, and `tf.split` to learn how to manipulate tensor dimensions.
*   Conditional Execution: Review `tf.cond` and related methods to understand branching within a TensorFlow graph.
*   Indexing and Slicing: Practice how to use TensorFlow's indexing to access and modify specific tensor elements.
*   `tf.where`: Study the usage of this method, as it is fundamental for implementing conditional behaviors and is also often used in conjunction with indexing operations.

By studying these topics, the user will gain a full understanding on how to properly implement the splitting of tensors, and will be able to better adapt these and other solutions to other scenarios, as well as gain a deeper understanding of tensor manipulation in TensorFlow.
