OpenCL’s device selection process is not an explicit optimization for maximum throughput, but rather a combination of platform-dependent default behaviors and user-specified preferences which can indirectly influence it. I've frequently encountered scenarios in high-performance computing where simply accepting the default device choice leads to significantly suboptimal performance. Understanding how these choices are made, and how to override them, becomes critical for achieving target performance on heterogeneous systems. The default behavior varies between different OpenCL implementations but is generally dictated by either the first device enumerated or some internal heuristic. However, these heuristics often prioritize device availability, not performance. A more granular approach involves examining device properties exposed by the OpenCL API and explicitly selecting the best option based on specific criteria, often informed by application requirements.

Let's examine the process more closely. The OpenCL framework does not inherently possess knowledge of your specific workload's computational profile. It does not 'know' which device will execute your kernel fastest. Instead, it relies on generic characteristics of the available devices. These characteristics, such as the number of compute units, clock frequency, memory bandwidth, and device type (CPU, GPU, accelerator) are exposed through the `clGetDeviceInfo` API call. When a user initializes a context without explicitly specifying a device, the OpenCL implementation internally chooses one based on its predefined rules. This selection is rarely designed for peak throughput for a particular workload. It is crucial to bypass this default behaviour and implement a custom device selection logic.

The key to maximizing throughput with OpenCL is the ability to examine the properties of each device, and subsequently select the device that best matches the specific nature of the computation being performed. This requires writing code that iterates through available devices, queries relevant parameters and evaluates these based on performance relevant considerations. For example, a compute-intensive workload might greatly benefit from a GPU with a large number of compute units while a workload that relies heavily on data movement may prioritize memory bandwidth. Choosing a device that matches the workflow can often lead to substantial performance gains. Consider the following scenarios I've experienced: running simulations of fluid dynamics on a system with an integrated GPU and a dedicated GPU, where the dedicated GPU performed many times faster because of its greater compute resources. Similarly, a sparse linear algebra calculation on a system with a CPU and GPU might run much faster on the CPU if the GPU was not designed for such patterns.

Here are some coding examples to illustrate this selection process.

**Example 1: Listing Available Devices**

This first code snippet focuses on enumerating available devices and displaying their names. This forms the foundation for any device selection logic.

```c++
#include <CL/cl.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void listDevices() {
    cl_platform_id platforms[10]; // Assuming a maximum of 10 platforms
    cl_uint numPlatforms;
    clGetPlatformIDs(10, platforms, &numPlatforms);

    if (numPlatforms == 0) {
        std::cerr << "No OpenCL platforms found." << std::endl;
        return;
    }

    for (cl_uint i = 0; i < numPlatforms; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Platform: " << i << std::endl;

        cl_device_id devices[10]; // Assuming a maximum of 10 devices per platform
        cl_uint numDevices;
        clGetDeviceIDs(platforms[i], CL_DEVICE_TYPE_ALL, 10, devices, &numDevices);

        if(numDevices == 0) {
          std::cout << "  No devices found for this platform" << std::endl;
          continue;
        }
        
        for (cl_uint j = 0; j < numDevices; ++j) {
            char deviceName[1024];
            clGetDeviceInfo(devices[j], CL_DEVICE_NAME, 1024, deviceName, nullptr);
            std::cout << "  Device: " << j << " - " << deviceName << std::endl;
        }
    }
}


int main() {
    listDevices();
    return 0;
}
```

This code first retrieves a list of available OpenCL platforms, and for each platform, retrieves the devices present in the system (e.g. CPU, GPU). `clGetDeviceInfo` is used to retrieve device names. Note that this example uses a fixed size for platforms and devices. In robust applications, it is necessary to allocate arrays dynamically to accommodate arbitrary numbers of platforms and devices. The output will give a basic list of potential execution targets.

**Example 2: Selecting a GPU**

This next example expands on the previous one by filtering for devices that are GPUs and selecting the first one found.

```c++
#include <CL/cl.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

cl_device_id selectGPU() {
  cl_platform_id platforms[10];
    cl_uint numPlatforms;
    clGetPlatformIDs(10, platforms, &numPlatforms);

    if (numPlatforms == 0) {
        std::cerr << "No OpenCL platforms found." << std::endl;
        return nullptr;
    }

    for (cl_uint i = 0; i < numPlatforms; ++i) {
        cl_device_id devices[10];
        cl_uint numDevices;
        clGetDeviceIDs(platforms[i], CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU, 10, devices, &numDevices);

        if(numDevices > 0) {
            // Return the first found GPU
            return devices[0];
        }
    }
  
    std::cerr << "No GPU device found." << std::endl;
    return nullptr;
}


int main() {
    cl_device_id selectedDevice = selectGPU();
    if (selectedDevice != nullptr) {
        char deviceName[1024];
        clGetDeviceInfo(selectedDevice, CL_DEVICE_NAME, 1024, deviceName, nullptr);
        std::cout << "Selected GPU: " << deviceName << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This example builds on the previous one by explicitly selecting only the GPU devices. The code iterates through platforms and if a GPU is found it will return the first one encountered and output its name. This provides a mechanism for choosing a GPU specifically, rather than relying on the default device. Note, the selection is still simplistic and merely returns the first GPU that is found, not necessarily the best performing.

**Example 3: Selecting Based on Compute Units**

This example expands further by selecting a device based on its number of compute units. It uses this criterion to identify the device with the highest number of compute units, which may be suitable for many compute-intensive workloads.

```c++
#include <CL/cl.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits>

cl_device_id selectDeviceByComputeUnits() {
    cl_platform_id platforms[10];
    cl_uint numPlatforms;
    clGetPlatformIDs(10, platforms, &numPlatforms);

    if (numPlatforms == 0) {
        std::cerr << "No OpenCL platforms found." << std::endl;
        return nullptr;
    }

    cl_device_id bestDevice = nullptr;
    cl_uint maxComputeUnits = 0;

    for (cl_uint i = 0; i < numPlatforms; ++i) {
        cl_device_id devices[10];
        cl_uint numDevices;
        clGetDeviceIDs(platforms[i], CL_DEVICE_TYPE_ALL, 10, devices, &numDevices);

        for(cl_uint j = 0; j < numDevices; ++j){
            cl_uint computeUnits;
            clGetDeviceInfo(devices[j], CL_DEVICE_MAX_COMPUTE_UNITS, sizeof(cl_uint), &computeUnits, nullptr);

            if (computeUnits > maxComputeUnits) {
                maxComputeUnits = computeUnits;
                bestDevice = devices[j];
            }

        }
    }
    
    if(bestDevice == nullptr){
      std::cerr << "No device found." << std::endl;
    }

    return bestDevice;
}


int main() {
    cl_device_id selectedDevice = selectDeviceByComputeUnits();
    if (selectedDevice != nullptr) {
        char deviceName[1024];
        clGetDeviceInfo(selectedDevice, CL_DEVICE_NAME, 1024, deviceName, nullptr);
        cl_uint computeUnits;
        clGetDeviceInfo(selectedDevice, CL_DEVICE_MAX_COMPUTE_UNITS, sizeof(cl_uint), &computeUnits, nullptr);

        std::cout << "Selected device: " << deviceName << " with " << computeUnits << " compute units." << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This example iterates through all available devices, retrieving the `CL_DEVICE_MAX_COMPUTE_UNITS` property. It tracks the device with the most compute units and ultimately selects this device. This shows a selection approach based on an important metric for throughput for certain types of workloads. Note that simply choosing a device with more compute units is not always the ideal choice, as memory bandwidth, clock speed and other properties can be equally or more important.

In summary, while OpenCL offers no automatic, out-of-the-box optimal device selection for maximum throughput, a careful examination of device characteristics exposed via the API, and a deliberate selection process tailored to the application, are critical.

I strongly recommend researching available OpenCL documentation and implementation-specific notes. Also, examining the specification document is essential. Vendor-provided SDKs often have examples and guidance, particularly AMD's ROCm and Intel's oneAPI. There are also several textbooks focused on OpenCL development. It’s vital to note that actual optimal selection will depend heavily on the specific hardware and computation performed. Benchmarking against various devices is crucial to validate performance conclusions drawn based on device parameters. Furthermore, carefully managing memory transfers and data layout is often crucial alongside device selection. Selecting a device wisely is a foundational step towards maximizing throughput.
