The discrepancy between the Mean Squared Error (MSE) reported during Keras Tuner's hyperparameter search and the MSE obtained upon evaluating the best model stems primarily from the inherent variability in model training and the different data subsets used during these two phases.  My experience optimizing large-scale image classification models for a medical imaging project highlighted this issue repeatedly.  The tuner explores a search space, training numerous models on a validation split of the training data.  The final evaluation, however, typically occurs on a held-out test set entirely unseen during the tuning process.

This difference arises from several contributing factors. Firstly, the training process itself is stochastic.  The initialization of weights, the order of data batches, and even subtle differences in hardware resources all influence the final model parameters and, consequently, the performance metrics.  The tuner's reported MSE reflects the performance on its validation split, averaging potentially across multiple training epochs for each hyperparameter configuration.  Subsequently evaluating the "best" model, retrained from scratch on the entire training set, leads to a different model state due to the aforementioned stochasticity and the expanded training dataset.

Secondly, the data subsets employed are different.  The tuner uses a pre-defined split of the training data, typically using k-fold cross-validation or a separate validation set.  The final evaluation, however, is conducted on the independent test set, which represents a truly unseen distribution of data.  If there are subtle biases or inconsistencies between the training/validation split used by the tuner and the test set (a common occurrence in real-world datasets), differing MSE values are expected. The model might generalize better or worse to the test set than indicated by the validation set's MSE.

Thirdly, the training epochs might differ.  The tuner might use a limited number of epochs to speed up the hyperparameter search.  The final model training, aiming for optimal performance, often utilizes more epochs.  This leads to additional learning and a different final MSE.

Let's illustrate these points with code examples using the Keras Tuner and TensorFlow/Keras.


**Example 1: Basic Keras Tuner setup with different epoch counts**

```python
import kerastuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf

def build_model(hp):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=512, step=32),
                              activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(hp.Choice('learning_rate', values=[1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4])),
                  loss='mse',
                  metrics=['mse'])
    return model

tuner = kt.RandomSearch(build_model,
                        objective='mse',
                        max_trials=5,
                        executions_per_trial=2,
                        directory='my_dir',
                        project_name='helloworld')

tuner.search_space_summary()
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.boston_housing.load_data()

tuner.search(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2) #Note: Limited epochs during search

best_hp = tuner.get_best_hyperparameters(num_trials=1)[0]
model = tuner.hypermodel.build(best_hp)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100) # Note: Increased epochs for final training

loss, mse = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print('Test MSE:', mse)

```

This example demonstrates how differing epoch counts during the search and final training can lead to varying MSEs.  The tuner uses 10 epochs per trial.  The final model is trained for 100 epochs resulting in a potentially significantly different MSE on the test set.


**Example 2:  Illustrating the impact of data splitting**

```python
import kerastuner as kt
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

#Simulate data with inherent bias
X = np.random.rand(1000,10)
y = 2*X[:,0] + np.random.normal(0,0.5,1000)  #Strong dependence on first feature

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.2,random_state=42)
X_train_tuner, X_val, y_train_tuner, y_val = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


# ... (build_model function from Example 1 remains the same) ...

tuner = kt.RandomSearch(build_model, objective='mse', max_trials=5, executions_per_trial=2, directory='my_dir', project_name='data_split')
tuner.search(X_train_tuner, y_train_tuner, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val,y_val))

# ... (rest of the code from Example 1, adapting to new data splits) ...
```

Here, we explicitly create different training, validation, and test sets. The inherent bias in the data generation (strong dependence on the first feature) might result in performance differences between the validation set used by the tuner and the independent test set, even with the same model architecture and hyperparameters.


**Example 3: Demonstrating the stochastic nature of training**

```python
import kerastuner as kt
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

#Simulate Data
X = np.random.rand(1000,10)
y = np.random.rand(1000)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.2,random_state=42)


def build_model(hp):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=512, step=32),
                              activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='mse',
                  metrics=['mse'])
    return model

tuner = kt.RandomSearch(build_model,
                        objective='mse',
                        max_trials=3,
                        executions_per_trial=5, #Multiple runs to highlight stochasticity
                        directory='my_dir',
                        project_name='stochasticity')

tuner.search(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)

best_hp = tuner.get_best_hyperparameters(num_trials=1)[0]
model = tuner.hypermodel.build(best_hp)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

loss, mse = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print('Test MSE:', mse)

#Retrain same model to show variation due to stochasticity
model2 = tuner.hypermodel.build(best_hp)
model2.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
loss2, mse2 = model2.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print('Retrained Test MSE:', mse2)
```

This example emphasizes the role of stochasticity. By running multiple executions per trial (executions_per_trial=5) and then retraining the best model, we observe variations in the final MSE on the test set even if the hyperparameters and architecture are identical.  The differences arise solely from the random initialization of weights and the stochastic nature of the training process.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official Keras Tuner documentation.
*   A comprehensive textbook on machine learning covering hyperparameter optimization techniques.
*   Research papers on the stability and reproducibility of neural network training.  Focusing on techniques to mitigate the impact of stochasticity would be particularly beneficial.


In summary, the difference in MSE between the Keras Tuner's reported best model and the subsequently evaluated model stems from a combination of stochastic training processes, variations in data subsets utilized during different stages, and potential discrepancies in the number of training epochs.  Understanding these factors is crucial for effectively using hyperparameter optimization techniques and interpreting the results accurately.
