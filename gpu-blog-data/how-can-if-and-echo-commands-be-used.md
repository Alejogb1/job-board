Conditional execution and output redirection are fundamental aspects of shell scripting.  My experience integrating these functionalities into large-scale data processing pipelines has highlighted the importance of precise conditional logic and robust error handling when combining `if` statements with `echo` and mail utilities.  The efficacy of this approach hinges on a clear understanding of shell syntax, especially regarding command substitution and proper quoting.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `if` statement provides conditional execution; it evaluates a test condition and executes a block of commands only if the condition is true.  The general syntax is:

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
  commands
elif [ condition ]; then
  commands
else
  commands
fi
```

The `[ ]` (or its equivalent `test`) is a command that evaluates the condition.  A non-zero exit code from `[ ]` indicates a false condition; zero indicates true.  Multiple conditions can be chained using `elif` (else if). The `echo` command displays text to the standard output.  Combining these, we can conditionally print text to the console.  To send output via email, we leverage the `mail` command (or a more sophisticated MTA like `sendmail` depending on the system configuration). This usually requires configuring your system to send email correctly (setting up an SMTP server, potentially).  The key is to capture the output of `echo` and redirect it as input to the `mail` command.

Command substitution, using backticks `` `command` `` or `$(command)`, is crucial. It allows capturing the output of a command and using it within another command. This is indispensable when constructing email bodies dynamically based on the conditional output.  Furthermore, proper quoting, especially when dealing with variables containing spaces or special characters, is essential to avoid unexpected behavior and maintain script robustness.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Conditional printing to console:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

file_exists="/tmp/my_file.txt"

if [ -f "$file_exists" ]; then
  echo "The file '$file_exists' exists."
else
  echo "The file '$file_exists' does not exist."
fi
```

*This script checks if a file exists.  The `-f` test operator verifies a file's existence. Note the use of double quotes around the variable `$file_exists`. This handles filenames containing spaces correctly. The script prints an appropriate message based on the file's existence.*


**Example 2: Conditional emailing of results:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

user_input="test string"

if [[ "$user_input" == "test string" ]]; then
  email_body=$(echo "User input matched: $user_input")
  echo "$email_body" | mail -s "User Input Match" myemail@example.com
else
  echo "User input did not match."
fi
```

*This script checks if a user input string matches a specific value. If it matches, it constructs an email body using command substitution and pipes it to the `mail` command.  The `-s` option sets the email subject.  Remember to replace `myemail@example.com` with a valid email address. The use of `[[ ]]` is preferred over `[ ]` for more complex string comparisons.*


**Example 3:  Error handling and conditional output:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

command_output=$(some_command 2>&1) # Captures both stdout and stderr

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then # Check exit status of the command
  echo "Command successful. Output: $command_output"
  echo "$command_output" | mail -s "Command Success" myemail@example.com
else
  echo "Command failed with error: $command_output"
  echo "Error: $command_output" | mail -s "Command Failure" myemail@example.com
fi

```

*This script executes a fictional `some_command` and checks its exit status using `$?`.  `2>&1` redirects standard error (stderr) to standard output (stdout), ensuring that both are captured in `command_output`.  The script sends an email reporting success or failure, including the command output for debugging purposes.  Robust error handling is crucial for production scripts.*


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, consult your system's `man` pages for `if`, `echo`, `mail`, and `test` or `[ ]`.  Thorough exploration of shell scripting tutorials focusing on command substitution, quoting, and input/output redirection is recommended.  Advanced texts on Unix/Linux system administration will offer comprehensive coverage of these concepts within the broader context of shell programming.  Finally, reviewing examples in existing shell scripts, particularly those involving conditional logic and email notifications, will prove beneficial.  Pay close attention to error handling and best practices employed in such scripts.  This practical experience will significantly enhance your ability to effectively utilize `if`, `echo`, and `mail` for conditional output management.
