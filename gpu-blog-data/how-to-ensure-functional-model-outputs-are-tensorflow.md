The core challenge in ensuring functional model outputs are TensorFlow layers lies in understanding the distinction between a TensorFlow `Layer` object and the tensor output of a layer's `call` method.  Many functional models inadvertently treat the output tensor as the layer itself, leading to issues in subsequent model construction and training.  My experience building large-scale recommendation systems has highlighted this repeatedly, particularly when integrating custom layers into complex architectures.  The solution hinges on correctly wrapping the output computation within a custom `Layer` subclass.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A TensorFlow functional model is constructed by connecting layers sequentially, with the output of one layer serving as the input to the next.  Crucially, each layer in this sequence *must* be a `tf.keras.layers.Layer` instance.  While a layer's `call` method produces a tensor, this tensor is not the layer itself.  Attempting to connect tensors directly instead of layers will result in an incompatible model structure, preventing proper weight tracking, serialization, and training.

To illustrate, consider a simplified scenario:  you want to create a functional model that first applies a convolutional layer, then a dense layer, and finally a custom normalization layer.  An incorrect approach would be to directly connect the output tensors of each layer. The correct approach involves defining a custom layer that encapsulates the normalization logic and returns a `tf.Tensor` object as the output of the layer's `call` method.  This custom layer then becomes a proper component within the functional model.

Failing to encapsulate the computation within a `Layer` subclass will preclude the model from correctly managing the trainable weights within the normalization function. The weights would not be tracked by the optimizer, hindering the backpropagation process and rendering the training ineffective. Furthermore, the lack of a proper layer object prevents model saving and loading. The model architecture would lack the necessary metadata about your custom normalization process.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Approach – Tensors as Model Components:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect:  Directly connecting tensor outputs
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1))
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

x = tf.keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
conv_output = conv_layer(x)
dense_output = dense_layer(conv_output) #this is valid but the next line is not.

# This is incorrect.  dense_output is a tensor, not a layer.
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=x, outputs=dense_output) #Error would occur during model compilation or training
```

This example demonstrates the erroneous practice of directly using the output tensor (`dense_output`) as the model's output.  The resulting `model` object will not function correctly because the model architecture is incomplete. The model lacks the structural information necessary to trace the flow, and especially it cannot manage the weights involved in the convolutional and dense layers.

**Example 2: Correct Approach – Custom Layer for Normalization:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomNormalization(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(CustomNormalization, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.l2_normalize(inputs, axis=-1)

conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1))
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
norm_layer = CustomNormalization()

x = tf.keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
conv_output = conv_layer(x)
dense_output = dense_layer(conv_output)
normalized_output = norm_layer(dense_output)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=x, outputs=normalized_output)
```

Here, the normalization logic is encapsulated within the `CustomNormalization` layer. This is the crucial step. The `call` method processes the input and returns a tensor, but the `CustomNormalization` object itself is a proper `tf.keras.layers.Layer`, allowing the model to manage it correctly.

**Example 3: Correct Approach –  Complex Custom Layer with Multiple Outputs:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MultiOutputLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units1, units2, **kwargs):
        super(MultiOutputLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units1)
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units2)

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        y = self.dense2(inputs)
        return [x, y]  # Returning a list of tensors is acceptable

input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,))
output_list = MultiOutputLayer(5, 2)(input_layer)  #Note the use of list unpacking

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_list)
```

This demonstrates a more complex custom layer with multiple outputs. The `call` method returns a list of tensors, which is perfectly acceptable for functional models.  The key remains that the `MultiOutputLayer` is a properly defined `tf.keras.layers.Layer` subclass, ensuring compatibility within the model structure.  The model will correctly manage the weights within `dense1` and `dense2`.  This structure is useful when building models with auxiliary outputs or multi-task learning scenarios.  In this scenario, the returned list maintains the correct layer information for each branch of the output.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on custom layers and functional models, provides invaluable details.  A thorough understanding of object-oriented programming principles in Python will also significantly aid in this area.  Reviewing the source code of existing Keras layers can offer insightful examples of proper layer implementation.  Finally, focusing on understanding the differences between TensorFlow tensors and Keras layers is critical.  A strong foundation in linear algebra and calculus is essential to fully grasp the underlying mathematical principles of deep learning and thus the proper functioning of layers within models.
