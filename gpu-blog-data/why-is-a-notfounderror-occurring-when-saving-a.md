The `NotFoundError` during model saving with `pickle`, especially when occurring seemingly intermittently, often stems from a discrepancy between the environment where the model was trained and where the model is being saved. Specifically, `pickle` serializes Python objects, including their class definitions and module paths. If those paths are inaccessible or have changed at the time of saving, the deserialization process (used internally during saving when verifying pickle) raises `NotFoundError`.

I have encountered this frequently during my experience deploying machine learning models. Let me illustrate why this happens. When you train a model, letâ€™s say a scikit-learn classifier, its internal structure, including references to the specific versions of libraries and potentially custom classes, are encoded into the pickle string. This encoded information contains absolute references to the classes and modules used. For example, if you train a model while your environment is in a virtualenv located at `/home/user/venv`, and then attempt to save the model while operating from a different directory, or even a different user context entirely, the pickled object may not find the exact file paths to deserialize. This is why intermittent failures are common, as slight differences in the active environment, even if using the same code, can produce the error.

The critical factor is that `pickle` saves not only the *data* of your object, like weights in a neural network, but also *how* to recreate the object. This includes the locations of necessary modules and the class definitions. If the paths change or modules are missing, the deserialization phase that `pickle` uses before actually saving to disk will trigger the `NotFoundError`. To put this another way, pickling implicitly calls __reduce__, which includes __getstate__, and then the unpickling process, or in this case the internal verification call, uses those results. A discrepancy in class location causes problems at the unpickling stage.

Let's examine some practical scenarios, each demonstrating variations of this core issue:

**Code Example 1: Environment Mismatch with Custom Class**

```python
import pickle
import os
import shutil

# Simulate a custom class that will cause issues when pickled and relocated
class MyModel:
    def __init__(self, param):
        self.param = param
    def predict(self, input_data):
        return input_data * self.param

# Original Training Environment (simulated)
temp_dir = 'temp_env_dir'
os.makedirs(temp_dir, exist_ok=True)
os.chdir(temp_dir) # mimic operating inside the training env
# Save the model in the simulated environment
model = MyModel(2)
with open('my_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)

os.chdir('..') # now outside the training env
shutil.rmtree(temp_dir) # remove simulated training env

#Attempt to reload it in a different environment (simulated)
try:
    with open('temp_env_dir/my_model.pkl', 'rb') as f: # trying to open the file in the original context path
         pickle.load(f)
except FileNotFoundError as e: # will error because of the temp_dir folder being gone
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Now simulate loading the same pickle without the original context folder but same class definition

class MyModel: # re-define the class in current context
  def __init__(self, param):
      self.param = param
  def predict(self, input_data):
      return input_data * self.param

try:
  with open('temp_env_dir/my_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
         loaded_model = pickle.load(f) # this should now work
         print(f"Loaded model with param: {loaded_model.param}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error after re-defining class: {e}")

shutil.rmtree('temp_env_dir', ignore_errors=True) # cleanup temp folder
```

**Commentary:**
In this first example, I create a simplified custom class `MyModel`. I simulate creating a model using this class inside a temporary directory and then remove this temporary directory. If the pickle is loaded from the absolute path to the temporary directory *without* having the temporary directory present, it fails with a `FileNotFoundError`, as expected. If we redefine the class, it loads correctly. If you try the above code, the first attempt will fail with `FileNotFoundError` since the directory is gone. The second attempt will load the pickle successfully.

**Code Example 2: Module Versioning Issues**
```python
import pickle
import sklearn
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from packaging import version

# Simulate training with a specific library version
print(f"Sklearn version: {sklearn.__version__}")
if version.parse(sklearn.__version__) >= version.parse("1.4.0"):
  model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42) # a version > 1.4.0
else:
   model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', random_state=42) # older version

model.fit([[0, 1], [1, 0]], [0, 1]) # simplified training

with open('logreg_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)


# Simulate a different environment
# The following try/except will likely error if you try running the code again
# after upgrading sklearn in your environment and try to load old pickles
try:
    with open('logreg_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
       loaded_model = pickle.load(f)
    print("Model loaded successfully, however it might have issues...")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Model Load Failed: {e}")
```

**Commentary:**

Here, I've used the scikit-learn library and demonstrate a potential problem caused by library version differences.  While `pickle` might still load the model, a different version of the library can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the internal representation of a model object has changed. This version-related issue is a variant of the main issue: a change in the environment in which a pickled model is used compared with the environment it was pickled. The pickled object contains references to the library's specific classes, and these references can break if the class definition at the target location changes.

**Code Example 3: Relative Imports in Pickled Objects**
```python
import pickle
import os

# Create a folder structure
os.makedirs('my_module', exist_ok=True)
with open('my_module/__init__.py', 'w') as f:
    f.write("")

with open('my_module/my_class.py', 'w') as f:
    f.write("""
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def get_value(self):
        return self.value
    """)

from my_module.my_class import MyClass

# Save an object
instance = MyClass(5)
with open("my_instance.pkl", "wb") as file:
   pickle.dump(instance, file)

# Simulate Loading from elsewhere
try:
    import os
    from my_module.my_class import MyClass
    with open("my_instance.pkl", "rb") as file:
        loaded_instance = pickle.load(file)
    print(f"Loaded Value: {loaded_instance.get_value()}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during load: {e}")

import shutil
shutil.rmtree("my_module")
```

**Commentary:**

This example involves a custom module structure. Even though the code seems simple, problems can arise with more complex models if these modules are not accessible from the point where you are trying to load the pickled model. If the module path is not available or the folder structure changes, this will lead to failures. Here it loads successfully, but this is not guaranteed to work, especially if you are deploying the model in a more restrictive context where relative imports might not be supported. Notice that if you delete the `my_module` folder before loading, then the `FileNotFoundError` is raised.

To mitigate these issues, several strategies are useful.  Firstly, ensure that the environment in which you are saving the pickled object closely matches the environment from where you intend to load it. This involves precise control of installed library versions. Conda environments or virtual environments can be used to maintain this consistency. Secondly, using a more robust serialization format such as ONNX can decouple the trained model's architecture from the specific python environment used to train it. Third, it is often useful to explicitly handle the __getstate__ and __setstate__ methods of your custom classes in case they have object attributes that do not serialize easily.

For further research, consult Python's official documentation on pickling, and study strategies for managing package dependencies using tools such as Conda or pip. Deep learning frameworks documentation often contains specific recommendations for model serialization and deployment strategies. Reading these official sources and applying the concepts in these examples will help you effectively address `NotFoundError` during pickle-based model saving.
