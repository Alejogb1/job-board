The core difference between `tf.keras.layers.CuDNNGRU` and `tf.keras.layers.GRU` lies in their underlying implementation and associated hardware acceleration.  `CuDNNGRU` leverages NVIDIA's cuDNN library for significantly faster processing on compatible NVIDIA GPUs, while the standard `GRU` layer uses a TensorFlow-native implementation, often relying on CPU computation or less optimized GPU kernels. This performance discrepancy is crucial when dealing with large-scale recurrent neural networks.  My experience optimizing LSTM and GRU models for time-series forecasting highlighted this disparity numerous times.

**1. Clear Explanation of Conversion and Implications:**

Directly converting a model using `CuDNNGRU` to one employing `GRU` involves replacing the layer instances. However, this is not a simple substitution; the resulting model will likely exhibit performance differences.  The speed advantage of `CuDNNGRU` is considerable, particularly for long sequences.  Therefore, replacing it with `GRU` will almost certainly result in a slower training and inference process.  The magnitude of this slowdown is dependent on factors such as sequence length, batch size, and hardware capabilities.

Furthermore, the precise numerical results might also differ subtly. This is due to variations in the underlying algorithms and floating-point arithmetic operations between cuDNN and the TensorFlow implementation. While usually minor, these differences can become relevant for sensitive applications where precise reproducibility is paramount.  In my previous work on anomaly detection in network traffic, these subtle discrepancies necessitated careful consideration of the appropriate layer choice based on the criticality of prediction accuracy versus training time.

The conversion process itself is straightforward in terms of code modification, but requires understanding the potential performance penalty and the possibility of slight output variations.  Thorough testing and validation are essential after the substitution.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Original Model with CuDNNGRU:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model_cudnn = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_len),
  tf.keras.layers.CuDNNGRU(64, return_sequences=True),
  tf.keras.layers.CuDNNGRU(32),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_cudnn.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This example showcases a simple sequential model utilizing two `CuDNNGRU` layers.  The `return_sequences=True` argument in the first layer is crucial, as it ensures that the output from this layer is a sequence, which is then passed to the subsequent `CuDNNGRU` layer.  The final `Dense` layer performs the classification task.  Note the dependence on a GPU with CUDA support for optimal performance.

**Example 2: Converted Model with GRU:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model_gru = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_len),
  tf.keras.layers.GRU(64, return_sequences=True),
  tf.keras.layers.GRU(32),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_gru.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This is the direct equivalent of Example 1, with `CuDNNGRU` layers replaced by `GRU` layers. The architecture remains identical, preserving the model's structure. The key difference lies in the execution engine: the CPU or a less-optimized GPU kernel will be utilized instead of the cuDNN library.  Expect a significant decrease in training speed.

**Example 3:  Handling potential shape inconsistencies:**

While unlikely,  differences in internal state handling between `CuDNNGRU` and `GRU` might lead to subtle shape discrepancies.  This can be addressed using appropriate reshaping layers if necessary.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model_gru_adjusted = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_len),
  tf.keras.layers.GRU(64, return_sequences=True),
  tf.keras.layers.Reshape((32, 2)), # Example adjustment, adapt as needed
  tf.keras.layers.GRU(32),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_gru_adjusted.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This illustrates a potential scenario where a `Reshape` layer is introduced to handle any inconsistencies in the output shape of the first `GRU` layer. The specific shape adjustment (`(32,2)`) is illustrative and will depend entirely on the observed incompatibility.  This scenario is less frequent but highlights the necessity of rigorous testing after the conversion.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of recurrent neural networks, I recommend exploring comprehensive textbooks on deep learning.  Focusing on the TensorFlow documentation for both `CuDNNGRU` and `GRU` layers will provide crucial detail regarding their respective functionalities and limitations.  Furthermore, referring to  publications detailing the implementation of cuDNN and its performance characteristics will offer valuable insight into the performance advantages of the accelerated version.  Finally, review papers comparing different GRU implementations will provide a better perspective on the subtle differences that can arise between different implementations.
