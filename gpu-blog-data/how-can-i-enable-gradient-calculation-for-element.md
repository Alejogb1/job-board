The core issue lies in understanding the autograd engine's behavior regarding leaf nodes and their `requires_grad` attribute within a computational graph.  In my experience debugging complex neural networks, I've frequently encountered scenarios where seemingly straightforward operations—particularly those involving tensor slicing or indexing—unexpectedly disable gradient calculation for specific elements.  The key to resolving this is not simply setting `requires_grad=True` on the parent tensor, but ensuring the operation creating element 0 is itself differentiable and retains gradient information.  This often requires careful consideration of the indexing operation's implications for the autograd process.

**1. Clear Explanation**

PyTorch's autograd system dynamically builds a computational graph, tracking operations and their dependencies.  When `requires_grad=True` is set on a tensor, the autograd engine tracks its operations, allowing for backpropagation to calculate gradients. However, indexing operations, while seemingly simple, can break this chain of differentiability.  If element 0 is obtained through an indexing operation that isn't differentiable, the gradient for that element will be `None`, even if the parent tensor has `requires_grad=True`.  Differentiability in this context hinges on the operation being continuous and having well-defined derivatives.  Simple indexing – using `tensor[0]` – is non-differentiable because the index is a constant and doesn't participate in the gradient calculation.  To enable gradient calculation, one must employ differentiable operations that preserve the gradient flow to element 0.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Incorrect Approach - Non-Differentiable Indexing**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(5, requires_grad=True)
element_zero = x[0]  # Non-differentiable indexing

y = element_zero * 2
y.backward()

print(x.grad)  # Output: None or a tensor with only the zeroth element as None.
```

This approach fails because direct indexing `x[0]` creates a detached tensor; the resulting `element_zero` is not part of the computational graph.  The `backward()` call attempts to compute gradients, but the absence of a gradient path from `y` to `x[0]` results in a `None` gradient for the zeroth element.


**Example 2: Correct Approach - Using `torch.gather`**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(5, requires_grad=True)
indices = torch.tensor([0])
element_zero = torch.gather(x, 0, indices)

y = element_zero * 2
y.backward()

print(x.grad) # Output: A tensor with a gradient for element 0
```

`torch.gather` is a differentiable operation. It selects elements from a tensor based on provided indices. The indices are themselves tensors which can influence the gradient calculation. Because `indices` is a tensor, the operation becomes differentiable, allowing the gradient to flow back to `x[0]`.

**Example 3: Correct Approach - Using a Mask**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(5, requires_grad=True)
mask = torch.tensor([1, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=torch.bool)  #Boolean mask selecting only element 0
element_zero = torch.masked_select(x, mask)

y = element_zero * 2
y.backward()
print(x.grad)  # Output: A tensor with a gradient for element 0

```

This method employs a boolean mask to select only element 0.  `torch.masked_select` is a differentiable operation that returns a view of the original tensor, retaining the gradient connection.  The mask itself could be a parameter within a neural network, dynamically changing the selected element.

These examples demonstrate the crucial role of choosing differentiable operations when handling tensor elements and calculating gradients.  Simply setting `requires_grad=True` on the parent tensor is insufficient; the operation accessing the element must also participate in the autograd process.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of PyTorch's autograd system, I strongly advise reviewing the official PyTorch documentation's sections on automatic differentiation.  Furthermore, exploring resources dedicated to computational graphs and backpropagation within the context of deep learning will enhance your comprehension of the underlying mechanisms.  Finally, I'd recommend practicing with various tensor operations and observing their effect on gradient calculation through experimentation and careful debugging. This hands-on approach solidifies understanding more effectively than passive reading alone.  These resources, used in conjunction with diligent coding practice, are instrumental in mastering the nuances of gradient calculation in PyTorch.  The level of detail in these materials varies, so choose levels appropriate for your current skillset and desired depth of knowledge.  Don’t hesitate to work through examples and modify them to test your understanding.
