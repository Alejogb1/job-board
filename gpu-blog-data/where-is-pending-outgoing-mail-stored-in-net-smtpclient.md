The .NET `SmtpClient` class, unlike a fully-fledged mail server, does not inherently manage a persistent, pending outgoing mail queue on the file system or in a database. Instead, the handling of pending messages is largely an ephemeral process occurring within the application’s execution context. The `SmtpClient`'s primary function is to establish a connection with an SMTP server and relay messages to that server for further processing and eventual delivery. Therefore, messages are not typically "stored" in a persistent location by `SmtpClient` itself while waiting to be sent; their temporary state resides primarily in memory until a successful send attempt is concluded or an exception occurs.

The process begins when you call the `Send` method (or its asynchronous equivalent). Internally, the `SmtpClient` utilizes the underlying network stack to open a socket connection to the specified SMTP server. The message, represented as a `MailMessage` object, is then formatted into a sequence of SMTP commands, including `MAIL FROM`, `RCPT TO`, `DATA`, and others. This formatted stream of commands and message content is transmitted over the socket. If this process completes without errors, the SMTP server acknowledges receipt of the message (typically with a 250 OK status code). At this point, the `SmtpClient` considers the send operation to be completed.

However, it is crucial to understand that the responsibility of holding and managing unsent messages shifts entirely to the external SMTP server immediately upon successful transmission by `SmtpClient`. If the SMTP server is unable to deliver the message to the recipient for whatever reason (e.g., mailbox full, server down, recipient address invalid), it is the SMTP server's responsibility to manage the failed delivery attempts and any related actions (such as returning an error message to the sender). `SmtpClient` does not possess the mechanisms for re-transmission, queuing, or handling deferred deliveries at the client application level. Therefore, an application architecturally must address these complexities.

Consider that an application may need to handle temporary SMTP server issues or other failures. In such scenarios, implementing a durable queue becomes a requirement within the application itself. This requires additional application logic beyond the straightforward use of `SmtpClient`. The application would store the message in a persistent storage medium (such as a database or a message queue) and then attempt to re-send the message after the issue has been resolved. This also necessitates building mechanisms for detecting failures in the transmission of messages as acknowledged by the SMTP server and marking the message as unsent, allowing another retry operation.

To further clarify the practical implications, I'll present several examples based on previous experience where understanding these mechanics was critical.

**Code Example 1: Basic synchronous send operation**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Mail;

public class EmailSender
{
    public static void SendEmail(string fromAddress, string toAddress, string subject, string body, string smtpServer, int smtpPort, string smtpUser, string smtpPassword)
    {
        using (var mailMessage = new MailMessage(fromAddress, toAddress, subject, body))
        {
            using (var smtpClient = new SmtpClient(smtpServer, smtpPort))
            {
                smtpClient.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(smtpUser, smtpPassword);
                smtpClient.EnableSsl = true;
                try
                {
                    smtpClient.Send(mailMessage);
                    Console.WriteLine("Email sent successfully.");
                }
                catch (SmtpFailedRecipientException ex)
                {
                  Console.WriteLine($"Email failed to send to recipient: {ex.FailedRecipient}, Error Message: {ex.Message}");
                }
                 catch (SmtpException ex)
                 {
                   Console.WriteLine($"SMTP Exception: {ex.Message}");
                 }
                catch (Exception ex)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"General error: {ex.Message}");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this basic example, the application directly sends the email synchronously using `smtpClient.Send(mailMessage)`. This method is synchronous, meaning the thread calling it will block until the operation is completed or an exception is raised. The `try-catch` block handles several specific exception types. Any issue during the connection or during the transmission will throw an exception. The message data exists in memory only until the send operation completes and is not stored on disk or elsewhere in a queue. The success or failure of transmission directly relates to the operation’s execution.

**Code Example 2: Asynchronous send operation and handling exceptions**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Mail;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class AsyncEmailSender
{
    public static async Task SendEmailAsync(string fromAddress, string toAddress, string subject, string body, string smtpServer, int smtpPort, string smtpUser, string smtpPassword)
    {
        using (var mailMessage = new MailMessage(fromAddress, toAddress, subject, body))
        {
            using (var smtpClient = new SmtpClient(smtpServer, smtpPort))
            {
                smtpClient.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(smtpUser, smtpPassword);
                smtpClient.EnableSsl = true;
                try
                {
                    await smtpClient.SendMailAsync(mailMessage);
                    Console.WriteLine("Email sent successfully asynchronously.");
                }
                catch (SmtpFailedRecipientException ex)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"Email failed to send to recipient: {ex.FailedRecipient}, Error Message: {ex.Message}");
                }
                 catch (SmtpException ex)
                {
                   Console.WriteLine($"SMTP Exception: {ex.Message}");
                 }
                catch (Exception ex)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"General error: {ex.Message}");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This example illustrates asynchronous sending using `smtpClient.SendMailAsync(mailMessage)`. This approach is non-blocking, allowing the application to continue its operations while the message is sent in the background. Again, the message itself is transient; the asynchronous nature does not change where the mail data is stored, which is still in the application's memory until the send operation is done. The `await` keyword ensures that execution resumes after the asynchronous operation completes. This asynchronous send method also uses the same `try-catch` blocks to capture exceptions during the transmission. The difference is the non-blocking character of the send call, which improves scalability.

**Code Example 3: Implementing basic message queuing with database**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Mail;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

public class QueuedEmailSender
{
    private static string _connectionString = "YourConnectionStringHere";

    public static async Task QueueEmailAsync(string fromAddress, string toAddress, string subject, string body, string smtpServer, int smtpPort, string smtpUser, string smtpPassword)
    {
       var emailId = Guid.NewGuid();
        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
       {
           await connection.OpenAsync();
           using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("INSERT INTO EmailQueue (Id, FromAddress, ToAddress, Subject, Body, SmtpServer, SmtpPort, SmtpUser, SmtpPassword, QueuedAt) VALUES (@Id, @FromAddress, @ToAddress, @Subject, @Body, @SmtpServer, @SmtpPort, @SmtpUser, @SmtpPassword, @QueuedAt)", connection))
            {
                command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Id", emailId);
                command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@FromAddress", fromAddress);
                command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@ToAddress", toAddress);
                command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Subject", subject);
                command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Body", body);
                command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@SmtpServer", smtpServer);
                command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@SmtpPort", smtpPort);
                command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@SmtpUser", smtpUser);
                command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@SmtpPassword", smtpPassword);
                command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@QueuedAt", DateTime.UtcNow);

                await command.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
                Console.WriteLine($"Email with Id {emailId} queued to be sent.");
            }
       }
    }

    public static async Task ProcessQueuedEmailsAsync()
    {
       using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString))
       {
            await connection.OpenAsync();
           using(SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT TOP 10 Id, FromAddress, ToAddress, Subject, Body, SmtpServer, SmtpPort, SmtpUser, SmtpPassword FROM EmailQueue ORDER BY QueuedAt",connection))
            {
                 using(SqlDataReader reader = await command.ExecuteReaderAsync())
                 {
                     while (await reader.ReadAsync())
                     {
                        var id = reader.GetGuid(0);
                        var fromAddress = reader.GetString(1);
                        var toAddress = reader.GetString(2);
                        var subject = reader.GetString(3);
                        var body = reader.GetString(4);
                        var smtpServer = reader.GetString(5);
                        var smtpPort = reader.GetInt32(6);
                        var smtpUser = reader.GetString(7);
                        var smtpPassword = reader.GetString(8);

                        try
                         {
                              await SendEmailAsync(fromAddress, toAddress, subject, body, smtpServer, smtpPort, smtpUser, smtpPassword);

                              using(SqlCommand deleteCommand = new SqlCommand("DELETE FROM EmailQueue WHERE Id = @Id", connection))
                              {
                                deleteCommand.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Id", id);
                                 await deleteCommand.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
                                  Console.WriteLine($"Successfully sent email with Id: {id}. Email deleted from queue.");
                               }
                        }
                       catch(Exception ex)
                       {
                           Console.WriteLine($"Error sending email with Id: {id}. Error: {ex.Message}.  Will attempt later");
                       }
                     }
                 }
            }
       }
    }

     private static async Task SendEmailAsync(string fromAddress, string toAddress, string subject, string body, string smtpServer, int smtpPort, string smtpUser, string smtpPassword)
    {
        using (var mailMessage = new MailMessage(fromAddress, toAddress, subject, body))
        {
            using (var smtpClient = new SmtpClient(smtpServer, smtpPort))
            {
                smtpClient.Credentials = new NetworkCredential(smtpUser, smtpPassword);
                smtpClient.EnableSsl = true;
                try
                {
                    await smtpClient.SendMailAsync(mailMessage);
                    Console.WriteLine("Email sent successfully asynchronously.");
                }
                 catch (SmtpFailedRecipientException ex)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"Email failed to send to recipient: {ex.FailedRecipient}, Error Message: {ex.Message}");

                 }
                catch (Exception ex)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"General error: {ex.Message}");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This last example implements basic message queuing in SQL Server.  `QueueEmailAsync` adds a new row to a `EmailQueue` table, capturing the message details.  `ProcessQueuedEmailsAsync` then fetches up to ten queued messages, attempts to send them, and deletes successfully sent messages from the table. This example illustrates the necessity to build additional application logic if you want a durable mail queue. The message is now persistently stored in the database and is not ephemeral. This implementation allows you to re-try message send operations if any exceptions are triggered, ensuring delivery is handled even during intermittent connection failures.

Regarding resources for further learning, I recommend exploring materials on the .NET `System.Net.Mail` namespace documentation for a comprehensive overview of `SmtpClient`'s API. In addition, articles focusing on resilient application architecture, distributed systems, and message queuing systems will be beneficial for implementing durable mail handling capabilities. Examining documentation for database systems like SQL Server, Postgresql, or message broker technologies like RabbitMQ or Kafka would also be highly valuable for more advanced solutions.
