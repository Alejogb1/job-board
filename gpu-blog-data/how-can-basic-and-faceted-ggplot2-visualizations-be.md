The core challenge in combining basic and faceted ggplot2 visualizations using `ggarrange` lies in managing the differing dimensions and aspect ratios inherent in the two approaches.  My experience working on data visualization projects for pharmaceutical efficacy studies highlighted this frequently.  Simple scatter plots often needed to be juxtaposed with faceted analyses showing drug response across different patient demographics, demanding careful consideration of layout aesthetics and overall communicative impact.  Successfully integrating these varied plots requires a nuanced understanding of `ggarrange`'s arguments, especially `nrow`, `ncol`, and the underlying `ggplot2` object properties.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

`ggarrange`, from the `ggpubr` package, provides a straightforward method for arranging multiple ggplot2 objects into a single figure.  However, when combining basic and faceted plots, discrepancies in plot dimensions can lead to uneven spacing and an aesthetically unappealing result.  This is because faceted plots inherently adjust their dimensions based on the number of facets and the data within each facet.  A basic scatter plot, in contrast, maintains a fixed size determined by its individual data and aesthetic parameters.  Therefore, direct concatenation using `ggarrange` without adjustments frequently results in one plot dominating the arrangement, or substantial whitespace unnecessarily separating the plots.

The solution involves leveraging two key strategies:  pre-defining plot dimensions using `ggsave` before incorporating plots into `ggarrange`, or adjusting the `widths` and `heights` arguments within `ggarrange` itself.  The former approach is generally preferred for greater control and reproducibility, while the latter provides a more rapid, though less precise, solution suitable for less formal visualizations.  In either case, careful consideration of the relative sizes and aspect ratios of the basic and faceted plots is paramount for creating a visually balanced arrangement.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Pre-defining plot dimensions using `ggsave`:**

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100), group = factor(sample(1:3, 100, replace = TRUE)))

# Basic scatter plot
p1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Basic Scatter Plot")

# Faceted scatter plot
p2 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ group) +
  ggtitle("Faceted Scatter Plot")


# Save plots with specified dimensions to maintain aspect ratio during arrangement.
ggsave("p1.png", p1, width = 5, height = 4)
ggsave("p2.png", p2, width = 10, height = 6)


# Read saved plots as grobs
p1_grob <- readPNG("p1.png")
p2_grob <- readPNG("p2.png")

# Arrange using ggarrange (this example requires adjustment based on the actual dimensions).
ggarrange(p1_grob, p2_grob, nrow = 1, ncol = 2)
# Remove temporary files
unlink("p1.png")
unlink("p2.png")
```

This example uses `ggsave` to explicitly set the width and height of each plot before arranging them with `ggarrange`.  The `readPNG` function (from the `png` package) is used here; analogous functions exist for other formats (e.g. `readJPEG`).  This method ensures consistent plot sizing regardless of the underlying data. Note the careful adjustment of `width` and `height` parameters to reflect the expected sizes of the plot, which may require iterative refinement based on the data's influence on the faceted plot.


**Example 2: Adjusting `widths` and `heights` in `ggarrange`:**

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Sample data (same as Example 1)

# Basic and faceted plots (same as Example 1)

# Arrange using ggarrange with manual width adjustment
ggarrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1, ncol = 2, widths = c(1,2))
```

This example demonstrates a quicker method.  The `widths` argument allows for adjusting the relative widths of the plots. Here, we assign a width ratio of 1:2, giving the faceted plot more horizontal space. This approach is less precise than pre-defining dimensions but offers a convenient way to achieve a visually pleasing arrangement without external file manipulation.  Experimentation with different width ratios is often required to find the ideal balance.


**Example 3:  Handling complex facet layouts:**

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(gridExtra) # for arranging complex layouts

# Sample data with multiple faceting variables
data2 <- data.frame(x = rnorm(200), y = rnorm(200), group = factor(sample(1:3, 200, replace = TRUE)), subgroup = factor(sample(letters[1:2], 200, replace = TRUE)))

# Complex faceted plot
p3 <- ggplot(data2, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(group ~ subgroup) +
  ggtitle("Complex Faceted Plot")

# Arrange with a basic plot - `grid.arrange` may be needed for complex scenarios
grid.arrange(p1, p3, nrow = 1, ncol = 2, widths = c(1,2))
```

For more intricate facet arrangements (e.g., `facet_grid`), the default behavior of `ggarrange` may prove less intuitive.  In these situations,  `grid.arrange` from the `gridExtra` package offers greater control over plot placement and sizing within complex layouts.  This allows for more flexibility in arranging plots with significantly varying dimensions and facet structures.

The official ggplot2 documentation.  The ggpubr package vignette.  A comprehensive guide to data visualization with R (book recommendation).  An intermediate-level R graphics tutorial (online course recommendation).


This detailed response incorporates my experiences in adapting visualizations for diverse audiences and projects, emphasizing the necessity of careful dimension management when integrating differently structured ggplot2 objects using `ggarrange`. The examples demonstrate various techniques to address potential layout inconsistencies, offering both quick adjustments and a more precise approach using pre-defined plot dimensions.  The recommendation to consider `grid.arrange` for advanced facet layouts further underscores the need for flexibility and tailored solutions in constructing impactful data visualizations.
