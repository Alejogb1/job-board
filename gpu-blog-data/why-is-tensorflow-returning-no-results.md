TensorFlow's lack of output, particularly when expecting concrete results, often stems from a discrepancy between the computational graph defined and the actual execution of that graph. I've encountered this several times, frequently tracing it back to either incomplete session management, incorrect data feeding, or a failure to trigger the necessary operations within a TensorFlow session. It's rarely a bug within the core library itself, but rather an error in how the developer interacts with it.

**Explanation of Common Causes**

The core principle of TensorFlow involves constructing a symbolic computation graph first. This graph represents the sequence of operations you wish to perform. These operations are not executed until explicitly requested within a TensorFlow session. The graph itself is a static representation; it's like a blueprint for calculations. The most frequent mistake is that developers define this graph but fail to *evaluate* it within an active session. If no session is initiated or the necessary `session.run()` call isn't present for the relevant operations, TensorFlow remains silent. Nothing is calculated, and hence no output is generated.

Another frequent cause relates to the way input data is managed. TensorFlow placeholders are used to introduce external data into the graph at runtime. If these placeholders are not fed with the expected data via the `feed_dict` parameter during the `session.run()` call, the dependent operations might fail to produce meaningful results, or the evaluation might not even occur. Incorrect data shapes or types passed via the `feed_dict` can also lead to unexpected silent failures.

Furthermore, operations are executed based on dependencies. If the operation you intend to evaluate doesn’t depend on a chain of operations that ultimately connects to variables or placeholders, that operation will never be executed. For instance, building a graph for training without actually including operations such as optimization or loss calculation in the `session.run()` call, will not achieve anything.

Moreover, remember TensorFlow's lazy evaluation model. Operations are performed only when explicitly requested. If you define operations, particularly those involving intermediate computations but never actually ask for their result, the intermediate steps might be skipped. This might seem counterintuitive if you’re used to eager execution but it’s key to understand for proper TensorFlow usage.

**Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate these common pitfalls through three distinct scenarios.

**Example 1: Missing Session Execution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Graph definition
a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(10)
c = tf.add(a, b)

# We expect to see c=15, but nothing happens without running a session
print(c)
```

*Commentary:* In this example, we define a simple graph to add two constants. The print statement shows the symbolic representation of `c`, not its actual value. No numerical computation takes place because the graph is never executed within a session. TensorFlow has simply created a representation of what to calculate but hasn't done so yet. You'll see something similar to `<tf.Tensor 'Add:0' shape=() dtype=int32>` printed, not 15.

To rectify this, the code needs to be updated:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Graph definition
a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(10)
c = tf.add(a, b)

# Correct session execution to retrieve value
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  result = sess.run(c)
  print(result) # Output: 15
```

*Commentary:* Here, a TensorFlow session is initiated using the context manager (`with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess`). The `sess.run(c)` command tells TensorFlow to execute the graph necessary to compute the value of `c` which is then correctly printed. The session manages the execution of the graph, allocating resources and managing the flow of data.

**Example 2: Missing `feed_dict`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Placeholders
x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.int32)
y = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.int32)
z = tf.add(x, y)

# Session and execution but missing feed_dict
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(z)  # Error occurs here without values for x and y
    print(result)
```

*Commentary:* This example defines two placeholders, `x` and `y`, which are intended to receive external data. However, when `sess.run(z)` is called, we have not provided actual values for these placeholders through a `feed_dict`. Consequently, TensorFlow doesn't know what values to use for computation and will throw an error (in more recent versions) or potentially return an unexpected result in older versions, and it will not produce the desired output.

The corrected code is:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Placeholders
x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.int32)
y = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.int32)
z = tf.add(x, y)

# Correct session execution with feed_dict
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(z, feed_dict={x: 5, y: 10})
    print(result) # Output: 15
```

*Commentary:* The `feed_dict` parameter within `sess.run()` now specifies the values for the placeholders, allowing TensorFlow to compute the correct result. The dictionary keys correspond to the TensorFlow placeholder objects, and the values to the actual data being input.

**Example 3: Unconnected Operations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Variables
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((1, 1)))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((1, 1)))
x = tf.constant(5.0)

# Define linear regression
y = tf.add(tf.matmul(W, [[x]]), b)

# Loss definition (not used in run)
loss = tf.math.square(y - 10)

# Session execution, not evaluating loss
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
  y_val = sess.run(y)
  print(y_val) # Output based on random W and b. Not useful if training is the ultimate goal
```

*Commentary:* This more advanced case shows a basic linear regression setup. We initialize variables `W` and `b` and create a loss function `loss`. However, the session evaluation only includes `y`. While it technically outputs a value derived from random initializations of `W` and `b`, it doesn't perform any training or minimization because the `loss` operation or optimization steps weren't included in the `sess.run()` call. If the objective was to train the model and have `y` approach 10, you'd need the session to evaluate the optimizer/loss, and also potentially the predicted value from `y` using an updated `W` and `b`. The output here will only be based on a random initialization of `W` and `b`, and not based on any learning or training.

To address this, you would have to add optimization and updates to the computation graph, and execute those operations:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Variables
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((1, 1)))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((1, 1)))
x = tf.constant(5.0)

# Define linear regression
y = tf.add(tf.matmul(W, [[x]]), b)

# Loss definition
loss = tf.math.square(y - 10)

# Optimizer for training
optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.01).minimize(loss)

# Session and training
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    for _ in range(100): # Training loop
      _, loss_val = sess.run([optimizer, loss]) # Execute optimizer and loss
      y_val = sess.run(y)
    print(y_val) #Output closer to 10 after the training
```

*Commentary:* In this version, we’ve added an optimizer and used it in the session execution as well as the loss function. During the 100 iterations, the weight `W` and bias `b` will be adjusted towards a combination that brings the value of `y` closer to the target value of 10.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a more thorough understanding of TensorFlow and to resolve such issues, consult the following documentation resources:

1.  The official TensorFlow documentation offers comprehensive guides, API references, and tutorials. Focus on sections regarding sessions, placeholders, variables, and basic operations.

2.  Explore the TensorFlow guide section specifically relating to eager execution and graph construction. Understanding the interplay between these modes is crucial for avoiding unexpected behaviour.

3.  Review relevant examples in the TensorFlow model repository (if available) to gain practical experience with various TensorFlow concepts. Look at models that fit your use case and see how they execute sessions.

By thoroughly checking session management, data feeding and explicit execution of required operations within a session as outlined here, you will likely uncover the reasons for the lack of output and obtain the expected result in your TensorFlow projects. Careful review of the computational graph and intended operations is critical to a successful TensorFlow application.
