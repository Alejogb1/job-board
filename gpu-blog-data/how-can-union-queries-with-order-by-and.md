PostgreSQL's handling of `UNION` queries, especially when combined with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, can be significantly improved through careful consideration of query planning and execution.  My experience optimizing database performance for large-scale e-commerce applications has consistently highlighted the importance of understanding how PostgreSQL processes these constructs.  The key lies in recognizing that a naive `UNION ALL` followed by a single `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` leads to sorting potentially massive intermediate result sets, a computationally expensive operation.

**1. Understanding PostgreSQL's Query Processing:**

PostgreSQL's query planner analyzes the query structure to determine the most efficient execution path.  With `UNION ALL`, each `SELECT` statement is executed independently, and the results are concatenated.  Only then does the `ORDER BY` clause operate on this combined dataset.  This is problematic because the complete dataset must reside in memory or on disk before sorting can begin.  The `LIMIT` clause further complicates matters because even if only a small subset of the final result is required, the entire sorted intermediate result set must still be generated.  `UNION` (distinct) adds an additional overhead of duplicate removal after the concatenation.


**2. Optimization Strategies:**

The optimal approach involves mitigating the need for sorting a large intermediate result set. This can be achieved in several ways:

* **Using `UNION ALL` with subqueries and separate `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses:** This approach directs the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` operations to individual `SELECT` statements before the `UNION ALL` occurs.  This significantly reduces the size of the data being sorted and hence the computational cost.

* **Creating temporary tables or CTEs:** For complex queries involving multiple joins or subqueries within the `UNION` statements, creating temporary tables or common table expressions (CTEs) can improve performance.  This allows the optimizer to better analyze the query plan and potentially choose more efficient strategies.

* **Utilizing indexes:** Properly indexing columns used in `WHERE` clauses and the `ORDER BY` clause is crucial for efficient data retrieval and sorting.


**3. Code Examples:**

Let's illustrate these optimization techniques with examples.  Assume we have two tables, `products_electronics` and `products_clothing`, both with columns `product_id`, `name`, `price`.

**Example 1: Inefficient Approach**

```sql
SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM products_electronics
UNION ALL
SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM products_clothing
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query concatenates the entire result sets before sorting and applying the limit. This is highly inefficient for large tables.


**Example 2: Optimized Approach with Subqueries**

```sql
SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM (
    SELECT product_id, name, price
    FROM products_electronics
    ORDER BY price DESC
    LIMIT 5
) AS electronics_top5
UNION ALL
SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM (
    SELECT product_id, name, price
    FROM products_clothing
    ORDER BY price DESC
    LIMIT 5
) AS clothing_top5
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This revised query sorts and limits each table independently *before* applying the `UNION ALL`. This drastically reduces the amount of data involved in the final `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` operation.  It only combines the top 5 from each, then sorts and limits to 10.

**Example 3: Optimized Approach with CTEs**

```sql
WITH electronics_top5 AS (
    SELECT product_id, name, price
    FROM products_electronics
    ORDER BY price DESC
    LIMIT 5
),
clothing_top5 AS (
    SELECT product_id, name, price
    FROM products_clothing
    ORDER BY price DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM electronics_top5
UNION ALL
SELECT product_id, name, price
FROM clothing_top5
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This example employs CTEs to achieve the same effect as Example 2.  The use of CTEs can enhance readability and make the query easier to maintain, especially for more complex scenarios. The optimizer can also more readily determine the optimal execution plan with clearly defined sub-queries.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

To further enhance your understanding of PostgreSQL query optimization, I recommend exploring the official PostgreSQL documentation, particularly the sections on query planning and execution.  In addition, delve into resources covering indexing strategies and the use of `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for analyzing query performance.  Familiarize yourself with PostgreSQL's cost-based optimizer. Consider studying various query planning techniques and how different data types impact performance. Finally, practical experience through working on real-world projects is invaluable.  Through trial and error, you'll gain insights into what works best under different conditions and learn to identify performance bottlenecks efficiently.  Analyzing `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` outputs is essential for identifying and troubleshooting bottlenecks in your query execution plans.
