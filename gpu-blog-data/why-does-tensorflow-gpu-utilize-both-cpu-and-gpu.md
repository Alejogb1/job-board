TensorFlow’s seemingly paradoxical behavior of engaging both CPU and GPU resources when configured for GPU execution, particularly on a card like an RTX 3080, stems from its design as a hybrid computation framework rather than a purely GPU-driven engine. This is not a flaw or inefficiency; rather, it is a deliberate architectural choice to maximize performance across diverse workloads and hardware configurations. Over my years optimizing machine learning models, I’ve seen first-hand how understanding this interplay between CPU and GPU within TensorFlow is crucial for efficient resource utilization.

The core reason lies in the inherent nature of deep learning tasks, which often consist of a complex pipeline. This pipeline isn't entirely amenable to GPU acceleration. While the core matrix multiplications and convolutions that form the bulk of neural network computations excel on GPUs, other operations—such as data preprocessing, data loading, graph definition, and control flow management—are frequently faster on a CPU. Consequently, attempting to execute everything solely on the GPU often results in a significant performance bottleneck due to data transfer overhead and inefficient CPU-emulation of these typically CPU-bound tasks.

TensorFlow strategically assigns different parts of the computation graph to either the CPU or the GPU based on the type of operation and availability of hardware. This distribution is not static; it dynamically adjusts during runtime. Certain operations, such as I/O operations relating to file reading, or data manipulation using libraries such as NumPy, are invariably handled on the CPU, simply because the inherent design of these software libraries makes them more suitable for a CPU architecture. Similarly, even if you’ve assigned your entire graph to the GPU, operations to move data into the GPU memory or out of the GPU memory to the host, will necessarily need to be performed by the CPU.

Furthermore, TensorFlow’s internal graph representation enables asynchronous execution. When computationally expensive operations are assigned to the GPU, the CPU isn’t just idle; it’s busy preparing the next batch of data, managing the computation graph, and handling operations that do not require the parallel power of the GPU. This asynchronous behaviour allows the CPU and GPU to work in parallel, reducing overall computation times, particularly in workloads which involve a lot of I/O, or large transformations before the data is fed to the model.

To illustrate this, let’s examine some code examples.

**Example 1: Simple Matrix Multiplication**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

# Ensure TensorFlow uses the GPU if available
if tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'):
    print("GPU is available. Using GPU.")
    device = "/GPU:0"
else:
    print("GPU is not available. Using CPU.")
    device = "/CPU:0"

# Define two matrices
matrix_a = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000), dtype=tf.float32)
matrix_b = tf.random.normal((1000, 1000), dtype=tf.float32)

# Perform matrix multiplication on the specified device
with tf.device(device):
    start_time = time.time()
    result = tf.matmul(matrix_a, matrix_b)
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Matrix multiplication time on {device}: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
```

In this first example, even when running the `tf.matmul` operation on the GPU, the Python process executing the TensorFlow code still runs on the CPU. The CPU first creates the matrices, `matrix_a` and `matrix_b`. These matrices are stored in RAM, which is a part of the CPU’s memory space. The tensors are not initially stored in GPU memory. Then, during the computation within the `tf.device` context, TensorFlow manages data transfer, orchestrating the movement of `matrix_a` and `matrix_b` from CPU RAM to GPU memory, triggering the matrix multiplication on the GPU, retrieving the result, and storing it back into CPU RAM. The program also keeps track of timing using Python's `time.time()` function, which is inherently a CPU operation. The device assignment is explicit here, but TensorFlow's automatic device placement will make a similar selection based on available hardware and the operation being performed, if this context was absent.

**Example 2: Data Loading and Preprocessing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import time

# Check if GPU is available
if tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'):
    print("GPU is available. Using GPU for model.")
    device = "/GPU:0"
else:
    print("GPU is not available. Using CPU.")
    device = "/CPU:0"

# Simulate data loading and preprocessing on CPU
def load_and_preprocess_data(batch_size):
    start_time = time.time()
    # Simulate data loading (e.g., reading from a file, which is inherently a CPU bound operation)
    raw_data = np.random.rand(batch_size, 28, 28, 3) # simulates an image
    # Simulate data preprocessing using NumPy (CPU)
    processed_data = raw_data.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"CPU data loading and preprocessing time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
    return tf.convert_to_tensor(processed_data, dtype=tf.float32)

# Define a simple model on GPU
with tf.device(device):
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])

  # Run model
  batch_size = 64
  # Load data using CPU
  data = load_and_preprocess_data(batch_size)
  # Perform a forward pass
  predictions = model(data) # GPU operations here

  print("Model processing complete")
```

In this example, we clearly separate CPU-intensive operations from GPU computations. The `load_and_preprocess_data` function uses NumPy, running on the CPU. This simulates real-world scenarios where image loading, format conversion, and normalizations are often handled by libraries more suited for the CPU architecture. Even when the model runs on the GPU, the preprocessed data needs to be moved from CPU memory to the GPU’s memory. This transfer, while managed by TensorFlow, still uses CPU resources. This illustrates that even in models primarily executed on the GPU, a significant portion of the pipeline is running on the CPU, especially data loading and preprocessing, that might constitute an I/O bottleneck if not addressed correctly.

**Example 3: Asynchronous Execution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time
import threading

# Set up GPU usage if available
if tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'):
    print("GPU is available. Using GPU.")
    device = "/GPU:0"
else:
    print("GPU is not available. Using CPU.")
    device = "/CPU:0"

# Define a function that computes on the GPU
def gpu_compute_task(data):
    with tf.device(device):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = tf.matmul(data, data, transpose_b = True)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"GPU computation time: {end_time-start_time:.4f} seconds")
    return result

# Define a function that performs CPU-bound pre-processing
def cpu_preprocess_task(shape):
    start_time = time.time()
    # simulates some CPU heavy processing using NumPy
    data = tf.random.normal(shape, dtype=tf.float32)
    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"CPU preprocessing time: {end_time-start_time:.4f} seconds")
    return data

# Run computations asynchronously
data_shape = (1000, 1000)

gpu_thread = threading.Thread(target=gpu_compute_task, args=(cpu_preprocess_task(data_shape),))

gpu_thread.start()

gpu_thread.join()

print("Asynchronous processing complete")

```

This example simulates asynchronous behaviour. Here, two computationally intensive tasks are executed; a CPU bound task using random data generation and a GPU bound task using matrix multiplication. The critical part here is that, while the GPU is executing the matmul operation, which can take a significant amount of time, the CPU isn't idle. It handles the creation of the data for the matrix, and manages the asynchronous execution. Without this feature, our CPU would be completely blocked until the data creation is completed. This demonstrates how CPU and GPU often work in concert, with the CPU actively feeding work to the GPU. This is essential in keeping the GPU busy and maximizing its utilization.

The efficient use of CPU resources alongside the GPU is a core design principle of TensorFlow, particularly for complex deep learning workloads that aren't purely GPU-accelerated. The dynamic allocation of operations, data transfer orchestration, and asynchronous execution are all designed to make the best use of all the available hardware resources.

For further reading I suggest exploring books and papers on the following topics: Parallel Computing Architectures, TensorFlow Internals, and the interplay between Software and Hardware Optimization in Machine Learning. Furthermore, research papers related to modern hardware accelerators and the optimisation of deep learning workloads are also recommended. Resources describing best practices for training and deployment with TensorFlow would also prove invaluable.
