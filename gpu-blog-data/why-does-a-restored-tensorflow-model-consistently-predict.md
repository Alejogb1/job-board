The observed behavior—consistent prediction from a restored TensorFlow model unless the input is flipped—strongly suggests a symmetry inherent in the model's learned weights, likely stemming from either the dataset used for training or architectural limitations.  My experience debugging similar issues points to two primary culprits: insufficient data diversity and inappropriate convolutional filter design.

**1.  Explanation:**

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), frequently used in image processing tasks where TensorFlow excels, employ convolutional filters which learn features from input data. If the training dataset lacks sufficient variations in object orientation, the model may learn to recognize objects only in a specific orientation.  This leads to a bias where the model effectively only "sees" one specific aspect of the input.  Flipping the input then becomes necessary to expose the model to the unseen variations, triggering a different activation pattern within the network and consequently a different prediction.  This effect is exacerbated when using architectures lacking mechanisms to mitigate this, such as max pooling layers with aggressive down-sampling, which can prematurely discard crucial spatial information.  Furthermore, inadequate data augmentation during training can significantly contribute to this problem.


Another potential issue, less common but still relevant, is a flaw in the model's restoration process.  If the weights are not loaded correctly during the `tf.train.Saver` process, or if there's incompatibility between the saved model and the restoration environment (different TensorFlow versions, for instance), it could lead to unexpected behavior, potentially manifesting as this directional bias.  However, the consistency of the prediction strongly suggests a bias embedded in the learned weights themselves rather than a loading error.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**


**Example 1: Illustrating Data Augmentation Deficiency:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# ... (Model definition using tf.keras.Sequential, assuming a CNN architecture) ...

# Insufficient data augmentation: Only horizontal flips are applied
train_data = ... # Load training data, assume images are represented as NumPy arrays
train_labels = ... # Corresponding labels

augmented_train_data = []
augmented_train_labels = []

for image, label in zip(train_data, train_labels):
    augmented_train_data.append(image)
    augmented_train_labels.append(label)
    augmented_train_data.append(np.fliplr(image)) # only horizontal flip
    augmented_train_labels.append(label)

model.fit(np.array(augmented_train_data), np.array(augmented_train_labels), ...)

# ... (Model saving and restoration) ...
```

**Commentary:**  This example highlights a critical flaw:  only horizontal flips are performed during augmentation.  This limited augmentation fails to introduce the necessary variations in object orientation, leading to the observed prediction bias. Robust augmentation would involve vertical flips, rotations, and potentially more sophisticated transformations like shearing.


**Example 2: Demonstrating the Impact of Filter Design:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Model definition) ...

model.add(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same'))  # A typical convolutional layer

# ... (rest of the model) ...
```

**Commentary:**  The `padding='same'` argument ensures that the output feature maps have the same spatial dimensions as the input.  However, the inherent structure of the 3x3 convolutional filter itself can, if the data isn't diverse enough, contribute to the problem.  A small filter size, paired with insufficient training data variation, might lead to a filter learning directional features predominantly.  Experimenting with larger filter sizes (e.g., 5x5 or 7x7) or employing multiple convolutional layers with varying filter sizes can mitigate this issue by learning features at multiple scales and orientations.


**Example 3: Verifying Model Restoration Integrity:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Model training and saving) ...

# Model restoration
restored_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5') # Assuming .h5 format

# Check model architecture consistency
print(restored_model.summary())

# Test prediction consistency with both original and flipped images
original_image = ...
flipped_image = np.fliplr(original_image)

original_prediction = restored_model.predict(np.expand_dims(original_image, axis=0))
flipped_prediction = restored_model.predict(np.expand_dims(flipped_image, axis=0))

print("Original Prediction:", original_prediction)
print("Flipped Prediction:", flipped_prediction)
```

**Commentary:**  This code snippet illustrates a crucial step: verifying the restored model's architecture matches the saved model.  Discrepancies can lead to unpredictable behavior.  The final part explicitly compares predictions from both the original and the flipped image.  Significant differences in predictions demonstrate that the model's behavior is not solely determined by input orientation; this is a critical test to rule out simple loading issues.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further investigation, I would suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on data augmentation, CNN architecture design, and model saving/restoration. A thorough understanding of convolutional filters and their role in feature extraction is essential.  Explore research papers on data augmentation techniques, including those tailored for object recognition tasks.  Finally, studying best practices for model training and evaluation will be invaluable in debugging similar issues in the future.
