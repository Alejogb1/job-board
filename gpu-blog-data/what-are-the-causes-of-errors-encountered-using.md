The `fminsearch` and `fminbnd` functions in MATLAB, while powerful tools for optimization, frequently encounter errors stemming from ill-defined objective functions and limitations inherent in their algorithms. Specifically, `fminsearch`, a direct search method, is susceptible to issues related to local minima and poor initial guesses, whereas `fminbnd`, designed for bounded one-dimensional optimization, is prone to errors when the minimum falls outside the specified interval or the objective function lacks sufficient smoothness within the interval. I’ve encountered these problems countless times when developing optimal control algorithms and refining parameter estimations for complex mechanical systems.

`fminsearch` employs the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, which iteratively moves a simplex (a geometric figure with *n+1* vertices in *n* dimensions) around the search space. The algorithm contracts, expands, and reflects the simplex based on the function values at the vertices. A primary source of errors with `fminsearch` is premature convergence to a local minimum rather than the global minimum. This occurs particularly when the objective function presents numerous local minima, a common scenario with nonlinear functions. The simplex can easily become trapped within the basin of attraction of a local minimum, failing to explore other regions of the search space where a lower function value might exist. This can be exacerbated by poor initial guesses for the starting vertices of the simplex. If the initial simplex is positioned far from the true global minimum, or if the vertices are very close together, the algorithm's effectiveness diminishes. It may take an inordinate number of iterations to move toward a relevant minimum, or it may simply terminate at a suboptimal point. Furthermore, flat regions in the objective function can confuse the algorithm. The simplex may struggle to find a direction of improvement, causing the algorithm to stop without achieving a minimum. Function evaluations that are computationally expensive can further compound this problem, as the simplex may prematurely stop before it can converge to a meaningful result.

In contrast, `fminbnd` is specifically designed for one-dimensional optimization within a bounded interval, utilizing a golden section search and parabolic interpolation. The core issue with this algorithm is that if the minimum of the function is outside the defined bounds, the routine will return one of the bounds rather than the true minimum. This means the user must have some understanding of the function's behavior and establish realistic and inclusive bounds. Moreover, if the function is not unimodal within the specified interval – that is, it contains multiple local minima or maxima – `fminbnd` will likely converge to the local minimum closest to the boundary. Discontinuities, noise, or lack of smoothness can also cause issues for `fminbnd`. The parabolic interpolation method relies on the assumption that the function has some smoothness properties. If the function exhibits abrupt changes or is noisy, the interpolation process can fail, and the algorithm can return an inaccurate result or an error.

Below are some examples of common issues with both functions.

**Example 1: `fminsearch` Trapped in a Local Minimum**

```matlab
% Define a function with multiple local minima
func = @(x) (x(1)^2 - 2*x(1) + 1) + (x(2)^2 + 5*cos(3*x(2)));

% Initial guess
x0 = [2, 2];

% Find the minimum
options = optimset('Display','iter','MaxFunEvals',1000);
[xmin, fmin, exitflag] = fminsearch(func, x0, options);

disp(['Minimum found: x = [', num2str(xmin(1)), ', ', num2str(xmin(2)), '], f(x) = ', num2str(fmin)]);
disp(['Exit Flag: ', num2str(exitflag)]);
```

In this example, the function `func` has multiple minima. When provided with an initial guess, `x0 = [2, 2]`,  `fminsearch` often converges to a local minimum rather than the global minimum. Observing the display during optimization will often show that the algorithm settles quickly into a relatively stationary region. Increasing `MaxFunEvals` may help in this case, but it's not guaranteed, highlighting the sensitivity of `fminsearch` to the initial guess and the nature of the objective function. The exit flag provides additional information about why the optimization terminated, but a flag of `1` (the default for a successful convergence) does not imply the result is a global minimum.

**Example 2: `fminbnd` with Minimum Outside the Interval**

```matlab
% Define a simple quadratic function
func = @(x) (x - 5)^2;

% Bounded optimization
lb = 0;
ub = 2;
options = optimset('Display','iter');
[xmin, fmin, exitflag] = fminbnd(func, lb, ub, options);

disp(['Minimum found: x = ', num2str(xmin), ', f(x) = ', num2str(fmin)]);
disp(['Exit Flag: ', num2str(exitflag)]);
```

Here, the minimum of the function `(x - 5)^2` occurs at *x=5*.  Since the specified bounds are 0 and 2, `fminbnd` returns the function value at *x = 2*. This isn’t an error, in the sense that MATLAB is executing the request correctly, but it highlights a scenario where the result isn’t the true minimum of the function when considered over its entire domain. The exit flag, again, doesn't indicate any problems, which reinforces the need for a good understanding of the function's behavior before using this optimization routine. The key takeaway is that the returned minimum will always exist within the boundary, rather than the function’s global minimum.

**Example 3: `fminbnd` with Non-Smooth Function**

```matlab
% Define a function with a discontinuity
func = @(x) abs(x - 3) + (x - 2)^2;

% Bounded optimization
lb = 1;
ub = 5;
options = optimset('Display','iter');
[xmin, fmin, exitflag] = fminbnd(func, lb, ub, options);

disp(['Minimum found: x = ', num2str(xmin), ', f(x) = ', num2str(fmin)]);
disp(['Exit Flag: ', num2str(exitflag)]);
```

In this instance, the objective function, `abs(x-3) + (x-2)^2`,  has a sharp corner at *x = 3*. Though the function is continuous, it is not differentiable there.  `fminbnd` may struggle with this non-smoothness. As can be seen by examining the intermediate steps during optimization, `fminbnd` may return a value near the point where the slope is undefined. This results in a suboptimal answer. Again, the exit flag will most likely not indicate an error, but the minimum returned will not necessarily be the true global minimum. This example demonstrates the limitations of `fminbnd` with functions that lack sufficient smoothness.

To mitigate these issues, I would strongly recommend a few best practices when using these functions. For `fminsearch`, consider trying different initial guesses and, if computationally feasible, performing multiple optimization runs starting from different initial simplex locations to increase the probability of finding a global minimum. If the function evaluations are cheap, increasing the `MaxFunEvals` parameter may help explore the space more extensively.  For `fminbnd`, it’s critical to choose the boundaries carefully to encompass a region that likely contains the global minimum and to ensure that the function is reasonably smooth within these boundaries. Visualizing the function within the interval prior to optimization can help avoid common errors of a minimum occurring outside of the specified bound. I would also recommend familiarizing yourself with alternative optimization algorithms like gradient descent variants (using the optimization toolbox) when the function is known to be differentiable. Consulting documentation for guidance on algorithm selection and parameter tuning is also helpful. Textbooks covering numerical optimization techniques can also offer a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of various optimization approaches, leading to better troubleshooting strategies. Lastly, I recommend reviewing material on algorithm design from first principles to have a firm foundational understanding of the underlying math of these algorithms.
