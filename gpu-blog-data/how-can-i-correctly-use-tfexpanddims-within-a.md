`tf.expand_dims`, when utilized within a Keras layer, necessitates careful consideration of its position within the computational graph to achieve the intended dimensionality manipulation. Incorrect placement can lead to unexpected shape mismatches and ultimately, errors within the model. I've encountered this issue myself, particularly when constructing custom layers that operate on data with variable sequence lengths or when needing to add a channel dimension for compatibility with convolutional operations.

Fundamentally, `tf.expand_dims` introduces a dimension of size 1 at a specified axis. Its proper integration within a Keras layer hinges on the layer's input shape, the desired output shape, and the specific position of the new dimension. The challenge arises because Keras layers often operate on batches of data; consequently, one must account for batch dimensions when specifying the target axis for `tf.expand_dims`. Failure to do so typically results in an incorrect manipulation, often shifting the location of the batch size, leading to errors. The batch size dimension, typically located at position 0, cannot be directly modified by `tf.expand_dims` within the layer’s `call` function in a way that affects the overall batch structure.

I'll illustrate this with several scenarios, drawing from my experience.

**Scenario 1: Adding a Channel Dimension to Input**

Let's assume a situation where a Keras layer takes single-channel feature maps as input, but the subsequent operation requires a multi-channel input. I observed this when a recurrent network was required to process feature maps generated by another processing stage. The input shape to the custom layer might be `(batch_size, sequence_length, feature_dim)` and I needed to transform this to `(batch_size, sequence_length, 1, feature_dim)`. This required introducing a channel dimension of size 1 at a specific axis (axis 2 in this case because sequence length is at axis 1). The code is structured as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class ChannelExpansionLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(ChannelExpansionLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def call(self, inputs):
        # inputs.shape: (batch_size, sequence_length, feature_dim)
        expanded_input = tf.expand_dims(inputs, axis=2)
        # expanded_input.shape: (batch_size, sequence_length, 1, feature_dim)
        return expanded_input

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
       return (input_shape[0],input_shape[1], 1,input_shape[2])
    
# Example Usage
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 10, 128))
layer = ChannelExpansionLayer()
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)

print("Input Shape:", input_tensor.shape)
print("Output Shape:", output_tensor.shape)

```
In this example, within the `call` method of the `ChannelExpansionLayer`, `tf.expand_dims` adds a dimension at `axis=2`, effectively inserting a single channel after the `sequence_length` dimension. The `compute_output_shape` method explicitly defines the output shape ensuring consistent operations in subsequent layers. This is critical as Keras requires layers to provide output shape information for optimal graph construction and parameter calculation.

**Scenario 2: Expanding Dimensions for Convolutional Layers**

Consider a scenario where a fully-connected layer’s output needs to be processed by a 2D convolutional layer. For this, the fully-connected layer's output needs reshaping and an additional channel dimension added. The fully-connected output may have a shape such as `(batch_size, height*width)`, which then needs to become `(batch_size, height, width, 1)`. This requires reshaping and then dimension expansion using `tf.expand_dims`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class ReshapeAndExpand(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, height, width, **kwargs):
      super(ReshapeAndExpand, self).__init__(**kwargs)
      self.height = height
      self.width = width

    def call(self, inputs):
        # inputs.shape: (batch_size, height*width)
        reshaped_input = tf.reshape(inputs, shape=(-1, self.height, self.width))
        # reshaped_input.shape: (batch_size, height, width)
        expanded_input = tf.expand_dims(reshaped_input, axis=-1)
        # expanded_input.shape: (batch_size, height, width, 1)
        return expanded_input

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        return (input_shape[0], self.height, self.width, 1)

# Example Usage
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 64)) #height*width = 64
layer = ReshapeAndExpand(height=8, width=8)
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)
print("Input Shape:", input_tensor.shape)
print("Output Shape:", output_tensor.shape)
```

Here, the `ReshapeAndExpand` layer first reshapes the flattened input into the desired 2D shape using `tf.reshape` based on the provided height and width parameters. Then, `tf.expand_dims` adds a channel dimension at the last axis (`axis=-1`).  The negative index signifies the last axis irrespective of the number of dimensions. This method works well for data requiring channel dimensions for convolutional processing. It’s important to note that the shape arguments passed to `tf.reshape` need to be compatible with the number of elements in the input tensor.

**Scenario 3: Expanding Dimensions within a Sequential Model**

Expanding on the example above, `tf.expand_dims` can also be implicitly used through the keras.layers.Reshape layer. Consider the example below that first reshapes and then uses `keras.layers.Conv2D`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(64,)),  # Input shape for a flattened feature map
    keras.layers.Reshape((8, 8, 1)), # Reshape input data and add an extra dimension, in this instance the channel.
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),  
    keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Example Usage
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 64)) #height*width = 64
output_tensor = model(input_tensor)
print("Input Shape:", input_tensor.shape)
print("Output Shape:", output_tensor.shape)
```

In this scenario, the `keras.layers.Reshape` layer transforms the flattened input directly into a tensor of shape `(8, 8, 1)`, effectively combining the functionality of `tf.reshape` and `tf.expand_dims` from the previous example. This is a more concise approach and is the generally preferred way of manipulating tensor shapes within a model. The layer adds the channel dimensions implicitly. This highlights how Keras sometimes abstracts lower-level Tensorflow functionalities into its higher level objects and functions. It is important to understand this underlying behavior, to allow a better understanding and implementation of custom layers.

**Resource Recommendations:**

To further expand understanding, I recommend consulting resources detailing Tensorflow tensor manipulation operations. Specifically, documents covering the `tf.reshape` function, which is frequently used in conjunction with `tf.expand_dims`. It would also be beneficial to review examples of custom layer creation within Keras, paying close attention to how the `call` and `compute_output_shape` methods function. Further examination of Keras’s functional and sequential API structure would further increase the user's understanding of effective layer usage within complex models. Finally a review of the Keras API documentation outlining the different options for specifying the `axis` parameter in `tf.expand_dims` is crucial.

In summary, while `tf.expand_dims` is a seemingly simple function, its application within Keras layers requires a detailed understanding of tensor shapes, the batch dimension, and the intended axis of dimension insertion. Failing to address these points will inevitably lead to errors and debugging challenges. My experiences have reinforced that explicit management of shape information within Keras layers is crucial for building stable, functional models.
