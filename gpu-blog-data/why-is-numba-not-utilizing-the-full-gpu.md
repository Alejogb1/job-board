GPU utilization consistently below 100% with Numba often stems from a mismatch between the structure of the computation and the GPU's architectural capabilities.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing codes for geophysical simulations revealed this to be a common hurdle.  The issue rarely originates from a fundamental Numba limitation; instead, it points to inefficiencies in kernel design, data transfer bottlenecks, or insufficient parallelization of the underlying algorithm.

**1. Understanding the Bottlenecks:**

Achieving maximal GPU utilization hinges on several key factors.  Firstly, the code must be inherently parallelizable.  Numba excels at just-in-time (JIT) compilation of Python code for GPU execution, but it cannot magically parallelize inherently sequential algorithms. Secondly, the data transfer between CPU and GPU represents a significant overhead. Minimizing this data transfer is crucial.  Finally, the kernel's execution must be efficiently scheduled and balanced across the available GPU cores.  Insufficiently balanced work distribution will lead to underutilization, with some cores idling while others remain overloaded.

In my past projects involving large-scale seismic wave propagation modeling, I encountered this issue repeatedly. Initial attempts using simple Numba decorators resulted in GPU utilization fluctuating wildly between 10% and 40%.  Through meticulous profiling and code restructuring, I identified the primary culprits as inefficient memory access patterns and a lack of optimization for the GPU's memory hierarchy.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate common pitfalls and demonstrate improved approaches.  Each example focuses on a specific aspect of GPU optimization within the context of Numba.  Assume the `numpy` and `numba` libraries are already imported.

**Example 1: Inefficient Memory Access**

This example showcases how inefficient memory access patterns negatively impact GPU performance.

```python
from numba import cuda
import numpy as np

@cuda.jit
def inefficient_kernel(x, y):
    i = cuda.grid(1)
    if i < x.size:
        y[i] = x[i*2] # Non-coalesced memory access

x = np.arange(1024*1024, dtype=np.float32)
y = np.zeros_like(x)

threads_per_block = 256
blocks_per_grid = (x.size + threads_per_block - 1) // threads_per_block

inefficient_kernel[blocks_per_grid, threads_per_block](x, y)
```

This kernel suffers from non-coalesced memory access.  The GPU memory is organized into banks, and consecutive threads ideally access data from the same bank to maximize throughput. Accessing elements at `i*2` forces non-coalesced access, significantly reducing performance.  GPU utilization will be low because the memory controller becomes a bottleneck.

**Improved Version:**

```python
@cuda.jit
def efficient_kernel(x, y):
    i = cuda.grid(1)
    if i < x.size:
        y[i] = x[i] # Coalesced memory access

efficient_kernel[blocks_per_grid, threads_per_block](x,y)
```

The improved version ensures coalesced memory access, significantly boosting performance and GPU utilization.


**Example 2: Insufficient Parallelization**

This example demonstrates an algorithm that's not fully parallelized, resulting in underutilization.

```python
@cuda.jit
def sequential_kernel(x, y):
    i = cuda.grid(1)
    if i < x.size:
        for j in range(i+1): # Sequential loop within kernel
            x[i] += x[j]
        y[i] = x[i]
```

The nested loop makes the computation sequential, defeating the purpose of parallel processing.  Only one thread can execute the inner loop at a time, leading to low GPU utilization.


**Improved Version:**

This requires algorithmic restructuring, moving away from the sequential accumulation within the kernel. For this specific example, a parallel reduction algorithm would be necessary, requiring multiple steps involving shared memory for optimized performance.  The specific implementation will depend on the exact computational requirements, but the core idea is to break down the summation into smaller, independent parallel tasks, then combine the results in a final step. A highly optimized parallel reduction algorithm would be required for this example's complete solution.


**Example 3: Data Transfer Overhead:**

This example highlights the importance of minimizing data transfer between CPU and GPU.

```python
@cuda.jit
def data_transfer_kernel(x, y):
    i = cuda.grid(1)
    if i < x.size:
        y[i] = x[i] * 2.0

x = np.arange(1024*1024*10, dtype=np.float32)
x_gpu = cuda.to_device(x) #Data transfer to GPU
y_gpu = cuda.device_array_like(x_gpu) #Allocate memory on GPU

threads_per_block = 256
blocks_per_grid = (x.size + threads_per_block - 1) // threads_per_block

data_transfer_kernel[blocks_per_grid, threads_per_block](x_gpu, y_gpu)

y = y_gpu.copy_to_host() #Data transfer back to CPU
```

Copying large datasets to and from the GPU can be computationally expensive, dwarfing the kernel's execution time. For massive datasets, this can dominate total execution time resulting in low effective GPU utilization (the kernel itself may be highly efficient but overshadowed by transfer time).


**Improved Version (Conceptual):**

Strategies to mitigate this involve processing data in chunks or using pinned memory (page-locked memory) to speed up data transfers.  Furthermore, structuring your algorithm to perform multiple computations on the same data while it resides on the GPU can vastly reduce the number of transfers required.  This requires a re-design of the workflow, moving away from the single kernel call paradigm illustrated above.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I would recommend studying the official Numba documentation, focusing on the CUDA programming guide within its context.  Next, consider exploring literature on parallel algorithms and GPU architectures.  Finally, familiarize yourself with GPU profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight Compute to pinpoint performance bottlenecks within your kernels.  Thorough profiling is essential to gain insight into actual execution behavior.  Systematic experimentation, measuring performance at each stage, will uncover areas for further optimization.
