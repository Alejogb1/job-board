The `__cudaPopCallConfiguration` undefined reference error typically surfaces during CUDA application linking, indicating a discrepancy between the compiled code's expectations and the libraries available to the linker. This specific symbol, `__cudaPopCallConfiguration`, is intimately tied to the CUDA runtime API's device-side function call mechanism, specifically the management of call stack configuration on the GPU. My experience developing a high-performance ray tracer with CUDA taught me firsthand how easily this error can arise, especially with newer compiler and driver versions.

The root cause lies in how CUDA code is compiled and linked. Device code (kernels) are typically compiled into a binary format known as PTX or SASS, which is then embedded within the host application's executable. At runtime, the CUDA driver takes over, loading and launching kernels on the GPU. The `__cudaPopCallConfiguration` function is part of the CUDA runtime library, specifically used to restore the execution configuration after nested function calls within a kernel. The linker, responsible for stitching together object files and libraries into an executable, must be able to find the definition of this function in a compatible CUDA runtime library. When the linker cannot locate this symbol, the undefined reference error appears.

This failure usually stems from one of several scenarios. First, and perhaps most common, is a mismatch between the CUDA toolkit version used for compilation and the CUDA driver version installed on the system. The CUDA runtime libraries are not always backwards or forwards compatible. If the code was compiled with a toolkit that depends on a newer version of the `__cudaPopCallConfiguration` function than the one provided by the installed driver, this error will occur. The linker is referencing a symbol that does not exist in the runtime libraries available at the time.

Another cause is incorrect library linking during the build process. When compiling a CUDA application, the CUDA runtime library, typically `cudart`, must be correctly specified as a dependency for the linker. If the linker is not explicitly told to include `cudart`, or if it cannot find it in the library search path, it won't be able to resolve symbols like `__cudaPopCallConfiguration`. This can manifest in a variety of ways, including the absence of the `-lcudart` flag during compilation, an incorrect path within library search flags, or a failure to install the CUDA toolkit correctly.

A third, less frequent but still plausible, cause revolves around mixed language compilations, specifically when combining CUDA with other languages like C or C++. If a portion of the code is compiled with older tools, which don't understand or correctly interface with the newer CUDA runtime, conflicts can occur and result in this error. This mixing of compilers and their associated runtime may not always handle compatibility correctly, leading to this problem during linking.

Let me illustrate these scenarios with examples.

**Example 1: Compiler/Driver Mismatch**

Assume we have a simple CUDA kernel, `add_arrays`, defined in `kernel.cu`:

```cpp
__global__ void add_arrays(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < n) {
        c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
    }
}
```

And a host code file `main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>

extern "C" void add_arrays(int *a, int *b, int *c, int n);

int main() {
    int n = 1024;
    int *h_a, *h_b, *h_c, *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;

    h_a = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * n);
    h_b = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * n);
    h_c = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        h_a[i] = i;
        h_b[i] = i*2;
        h_c[i] = 0;
    }

    cudaMalloc(&d_a, sizeof(int) * n);
    cudaMalloc(&d_b, sizeof(int) * n);
    cudaMalloc(&d_c, sizeof(int) * n);
    
    cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, sizeof(int) * n, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, sizeof(int) * n, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


    add_arrays<<< (n + 255) / 256, 256>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, n);

    cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, sizeof(int) * n, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    cudaFree(d_a);
    cudaFree(d_b);
    cudaFree(d_c);
    free(h_a);
    free(h_b);
    free(h_c);


    std::cout << "Result:" << std::endl;
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
        std::cout << h_c[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;


    return 0;
}
```

If this code is compiled using a newer CUDA toolkit, say version 12.0, and the installed CUDA driver is older, say supporting version 11.x, the linker might fail to locate the required `__cudaPopCallConfiguration` symbol. The resulting executable would then crash, either during startup or when the driver tries to load the kernel, with the error indicating an undefined reference to this function.

**Example 2: Incorrect Linker Flags**

Compiling the same code with a compatible CUDA toolkit and driver might still fail if the linker is not instructed to link against `cudart`. Using a compilation command such as:

```bash
nvcc -o main main.cpp kernel.cu
```

might produce the `__cudaPopCallConfiguration` undefined reference error because the command does not explicitly specify to link with the CUDA runtime library. The linker, unaware of the CUDA runtime, would not include it, resulting in the error.

To resolve this, the following compilation command should be used:

```bash
nvcc -o main main.cpp kernel.cu -lcudart
```

This `-lcudart` flag instructs the linker to include the CUDA runtime library and resolve the `__cudaPopCallConfiguration` symbol.

**Example 3: Mixing Compilers**

Consider a more complex scenario involving pre-compiled library files written in standard C++. Suppose a static library `mylib.a` was created using an older C++ compiler that does not correctly interact with the CUDA runtime, and then this library is linked into a CUDA application. While the CUDA portions might compile without problems, linking the final application may lead to the undefined reference to `__cudaPopCallConfiguration` because the static library introduces a compatibility problem with the CUDA runtime. This can be very difficult to diagnose because the individual units may compile successfully, but the combination causes an issue.

To address this issue, one must either recompile the static library with tools compatible with the CUDA toolkit being used, or investigate using intermediate object files to ensure the final compilation links correctly with the CUDA runtime.

To resolve such undefined reference errors, it's critical to ensure a match between the CUDA toolkit and the CUDA driver. The CUDA driver must support the version of the CUDA runtime required by the application. This is often stated in the release notes of both the CUDA driver and CUDA toolkit. Regular updates of both are essential to avoid these issues. Always link against the CUDA runtime (`-lcudart`) explicitly. Verify that the linker can locate the CUDA runtime libraries. Pay close attention to any version mismatches, particularly if using complex build systems or combining multiple languages and compilers.

For further guidance, I recommend reviewing the official CUDA toolkit documentation from NVIDIA, particularly the sections on the CUDA runtime API and compilation process. Additionally, exploring forums dedicated to CUDA development can provide insights from fellow practitioners facing similar problems. Detailed tutorials on building CUDA applications and a thorough understanding of system dependencies are crucial for resolving these often elusive errors.
