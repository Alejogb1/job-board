The core distinction between `future` and `async move { future }` lies in ownership and execution context.  While both represent asynchronous operations, the latter introduces a crucial shift in how the underlying `future`'s resources are managed, specifically affecting its ability to access borrowed data within its environment. This becomes especially relevant when dealing with complex asynchronous workflows involving closures and data borrowed from the surrounding scope.  My experience debugging concurrent systems built using Tokio and asynchronous programming in Rust has illuminated this difference numerous times, often resulting in subtle, hard-to-track errors related to lifetime management.

**1.  Explanation:**

A `Future` in Rust represents a computation that hasn't completed yet.  It's a trait, not a concrete type, meaning many different types implement it.  Crucially, a `Future` can hold onto data—often borrowed—from its surrounding scope.  This data remains accessible *as long as the `Future` itself lives*.  However, there's a limitation: this borrowed data is only accessible within the context where the `Future` was initially created.

The `async move { ... }` block creates a new, independent execution context. Within this context, it *moves* ownership of the captured variables into the asynchronous block. This means that any borrowed data inside the `async move` block is moved, rather than borrowed. This changes how the compiler reasons about lifetimes significantly. The original surrounding scope is no longer responsible for the lifetimes of the moved data. The `future` inside is now responsible for the lifetime of the variables it holds.

If you simply use `future` in an asynchronous context, the `future` may hold references to data that lives outside its execution context. This can lead to lifetime errors if the outer scope ends before the `future` completes. The `async move { future }` solves this by moving the data into the `future`, ensuring it outlives the `future`'s execution, provided the `future`'s implementation uses these moved-in values safely.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Simple Future (Potential Lifetime Error)**

```rust
use std::future::Future;
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};

struct MyData {
    value: i32,
}

impl MyData {
    fn new(v: i32) -> Self { MyData { value: v } }
    fn get_value(&self) -> i32 { self.value }
}


struct MyFuture<'a> {
    data: &'a MyData,
}

impl<'a> Future for MyFuture<'a> {
    type Output = i32;
    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
        Poll::Ready(self.data.get_value())
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let data = MyData::new(10);
    let future = MyFuture { data: &data }; //Borrowing data
    let result = future.await;  //Potential error if data is dropped before future completes.
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

This example showcases a potential issue.  `MyFuture` borrows `data`. If `data` goes out of scope before `future` completes, we'll get a runtime error.  This is because the borrow is only valid as long as the `data` lives.

**Example 2: Using async move to resolve the lifetime error**

```rust
use std::future::Future;
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};

struct MyData {
    value: i32,
}

impl MyData {
    fn new(v: i32) -> Self { MyData { value: v } }
    fn get_value(&self) -> i32 { self.value }
}

struct MyFuture {
    data: MyData,
}

impl Future for MyFuture {
    type Output = i32;
    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
        Poll::Ready(self.data.get_value())
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let data = MyData::new(10);
    let future = async move { MyFuture { data }.await }; //Ownership moved inside.
    let result = future.await;
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

Here, `async move` takes ownership of `data`. The lifetime issue is resolved because `data` now lives as long as `MyFuture` within the asynchronous block. The `await` call is safe as ownership is moved.

**Example 3: Complex Scenario with multiple futures**

```rust
use tokio::sync::oneshot;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let (tx1, rx1) = oneshot::channel();
    let (tx2, rx2) = oneshot::channel();

    let future1 = async move {
        let _ = rx1.await; // Receive from channel 1
        println!("Future 1 completed");
    };

    let future2 = async move {
        let _ = rx2.await; // Receive from channel 2
        println!("Future 2 completed");
    };

    let combined_future = async move {
        tokio::join!(future1, future2);
        println!("Both futures completed");
    };

    tx1.send(()).unwrap();
    tx2.send(()).unwrap();

    combined_future.await;
}
```

This example demonstrates how `async move` helps manage resources in a more complex scenario.  Both `future1` and `future2` each move ownership of their respective receiver halves (`rx1`, `rx2`) from the `main` function. This prevents any lifetime issues in case `main` returns prematurely. The `combined_future` then moves in the two other futures to manage them together.  This is more maintainable and less prone to errors compared to managing lifetimes manually across multiple async blocks.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The Rust Programming Language (official book) – Covers ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes extensively. Crucial for understanding the nuances of this topic.
*   Rust by Example – Provides practical examples demonstrating various concepts, including asynchronous programming.
*   Advanced Rust – Covers advanced topics like unsafe Rust and compiler internals, relevant for a deeper understanding of lifetimes and memory management.  This provides a strong foundation for tackling more challenging scenarios.
*   Tokio documentation – Provides comprehensive details on the Tokio runtime, crucial for building robust asynchronous applications in Rust.


By carefully understanding the implications of ownership and lifetimes in asynchronous Rust, and leveraging the `async move` construct appropriately, we can significantly improve the robustness and maintainability of our concurrent systems.  The examples highlight the practical differences and the potential pitfalls of ignoring ownership considerations in asynchronous programming.  The recommended resources offer further exploration into the underlying concepts that are essential to mastery of this area.
