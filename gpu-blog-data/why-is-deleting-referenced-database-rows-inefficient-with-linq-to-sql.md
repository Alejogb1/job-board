Directly addressing the inefficiency of deleting referenced database rows with Linq to SQL stems from the framework's inherent behavior regarding change tracking and its interaction with foreign key constraints in relational databases. Unlike a direct SQL `DELETE` statement which operates at the database level, Linq to SQL's deletion process typically involves fetching and materializing the referenced entities into memory first. This behavior, while providing a convenient object-oriented view, introduces significant overhead that can drastically impact performance, especially when dealing with a large number of related records.

Specifically, the problem arises because Linq to SQL's change tracker needs to be aware of all entities it's handling. When you attempt to delete a parent entity that has related child entities due to a foreign key constraint, the framework, by default, doesn't simply send a single `DELETE` command to the database. Instead, it typically performs the following sequence:

1.  **Entity Retrieval:** The parent entity to be deleted is loaded, including all its related children (assuming eager or explicit loading is enabled, or the relationships are already tracked).
2.  **Change Tracking:** Each loaded child entity is added to the data context's change tracker. This establishes relationships between the loaded entities that are actively monitored for changes.
3.  **Deletion Attempt:** You then attempt to delete the parent entity via `dataContext.DeleteOnSubmit(parentEntity)`.
4.  **Cascading Deletion (If Configured):** If cascade delete is configured in the database, the database server will handle the deletion of child records, and the Linq context will remove those entities from the local tracked set. If cascade delete is not enabled, the attempt to delete the parent entity will fail at the database level due to the foreign key constraint violation.
5. **Manual Child Deletion (If No Cascading):** In the absence of database-level cascading deletes, the framework must handle the child deletion. It can do that by enumerating through all the tracked children from the initial load, deleting them individually by making a separate round-trip to the database for each child, before deleting the parent entity.

This process of loading all related child entities into memory, individually deleting them, and then proceeding with the parent deletion can become extremely slow, especially when parent entities have many children. This inefficiency exists as a tradeoff to support features like conflict detection and object caching, which are important for general data manipulation workflows but become detrimental for bulk delete operations.

To illustrate this, consider a scenario where you have `Orders` and `OrderItems`. An `Order` can have multiple `OrderItems`, linked by a foreign key relationship. The desired operation is to delete an `Order` and all its associated `OrderItems`.

**Code Example 1: Inefficient Deletion with Load and Delete**

```csharp
using (var dataContext = new MyDataContext())
{
    //Inefficient method: loads all order items for each order.
    var ordersToDelete = dataContext.Orders
        .Where(o => o.Status == "Cancelled")
        .ToList();

    foreach(var order in ordersToDelete)
    {
        dataContext.Orders.DeleteOnSubmit(order);
    }
    dataContext.SubmitChanges();
}
```

**Commentary:** In this code example, the `.ToList()` call is critical. It forces Linq to SQL to load all the `Order` entities that have the status "Cancelled", and subsequently, because the relationship between orders and order items is loaded when the first order is accessed, it also loads all the related order items for every loaded order. When the `DeleteOnSubmit` is called on an order, Linq To SQL will attempt to remove all the loaded order items first. If cascade delete is not configured on the database level, it has to remove each child separately making a round-trip for each child. If database cascade delete is configured, this example will remove the order with the associated child records. This approach, while functional, exhibits poor performance due to the large number of entities loaded into the change tracker and the potential for multiple queries if cascade delete is not configured.

**Code Example 2: Attempted Efficient Deletion (Often Fails)**

```csharp
using (var dataContext = new MyDataContext())
{
    // This is a common attempt at optimizing that frequently leads to errors.
    var ordersToDelete = dataContext.Orders
        .Where(o => o.Status == "Cancelled");

    dataContext.Orders.DeleteAllOnSubmit(ordersToDelete);
    dataContext.SubmitChanges();
}
```

**Commentary:** This code aims to be more efficient by using `DeleteAllOnSubmit`. However, it often fails with a "Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails" error at `SubmitChanges()` because the Linq context is not removing child records and the database doesn't handle cascade deletes. It does not load all entities, but instead directly translates the delete command, as the framework recognizes it as a delete based on query result rather than a delete based on loaded object graph. However, it doesn't cater to foreign key constraints. Therefore, if cascade deletes are not enabled on the database side it can only delete records that do not have any child records, or it will fail.

**Code Example 3: Efficient Deletion using Direct SQL Execution**

```csharp
using (var dataContext = new MyDataContext())
{
    // This example uses Direct SQL execution, bypassing the change tracker for more efficiency.
    var sql = "DELETE FROM OrderItems WHERE OrderId IN (SELECT OrderId FROM Orders WHERE Status = 'Cancelled');";
    dataContext.ExecuteCommand(sql);
     sql = "DELETE FROM Orders WHERE Status = 'Cancelled';";
    dataContext.ExecuteCommand(sql);
}
```

**Commentary:** This third example showcases a significant improvement in efficiency by directly executing SQL commands. It bypasses Linq to SQL's change tracking and materialization process completely. First, all the associated order items are deleted using a subquery that selects all `OrderId` from canceled orders. Then, in the second query, cancelled orders are deleted. This approach executes at the database level, avoiding the overhead of loading entities into memory, individual delete operations, and Linq's change tracking system and will be significantly faster than the previous two examples. This method effectively handles foreign key constraints by removing child records before the parent records and leverages the database's optimized delete capabilities.

To address this inefficiency, I recommend the following general strategies:

1. **Direct SQL Execution:** As shown in the last example, utilizing direct SQL commands via `ExecuteCommand` offers the most efficient approach for bulk delete operations involving referenced data, provided caution is used to prevent SQL injection. This bypasses Linq to SQL's change tracking system and delegates the work to the database engine, which is optimized for this kind of work.
2. **Database-Level Cascade Deletes:** Configuring cascade deletes at the database level can reduce the work done by Linq to SQL and also enforce data integrity in the database itself, which is the ideal approach. With cascade deletes enabled, the Linq to SQL context can simply load the parent records to be deleted and remove those from the context. The database engine will then automatically remove all the associated child records, reducing the time to complete the delete operation significantly.
3.  **Batch Deletion (if database constraints don't allow cascades):** This involves carefully crafted queries that perform the deletions in batches, using multiple calls to `SubmitChanges` that only load subsets of records. This is a complex approach, and requires careful management of batches but it can improve speed significantly compared to loading all records to delete.

For further exploration, resources on "SQL Server Foreign Key Constraints", "Linq to SQL Delete Optimization", "Database Performance Tuning" and "ADO.NET Command Execution" will prove beneficial. While direct SQL execution might seem more complex initially, it can provide substantial performance gains over the default behavior when deleting referenced records through Linq to SQL, as it leverages the strengths of the database engine.
