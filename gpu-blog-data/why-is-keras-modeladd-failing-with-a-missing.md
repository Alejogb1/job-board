The `model.add()` method in Keras, particularly within the Sequential API, primarily falters due to an inconsistent understanding of the layer instantiation process or an inadvertent use of an outdated Keras version. I've encountered this exact problem multiple times during model development; it often manifests unexpectedly when transitioning between different coding environments or modifying existing architectures.

The crux of the issue lies in the fact that `model.add()`, when used with layers, expects a layer *instance* as its sole positional argument, not a layer class or a string representation of a layer. Keras constructs the computation graph layer by layer, and each layer within the graph needs to be an individual object initialized with its specific parameters. Failure to initialize a layer before passing it to `model.add()` results in the TypeError observed, indicating a missing positional argument since the method isn't receiving the expected layer instance.

To illustrate, consider these potential errors and their corrections:

**Example 1: Incorrect Layer Usage (Missing Instantiation)**

```python
# Incorrect code

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Dense)  # WRONG: Passing the class, not an instance
model.add(layers.Activation('relu')) # Another similar error
```

In this snippet, I am passing the `layers.Dense` *class* itself to `model.add()`, instead of a constructed layer object. Similarly, while `layers.Activation('relu')` looks like a construction, it is actually creating an object, not a class.  Keras does not interpret this as a valid layer addition. The `model.add()` method is expecting an instantiated layer object, possessing defined weights and biases that are configured within the layer’s parameters. The resulting traceback from this scenario will indicate the missing positional argument in `model.add()`, giving the impression that it's not accepting the input.

**Example 1: Corrected Implementation**

```python
# Correct code

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,))) # Correct: instantiated layer
model.add(layers.Dense(units=32, activation='sigmoid'))
```

Here, `layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,))` creates a *specific instance* of the `Dense` layer. I am passing the necessary parameters, like the number of units, activation function, and the shape of the input data, upon which to build the weights and biases. After instantiation, this layer object is passed to `model.add()`, enabling the addition of the layer to the model's architecture. The second `Dense` layer will now have input_shape equal to the number of units from the prior layer, in this case, 64.

**Example 2: Incorrect Layer Usage (Incorrect Input Shape Specification)**

```python
# Incorrect code

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')) # Missing input_shape, might work depending on where this layer is in the model
model.add(layers.Dense(32))
```

In this second example, I am instantiating the `Dense` layer correctly, however, missing the `input_shape` for the first layer in the model. In most cases this will not throw the same positional argument error, and it may not even throw any error at all. Instead, TensorFlow may try to infer the shape automatically, based on a subsequent training step using `fit`, and if successful, will only show a warning. If the shape cannot be inferred and no input data can be used as a reference, a different error regarding shape incompatibility will likely arise at the training step, masking the underlying problem. If this first layer is not the start of the model, then there will be no error as Keras will assume that the shape should equal the number of units from the preceding layer.

**Example 2: Corrected Implementation**

```python
# Correct code

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,))) # Correct: specific input shape added
model.add(layers.Dense(units=32, activation='sigmoid'))
```

By including the `input_shape` parameter for the first layer, I'm explicitly defining the shape of the input data for the first layer and am making the shape known to the model. This removes any potential ambiguity about the data dimension going into the model. The shape is specified as a tuple to correctly convey the format of the expected data. This will allow the subsequent layer to correctly build its weights and biases.

**Example 3: Incorrect Layer Usage (Misusing Function Wrappers)**

```python
# Incorrect code

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Dense(64))
model.add(layers.ReLU) # Incorrect, this should be an activation, not a layer
```

While seemingly trivial, it's worth noting that occasionally, developers may attempt to add an activation function directly as a layer. `layers.ReLU` is not a valid layer to add to the sequential model. Activations are not layer objects, and should instead be implemented directly as a parameter when constructing a layer as `activation = 'relu'`. Attempting this will cause a similar 'missing positional argument' error, because `layers.ReLU` expects instantiation parameters that were never specified.

**Example 3: Corrected Implementation**

```python
# Correct code

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = keras.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,))) # Correct: activation integrated into layer construction
model.add(layers.Dense(units=32))
```

The corrected code utilizes the `activation` parameter within the `layers.Dense` layer definition itself, correctly integrating the ReLU activation into the layer functionality. The second layer now also contains all of its necessary parameters.

In essence, troubleshooting a 'missing positional argument' error when using `model.add()` requires careful attention to detail regarding layer instantiation. This error arises from adding the *class* instead of the initialized object. Providing the necessary instantiation parameters, particularly the `input_shape` for the initial layer of a `Sequential` model, is crucial for proper construction and operation. Additionally, ensure you’re working with a compatible version of TensorFlow and Keras and that activations are not being added as layers.

For further assistance in understanding the specific layer types available and their respective parameters, the Keras API documentation, accessible through the TensorFlow website, offers a complete guide. I also recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow guides on building and training Keras models which include many specific examples of building different layer types and will assist in correctly setting up a neural network model. For debugging, the TensorFlow and Keras official GitHub repositories are good resources to check for common errors and issues. These resources collectively provide ample information for effective Keras model development.
