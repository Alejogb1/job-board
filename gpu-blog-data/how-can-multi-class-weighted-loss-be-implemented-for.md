Multi-class weighted loss functions are crucial for semantic image segmentation when dealing with imbalanced class distributions.  My experience optimizing segmentation models for satellite imagery, particularly in identifying sparsely populated urban features within vast rural landscapes, highlighted the necessity of addressing this imbalance.  Standard cross-entropy loss often leads to models prioritizing the majority class, neglecting the crucial, albeit less frequent, minority classes.  This directly impacts the overall accuracy and practical utility of the model, rendering it ineffective for tasks requiring precise identification of rare features.  Therefore, a weighted loss function is required to provide appropriate penalty for misclassifications based on class frequency.

The core concept involves modifying the standard categorical cross-entropy loss by assigning weights to each class, inversely proportional to their frequency in the training dataset.  This ensures that misclassifications of minority classes contribute more significantly to the overall loss, encouraging the model to learn these features more effectively.  The implementation in Keras/TensorFlow leverages the `tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy` class and its `sample_weight` argument, or alternatively, custom loss function definition for more granular control.

**1.  Utilizing `sample_weight` Argument:**

This approach is straightforward for imbalanced datasets where the class weights are pre-computed.  The weight for each sample is determined based on its corresponding class label. This method requires a `sample_weight` array of the same shape as the predicted probabilities.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_categorical_crossentropy(weights):
    """
    Weighted categorical cross-entropy loss function using sample_weight.

    Args:
        weights: A NumPy array of class weights.  Shape should be (num_classes,).

    Returns:
        A Keras loss function.
    """
    def loss(y_true, y_pred):
        # Ensure weights are correctly broadcasted to handle batch dimension.
        weights_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(weights, dtype=tf.float32)
        sample_weights = tf.gather(weights_tensor, tf.argmax(y_true, axis=-1))
        return tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=sample_weights)
    return loss

# Example usage:
num_classes = 5
class_weights = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.15] # Example weights; should be calculated based on your data.
weighted_loss = weighted_categorical_crossentropy(class_weights)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=weighted_loss, metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This code snippet defines a function that generates a weighted categorical cross-entropy loss function.  The `weights` parameter is a NumPy array containing the weight for each class.  The function uses `tf.gather` to efficiently retrieve the appropriate weight for each sample based on its true class label.  The resulting loss function is then used during model compilation.  Crucially, the weights should be determined *before* model compilation using class frequency analysis from your training data.  A common approach is to compute the inverse of class frequencies, normalizing them to sum to one.

**2.  Custom Loss Function with Class-Specific Weights:**

This approach offers greater flexibility, particularly when dealing with complex weighting schemes or when weights need to be dynamically adjusted during training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def custom_weighted_loss(weights):
  """
  Custom weighted categorical cross-entropy loss function.

  Args:
      weights: A NumPy array of class weights. Shape should be (num_classes,).

  Returns:
      A Keras loss function.
  """
  weights = tf.constant(weights, dtype=tf.float32)

  def loss(y_true, y_pred):
    # One-hot encode the ground truth for accurate calculation
    y_true = tf.one_hot(tf.cast(tf.argmax(y_true,axis=-1),dtype=tf.int32),depth=tf.shape(weights)[0])

    loss_per_sample = -tf.reduce_sum(y_true * tf.math.log(tf.clip_by_value(y_pred,1e-7,1.0)), axis=-1) # adding epsilon for numerical stability
    weighted_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss_per_sample * weights)
    return weighted_loss
  return loss

#Example usage:
num_classes = 5
class_weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.15])
custom_weighted_loss_fn = custom_weighted_loss(class_weights)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_weighted_loss_fn, metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This custom loss function explicitly calculates the weighted loss at each sample level, multiplying each individual sample loss by its corresponding class weight. The `tf.clip_by_value` function prevents numerical instability issues that can arise from taking the logarithm of very small values.  This approach provides more control and allows for more sophisticated weighting strategies.

**3.  Using Dice Coefficient with Class Weights:**

The Dice coefficient is a suitable metric for evaluating segmentation performance, especially when dealing with highly imbalanced datasets.  Incorporating class weights into the Dice loss further enhances its effectiveness.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def weighted_dice_loss(weights):
    """
    Weighted Dice loss function.

    Args:
        weights: A NumPy array of class weights. Shape should be (num_classes,).

    Returns:
        A Keras loss function.
    """
    weights = tf.constant(weights, dtype=tf.float32)

    def loss(y_true, y_pred):
        #Ensure the dimensions are correct for the dice coefficient calculation
        y_true = tf.one_hot(tf.cast(tf.argmax(y_true, axis=-1), dtype=tf.int32), depth=tf.shape(weights)[0])
        
        intersection = tf.reduce_sum(y_true * y_pred, axis=[1,2])
        sum_true = tf.reduce_sum(y_true, axis=[1,2])
        sum_pred = tf.reduce_sum(y_pred, axis=[1,2])
        dice = (2.0 * intersection + 1e-7) / (sum_true + sum_pred + 1e-7) #Avoiding division by zero
        weighted_dice = tf.reduce_mean(weights * dice)
        return 1.0 - weighted_dice #The Dice coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, transforming into a loss
    return loss

# Example usage:
num_classes = 5
class_weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.15])
weighted_dice_loss_fn = weighted_dice_loss(class_weights)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=weighted_dice_loss_fn, metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This example demonstrates how to incorporate class weights into the Dice loss.  The Dice coefficient is calculated for each class and then weighted based on the provided weights.  The result is then subtracted from 1 to obtain a loss value. The addition of a small epsilon value prevents issues caused by division by zero. This loss function is often preferred over cross-entropy when the focus is on optimizing for the overlap between predicted and true segmentations.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of loss functions in deep learning, I recommend consulting standard machine learning textbooks and research papers on semantic image segmentation.  Specifically, exploring resources on imbalanced data handling and advanced loss functions will be particularly beneficial.  Examine publications focusing on medical image analysis and remote sensing applications for practical examples and implementation details regarding weighted loss functions in these contexts.  Furthermore, thoroughly review the TensorFlow and Keras documentation for detailed explanations of the functions and classes used in the provided code examples.  Understanding the mathematical underpinnings of these functions is key to effectively applying and adapting them to specific problem domains.
