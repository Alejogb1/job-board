TensorFlow's `GradientTape` returning `None` typically stems from a mismatch between the `watch` calls and the computation graph's structure, specifically regarding the variables involved in the computation whose gradients are being sought.  Over the years, debugging this issue in large-scale model development has taught me the importance of meticulous tracking of variable dependencies within the tape's recording scope.  This response will elucidate the core causes and provide practical code examples to illustrate the common pitfalls and their resolutions.

**1.  Understanding the `GradientTape` Mechanism**

`tf.GradientTape` records operations for automatic differentiation. Crucially, it only tracks gradients for tensors it explicitly `watch`es.  If the tensor you are ultimately differentiating with respect to (the variable whose gradient you want) hasn't been watched, the `gradient()` method will return `None`. Furthermore, the operations must be performed *within* the tape's context manager (`with tf.GradientTape(...)`).  Operations outside this context are not recorded, leading to an inability to calculate gradients.  This often occurs when variables are modified indirectly or within nested functions in unexpected ways.  My experience suggests that the most frequent source of error lies in either forgetting to `watch` the appropriate variables or performing operations on watched variables outside the tape's context.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

**Example 1: Missing `watch` call.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = x * x

grad = tape.gradient(y, x) # grad will be None
print(grad) # Output: None

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(x) # Correctly watching x
    y = x * x

grad = tape.gradient(y, x)
print(grad) # Output: <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=4.0>
```

This example highlights the fundamental requirement:  `tape.watch(x)` explicitly instructs the `GradientTape` to track the gradients of `x`.  Without this call, the tape has no information about how `y` depends on `x`, resulting in `None`.

**Example 2: Operations outside the `GradientTape` context.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(x)
    y = x * x

z = y + 1 #This operation is outside the tape's context

grad = tape.gradient(z, x) # grad will be None
print(grad) #Output: None

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(x)
    y = x * x
    z = y + 1 # Now the operation is inside the tape's context

grad = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(grad) #Output: <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=5.0>
```

Here, the addition `z = y + 1` is critical.  If it is performed outside the `with` block, the gradient calculation fails because the tape did not record this operation.  The gradient is only calculated for operations within the tape's context.

**Example 3:  Incorrect variable usage within a function.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(2.0)

def compute_loss(x):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(x)
        y = x * x
    return y

with tf.GradientTape() as outer_tape:
    outer_tape.watch(x)
    loss = compute_loss(x)

grad = outer_tape.gradient(loss, x) # grad may be None (depending on TensorFlow version)
print(grad)

x = tf.Variable(2.0)

def compute_loss(x):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(x)  #Correct
        y = x * x
    return y, tape


with tf.GradientTape() as outer_tape:
    outer_tape.watch(x)
    loss, inner_tape = compute_loss(x)
    grad = inner_tape.gradient(loss, x)

print(grad) # Output should be a tensor, not None


```
This demonstrates a more nuanced scenario.  While `x` is watched within `compute_loss`, the crucial element is that the `GradientTape` *inside* `compute_loss` needs to be used to compute the gradient. Returning the tape from the function allows the gradient to be calculated correctly within the outer tape's context, providing a gradient with respect to x.  Directly using the outer tape to compute the gradient after calling the function will often fail, particularly in more complex scenarios.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guides on `tf.GradientTape` and automatic differentiation.  Thoroughly reviewing the examples and explanations within the documentation is crucial.  In addition, focusing on tutorials and examples that specifically address complex gradient calculations, especially those involving nested functions and custom layers, would enhance understanding.  Furthermore, a deep understanding of the underlying computational graph and the concepts of forward and reverse-mode automatic differentiation is beneficial in debugging such issues.  Finally, learning to effectively leverage TensorFlowâ€™s debugging tools can drastically improve the speed and efficiency of troubleshooting such problems.
