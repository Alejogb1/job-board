Recursive calls within an optimization function like `optim()` in R often lead to errors, primarily due to a fundamental conflict between the optimization algorithm’s iterative nature and the nested function calls. These errors typically manifest as stack overflows, excessive computation time, or failure to converge, stemming from how optimizers are designed to locate minima or maxima of a function. In my experience developing numerical routines for geophysical data inversion, I've repeatedly encountered these issues and observed that they arise not from `optim()` itself being flawed, but from how its usage deviates from its core principles.

`optim()` is designed to find the extremum (minimum or maximum) of a provided objective function by iteratively evaluating that function at different parameter values. Each evaluation determines the direction in which parameters should move to better approach the extremum. When you incorporate a recursive call within the objective function, you introduce a problematic dependency. Instead of evaluating a static function at each point, `optim()` now calls a function that, in turn, calls `optim()` again, nesting iterative searches within each other. This quickly compounds the computational burden and can disrupt the primary optimization process.

The primary issue is a misunderstanding of what the objective function should represent. The function passed to `optim()` must produce a single scalar value for each given set of parameters; this scalar is then used by the optimization algorithm to adjust the parameters. Introducing a second `optim()` call within this function not only breaks this single scalar output paradigm, but also means that the outer optimization algorithm is indirectly attempting to optimize the results of a nested optimization procedure, rather than the inherent parameters of the original problem. The nested `optim()` functions do not necessarily relate to the target of the original minimization; this adds unnecessary complexity and computation, creating instability and hindering convergence.

Let's examine this with an example. Consider a simplified model parameter estimation task where we want to minimize the difference between a model prediction and observed data.

```R
# Example 1: Recursive optim(), showcasing a simple scenario with errors

# Model function (simplified)
model <- function(x) {
    return(x^2)
}

# Loss function with a recursive optim() call (incorrect)
loss_recursive <- function(params, observed_value) {
    model_prediction <- model(params[1])
    inner_loss <- function(inner_param){
        return(abs(model(inner_param) - model_prediction))
    }
   
    inner_result <- optim(par = 0, fn = inner_loss)$value 
    return(abs(model_prediction - observed_value) + inner_result)
}

# Observed value
observed <- 4

# Attempt to optimize using recursive loss function
result_recursive <- try(optim(par=1, fn=loss_recursive, observed_value = observed))
print(result_recursive)

```

In this first example, the `loss_recursive` function attempts to find the value that minimizes the difference between a model prediction and a target value using a nested `optim()` call. This inner optimization has no direct connection to the goal of finding parameters that produce a model output closest to the observed data. This design is inherently flawed; the inner optimization doesn't directly contribute to evaluating the difference between `model_prediction` and `observed_value` and introduces non-deterministic behavior. The `try` wrapper shows that an error occurs and that `optim` fails to converge and exits.

Let's contrast this with a correct approach. Below is an example that shows how we should structure the same kind of problem.

```R
# Example 2: Proper usage of optim(), using an appropriately defined loss function

# Model function (simplified)
model <- function(x) {
    return(x^2)
}

# Loss function without recursion
loss_correct <- function(params, observed_value) {
    model_prediction <- model(params[1])
    return(abs(model_prediction - observed_value))
}

# Observed value
observed <- 4

# Optimize the function without a nested optim() call
result_correct <- optim(par=1, fn=loss_correct, observed_value = observed)
print(result_correct)
```

In the second example, `loss_correct` directly calculates the absolute difference between the model output and the target value, thus providing `optim` with the single, scalar result it expects. No recursive optimization occurs, and the result is accurate. The first `optim` call successfully finds the parameter which best produces a model value close to our specified observed value.

To elaborate further, consider a more complex scenario: minimizing the difference between observed data and a more complex, parameterised model.

```R
# Example 3: Complex model and loss function without recursion

#Complex Model function
complex_model <- function(x, a, b, c) {
  return(a * sin(b * x) + c*x^2)
}


# Loss function using the complex model
loss_complex <- function(params, observed_data, x_values){
  model_predictions <- complex_model(x_values, params[1], params[2], params[3])
  return(sum((model_predictions - observed_data)^2))
}


#Example input data
x_values <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 100)
true_params <- c(2, 3, 0.5)
observed_data <- complex_model(x_values, true_params[1], true_params[2], true_params[3]) + rnorm(100, 0, 0.1)


# Example use of optim on complex model
initial_params <- c(1, 1, 1)
result_complex <- optim(par= initial_params,
                      fn=loss_complex,
                      observed_data = observed_data,
                      x_values= x_values)

print(result_complex)

```

In the third example we show a more complex use case, which uses a model with 3 parameters. The example code demonstrates how to define a loss function that outputs a single scalar (the sum of the squared errors), which then enables `optim()` to correctly perform optimization. As in the second example, `optim()` is used once to find the parameter set for `complex_model` that best represents the observed data. This demonstrates the need for clarity in the purpose of our loss functions; it must evaluate the fit between model and observations given a single parameter set, and not introduce nested optimization.

In summary, recursive calls to `optim()` result in errors because they misrepresent the objective function and introduce computational inefficiency. The objective function passed to `optim()` should always represent the measure of fit to the problem we wish to optimize with a single scalar output value, rather than attempting further parameter optimization. When implementing optimization routines, I've found careful consideration of the objective function and ensuring that it evaluates the model’s performance is crucial.

To deepen understanding of `optim()` and optimization concepts in R, I would recommend exploring resources that focus on:

*   **Numerical optimization theory:** Texts explaining algorithms like gradient descent, Newton's method, and quasi-Newton methods would greatly benefit anyone working with numerical optimization.
*   **R documentation on `optim()`:** The official documentation provides a thorough breakdown of the function’s parameters, return values, and underlying algorithms.
*   **Examples of practical use cases of `optim()`:** Books or articles detailing typical optimization problems such as parameter fitting or maximum likelihood estimation can offer insight into correct implementation.
*   **Numerical analysis textbooks:** A more general numerical analysis text can provide a broader foundation to understand numerical techniques.
