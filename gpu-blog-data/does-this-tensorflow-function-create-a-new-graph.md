The behavior of TensorFlow graph creation within a function depends critically on the execution mode – eager execution or graph execution.  My experience debugging complex model deployments has shown that failing to account for this distinction is a frequent source of performance bottlenecks and unexpected behavior.  Simply put: in eager execution, a new graph is *not* created for each function invocation; in graph execution, a new graph is not directly created per invocation, but the function's operations are added to a single, potentially pre-existing graph.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's graph execution model, prevalent in earlier versions, constructs a computational graph representing the entire computation before execution.  Functions defined within this model contribute their operations to this single, global graph. Each function call doesn't generate a new graph; instead, the function's nodes are added to the existing graph, effectively creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the complete computation.  This allows for optimizations such as graph pruning and fusion.

Eager execution, introduced later, changes this paradigm significantly. In eager execution, operations are executed immediately, line by line, without a pre-built graph.  Functions defined under eager execution behave similarly; each function call executes its operations immediately, and no persistent graph is constructed.  While there's no explicit graph creation per invocation, the function's internal computations are not preserved across invocations unless explicitly saved to a persistent state like a checkpoint.  Therefore, the function's internal state is ephemeral.

The key difference lies in how TensorFlow manages the computation: a pre-built static graph versus an immediate execution model.  This drastically affects resource management and performance characteristics.  In the graph execution mode, the cost of graph construction is incurred once. In eager execution, the overhead of creating the internal structures and executing the operations is replicated for every call.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Graph Execution (Illustrative – requires specific TensorFlow version setup)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution() #Crucial for graph mode

@tf.function
def my_function(x):
  y = x * 2
  return y

graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
    result1 = my_function(tf.constant(5))
    result2 = my_function(tf.constant(10))

with tf.compat.v1.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
    print(sess.run(result1))  #Output: 10
    print(sess.run(result2))  #Output: 20
```

**Commentary:**  This example simulates graph execution. `tf.function` decorates `my_function`, indicating that its operations should be added to the graph.  `tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()` forces the graph execution mode, essential for this behavior. Note that there is only one graph, and the function’s operations are added repeatedly without creating multiple graphs.  The `Session` object executes the constructed graph.  Multiple calls to `my_function` add the same operations to the graph only once (due to optimization).

**Example 2: Eager Execution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_function(x):
  y = x * 2
  return y

result1 = my_function(tf.constant(5))
result2 = my_function(tf.constant(10))

print(result1.numpy())  # Output: 10
print(result2.numpy())  # Output: 20
```

**Commentary:** This showcases eager execution.  Even with `@tf.function`, the underlying execution is eager. The `@tf.function` decorator in eager mode provides benefits such as automatic graph construction for performance optimization, but it does not imply that a new graph is built per call.  Each call to `my_function` executes its operations independently, without any persistent graph structure between calls.


**Example 3: Demonstrating State within a Function (Eager Execution)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

counter = tf.Variable(0, name="counter")

@tf.function
def increment_counter():
  global counter
  counter.assign_add(1)
  return counter

print(increment_counter().numpy()) #Output: 1
print(increment_counter().numpy()) #Output: 2
print(increment_counter().numpy()) #Output: 3
```

**Commentary:** This illustrates how state is managed in eager execution within a `@tf.function`-decorated function.  The `tf.Variable` acts as a persistent state container.  While each invocation of `increment_counter` executes independently, the shared state `counter` maintains information across invocations.  The key is that the persistent state (the variable) isn't inherent to the function but exists outside it and is modified, not creating multiple graphs.  The statefulness comes from the mutable tensor, not inherent graph replication.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

To further deepen your understanding, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, focusing on sections detailing eager execution and graph construction.  Thorough study of the TensorFlow API reference is invaluable.  Moreover, working through the TensorFlow tutorials, particularly those on custom training loops and low-level graph manipulation, will reinforce your practical knowledge. Finally, a comprehensive book on deep learning with TensorFlow would offer a theoretical framework and contextual insights.  The specific choices depend on your preferred learning style and level of experience.
