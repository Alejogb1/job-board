TensorFlow's mismatch between expected input shape (99) and received input shape (3) stems fundamentally from a discrepancy between the model's architecture and the pre-processing pipeline feeding data into it.  This is a common issue, often arising from misunderstandings regarding data transformations, particularly within the context of feature engineering and batching. In my experience troubleshooting production-level TensorFlow models at a large financial institution, I've encountered this problem repeatedly, often masking deeper issues within the data preparation workflow.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The root cause lies in the dimensions of the input tensor.  The model, having been trained on a dataset with features organized in a vector of length 99, expects each input sample to conform to this dimensionality.  Receiving an input tensor of shape (3) indicates a fundamental mismatch.  This could originate from several sources:

* **Incorrect Feature Engineering:** The pre-processing steps may be inadvertently reducing the number of features from 99 to 3. This might involve unintended dropping of columns, erroneous feature selection, or incorrect data transformations (e.g., applying dimensionality reduction techniques without considering the model's requirements).

* **Data Loading Issues:** Problems within the data loading mechanism might result in only a subset of the features being loaded.  This might arise from faulty file parsing, incorrect indexing, or issues related to data splitting or sampling.

* **Batching Misconfiguration:** If the input data is organized into batches, a shape (3) might represent a single sample within a batch, if the batch size is not explicitly set to 1.  The model's input layer will then be expecting a tensor of shape (batch_size, 99), not (batch_size, 3).

* **Model Architecture Inconsistency:** While less likely in this specific case given the clear dimensional mismatch, it is conceivable that the model's definition itself might be inconsistent, either through modification or accidental deletion of layers that process specific features, resulting in an unexpected input dimensionality requirement for later layers.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how each of these issues might manifest:

**Example 1: Incorrect Feature Engineering**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample data with 99 features
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 99)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Incorrect preprocessing: selecting only the first three features
X_train_incorrect = X_train[:, :3]

# Model definition
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(99,)),  # Expecting 99 features
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Training will fail because of shape mismatch
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train_incorrect, y_train, epochs=1) # This will throw an error.

```

This code snippet demonstrates the error arising from selecting only the first three features instead of all 99.  The `input_shape` parameter in the `Dense` layer explicitly specifies the expected input dimensionality.  Trying to fit the model with `X_train_incorrect` will raise a `ValueError` due to shape mismatch.

**Example 2: Data Loading Issues**

```python
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume data is in a CSV file with 99 features
data = pd.read_csv('my_data.csv')

# Incorrect data loading: only loading the first three columns
X_train_incorrect = data.iloc[:, :3].values
y_train = data.iloc[:, -1].values

# Model definition (same as before)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(99,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train_incorrect, y_train, epochs=1) # This will throw an error.

```

Here, the data loading from a CSV uses pandas.  The erroneous slicing `data.iloc[:, :3]` only loads the first three columns.  The resulting `X_train_incorrect` has the incorrect shape, leading to a runtime error during model training.  This highlights the critical importance of data validation after loading.

**Example 3: Batching Misconfiguration**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

X_train = np.random.rand(100, 99)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Model definition (same as before)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(99,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Incorrect batch size handling: implicit batch size of 1
model.fit(np.expand_dims(X_train[:3,:],axis=0), y_train[:3], epochs=1)

#Correct batch size handling: explicit batch size
model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size = 32, epochs=1)

```

This example focuses on batching. The first `model.fit` call uses an implicit batch size of 1 by passing a single sample with shape (1,3,99).  The second call explicitly sets `batch_size=32`, showing the correct way to handle batches, assuming each batch has 32 samples.  Failing to manage batch size correctly often results in shape mismatches, particularly when dealing with data generators or custom input pipelines.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For comprehensive understanding of TensorFlow's data input pipelines, I strongly suggest reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on data preprocessing and input pipelines. Pay close attention to the sections detailing data transformations and batching strategies.  Thoroughly examining the TensorFlow Keras guide on model building and layer specifications will also prove invaluable in avoiding shape mismatches. Furthermore, exploring advanced debugging techniques specific to TensorFlow can significantly aid in pinpointing the exact location and nature of the shape mismatch error.  Lastly, understanding numpy array manipulation will be fundamentally useful.
