The seemingly deterministic nature of a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be deceiving; a saved model, when loaded and used for prediction, may produce slightly different outputs across runs. This stems primarily from non-deterministic operations occurring *after* the model's parameters have been frozen by the saving process. Specifically, the culprit is often found in layers and operations that incorporate randomness, even if not directly involved in backpropagation during training.

Let's examine several contributors to this variability. The most common source of unpredictability is Dropout layers. Even after a model is trained and saved, Dropout layers, when active, will randomly deactivate neurons during the forward pass. Since they are designed to introduce this element of chance to reduce overfitting, each forward pass will result in a subtly different network configuration and, consequently, slightly different outputs. This is by design, and the behavior persists after saving since the layer’s configuration, not just its weight, is preserved. We must specifically disable Dropout during inference to obtain consistent results. Other randomness sources may come from operations such as data shuffling if the data is not batched properly, or from the randomness of operations on the GPU itself during inference.

Beyond Dropout, variations can arise if batch normalization layers are not properly handled. Batch Normalization computes statistics (mean and variance) during training across mini-batches. This is then used to normalize the input during the forward pass. When deployed, it is crucial to utilize the *running* averages and variances that were calculated and tracked during training, not re-compute the statistics using a single inference batch, which could be small. If this is not configured correctly, the normalization step introduces inconsistencies. Correct usage involves switching the batch normalization layer into evaluation mode at inference time. This change in mode causes the use of the saved running statistics instead of computing new ones. This is crucial for consistent output, especially when the data at inference time has statistical properties that significantly deviate from the training data.

Data preprocessing stages can also indirectly cause output fluctuations. If preprocessing steps, like image augmentation, include randomized operations applied during the inference pipeline, this also introduces noise. These processes are often used in training and typically must be disabled or held constant when feeding the loaded model. While the model parameters are unchanged, preprocessing steps performed on a single image could, by design, yield slightly altered input vectors and thus, different predictions.

Let’s see this variability in action through a few examples in Python using a deep learning framework. In these examples, I’m using a simplified convolutional neural network (CNN). I will assume the user is familiar with the fundamental structures of a CNN. We'll also use arbitrary data for demonstration.

**Example 1: Dropout Layers Impact**

Here, I create a simple CNN that contains a dropout layer. I then train it on an arbitrary data. After saving and loading, predictions are generated using the dropout, demonstrating inconsistent results due to the random deactivation of neurons during the forward pass.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

# Define a simple CNN model with dropout
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.maxpool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16*7*7, 10) # 14x14 image with maxpool reduces to 7x7

    def forward(self, x):
      x = self.maxpool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
      x = self.dropout(x)
      x = self.flatten(x)
      x = self.fc(x)
      return x

# Generate dummy data for demonstration
X_train = torch.randn(100, 1, 28, 28)
Y_train = torch.randint(0, 10, (100,))

# Training the model
model = SimpleCNN()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
loss_function = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
for epoch in range(10):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  output = model(X_train)
  loss = loss_function(output, Y_train)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "my_model.pth")

# Load the model
loaded_model = SimpleCNN()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load("my_model.pth"))
loaded_model.eval() # Important to use eval() for consistent results. Remove it to see difference.

# Prediction using the loaded model, without and with eval
test_input = torch.randn(1, 1, 28, 28)
predictions_without_eval = []
for _ in range(3):
    loaded_model.train()
    predictions_without_eval.append(loaded_model(test_input).detach().numpy())

predictions_with_eval = []
for _ in range(3):
  loaded_model.eval()
  predictions_with_eval.append(loaded_model(test_input).detach().numpy())

print("Predictions without using model.eval():", predictions_without_eval)
print("Predictions using model.eval():", predictions_with_eval)
```

The initial output will show that the predictions without `model.eval()` vary, while the predictions generated after adding `model.eval()` are consistent across multiple inferences. This demonstrates the effect of disabling dropout at test time using `model.eval()`.

**Example 2: Batch Normalization in Inference**

The following code demonstrates how batch normalization layers can contribute to the issue if not handled correctly during inference. Here I will again use a simple CNN network, this time with batch normalization.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

# Define a simple CNN model with batch norm
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(16)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.maxpool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16*7*7, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.maxpool(self.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x))))
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Generate dummy data
X_train = torch.randn(100, 1, 28, 28)
Y_train = torch.randint(0, 10, (100,))

# Training the model
model = SimpleCNN()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
loss_function = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for epoch in range(10):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  output = model(X_train)
  loss = loss_function(output, Y_train)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "my_model_bn.pth")

# Load the model
loaded_model = SimpleCNN()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load("my_model_bn.pth"))

# Prediction using the loaded model
test_input = torch.randn(1, 1, 28, 28)
predictions_without_eval = []
for _ in range(3):
  loaded_model.train() # Set model to training mode so that it recompute batch statistics for normalization
  predictions_without_eval.append(loaded_model(test_input).detach().numpy())


predictions_with_eval = []
for _ in range(3):
    loaded_model.eval() # Switch to eval mode and use running statistics of normalization
    predictions_with_eval.append(loaded_model(test_input).detach().numpy())

print("Predictions without eval mode for batch norm:", predictions_without_eval)
print("Predictions using eval mode for batch norm:", predictions_with_eval)
```

Here, similarly to the last example, the difference in the two outputs will demonstrate that `model.eval()` is necessary to consistently use saved batch normalization parameters during inference. If `model.eval()` is not used, and instead the model is kept in train mode, batch normalization layers would recalculate mean and variance, causing changes in the final output.

**Example 3: Random Data Preprocessing**

This example shows how random data augmentation can generate different results when processing single images if not handled carefully during the inference.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
from torchvision import transforms
from PIL import Image

# Define a simple CNN model (same as before)
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.maxpool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16*7*7, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
      x = self.maxpool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
      x = self.flatten(x)
      x = self.fc(x)
      return x

# Generate dummy data
X_train = torch.randn(100, 1, 28, 28)
Y_train = torch.randint(0, 10, (100,))

# Training the model
model = SimpleCNN()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
loss_function = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for epoch in range(10):
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  output = model(X_train)
  loss = loss_function(output, Y_train)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "my_model_pre.pth")

# Load the model
loaded_model = SimpleCNN()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load("my_model_pre.pth"))
loaded_model.eval()

# Define data augmentation during training
train_transforms = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomRotation(degrees=15),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])

# Generate dummy test image
test_image = Image.new('L', (28, 28), color=100)
test_input = train_transforms(test_image).unsqueeze(0)


# Predictions using the loaded model with augmentation
predictions_with_aug = []
for _ in range(3):
  test_image = Image.new('L', (28, 28), color=100)
  test_input = train_transforms(test_image).unsqueeze(0)
  predictions_with_aug.append(loaded_model(test_input).detach().numpy())

# Predictions using the loaded model without augmentation
test_transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()]) #No random operations
predictions_without_aug = []
for _ in range(3):
    test_image = Image.new('L', (28, 28), color=100)
    test_input = test_transforms(test_image).unsqueeze(0)
    predictions_without_aug.append(loaded_model(test_input).detach().numpy())

print("Predictions with data augmentation:", predictions_with_aug)
print("Predictions without data augmentation:", predictions_without_aug)
```

In this case, the first output demonstrates that the predictions vary when random augmentations are applied. The second output will show the predictions remain consistent when the augmentations are removed from the pipeline. This highlights the need to ensure the same processing steps are performed during testing to reproduce the same results.

To avoid these variations, remember the following. During inference, always call `model.eval()`. Ensure that your batch normalization layers are not recomputing statistics on small input batches, and specifically use their pre-computed running statistics. Be sure to replicate the data preprocessing steps you employed during training, or disable the random components of the preprocessing during inference. Consistent results require consistency throughout the process, from input to output. Finally, be certain that any randomization done is in fact meant to be randomized (sometimes it is not), and if you are not intended to introduce randomness, utilize appropriate random number seeds to create reproducible results.

For more details on handling this issue, several resources are available on best practices for deployment and inference of deep learning models. Explore available tutorials, comprehensive documentation of deep learning libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), or online textbooks specifically focusing on model deployment. Further understanding of this can be improved by learning to use debugging techniques within the library of choice, which can isolate the source of variation. Specifically, stepping through the forward pass to see how the randomness is impacting the calculations can help you better diagnose the root cause of the difference in model outputs.
