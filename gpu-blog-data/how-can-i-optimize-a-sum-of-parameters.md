The most efficient approach to optimizing a sum of parameters subject to range constraints in R hinges on the choice of optimization algorithm and the structure of the objective function.  My experience working on high-dimensional parameter estimation for financial models has highlighted the limitations of naive approaches like brute-force search for anything beyond a very small parameter space.  For problems involving more than a handful of parameters, gradient-based methods offer significant computational advantages.  However, the presence of constraints necessitates the use of algorithms specifically designed to handle them.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in finding the values of a set of parameters (let's denote them as  `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n`) that minimize (or maximize) a given objective function,  `f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)`,  while simultaneously satisfying individual constraints for each parameter.  These constraints typically specify lower and upper bounds:  `l_i ≤ x_i ≤ u_i`, where `l_i` and `u_i` represent the lower and upper bounds for parameter `x_i`, respectively.

Directly applying unconstrained optimization techniques will invariably fail; the solution might violate the imposed constraints.  Therefore, constrained optimization algorithms are required.  In R, several packages provide robust implementations of such algorithms.  The `optim` function, while versatile, offers limited direct support for bound constraints.  However, using the `L-BFGS-B` method within `optim` elegantly addresses this issue.  Alternatives include the `constrOptim` function, which is more explicitly designed for constrained optimization. For very large-scale problems, or those with complex constraints, specialized packages like `nloptr` may become necessary.  My own work frequently leverages `nloptr` for its flexibility and support for diverse optimization algorithms tailored for different problem structures.  The choice of algorithm depends heavily on the characteristics of the objective function (e.g., differentiability, convexity).


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `optim` with `L-BFGS-B`:**

```R
# Objective function: Sum of squares
obj_fun <- function(x) sum(x^2)

# Lower and upper bounds
lower <- c(0, -2, -1)
upper <- c(5, 2, 1)

# Initial parameter values
initial_params <- c(1, 0, 0.5)

# Optimization using L-BFGS-B
result <- optim(par = initial_params, fn = obj_fun, method = "L-BFGS-B", lower = lower, upper = upper)

# Optimal parameters and objective function value
print(result$par)
print(result$value)
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward application of `optim` with the `L-BFGS-B` method. The objective function is a simple sum of squares, easily differentiable.  The `lower` and `upper` arguments directly specify the bounds.  The output provides the optimal parameter values (`result$par`) and the corresponding minimum objective function value (`result$value`).  Note that `L-BFGS-B` is particularly suitable for smooth, differentiable objective functions, making it efficient for many practical applications.


**Example 2: Using `constrOptim`:**

```R
# Objective function (same as Example 1)
obj_fun <- function(x) sum(x^2)

# Gradient of the objective function
grad_fun <- function(x) 2*x

# Inequality constraints (ui - Ai x >= bi)
ui <- rbind(c(-1,0,0), c(0,-1,0),c(0,0,-1),c(1,0,0),c(0,1,0),c(0,0,1))
ci <- c(-5,2,-1,5,-2,1)

# Initial parameter values (same as Example 1)
initial_params <- c(1,0,0.5)

# Optimization using constrOptim
result <- constrOptim(theta = initial_params, f = obj_fun, grad = grad_fun, ui = ui, ci = ci)

# Optimal parameters and objective function value
print(result$par)
print(result$value)
```

`constrOptim` explicitly handles inequality constraints.  We define the constraints in matrix form (`ui` and `ci`). This formulation allows for more complex constraints than simply bounds.  Providing the gradient (`grad_fun`) further accelerates the optimization process.  This approach is advantageous when dealing with more intricate constraint relationships. However,  it requires explicit specification of the gradient, which might be computationally demanding for complex functions.



**Example 3:  Handling Non-Differentiable Functions with `nloptr`:**

```R
library(nloptr)

# Non-differentiable objective function (e.g., sum of absolute values)
obj_fun <- function(x) sum(abs(x))

# Lower and upper bounds (same as Example 1)
lower <- c(0, -2, -1)
upper <- c(5, 2, 1)

# Initial parameter values (same as Example 1)
initial_params <- c(1, 0, 0.5)

# Optimization using nloptr with augmented Lagrangian method
local_opts <- list( "algorithm" = "NLOPT_LN_AUGLAG", "xtol_rel" = 1.0e-8 )
opts <- list( "algorithm" = "NLOPT_LN_AUGLAG", "xtol_rel" = 1.0e-8, "local_opts" = local_opts )

result <- nloptr( x0 = initial_params, eval_f = obj_fun, lb = lower, ub = upper, opts = opts )

# Optimal parameters and objective function value
print(result$solution)
print(result$objective)
```

This example illustrates the use of `nloptr`, a highly flexible package, to handle a non-differentiable objective function (sum of absolute values).  The augmented Lagrangian method (`NLOPT_LN_AUGLAG`) is particularly well-suited for constrained optimization problems involving non-smooth functions.  `nloptr` offers a broader array of algorithms, allowing for tailored solutions depending on the specific characteristics of the problem.  The increased flexibility comes at the cost of slightly more complex setup.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The R documentation for `optim`, `constrOptim`, and relevant packages.  Pay close attention to the arguments and algorithm choices.
*   A textbook on numerical optimization.  Understanding the underlying algorithms enhances the ability to select appropriate methods.
*   Advanced R programming resources.  This is crucial for efficiently handling data structures and implementing potentially complex objective functions and constraints.



By carefully selecting the appropriate optimization algorithm and utilizing the powerful capabilities of R's optimization packages,  you can effectively solve parameter optimization problems subject to range constraints.  The examples above provide a starting point, and adapting them to your specific problem requires a thorough understanding of your objective function and the nature of your constraints.  Remember to carefully consider the computational cost and the properties of your objective function when making algorithmic choices.
