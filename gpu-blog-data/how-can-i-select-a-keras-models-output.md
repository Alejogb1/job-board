Accessing a Keras model's output tensor via its layer name requires careful navigation of the model's functional API or, when using a Sequential model, utilizing its internal structure. Keras, by default, returns the output of the last layer when a model is invoked with data. However, intermediate layer outputs are also accessible via model instantiation and functional manipulation. My previous work in developing a real-time style transfer system necessitated extracting specific features from intermediate layers of a convolutional neural network for manipulation, making this a common task. I've also utilized this in debugging more complex networks when attempting to identify the point at which a signal deviates from the expected behavior, so I've had to become very familiar with this process.

Here's how one can select an output tensor using the layer's name:

**1. Understanding Keras's Model Types and Accessing Layers**

Keras offers two primary model construction approaches: Sequential and Functional. Sequential models are linear stacks of layers, while Functional models allow for the construction of complex, directed acyclic graphs of layers. The method for extracting named tensors differs slightly between them. With the Functional API, the output of any layer can be explicitly named and easily referenced. With Sequential models, the underlying model object contains the layer objects, and we access them via the layer's name attribute.

**2. Accessing Tensor Outputs: Functional API**

In the Functional API, the output tensor of a layer is an object that can be stored and passed as input to other layers. When creating the model, one assigns the output of each layer to a variable, which subsequently becomes a direct handle for extracting that specific tensor. This is the most explicit and recommended approach.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define Input
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))

# Layer 1: Convolutional layer (named explicitly)
conv_1 = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', name='conv_layer_1')(inputs)

# Layer 2: Max Pooling Layer (named explicitly)
pool_1 = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name = 'pool_layer_1')(conv_1)

# Layer 3: Flatten Layer
flat = layers.Flatten()(pool_1)

# Layer 4: Dense Layer (output layer)
outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(flat)

# Build the Model
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

# Extract specific layer output
intermediate_output_tensor = model.get_layer('pool_layer_1').output

# Print layer and output tensor
print(f"Layer name: {model.get_layer('pool_layer_1').name}")
print(f"Output Tensor: {intermediate_output_tensor}")

# Create a smaller model to predict from intermediate output
intermediate_model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs = intermediate_output_tensor)

# Test model on dummy input data
import numpy as np
dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)
output_of_intermediate = intermediate_model(dummy_input)
print(f"Shape of intermediate layer: {output_of_intermediate.shape}")
```

This code demonstrates several key aspects. Firstly, layers are explicitly named during creation, aiding in easy retrieval.  Secondly, `model.get_layer('layer_name').output` gives the tensor object of the named layer. We see the name of the retrieved layer, as well as the tensor object. Finally, we create a sub-model based on the intermediate layer we have selected. This is a common pattern when extracting feature maps for further processing.

**3. Accessing Tensor Outputs: Sequential API**

In Sequential models, layer outputs are implicitly defined by the order in which layers are added. Accessing a tensor by layer name here requires traversing the model's `layers` attribute, which is a list of all layers, and then selecting the layer matching the desired name.  I’ve often used this pattern to debug custom layer implementation, using the `name` attribute to ensure connections are correct when dynamically creating networks.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Create a Sequential Model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1), name = 'conv_layer_seq_1'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name = 'pool_layer_seq_1'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Get intermediate layer by name
intermediate_layer = None
for layer in model.layers:
    if layer.name == 'pool_layer_seq_1':
        intermediate_layer = layer
        break

# If the layer is not found this will produce an error
if intermediate_layer == None:
  print ("Intermediate layer not found")
else:
  intermediate_output_tensor = intermediate_layer.output

  # Print layer and output tensor
  print(f"Layer name: {intermediate_layer.name}")
  print(f"Output Tensor: {intermediate_output_tensor}")

  # Create a smaller model to predict from intermediate output
  intermediate_model = keras.Model(inputs=model.input, outputs = intermediate_output_tensor)

  # Test model on dummy input data
  import numpy as np
  dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)
  output_of_intermediate = intermediate_model(dummy_input)
  print(f"Shape of intermediate layer: {output_of_intermediate.shape}")
```

This code iterates through the model's layers, searching for the desired name. Once found, the output tensor is retrieved through the `output` attribute.  The same logic for creating an intermediate model and running a test on dummy input applies here, ensuring we are correctly retrieving the expected tensor output. The crucial difference from the Functional API is the need to manually iterate through the layers to find a match based on the layer’s name. Note that this code also includes a check to ensure the intermediate layer was found, which is good defensive programming practice.

**4. Handling Multiple Outputs and Shared Layers**

If layers have multiple outputs (e.g. merge layers or custom implementations), accessing the `output` attribute directly will only return one of them. To handle multiple outputs, the layer's `output` attribute acts as an alias for the first output tensor. The remaining tensor outputs can be accessed through a list of output tensors. For shared layers (e.g. a single layer used in multiple parts of the network) accessing `layer.output` returns the last called output.  These nuances are important when crafting more complex network architectures, but would make this discussion too lengthy. This is outside of the scope of this specific response.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define Input
input_1 = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1), name="input_1")
input_2 = keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1), name="input_2")

# Shared Convolutional layer (named explicitly)
shared_conv_1 = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', name='shared_conv_layer_1')

# Apply to each input
conv_1a = shared_conv_1(input_1)
conv_1b = shared_conv_1(input_2)

# Layer 2: Max Pooling Layer (named explicitly)
pool_1a = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name = 'pool_layer_1a')(conv_1a)
pool_1b = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), name = 'pool_layer_1b')(conv_1b)

# Layer 3: Concatenate layer
concat = layers.Concatenate(name = 'concat_layer')([pool_1a,pool_1b])

# Layer 4: Flatten Layer
flat = layers.Flatten()(concat)

# Layer 5: Dense Layer (output layer)
outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(flat)

# Build the Model
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_1,input_2], outputs=outputs)

# Extract specific layer output (shared layer)
intermediate_output_tensor = model.get_layer('shared_conv_layer_1').output

# Print layer and output tensor
print(f"Layer name: {model.get_layer('shared_conv_layer_1').name}")
print(f"Output Tensor: {intermediate_output_tensor}")

# Test model on dummy input data
import numpy as np
dummy_input_1 = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)
dummy_input_2 = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)
output_of_shared_layer = model.get_layer('shared_conv_layer_1')([dummy_input_1,dummy_input_2])
print(f"Shape of intermediate layer: {output_of_shared_layer.shape}")
```

This final code example demonstrates a shared layer, showing that accessing the `output` attribute of the shared layer returns one of the tensor outputs. If more than one tensor output is present, access to them must be through the list of tensors of the layer. We also demonstrate how to pass multiple inputs to the same layer.

**Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration, consult the Keras documentation specifically focusing on Model instantiation and the methods associated with the `keras.layers.Layer` object. Additionally, research into Functional API model construction patterns is beneficial for understanding more complex network architectures. Examining tutorials and example code using the TensorFlow framework, which Keras utilizes, can provide additional insight.  For more theoretical understanding, research material on convolutional neural network and graph neural network implementations will deepen the understanding of the underlying concepts.
