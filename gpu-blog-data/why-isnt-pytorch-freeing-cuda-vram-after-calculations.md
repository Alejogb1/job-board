Specifically, when you think it should be. What are the common reasons for this and how can I best avoid this problem?

The persistent allocation of CUDA VRAM by PyTorch, even after seemingly completing operations, frequently stems from a combination of internal caching mechanisms, asynchronous kernel launches, and reference management complexities. I’ve encountered this issue across numerous deep learning projects, initially misattributing it to memory leaks when, in fact, it's often a more nuanced interaction of PyTorch's memory management strategies. The core problem is that PyTorch, designed for high-performance computing, prioritizes speed over immediate memory reclamation, leading to seemingly held VRAM.

One fundamental aspect is PyTorch's memory allocator. Rather than returning memory to the operating system after each operation, it maintains a pool of allocated VRAM. This caching minimizes the overhead of repeated memory requests, particularly during training loops. When you create a tensor on the GPU, memory is allocated from this pool. Even after you seemingly "release" the tensor by having it go out of scope in your Python code, its underlying memory remains within the allocator's managed pool, waiting to be reused. This approach is significantly faster than constantly requesting and releasing memory through the OS’s allocator but can appear as unreleased memory when observing GPU usage with tools like `nvidia-smi`.

Furthermore, CUDA operations are often executed asynchronously. When you launch a kernel on the GPU, the function returns control to Python almost immediately. The actual kernel execution occurs sometime later on the GPU. This asynchronous nature means that Python code might move on to create new tensors while the GPU is still actively processing data from a previous tensor. The memory occupied by the ‘old’ tensor might not be immediately available until the GPU operation that used it finishes. Until such time, PyTorch cannot immediately release it.

Beyond allocation and asynchrony, object lifetime and reference counting in Python play critical roles. If other Python objects maintain references to tensors, even indirect ones, the garbage collector will not reclaim that tensor’s memory. Consequently, the memory associated with the tensor on the GPU is also retained. This often arises within the internals of large models or when custom classes internally manage tensors, leading to unintentional memory retention that can compound over time.

Let's illustrate this with concrete examples. First, consider a straightforward scenario:

```python
import torch

def simple_gpu_operation():
  device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
  x = torch.randn(10000, 10000, device=device)
  y = torch.randn(10000, 10000, device=device)
  z = torch.matmul(x, y)
  print("Operation complete.")

simple_gpu_operation()
input("Press enter to exit.")
```

This code creates two large tensors, performs a matrix multiplication, and prints a confirmation message. A user observing GPU VRAM using `nvidia-smi` immediately after the operation might expect the memory usage to drop. However, the VRAM usage will likely remain high, as the allocated memory has only returned to the PyTorch cache and is still being maintained by the device. Pressing enter allows the program to exit, at which point the Python garbage collector releases object references, allowing the memory to be reclaimed by the operating system. This first example demonstrates the cache-driven allocation of PyTorch.

A more complex example involves asynchronous operations and the necessity of synchronizing:

```python
import torch
import time

def async_gpu_example():
  device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
  x = torch.randn(10000, 10000, device=device)
  y = torch.randn(10000, 10000, device=device)
  z = torch.matmul(x, y)
  print("Matrix multiplication dispatched (async)")
  time.sleep(1) # Simulating other work, the kernel on the GPU may still be running.
  # Explicit synchronization needed here to free the memory immediately
  torch.cuda.synchronize()
  print("Synchronized, now memory will be free (at some point)")


async_gpu_example()
input("Press enter to exit.")
```

Here, I intentionally included a `time.sleep(1)` to illustrate that the matrix multiplication is initiated but is asynchronous. The `torch.matmul` function does not wait for the GPU to complete the computation before returning, so the tensors *x*, *y*, and *z* remain allocated in the device’s VRAM, even after the first print statement. The VRAM is only released, and thus visible to `nvidia-smi`, after the call to `torch.cuda.synchronize()`, which forces the program to wait for all operations on the current CUDA stream to complete. Without explicit synchronization, the memory associated with z will remain in the VRAM cache until the program finishes its operation.

Finally, consider a class-based example that illustrates the importance of reference management.

```python
import torch

class TensorHolder:
    def __init__(self, size):
        device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
        self.tensor = torch.randn(size, size, device=device)

    def compute(self):
        y = self.tensor * 2
        return y

def manage_references():
  tensor_holder = TensorHolder(10000)
  result = tensor_holder.compute()
  print("Compute done")
  #Explicitly releasing the reference to TensorHolder and it's tensor
  tensor_holder = None
  print("tensor_holder released")
  input("Press enter to exit.")
  # Result is still referencing y from compute until now.
  # result = None # Uncomment to test full release.
  print("Exiting, memory will be freed")
  # Once result goes out of scope, the garbage collector
  # is able to fully clean up the memory from previous calculations.

manage_references()
```

In this example, the `TensorHolder` class encapsulates a tensor. Even after the `manage_references` function completes and `tensor_holder` is set to None, the VRAM isn't necessarily immediately released. This is because the result of the `compute` method, `y`, is still referencing the tensor and is still in scope of the program. The VRAM allocated by the `tensor` in `TensorHolder` is not fully released until the `result` variable goes out of scope and is garbage collected. Uncommenting `result = None` would demonstrate this explicit release and show the memory going to the PyTorch cache. This illustrates the subtle ways references can prolong the life of tensors, and therefore prevent immediate VRAM release.

To mitigate these memory retention issues, several strategies can be employed. First, employ explicit calls to `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` to clear the PyTorch memory cache after critical sections of code where immediate memory release is needed. This should be used judiciously, however, as frequent calls will defeat the purpose of the cache and impact performance. Second, when feasible, use context managers with `torch.no_grad()` to minimize memory allocations during inference. This prevents PyTorch from storing gradients during operations and reduces memory usage. Thirdly, strive for explicit deallocation of tensors by using `del tensor` and/or setting references to `None` when they are no longer needed, as shown in the third example. Finally, and arguably the most effective tool is simply to use PyTorch data loaders that can reduce the amount of memory needed for any given batch, this reduces the overall memory footprint needed at any given time.

In summary, the seeming failure of PyTorch to immediately free CUDA VRAM is primarily a consequence of its memory caching mechanism, the asynchronous nature of GPU operations, and the complexities of object lifetime within Python. Careful memory management practices, coupled with an understanding of PyTorch's internal processes and reference management are the key to controlling VRAM usage and avoiding out-of-memory errors in practical applications.
For further learning, I would recommend reading the official PyTorch documentation on memory management, exploring advanced PyTorch training tutorials, and examining the source code of the PyTorch CUDA allocator. Additionally, I recommend studying best practices for PyTorch memory management, such as using data loaders to minimize memory footprints.
