MySQL's selection of a full table scan despite the presence of an applicable index is a common performance bottleneck I've encountered repeatedly in my years optimizing database systems. The core reason isn't always a simple bug or oversight;  the optimizer, while sophisticated, operates on cost-based estimations, and these estimations can be inaccurate, leading to suboptimal query plans. This inaccuracy arises from several factors, including outdated statistics, inappropriate index choices, problematic query structure, and data distribution characteristics.  Let's examine these in detail.


**1. Outdated Statistics:** The MySQL optimizer relies on statistics gathered about the data within your tables. These statistics include information such as cardinality (the number of unique values in a column) and data distribution. If these statistics are outdated or inaccurate—a common occurrence in frequently updated tables—the optimizer may misjudge the cost of an index scan versus a full table scan.  In my experience, working on a large e-commerce platform, neglecting to regularly update table statistics (using `ANALYZE TABLE` or `UPDATE TABLE STATISTICS`) resulted in significant performance degradation, exactly this issue.


**2. Inappropriate Index Choice:**  Even with an index present, it might be ineffective for a given query. This often occurs when the query conditions don't effectively leverage the index's structure.  For instance, a composite index on columns (A, B, C) is highly effective for queries using `WHERE A = X AND B = Y AND C = Z`.  However, a query using only `WHERE C = Z` might not benefit from this index, because MySQL would still have to scan a potentially large portion of the index to find matching values for C.  I encountered this during a project involving geographical data, where a spatial index was available but the query's filtering criteria were not optimally aligned with the index structure.  A carefully crafted query restructuring is essential for proper index utilization.


**3. Problematic Query Structure:** The way a query is written can significantly impact the optimizer's choice.  The presence of functions applied to indexed columns, for example, can prevent the optimizer from utilizing the index effectively.  Consider a query like `WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2023`. If `order_date` is indexed, the function `YEAR()` prevents index usage, as the optimizer cannot directly compare the indexed column's values to the result of the function.  The most effective method here would be to create a separate column storing the year and indexing that, avoiding function calls within the `WHERE` clause.  Similarly, `OR` conditions frequently force a full table scan unless the conditions can be re-written using `UNION ALL`.  I've personally seen substantial performance improvements by strategically rewriting queries to avoid such scenarios.


**4. Data Distribution:**  A highly skewed data distribution can also lead to full table scans. If a large proportion of values in an indexed column are identical, an index lookup might not significantly reduce the number of rows that need to be examined.  The optimizer estimates the cost considering this distribution; if the estimated cost of a full table scan is lower, it opts for that.  I remember one project involving user activity logs where a small subset of users generated a disproportionate number of records. The index on the user ID column, while technically usable, wasn't as efficient as it initially appeared to be.


Let's illustrate this with code examples:


**Example 1: Outdated Statistics**

```sql
-- Table with outdated statistics
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Inserting data (omitted for brevity)

-- Query using the index
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = 100;

-- Result shows full table scan, even if product_id is indexed
-- Solution: UPDATE TABLE STATISTICS products; or ANALYZE TABLE products; then rerun the EXPLAIN.

-- After updating statistics, the EXPLAIN should show index usage.
```


**Example 2: Inappropriate Index**

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    INDEX idx_customer_orderdate (customer_id, order_date)
);

-- Inserting data (omitted for brevity)

-- Inefficient query
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';

-- Full table scan likely
-- Efficient query (if order_date is frequently used alone)
CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON orders (order_date);
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';
-- Now should use the single-column index

```


**Example 3: Problematic Query Structure**

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    INDEX idx_email (email)
);

-- Inserting data (omitted for brevity)

-- Inefficient query (using function on indexed column)
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE LOWER(email) = 'test@example.com';

-- Likely a full table scan
-- Efficient query
--  While not always possible, consider adding a lowercased email column.
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN lower_email VARCHAR(255);
UPDATE users SET lower_email = LOWER(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_lower_email ON users (lower_email);
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE lower_email = 'test@example.com';
-- Now should utilize the index on lower_email
```


These examples highlight the key reasons for full table scans.  To effectively debug such issues, always employ `EXPLAIN` to analyze the query plan.  Carefully examine the execution plan, paying close attention to the `type` column, which indicates the access method used (e.g., `ALL` for full table scan, `ref` for index lookup).  Furthermore, understanding the data distribution in your tables and routinely updating table statistics are crucial for ensuring that the optimizer makes accurate cost estimations.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* The official MySQL documentation on query optimization.
* Books on database performance tuning, focusing on MySQL.
* Articles and tutorials on indexing strategies and query rewriting techniques.  Pay particular attention to those discussing composite indexes and the effects of data distribution.
* The MySQL Performance Schema documentation, to gain further insights on how MySQL executes queries.  A deeper dive into these metrics allows for even more sophisticated tuning.


By understanding these factors and employing a systematic approach to query optimization, including careful index selection and regular statistics updates, one can significantly reduce the reliance on full table scans and achieve substantial performance improvements. Remember that the specifics of each situation vary, requiring in-depth analysis of both your query and underlying data characteristics.
