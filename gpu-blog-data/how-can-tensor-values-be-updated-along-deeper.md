The core challenge in updating tensor values along deeper dimensions lies in effectively navigating the multi-dimensional indexing required to pinpoint the specific elements for modification.  This isn't simply a matter of incrementing or decrementing; it necessitates a thorough understanding of the tensor's shape and the relationship between indices across different dimensions.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural network training routines highlighted the performance implications of inefficient indexing, leading me to develop strategies that significantly improved computational efficiency.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Tensor manipulation hinges on the accurate representation and manipulation of its indices.  A tensor of shape (x, y, z) has x elements along dimension 0, y elements along dimension 1, and z elements along dimension 2.  Updating a value requires specifying the index along each dimension to reach the target element.  Naive approaches, such as iterating through nested loops for deeper dimensions, become computationally expensive with high dimensionality.  Instead, optimized methods leverage broadcasting and advanced indexing techniques to achieve efficient updates.  These advanced techniques exploit the underlying structure of the tensor, reducing the number of individual element accesses and improving memory access patterns.  Efficient access patterns are critical for performance, especially when dealing with large tensors on hardware with limited memory bandwidth.  This is particularly crucial when dealing with GPU computations where efficient data transfer between CPU and GPU is paramount.

For example, consider updating specific elements in a four-dimensional tensor representing a batch of images with multiple color channels. Each element could represent a pixel value.  Directly accessing each element using nested loops for a large batch size is highly inefficient. Vectorized operations or advanced indexing techniques provide significant performance advantages.  These allow for simultaneous operations across multiple elements, exploiting SIMD instructions available in modern processors and GPUs.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Using Numpy's advanced indexing for selective updates:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 4D tensor (batch, height, width, channels)
tensor = np.random.rand(2, 32, 32, 3)

# Update specific elements using boolean indexing
mask = tensor > 0.5  # Create a boolean mask based on a condition
tensor[mask] = 1.0  # Update elements where the mask is True

# Update specific slices along deeper dimensions
tensor[:, 10:20, 10:20, 0] = 0.0 # Update a slice of the first channel

print(tensor)
```

*Commentary*: This example leverages NumPy's powerful broadcasting and boolean indexing capabilities.  The boolean mask `mask` efficiently identifies elements satisfying the condition (values greater than 0.5).  The subsequent assignment `tensor[mask] = 1.0` updates all selected elements simultaneously.  Furthermore, specific slices along the height and width dimensions (for the first channel) are updated without explicit looping, showcasing efficient slicing for deep dimension modification.


**Example 2:  Updating elements using multi-dimensional indices:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 3D tensor
tensor = np.random.rand(2, 3, 4)

# Define indices for elements to be updated
indices = np.array([[0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 3]])  # Update specific elements using multiple index pairs.
updates = np.array([10, 20]) # Values for updates

tensor[tuple(indices)] = updates # Update specified elements

print(tensor)
```

*Commentary*: This demonstrates updating using multiple index tuples simultaneously.  The `indices` array provides row-wise index tuples for each element to be updated.  `tuple(indices)` converts this into a form acceptable for indexing the tensor. `updates` array supplies the respective updated values.  This approach bypasses explicit looping, leveraging NumPy's internal optimized indexing routines for better performance.  It's critical to note that the shape of `indices` and `updates` must be consistent for correct operation.



**Example 3:  Utilizing `einsum` for complex transformations:**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 3D tensor
tensor = np.random.rand(2, 3, 4)

# Update elements based on a transformation using einsum
update_matrix = np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8]])
tensor = np.einsum('ijk,kl->ijl', tensor, update_matrix)

print(tensor)
```

*Commentary*:  This showcases NumPy's `einsum` function for a more complex transformation.  While not directly updating individual elements, it modifies the tensor based on a matrix multiplication along a specific dimension.  `einsum` offers a concise and efficient way to perform arbitrary tensor contractions and transformations, including operations that might require multiple nested loops when implemented explicitly.  This method is particularly advantageous when dealing with linear transformations or other mathematical operations on tensors.  Understanding Einstein summation notation is key to efficiently using this function.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting the official documentation for NumPy, focusing on its array manipulation and broadcasting capabilities.  Further, a thorough understanding of linear algebra principles, especially matrix operations and tensor calculus, will greatly enhance one's ability to perform complex tensor manipulations effectively.  Finally, studying optimized array manipulation techniques within the context of high-performance computing will provide further insights into achieving computational efficiency.  These resources, along with dedicated practice, will equip you to handle high-dimensional tensor updates with finesse and efficiency.
