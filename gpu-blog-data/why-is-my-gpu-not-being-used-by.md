TensorFlow's failure to utilize the GPU is often attributable to a mismatch between the TensorFlow installation, the CUDA toolkit version, and the NVIDIA driver.  I've encountered this issue numerous times over the years while working on large-scale image processing projects and high-performance computing tasks. The core problem usually boils down to an incompatibility in the underlying software stack.  Correctly identifying and resolving this incompatibility requires systematic troubleshooting across these three components.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow leverages CUDA, NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model, to accelerate computation on NVIDIA GPUs.  This acceleration is achieved through highly optimized kernels that handle matrix operations and other computationally intensive tasks far more efficiently than CPU-based calculations.  However, for this acceleration to occur, several conditions must be met.  First, TensorFlow must be compiled with CUDA support. This is usually achieved during installation by selecting the appropriate CUDA-enabled wheel file.  Second, the version of CUDA installed on your system must be compatible with the version of cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) that TensorFlow expects.  Third, the NVIDIA driver version must be compatible with both CUDA and cuDNN. Any mismatch in these versions will result in TensorFlow falling back to CPU execution, negating the benefits of the GPU. Furthermore, even with compatible versions, improper configuration or environment variables can still prevent GPU utilization.  Incorrectly specified device placements within your TensorFlow code also contribute significantly to this problem.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Verifying GPU Availability and TensorFlow Configuration:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

try:
    gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    if gpus:
        try:
            # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
            for gpu in gpus:
                tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
            logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')
            print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
        except RuntimeError as e:
            # Virtual devices must be set before configuring Kears
            print(e)
except:
    print("No GPUs found. Check your NVIDIA drivers and CUDA installation.")


with tf.device('/GPU:0'):  # Explicitly specify GPU device
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3])
    b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2])
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)
    print(c)
```

**Commentary:** This code first checks for available GPUs using `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')`.  It then attempts to enable memory growth, a crucial step for efficient GPU memory management. Finally, it performs a matrix multiplication explicitly on GPU 0 (`/GPU:0`) to verify if TensorFlow is using the GPU.  Failure to print the result of `c` on the GPU and instead seeing it calculated on the CPU indicates a problem. The error handling included addresses common runtime errors.


**Example 2:  Handling Multiple GPUs:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy() # Or other strategies like MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy
with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

# ...rest of your model training code...
```

**Commentary:**  When multiple GPUs are present, using a distribution strategy like `MirroredStrategy` is crucial.  This allows TensorFlow to distribute the computation across available GPUs, significantly improving training speed.  Failing to use a distribution strategy, even with multiple GPUs, can lead to only one GPU being used or no GPU utilization at all.


**Example 3:  Checking TensorFlow and CUDA Versions:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import subprocess

print("TensorFlow version:", tf.version.VERSION)

try:
    cuda_version = subprocess.check_output(['nvcc', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip()
    print("CUDA version:", cuda_version)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("CUDA not found. Ensure CUDA is installed and added to your PATH.")
except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
    print("Error executing nvcc.  Check your CUDA installation.")

#Further checks for cuDNN version can be done via similar methods if it's needed or provided as package information.
```

**Commentary:** This code snippet displays the installed TensorFlow and CUDA versions.  Checking these versions against the compatibility matrix provided by NVIDIA is essential for ensuring compatibility.  In my experience, discrepancies often manifest as silent failures where TensorFlow defaults to CPU computation. The error handling accounts for scenarios where CUDA might not be installed or configured correctly.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is your primary resource.  Thoroughly review the installation guides and troubleshooting sections specific to your operating system and hardware.  Consult the NVIDIA CUDA documentation for detailed information on CUDA installation, configuration, and compatibility with various hardware and software components.  Finally, explore online forums dedicated to TensorFlow and deep learning; these communities often contain solutions to common problems, including those related to GPU utilization.  Remember to precisely specify your operating system, TensorFlow version, CUDA version, and NVIDIA driver version when seeking help.  This detailed information is crucial for effective troubleshooting.
