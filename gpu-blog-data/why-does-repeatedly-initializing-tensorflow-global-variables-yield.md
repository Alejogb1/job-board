The reason repeatedly initializing TensorFlow global variables appears to yield identical results stems from a misunderstanding of how TensorFlow manages its computational graph and variable state. Specifically, the initialization operation itself, when executed multiple times within the same TensorFlow session and graph, doesn't overwrite the *values* currently stored in the variables unless a subsequent assignment operation is also performed.

TensorFlow’s computational model operates on the concept of a graph. This graph represents the sequence of mathematical operations that will be performed. Variables, within this graph, are essentially placeholders that hold numerical values. When a TensorFlow variable is created, it's given an initial value or a method to obtain one. The initialization operation, often `tf.global_variables_initializer()` or a more targeted initializer, sets these variables to their specified initial states. Critically, this initialization process is an operation within the computational graph, *not* a direct manipulation of an underlying, mutable memory space as one might expect in purely imperative languages.

The key to understanding why repeated initializations don't lead to changes lies in the execution model. When `tf.global_variables_initializer()` is executed for the first time within a `tf.Session` context, the TensorFlow runtime traverses the graph, finds the initialization operations, and performs them. This assigns the initial values to their associated variables. Subsequent calls to `tf.global_variables_initializer()` on the same variables within the same session and graph do not *reset* the variables to their initial *values*. Rather, they attempt to execute the same node in the graph again but the variables remain the same because TensorFlow recognizes they are already in the right state. The initialization operation, fundamentally, is a node in the graph. After it executes once, the node's output is cached. The variable effectively retains the value assigned from the initial execution unless we perform another *assignment* operation on the variable, overwriting the stored values with some new computation or constant.

Consider a scenario where a neural network's weights are initialized. If we were to naively expect repeated initializations to 'reset' the model, we might be attempting to retrain our network incorrectly. This is why controlled updates to variable values are essential for achieving meaningful learning in TensorFlow models.

Here are three code examples to illustrate this behavior:

**Example 1: Basic Variable Initialization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a variable with initial value 1.0
var = tf.Variable(1.0, name="my_variable")

# Create the initialization operation
init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()

# Start a session
with tf.Session() as sess:
  # Initialize the variable
  sess.run(init_op)
  print("Value after first init:", sess.run(var))

  # Initialize the variable again
  sess.run(init_op)
  print("Value after second init:", sess.run(var))

  # Explicitly assign a new value
  assign_op = var.assign(2.0)
  sess.run(assign_op)
  print("Value after explicit assignment:", sess.run(var))

  # Initialize again
  sess.run(init_op)
  print("Value after init, following assignment:", sess.run(var))

```

In this example, the first initialization correctly sets `var` to 1.0. The second initialization does not change the value. Only the explicit assignment changes the value to 2.0. The subsequent `init_op` after assigning the value of 2.0 does not revert the variable's value back to 1.0. This highlights the point that initialization *alone*, in this context, does not alter an already initialized variable. It simply is run again as an already performed node in the computation graph. The `assign_op` is the only operator that affects the value directly.

**Example 2: Counter Example with Increment**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a variable starting at 0.
counter = tf.Variable(0, name="counter")

# Define an increment operation
increment_op = counter.assign_add(1)

init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(init_op) #Initialize
    print("Initial Counter:", sess.run(counter))

    # Execute increment and print
    for _ in range(3):
        sess.run(increment_op)
        print("Counter:", sess.run(counter))

    sess.run(init_op)
    print("Counter after second init:", sess.run(counter))

```

Here, the counter variable is initialized to 0. The increment operation clearly increases the value each time. The repeated initialization, after the increment operations, does not reset the counter back to 0. Instead, it leaves the counter at the value reached from the increment operations. This shows that initializers *cannot* undo the effect of other operations.

**Example 3: Initialization with Random Values**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
# Define a variable using random normal initialization
rand_var = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([5]), name="rand_var")

init_op = tf.global_variables_initializer()

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(init_op)
    print("Random variable first init:", sess.run(rand_var))
    sess.run(init_op)
    print("Random variable second init:", sess.run(rand_var))

    rand_assign = rand_var.assign(tf.random_normal([5]))
    sess.run(rand_assign)

    print("Random variable after assigning new random:", sess.run(rand_var))

    sess.run(init_op)
    print("Random variable init after assigning random:", sess.run(rand_var))

```

Even when variables are initialized with random values, the problem persists. The first random initialization sets the initial values. The second initialization, once again, does not change the previously assigned random numbers. We see the explicit assignment of new random values does correctly update the variable. However, running the initialization once more still leaves the new values unchanged. This confirms that the observed behavior isn't particular to fixed numerical initial values, but applies even to operations which produce random numbers. TensorFlow is designed to be deterministic given the same graph and variable state and running the same node in the graph does not change the values of the variables, once a value has been assigned to them.

In conclusion, the seemingly unchanged values after repeated variable initializations stem from the nature of the TensorFlow computational graph. Initializers are operations in the graph, which set initial values to variables *the first time* they are run. Subsequent executions do not *reset* the values. This understanding is crucial when building and training TensorFlow models, where explicit variable updates using assign or other operators must be used to modify variables during training or inference.

For further conceptual understanding, I would recommend a deep dive into the official TensorFlow documentation, focusing on the sections covering variables, graphs, and sessions. Also, researching the computational graph execution model will provide more context. Studying example use cases will clarify how variables and assignment operators are used in neural networks and how initializers are deployed in more realistic scenarios. The book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron is a solid resource to better understand this concept in practice. Additionally, any rigorous textbook on deep learning should also detail how variables are managed in the context of model creation and training.
