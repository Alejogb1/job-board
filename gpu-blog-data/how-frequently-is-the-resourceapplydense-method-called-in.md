The frequency of `_resource_apply_dense` calls within a Keras optimizer is directly tied to the optimizer's update mechanism and the structure of the model's trainable variables.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks has shown that this method is invoked once per weight tensor update during each gradient descent step.  This holds true regardless of the specific Keras optimizer used (e.g., Adam, SGD, RMSprop), though the internal calculations within `_resource_apply_dense` will naturally differ.  Let's examine this in detail.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras optimizers, at their core, are responsible for adjusting the model's weights based on the calculated gradients.  These gradients represent the direction and magnitude of the weight adjustments needed to minimize the loss function.  The `_resource_apply_dense` method is a crucial component of this process.  It's designed to handle dense weight tensors, which are the most common type of weight representation in neural networks.

During training, the backpropagation algorithm computes the gradients for each weight tensor in the model. These gradients are then passed to the optimizer.  The optimizer uses these gradients, along with its internal state (e.g., momentum, moving averages), to compute the weight updates.  This update calculation is where `_resource_apply_dense` comes into play.  Specifically, this function applies the calculated updates to the dense weight tensors.

Because every trainable weight in a model is typically a dense tensor (unless specialized layers like convolutional or recurrent layers are used, which would involve different update methods), and because the optimizer needs to update each of these weights after calculating the gradients in a single batch of data, `_resource_apply_dense` is called once for each weight tensor per gradient descent step. The number of calls, therefore, directly corresponds to the number of trainable weight tensors in the model.

Consider a simple model with two dense layers.  The first layer might have 1000 weights connecting to 64 nodes, forming a 1000x64 weight matrix. The second layer might have 64x10 weights.  During a single training step, `_resource_apply_dense` would be called twiceâ€”once for the first layer's weight matrix and once for the second layer's.  For more complex models with numerous layers and larger weight matrices, the number of calls increases proportionally.

It's also important to note the role of batch size.  The gradients are calculated for an entire batch of training examples.  Thus, `_resource_apply_dense` is called once per weight tensor *per batch*.  A larger batch size does not increase the number of calls per batch but instead modifies the magnitude of the gradients used in the update calculations.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Here are three examples illustrating the context of `_resource_apply_dense`, focusing on different optimizer implementations and model structures.  Note that direct access to `_resource_apply_dense` is usually not needed for standard model training; it's an internal function. These examples emphasize conceptual understanding.

**Example 1: Simple Model with SGD**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Define a simple model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model with SGD optimizer
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='categorical_crossentropy')

# Access the optimizer's internal variables (Illustrative - not typically done)
optimizer = model.optimizer
#  The following line is for illustrative purposes and not a typical workflow. 
# Accessing internal methods directly is generally discouraged and may change across TensorFlow versions.
# Instead, focus on understanding the overall mechanism.
#  Assume a hypothetically accessible method to get the dense weight update operation count
#  In reality such an operation count is not directly available in the way illustrated here.
# count = optimizer._get_dense_update_count()  # Hypothetical method

# Train the model (Illustrative - demonstrates the calls in the context of training)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
# Each epoch would invoke _resource_apply_dense twice per batch (once per dense layer)

# Hypothetical output (this would not be the actual output)
# print(f"Number of _resource_apply_dense calls per epoch: {count * 10}")
```

**Example 2:  Model with Multiple Dense Layers and Adam**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=64)
# _resource_apply_dense will be called three times per batch in each epoch (one for each dense layer).
```

**Example 3: Custom Optimizer (Illustrative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyOptimizer(keras.optimizers.Optimizer):
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, name="MyOptimizer"):
        super().__init__(name)
        self._set_hyper("learning_rate", keras.backend.variable(learning_rate))


    def _create_slots(self, var_list):
        for var in var_list:
            self.add_slot(var, "m")  #example slot for momentum

    def _resource_apply_dense(self, grad, var, apply_state): #Overridden method
        var_update = tf.subtract(var, tf.multiply(self.learning_rate, grad))
        return tf.assign(var, var_update) # Simple update rule


    def _resource_apply_sparse(self, grad, var, indices, apply_state): #Necessary for completeness
        raise NotImplementedError


    def get_config(self): #Necessary for serialization
        base_config = super().get_config()
        return {
            **base_config,
            "learning_rate": self._serialize_hyperparameter("learning_rate"),
        }


model = keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,))])
opt = MyOptimizer()
model.compile(optimizer=opt, loss='mse')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)
#_resource_apply_dense is called once per batch.
```

These examples illustrate that the frequency is determined by the number of dense weight tensors and the number of batches processed.  The specific optimizer only affects the internal calculations within `_resource_apply_dense`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of Keras optimizers and their internal workings, I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, focusing on the source code of various optimizers.  Furthermore, a thorough understanding of gradient descent algorithms and their variations is essential.  Finally, studying the implementation details of TensorFlow's low-level operations related to tensor manipulation will provide significant insight.
