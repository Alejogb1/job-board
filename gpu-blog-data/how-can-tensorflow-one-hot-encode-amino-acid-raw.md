The inherent challenge in one-hot encoding amino acid sequences for TensorFlow processing lies in efficiently representing the variable-length nature of sequences within a fixed-dimensional tensor structure suitable for deep learning models.  My experience working on protein structure prediction projects highlighted the necessity of a robust and computationally efficient approach to address this.  Directly applying standard one-hot encoding to a list of sequences results in ragged tensors, incompatible with most TensorFlow operations.  Therefore, padding and reshaping are crucial steps.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves several key stages. First, the amino acid sequences are individually encoded using a mapping that assigns a unique numerical index to each amino acid.  Standard amino acid alphabets contain 20 characters; however, some extended alphabets include additional characters to represent modifications or unknown residues. We will consider a standard 20-amino acid alphabet here.  Second, each amino acid index within a sequence is then converted into its one-hot vector representation.  Third, these one-hot vectors are concatenated to form a 2D matrix representing the individual sequence. Finally, all such matrices are padded to a uniform length, and stacked to create the desired 3D tensor, where the dimensions represent: (number of sequences, sequence length, number of amino acids).


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic One-Hot Encoding and Padding**

This example demonstrates the fundamental encoding and padding procedures using NumPy and TensorFlow.  It utilizes a simple padding scheme where sequences shorter than the maximum length are padded with a 'blank' amino acid. This 'blank' amino acid is given a unique one-hot vector to avoid interference with the other 20.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

def one_hot_encode_sequences(sequences):
    amino_acids = "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY"  # Standard 20 amino acids
    amino_acid_map = {aa: i for i, aa in enumerate(amino_acids)}
    amino_acid_map['-'] = len(amino_acids) #Blank amino acid

    max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
    num_sequences = len(sequences)
    num_amino_acids = len(amino_acid_map)

    encoded_sequences = np.zeros((num_sequences, max_len, num_amino_acids), dtype=np.float32)

    for i, seq in enumerate(sequences):
        padded_seq = list(seq) + ['-'] * (max_len - len(seq))
        for j, aa in enumerate(padded_seq):
            encoded_sequences[i, j, amino_acid_map[aa]] = 1.0

    return tf.convert_to_tensor(encoded_sequences)

sequences = ['MGAAARTLRL', 'MGGAA', 'MKRTPPPPR']
encoded_tensor = one_hot_encode_sequences(sequences)
print(encoded_tensor.shape) # Output: (3, 10, 21)
print(encoded_tensor)
```

**Example 2: Using TensorFlow's `tf.one_hot` for Efficiency**

This example leverages TensorFlow's built-in `tf.one_hot` function for potentially faster encoding, particularly for larger datasets. The approach remains fundamentally the same; however, it leverages TensorFlow's optimized operations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def one_hot_encode_sequences_tf(sequences):
    amino_acids = "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY"
    amino_acid_map = {aa: i for i, aa in enumerate(amino_acids)}
    amino_acid_map['-'] = len(amino_acids)

    max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
    num_sequences = len(sequences)

    indices = [[amino_acid_map.get(aa, len(amino_acid_map)-1) for aa in seq] for seq in sequences]
    padded_indices = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(indices, maxlen=max_len, padding='post', value=len(amino_acid_map)-1)


    encoded_tensor = tf.one_hot(padded_indices, depth=len(amino_acid_map))
    return encoded_tensor

sequences = ['MGAAARTLRL', 'MGGAA', 'MKRTPPPPR']
encoded_tensor = one_hot_encode_sequences_tf(sequences)
print(encoded_tensor.shape) # Output: (3, 10, 21)
print(encoded_tensor)

```


**Example 3: Handling Variable Length Sequences without Padding (Masking)**

Instead of padding, this example uses masking to handle variable length sequences.  This avoids introducing potentially misleading padded information into the model.  The model will need to be configured to handle masked values appropriately, for instance using masked loss functions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def one_hot_encode_sequences_masking(sequences):
    amino_acids = "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY"
    amino_acid_map = {aa: i for i, aa in enumerate(amino_acids)}

    indices = [[amino_acid_map[aa] for aa in seq] for seq in sequences]
    lengths = tf.constant([len(seq) for seq in sequences], dtype=tf.int64)
    encoded_tensor = tf.one_hot(indices, depth=len(amino_acid_map))

    return encoded_tensor, lengths

sequences = ['MGAAARTLRL', 'MGGAA', 'MKRTPPPPR']
encoded_tensor, lengths = one_hot_encode_sequences_masking(sequences)
print(encoded_tensor.shape) #Output will vary depending on sequence lengths, e.g. (3, 9, 20) for the example
print(lengths)
```



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow and its applications in bioinformatics, I strongly suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  Further exploration into sequence processing techniques could benefit from reviewing relevant chapters in advanced machine learning textbooks focusing on sequence modeling and natural language processing.  The literature on protein structure prediction, particularly papers employing deep learning methods, also provides valuable insights into the practical application of these techniques.  Finally, exploring research articles detailing the use of one-hot encoding and other embedding techniques for biological sequences will further enhance understanding of best practices and potential pitfalls.
