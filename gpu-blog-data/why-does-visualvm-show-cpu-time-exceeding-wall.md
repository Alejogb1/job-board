I've encountered scenarios where VisualVM reports CPU time significantly exceeding wall clock time, and it’s a symptom of multi-threaded application behavior, specifically where parallel execution across multiple cores is taking place. The core reason boils down to how these times are measured and what they represent. Wall clock time, or elapsed time, is simply the duration a process runs from start to finish, as perceived by an external observer. CPU time, on the other hand, is the aggregate time all the threads within that process spend actively utilizing CPU resources. When an application employs multiple threads executing simultaneously on different CPU cores, the sum of their individual CPU times can easily surpass the total wall clock time.

To understand this more thoroughly, consider a single-threaded application. In this basic case, the CPU time will generally align closely with the wall clock time. The application’s single thread is the sole consumer of CPU resources, so the time it spends on the CPU closely resembles the total time the application is running. However, as we introduce multiple threads designed to accomplish independent or semi-independent tasks, the relationship between CPU time and wall clock time changes significantly. If these threads run on different CPU cores simultaneously, the total amount of work being done by the application in a given period expands. Consequently, the aggregated CPU time increases, while the wall clock time might not see a proportional increase, particularly if core utilization is high.

The key distinction is that wall clock time measures how long the application is running in real-world terms, while CPU time measures the sum of time all its threads were actively executing on a processing unit. Therefore, if multiple threads are running in parallel, the combined CPU time will necessarily be greater than what we see on a clock or a stopwatch. This phenomenon isn't an error in measurement but rather a fundamental aspect of parallel processing. The greater the number of threads that can run concurrently and actively utilize the CPU, the greater the potential for CPU time to outstrip wall clock time. In addition to parallel execution, other factors can also contribute to this discrepancy. Context switching, where the operating system rapidly switches between threads, also contributes to increased aggregated CPU time, even though the individual threads are not necessarily executing continuously. While context switching overhead is usually small, it does increase CPU time, as the kernel is using processing power for thread management, which is captured in the application's CPU time metrics.

Here are some code examples to illustrate the phenomenon:

**Example 1: Single-Threaded Application**

```java
public class SingleThreaded {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
           result += i;
        }
        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        System.out.println("Single Thread Result: " + result);
        System.out.println("Wall Clock Time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " ms");
    }
}
```

In this first example, the code executes a computationally intensive loop on a single thread. When run, the wall clock time should closely approximate the reported CPU time (observable through tools like VisualVM or jconsole), assuming no significant competing processes. The output will typically show that the elapsed time is similar to the CPU usage reported over the period of the calculation. There is one active thread consuming CPU and thus a close alignment between the measures is expected.

**Example 2: Multi-Threaded Application using Runnable**

```java
public class MultiThreadedRunnable {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        int numThreads = 4;
        Thread[] threads = new Thread[numThreads];
        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
             threads[i] = new Thread(new ComputationRunnable());
            threads[i].start();
        }

       try {
            for (Thread thread : threads) {
               thread.join();
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
             Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }

        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
         System.out.println("Multi-threaded (Runnable) Wall Clock Time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " ms");
    }
    static class ComputationRunnable implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            long result = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < 250000000; i++) { //Reduced loop for equal work
               result += i;
             }
            System.out.println("Thread Result: "+result);
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we create four threads, each executing a similar computationally intensive operation as in the single-threaded example. Note that the loop count is reduced to ensure comparable total work. Since these threads can potentially execute concurrently on multiple CPU cores, the total CPU time will almost always be greater than the wall clock time. Each thread is adding CPU time to the application as it runs. The wall clock time represents the overall duration of the execution of all these threads, while the CPU time aggregates the processing times of all threads and is expected to exceed the elapsed time.

**Example 3: Multi-Threaded Application using Executors**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class MultiThreadedExecutor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        int numThreads = 4;
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numThreads);

        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
            executor.submit(() -> {
                long result = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < 250000000; j++) {
                    result += j;
                }
                 System.out.println("Thread Result: "+result);
            });
        }

       executor.shutdown();
       try {
            if (!executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                 executor.shutdownNow();
             }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            executor.shutdownNow();
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
         System.out.println("Multi-threaded (Executor) Wall Clock Time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " ms");
    }
}
```

This example is similar to Example 2, but utilizes an `ExecutorService` for managing threads. This pattern is often more manageable in complex applications. The core principle still holds: multiple threads execute in parallel, increasing aggregated CPU time beyond wall clock time.  While the implementation differs, the underlying principle of concurrent thread execution leading to increased CPU time remains consistent. The executor provides further control over thread management, but the impact on CPU time and wall clock time is still the result of concurrent processing.

In all of these scenarios, VisualVM would report CPU times exceeding wall clock time in examples 2 and 3, but CPU time would be very close to the wall clock time in the single-threaded example. This is because of the concurrent execution in the multi-threaded cases, which drives total CPU consumption higher than a typical stopwatch reading of elapsed wall clock time. The amount by which CPU time exceeds wall clock time will depend on thread count, core availability, and the nature of the tasks performed by each thread.

For further study, I'd recommend exploring resources detailing operating system concepts, specifically process and thread management.  Look for literature covering concurrency patterns and parallel programming. Textbooks on advanced Java programming would also be beneficial, focusing on threads, concurrency utilities, and performance analysis.  Researching how different profilers work under the hood, particularly in respect to CPU usage measurement, can also increase understanding. Examining articles discussing the differences between kernel and user CPU time is also helpful. These resources should provide deeper context and a more detailed grasp on how concurrent execution impacts CPU and wall clock time.
