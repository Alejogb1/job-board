Saving a Keras subclassed model requires a nuanced approach compared to saving models built using the Keras sequential or functional APIs.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects highlighted this distinction, particularly when dealing with models incorporating custom layers or complex training logic.  The standard `model.save()` method isn't directly sufficient; instead, we must leverage the `save_weights()` and `save()` methods judiciously, coupled with careful management of the model's architecture definition.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras subclassed models define their architecture within a class inheriting from `tf.keras.Model`. This approach offers flexibility, but it necessitates a two-step saving process.  The model's architecture itself is not directly serialized by `model.save()`.  Instead, `model.save()` primarily saves the model's weights and the optimizer's state.  Therefore, to fully restore the model later, we must save both the weights and a means of reconstructing the model architecture.  This usually involves saving the model's class definition separately (e.g., as a Python file) or using a mechanism to reconstruct the architecture from the saved weights.

The optimal strategy depends on the complexity of the model.  For relatively simple subclassed models, saving the model's weights along with the architecture definition in a separate file provides sufficient reproducibility. For more complex architectures involving custom layers with numerous parameters, a more robust approach involving a custom serialization method might be preferable.  In scenarios where the model architecture can be programmatically defined (e.g., based on configuration parameters), saving only the configuration and weights might be the most efficient.

Furthermore,  the choice between saving the entire model using `model.save()` (which attempts to save both the weights and architecture, often through a mechanism like saving the config, but may not always capture custom components successfully) and saving weights solely via `model.save_weights()` depends on the nature of the custom layers and the desired level of reproducibility.  In scenarios where recreating the model architecture is straightforward, saving just the weights and reconstructing the model during loading may be more efficient.



**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Subclassed Model with Saved Architecture**

This example showcases a simple subclassed model and demonstrates saving both the model's weights and the architecture definition.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)

# Model instantiation and training (omitted for brevity)
model = SimpleModel()
# ... training code ...

# Saving the model
model.save_weights('simple_model_weights.h5')

# To reload:
new_model = SimpleModel() #Recreate the architecture
new_model.load_weights('simple_model_weights.h5')
```

This approach is suitable for straightforward models. The architecture is implicitly defined within the `SimpleModel` class, and `load_weights` efficiently restores the learned parameters.  However, this approach relies on the `SimpleModel` class being available during loading.

**Example 2:  Model with Custom Layer and Separate Architecture File**

For more complex models, especially those with custom layers, explicitly saving the architecture is often necessary for complete reproducibility.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import json

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  # ... custom layer implementation ...

class ComplexModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, config):
    super(ComplexModel, self).__init__()
    self.custom_layer = CustomLayer(**config['custom_layer'])
    self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

  def call(self, inputs):
    x = self.custom_layer(inputs)
    return self.dense(x)

# ... Model instantiation and training (omitted for brevity) ...

#Saving architecture
config = {'custom_layer': {'param1':10, 'param2':0.5}} #Example config
with open('complex_model_config.json','w') as f:
    json.dump(config,f)

model.save_weights('complex_model_weights.h5')

# To reload:
with open('complex_model_config.json','r') as f:
    config = json.load(f)
new_model = ComplexModel(config)
new_model.load_weights('complex_model_weights.h5')
```

Here, the model's architecture is partially defined by a JSON configuration file, allowing for flexibility and reproducibility even if the `ComplexModel` class undergoes changes. The custom layer's parameters are included in the configuration.

**Example 3:  Using `model.save()` for simpler architectures (with caution):**

For simpler models where the architecture is easily reconstructed and the custom layers are straightforward,  `model.save()` might appear to work. However, this method's reliability with custom components varies across Keras versions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleCustomModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCustomModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return x

#Model Instantiation and training (omitted)

model = SimpleCustomModel()
model.save('simple_custom_model')


#Reload
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('simple_custom_model')
```

This seemingly simple approach should be used cautiously. It might work for certain simple subclassed models, but its success is not guaranteed, particularly with complex custom components or custom training loops.  The previous approaches, separating weight and architecture saving, are more robust and less prone to unexpected behavior.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on saving and loading models.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning with a strong Keras focus.  Finally, peer-reviewed publications focusing on model serialization and reproducibility in deep learning frameworks.  Carefully reviewing these resources will provide a more nuanced understanding of the intricacies involved in saving and loading Keras subclassed models.  Thorough testing of the chosen method across different environments and Keras versions is crucial to ensure reproducibility.  Always prioritize a method that explicitly handles the architecture definition separately from the model's weights.
