The "sample must be less than 1" error within TensorFlow Probability's (TFP) distributions typically stems from a mismatch between the `sample_shape` argument provided to the distribution's `sample()` method and the underlying distribution's support.  My experience troubleshooting this, spanning several large-scale Bayesian inference projects, reveals that this error frequently arises from misunderstanding the interplay between batch shape, event shape, and the intended number of samples.  The core issue is not simply a numerical constraint on sample values, but rather an inconsistency in how TensorFlow interprets the dimensionality of the sampling process.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow distributions operate on tensors, and these tensors have inherent shapes.  The `sample()` method accepts a `sample_shape` argument, which determines the number of independent samples drawn from the distribution.  This is separate from the distribution's `batch_shape` (representing independent distributions) and `event_shape` (representing the dimensionality of a single sample from a single distribution).  The error "sample must be less than 1" usually appears when you provide a `sample_shape` argument that is misinterpreted by the distribution due to an incompatibility with its `batch_shape` or `event_shape`. This misunderstanding often manifests as attempts to draw a number of samples that exceeds the available data or contradicts the intended dimensionality of each individual sample.  For instance, if you're working with a multivariate distribution and intend to sample multiple independent instances, the dimensions must be carefully accounted for in both the `sample_shape` and `batch_shape`.  Incorrectly specifying either can result in shape mismatches that TensorFlow interprets as an attempt to sample a fractional number of times, leading to the error.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Incorrect `sample_shape` for a univariate distribution:**

```python
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
import tensorflow as tf

dist = tfp.distributions.Normal(loc=0., scale=1.)  # Standard Normal

# Incorrect: Attempts to sample a non-integer number of times given the batch shape.
try:
  samples = dist.sample(sample_shape=[0.5])
  print(samples)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
  print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
```

*Commentary*: This code attempts to draw 0.5 samples, which is mathematically impossible. The `sample_shape` must contain integers.  The error clearly indicates the fundamental problem of requesting a non-integer number of samples.  Correct usage would require an integer value, such as `sample_shape=[10]` to draw 10 samples.


**Example 2: Mismatch between `batch_shape` and `sample_shape`:**

```python
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a batch of Normal distributions
dist = tfp.distributions.Normal(loc=[0., 1.], scale=[1., 2.]) # Batch size of 2

# Incorrect: Attempts to draw more samples than available in the batch.
try:
    samples = dist.sample(sample_shape=[3])
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}")

# Correct: Draw samples respecting the batch_shape.
samples_correct = dist.sample(sample_shape=[1])
print(samples_correct)
```

*Commentary*: Here, we have a batch of two normal distributions.  Attempting to sample three times will lead to an error because the requested samples exceed the available distributions in the batch.  To correct this, you either need to decrease `sample_shape` or increase the `batch_shape` to align with the available distributions.  The corrected section demonstrates drawing a single sample per distribution in the batch.


**Example 3:  Multivariate distribution and sample shape:**

```python
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
import tensorflow as tf

# Bivariate Gaussian distribution (2-dimensional event shape)
dist = tfp.distributions.MultivariateNormalDiag(loc=[0., 0.], scale_diag=[1., 1.])

# Incorrect: Mismatch between sample shape and event shape interpretation.
try:
  samples = dist.sample(sample_shape=[1, 0.5]) # Trying to sample 0.5 times in one of the dimensions
  print(samples)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
  print(f"Error encountered: {e}")


# Correct:  Drawing 10 samples of the 2D distribution
samples_correct = dist.sample(sample_shape=[10])
print(samples_correct)
```

*Commentary*: This demonstrates the importance of considering the `event_shape` when working with multivariate distributions.  Incorrectly specifying `sample_shape` as `[1, 0.5]` attempts to sample a non-integer number of times along one of the sample dimensions. The corrected version shows the correct way to draw multiple samples from the bivariate Gaussian distribution by specifying a single integer in the `sample_shape`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow Probability documentation, specifically the sections detailing distributions, sampling methods, and tensor shapes.  A thorough understanding of NumPy's array manipulation and broadcasting rules is essential, as TensorFlow's tensor operations closely mirror NumPy's behavior.  Finally, I would suggest consulting advanced materials on Bayesian inference and probabilistic programming as these underpin the conceptual understanding needed to effectively utilize TFP's distribution functionalities and avoid such errors.  Careful review of error messages and tracing the shapes of tensors throughout your code will drastically improve debugging capabilities.
