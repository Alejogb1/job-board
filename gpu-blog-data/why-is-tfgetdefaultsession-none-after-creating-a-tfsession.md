A core misunderstanding often arises regarding TensorFlow's default session: creating a `tf.Session()` instance does not automatically set it as the default. The default session, accessed via `tf.get_default_session()`, is a separate entity implicitly managed by TensorFlow, typically within a `tf.Session` context manager. Directly instantiating a session using `tf.Session()` creates a session object, but does not associate it with the default execution environment unless explicitly declared. This separation allows multiple sessions to exist concurrently, each with independent graph execution environments, but demands a specific methodology for establishing a default session if required. I've encountered this nuance frequently while managing distributed TensorFlow deployments, particularly when migrating code between notebook-based prototyping and production pipelines.

The fundamental reason stems from TensorFlow's design principle of explicit control. The framework provides tools for creating and managing computational graphs and their corresponding execution contexts, sessions. When you create a session using `tf.Session()`, youâ€™re creating an *object* that represents that execution environment, but it is not automatically flagged as the session for default operations. Consequently, operations such as variable initializations and tensor evaluations will not execute against this session unless specifically specified using the session object's `run()` method, or the session is explicitly set as default via a context manager. Failing to manage default sessions explicitly often leads to `None` returns from `tf.get_default_session()`, particularly outside the scope of a context manager, where the default session has not been established. It is also essential to understand that `tf.InteractiveSession` creates a session and immediately sets it as default, differing from `tf.Session`. This distinction is crucial to correctly diagnose the absence of a default session in many situations.

Consider a scenario where I'm developing a custom layer. I might begin by creating a graph and its associated operations. I've noticed junior engineers sometimes mistake the instantiation of `tf.Session()` as implicitly making it the default, and then attempt to run tensors without context. The following example demonstrates the consequence of not managing the default session properly.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create some tensors and variables
a = tf.constant(2.0)
b = tf.Variable(3.0)

# Instantiate a session
sess = tf.Session()

#Attempt to evaluate a tensor, but default session is not set
try:
    print("Default session:", tf.get_default_session())
    print(a.eval())
except Exception as e:
    print("Exception:", e)

sess.close()
```

In this code block, while a `tf.Session` is created, `tf.get_default_session()` will print `None`. Attempting to directly evaluate `a.eval()` without explicitly running it in the `sess` using `sess.run()` will result in an exception. It highlights the core problem: the session instance `sess` exists but is not the default, meaning tensor evaluation can't occur directly without referencing the session explicitly. Note that  `b.eval()` is also not possible since variable initialization has not occurred.

To rectify this, you can explicitly use the session context manager, as shown in the next example. This approach makes the created session the default session, and ensures operations are executed under that session automatically.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create some tensors and variables
a = tf.constant(2.0)
b = tf.Variable(3.0)


# Use the session as a context manager, thus setting it as default
with tf.Session() as sess:
    print("Default session:", tf.get_default_session())
    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    print(a.eval())
    print(sess.run(b)) # This will run variable initialized value.
```
Here, `tf.get_default_session()` will now return the session object being managed within the `with` block. Inside this block `a.eval()` and `sess.run(b)` (after initialization), are executed within the context of the session defined. This ensures operations within the scope of the context manager are executed by that specific session, hence the values are printed successfully. It's crucial to manage your sessions this way, especially for larger scripts involving training and evaluation cycles. The implicit association to the default session using the context manager removes a lot of ambiguity and makes the code more readable and maintainable.

The final illustrative code focuses on explicit session management when not employing the context manager. Although not generally recommended, this showcases how to use `tf.get_default_session()` in such scenarios:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create some tensors and variables
a = tf.constant(2.0)
b = tf.Variable(3.0)


# Instantiate a session, and set as default explicitly
sess = tf.Session()
default_session = sess.as_default()
default_session.__enter__()
try:
  print("Default session:", tf.get_default_session())
  sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
  print(a.eval())
  print(b.eval())
finally:
  default_session.__exit__(None, None, None)
  sess.close()
```

In this example, although `tf.get_default_session()` is still initially `None`, after explicitly making `sess` the default via `sess.as_default()`, `tf.get_default_session()` will now return the created session. This, however, is a more verbose approach compared to the `with` context manager. The explicit enter and exit methods `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` manage setting and releasing the default session and need error handling which was done here via the `finally` clause, which underscores the simplicity of using the `with` context manager. In this final example, `a.eval()` and `b.eval()` are now within the default session and evaluate correctly and will run without exception. This approach is often more cumbersome for general usage than utilizing `tf.Session()` as a context manager.

Regarding further resources, several excellent sources can provide deeper understanding. The TensorFlow official documentation on sessions is invaluable, especially the tutorials that cover basic graph execution. Furthermore, exploring code examples on sites like GitHub, specifically projects that use different session management strategies, is highly beneficial. The TensorFlow Github repository itself is a great learning tool to see how different projects manage different session situations. Finally, examining books dedicated to deep learning with TensorFlow can provide a theoretical basis for understanding these practical considerations in greater depth. Specific chapters focusing on TensorFlow's computational graph and execution model will be particularly useful. Mastering session management is key to building and deploying reliable TensorFlow applications, avoiding common errors and promoting robust code.
