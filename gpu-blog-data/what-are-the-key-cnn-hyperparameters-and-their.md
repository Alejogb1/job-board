Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly sensitive to hyperparameter tuning.  My experience optimizing CNN architectures for image classification across diverse datasets, including medical imagery and satellite remote sensing data, underscores the crucial role these parameters play in model performance.  Improperly chosen hyperparameters can lead to suboptimal performance, including overfitting, underfitting, and slow convergence.  Therefore, a thorough understanding of their influence is paramount.

**1. Learning Rate:** This scalar value dictates the size of the weight updates during backpropagation.  A high learning rate can cause the optimization process to overshoot the optimal weights, resulting in oscillations and failure to converge.  Conversely, a low learning rate can lead to excessively slow convergence, requiring significantly more epochs to achieve satisfactory results.  In my work with a large-scale dataset of microscopic images, I found that a learning rate schedule, specifically cyclical learning rates, proved remarkably effective.  This dynamic adjustment of the learning rate allowed for faster convergence without the instability associated with a consistently high learning rate.  The optimal learning rate is often dataset-dependent and requires experimentation.  Techniques like learning rate range test can guide this process.

**2. Batch Size:** This parameter specifies the number of training samples processed before the model weights are updated.  Larger batch sizes can lead to smoother gradient estimates, potentially improving convergence speed. However, they also increase memory consumption and computational cost per iteration.  Smaller batch sizes introduce more noise into the gradient estimates, which can act as a form of regularization, preventing overfitting.  My experience with high-resolution satellite imagery demonstrated that a moderate batch size, balancing computational efficiency with regularization, was most beneficial.  Extremely large batch sizes yielded faster convergence initially but often resulted in poorer generalization performance on unseen data. Conversely, excessively small batch sizes led to unstable training dynamics.

**3. Number of Epochs:** This determines the number of times the entire training dataset is passed through the network.  Too few epochs result in underfitting, as the model doesn't learn the underlying patterns sufficiently.  Too many epochs can lead to overfitting, where the model memorizes the training data and performs poorly on unseen data.  Early stopping, a common regularization technique, is crucial here.  In my research involving medical image segmentation, I employed early stopping based on a validation set performance metric, preventing overfitting and saving significant computational resources.  The optimal number of epochs is intrinsically tied to the complexity of the dataset and model architecture, thus demanding careful monitoring and validation.

**4. Number of Filters (Convolutional Layers):** This parameter dictates the number of feature maps extracted at each convolutional layer.  Increasing the number of filters allows the network to learn more complex features, potentially improving accuracy.  However, it also significantly increases the model's complexity and computational cost.  A careful balance is needed; excessive filters can lead to overfitting and computational burden, while insufficient filters can limit the model's representational capacity.  During my work with hyperspectral image classification, I found that a gradual increase in the number of filters across successive layers proved effective, starting with a relatively small number in the initial layers and progressively increasing towards deeper layers. This mimicked the hierarchical feature learning process, improving performance compared to using a constant number of filters throughout the network.

**5. Filter Size (Convolutional Layers):**  This defines the spatial extent of each convolutional filter. Smaller filters capture local features, while larger filters capture more global contextual information.  Smaller filters often require deeper networks to capture complex patterns, increasing computational costs. Conversely, very large filters can be computationally expensive and might not significantly improve performance. The choice depends on the nature of the data and the desired level of detail in feature extraction.  In one project involving handwritten digit recognition,  I compared various filter sizes and found that 3x3 filters provided an excellent trade-off between computational efficiency and representational power.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating Learning Rate Scheduling with Keras:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# ... define your model ...

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001) #initial learning rate

lr_schedule = tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler(lambda epoch: 0.001 * 0.95 ** epoch) #Exponential decay

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100, callbacks=[lr_schedule], validation_data=(x_val, y_val))
```

This example demonstrates using a learning rate scheduler in Keras for exponential decay. The learning rate starts at 0.001 and decreases by 5% each epoch.


**Example 2: Impact of Batch Size on Training Time and Accuracy:**

```python
import time
import tensorflow as tf

# ... define your model ...

batch_sizes = [32, 64, 128, 256]
results = {}

for batch_size in batch_sizes:
    start_time = time.time()
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val), verbose=0)
    end_time = time.time()
    results[batch_size] = {'accuracy': history.history['val_accuracy'][-1], 'time': end_time - start_time}

print(results)
```

This code snippet explores the effects of different batch sizes on both training time and validation accuracy. It iterates through a list of batch sizes, training the model for each and recording both the final validation accuracy and training time.


**Example 3: Varying the Number of Filters:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D

#... other layers of the model...

#Experimenting with the number of filters
model_1 = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)), #32 Filters
    #... rest of the model...
])

model_2 = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)), #64 Filters
    #... rest of the model...
])

model_3 = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1)), #128 Filters
    #... rest of the model...
])


#... compile and train each model separately ...
```

This example demonstrates how to modify the number of filters in a convolutional layer. Three models are created, each with a different number of filters (32, 64, and 128), allowing for a comparison of their performance.  The subsequent layers and compilation would need to be added for complete functionality.
