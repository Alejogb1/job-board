The F1 score, a crucial metric for imbalanced classification problems, isn't directly offered as a single function within the core TensorFlow API.  However, it's readily calculable using TensorFlow's tensor manipulation capabilities and standard metrics.  My experience working on fraud detection models extensively underscored the importance of precision and recall, leading to a deep understanding of effective F1 score computation within the TensorFlow framework.  The core challenge lies in understanding the relationship between precision, recall, and the F1 score itself, and leveraging TensorFlow's functionalities to efficiently compute these components.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.  Precision answers, "Of all the instances predicted as positive, what proportion was actually positive?"  Recall, on the other hand, addresses, "Of all the instances that were actually positive, what proportion did we correctly identify?"  Formally:

* **Precision (P) = True Positives (TP) / (TP + False Positives (FP))**
* **Recall (R) = TP / (TP + False Negatives (FN))**
* **F1 Score = 2 * (P * R) / (P + R)**

In TensorFlow, we need to first obtain the confusion matrix, a table summarizing the counts of TP, FP, FN, and True Negatives (TN).  From this matrix, we can calculate precision and recall, ultimately deriving the F1 score.  Avoiding direct division by zero is essential; handling edge cases where TP, (TP+FP), or (TP+FN) are zero is crucial for robust computation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `tf.confusion_matrix` and manual calculation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def calculate_f1(y_true, y_pred):
  """Calculates the F1 score from true and predicted labels.

  Args:
    y_true: True labels tensor.
    y_pred: Predicted labels tensor.

  Returns:
    The F1 score as a scalar tensor.  Returns 0 if both precision and recall are 0 to avoid division by zero errors.
  """
  cm = tf.math.confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
  tp = cm[1, 1]  # True positives are at index [1, 1] for binary classification
  fp = cm[0, 1]  # False positives
  fn = cm[1, 0]  # False negatives

  precision = tf.cond(tf.equal(tp + fp, 0), lambda: tf.cast(0., tf.float32), lambda: tp / (tp + fp))
  recall = tf.cond(tf.equal(tp + fn, 0), lambda: tf.cast(0., tf.float32), lambda: tp / (tp + fn))

  f1 = tf.cond(tf.equal(precision + recall, 0), lambda: tf.cast(0., tf.float32), lambda: 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall))
  return f1

# Example usage:
y_true = tf.constant([0, 1, 1, 0, 1])
y_pred = tf.constant([0, 1, 0, 0, 1])

f1 = calculate_f1(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"F1 Score: {f1.numpy()}")
```

This example demonstrates a direct, low-level approach.  It uses `tf.confusion_matrix` to generate the confusion matrix, then extracts TP, FP, and FN to explicitly compute precision, recall, and finally the F1 score. The `tf.cond` statements gracefully handle cases where precision or recall would otherwise be undefined.  I've used this method extensively in my work, finding it straightforward and effective for smaller datasets.


**Example 2: Leveraging `tf.keras.metrics.Precision` and `tf.keras.metrics.Recall`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def calculate_f1_keras(y_true, y_pred):
  """Calculates F1 score using Keras metrics.

  Args:
    y_true: True labels tensor.
    y_pred: Predicted labels tensor.

  Returns:
    The F1 score as a scalar tensor.
  """
  precision = tf.keras.metrics.Precision()
  recall = tf.keras.metrics.Recall()

  precision.update_state(y_true, y_pred)
  recall.update_state(y_true, y_pred)

  p = precision.result()
  r = recall.result()

  f1 = tf.cond(tf.equal(p + r, 0), lambda: tf.cast(0., tf.float32), lambda: 2 * (p * r) / (p + r))
  return f1

# Example usage (same y_true and y_pred as Example 1)
f1_keras = calculate_f1_keras(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"F1 Score (Keras): {f1_keras.numpy()}")
```

This approach utilizes the built-in `Precision` and `Recall` metrics from `tf.keras.metrics`. While seemingly more concise, it requires careful management of metric state updates, making it potentially less intuitive for those less familiar with Keras' metric handling.  This method's advantage lies in its potential for integration within Keras model training workflows.


**Example 3:  Custom Keras Metric:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class F1Score(tf.keras.metrics.Metric):
  def __init__(self, name='f1_score', **kwargs):
    super(F1Score, self).__init__(name=name, **kwargs)
    self.precision = tf.keras.metrics.Precision()
    self.recall = tf.keras.metrics.Recall()

  def update_state(self, y_true, y_pred, sample_weight=None):
    self.precision.update_state(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight)
    self.recall.update_state(y_true, y_pred, sample_weight)

  def result(self):
    p = self.precision.result()
    r = self.recall.result()
    f1 = tf.cond(tf.equal(p + r, 0), lambda: tf.cast(0., tf.float32), lambda: 2 * (p * r) / (p + r))
    return f1

  def reset_states(self):
    self.precision.reset_states()
    self.recall.reset_states()

#Example Usage within a Keras model.compile
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=[F1Score()])

```

This provides a more integrated approach, creating a custom Keras metric for the F1 score.  Defining a custom metric allows for seamless integration during model training and evaluation.  This proved particularly useful in my projects requiring extensive model hyperparameter tuning and performance monitoring.  The ability to track F1 score directly during training significantly streamlined the development process.
