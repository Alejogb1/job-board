The observed freezing behavior after `await Task.Run()` completes stems from a misunderstanding of the `Task.Run()` method's role within the asynchronous programming model and its interaction with the UI thread (or, more broadly, the synchronization context).  My experience debugging similar issues in high-throughput server applications and WPF-based clients has highlighted this subtle yet common pitfall.  The critical fact is that `Task.Run()` offloads work to the thread pool, but it doesn't inherently manage the return to the original context. Consequently, if the awaiting task attempts to manipulate UI elements or other context-bound resources after completion, it risks deadlocks or freezes.

**1. Explanation:**

`Task.Run()` schedules a delegate to execute asynchronously on a thread pool thread.  This is ideal for CPU-bound operations, preventing them from blocking the UI thread. However, the completion of this task doesn't automatically marshal the continuation back to the original context (typically the UI thread for UI applications).  The awaiting code, therefore, resumes execution on the thread pool thread. If this code interacts with UI elements, a cross-thread exception will occur in some environments (WPF, WinForms), resulting in a freeze or crash.  Even without explicit UI interaction, the asynchronous operation might be holding onto resources that require context-switching for release.  This can manifest as a seemingly inexplicable freeze, especially in applications with complex synchronization or resource management.

In essence, the problem isn't that `await Task.Run()` is freezing *after* completion.  Instead, it's that the code *following* the `await` is executing on an inappropriate thread.  The freeze is a consequence of this incorrect thread context, often masked by the asynchronous nature of the operation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Problematic Code (WPF)**

```csharp
private async void MyButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    await Task.Run(() => PerformLongOperation());
    MyTextBlock.Text = "Operation Complete!"; // Potential cross-thread exception
}

private void PerformLongOperation()
{
    // Perform a long-running CPU-bound operation.
    Thread.Sleep(5000);
}
```

This code will likely freeze the application.  `PerformLongOperation()` executes on a thread pool thread.  The `await` completes, but the subsequent line updating `MyTextBlock.Text` attempts to access a UI element from a non-UI thread, leading to a cross-thread exception.  WPF's dispatcher will either throw an exception or silently fail. The result appears as a frozen UI.

**Example 2: Correct Code (WPF using Dispatcher)**

```csharp
private async void MyButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    await Task.Run(() => PerformLongOperation());
    this.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(() => MyTextBlock.Text = "Operation Complete!");
}

private void PerformLongOperation()
{
    // Perform a long-running CPU-bound operation.
    Thread.Sleep(5000);
}
```

This improved version explicitly uses `Dispatcher.BeginInvoke()`.  This marshals the update of `MyTextBlock.Text` back to the UI thread, resolving the cross-thread exception and preventing the freeze.  This technique is specific to WPF and similar UI frameworks.

**Example 3:  Correct Code (Generic Context Using ConfigureAwait)**

```csharp
private async Task MyMethodAsync()
{
    var result = await Task.Run(() => PerformLongOperation()).ConfigureAwait(false);
    // Process the result; no UI interaction assumed here.
    Console.WriteLine($"Operation complete. Result: {result}");
}

private int PerformLongOperation()
{
    // Perform a long-running CPU-bound operation.
    Thread.Sleep(5000);
    return 123;
}
```

This example demonstrates the use of `ConfigureAwait(false)`. This crucial parameter prevents the continuation from automatically resuming on the original synchronization context.  The code executes on the thread pool thread after the `await`, which is acceptable if no UI interaction or context-bound operations are needed.  This approach is generally preferred for non-UI-related asynchronous operations, improving efficiency by avoiding unnecessary context switching.  This might not resolve a freeze directly, but it prevents a potential source of deadlocks or unexpected context switches if the following code inadvertently tries to access resources only available in its original context.  Note that proper error handling and resource management are still crucial.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of asynchronous programming in C#, I recommend consulting the official Microsoft documentation on `async` and `await`, focusing specifically on the nuances of `Task.Run()` and `ConfigureAwait()`.  Additionally, thorough study of the threading model within the specific framework (WPF, WinForms, ASP.NET, etc.) is essential to manage thread context effectively.  A solid understanding of synchronization contexts and their implications in asynchronous code is crucial for avoiding such issues.  Furthermore, exploring advanced concepts like `TaskCompletionSource` for more fine-grained control over task management will provide even more advanced solutions for specific scenarios.  Finally, mastering debugging tools and techniques for tracking thread execution will allow for a faster identification of the root cause of these seemingly cryptic freezes.
