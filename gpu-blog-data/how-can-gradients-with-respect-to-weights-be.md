The core challenge in monitoring weight gradients during training in TensorFlow Keras lies in effectively accessing and logging these intermediate tensors without significantly impacting performance.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks has shown that inefficient gradient logging can easily cripple training speed, especially when dealing with complex architectures or substantial datasets. Therefore, a carefully considered approach leveraging Keras's custom callback functionality is crucial.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow Keras doesn't natively provide a mechanism to directly log gradients to TensorBoard.  Gradients are internal computational elements; their primary purpose is to update model weights, not to be directly observed during standard training.  However, we can leverage the `tf.GradientTape` API within a custom callback to capture these gradients, convert them into suitable TensorBoard summaries, and then write them to logs during each training epoch.  This requires understanding the Keras training loop and how callbacks operate within that context.  Specifically, we exploit the `on_train_batch_end` or `on_epoch_end` method of the custom callback to access the model's weights and calculate gradients using the tape. These gradients are then summarized using TensorBoard's `tf.summary` operations before being written to the log directory.  Careful consideration needs to be given to the frequency of logging to balance monitoring granularity with performance overhead.  Excessive logging can severely hamper training progress.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Logging Gradients at the End of Each Epoch:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback

class GradientLogger(Callback):
    def __init__(self, log_dir):
        super(GradientLogger, self).__init__()
        self.log_dir = log_dir
        self.summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            # Dummy input for gradient calculation; replace with your actual input data
            inputs = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 1)) 
            predictions = self.model(inputs)
            loss = tf.reduce_mean(predictions) #Example loss; Adapt to your actual loss function.

        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, self.model.trainable_variables)
        with self.summary_writer.as_default():
            for i, grad in enumerate(gradients):
                tf.summary.histogram(f"gradients/layer_{i}", grad, step=epoch)

# Model definition (replace with your actual model)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')

# Training with gradient logging
log_dir = "logs/gradient_logs"
gradient_logger = GradientLogger(log_dir)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[gradient_logger]) #Replace with your data

```

This example logs gradient histograms for each trainable layer at the end of every epoch.  The use of `tf.random.normal` provides a dummy input; replace this with your actual training data. The loss function is simplified for demonstration;  adapt it to your specific needs.  Critically, the gradient calculation happens within the `on_epoch_end` callback, leveraging `tf.GradientTape` to compute gradients with respect to the model's trainable variables. The histograms are written using `tf.summary.histogram`.

**Example 2:  Logging Gradients for Specific Layers:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback

class SpecificLayerGradientLogger(Callback):
    def __init__(self, log_dir, layer_indices):
        super(SpecificLayerGradientLogger, self).__init__()
        self.log_dir = log_dir
        self.layer_indices = layer_indices #List of indices of layers to log
        self.summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)


    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            inputs = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 1))
            predictions = self.model(inputs)
            loss = tf.reduce_mean(predictions)


        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [self.model.layers[i].trainable_variables for i in self.layer_indices])
        with self.summary_writer.as_default():
            for i, grad_list in enumerate(gradients):
                for j, grad in enumerate(grad_list):
                    tf.summary.histogram(f"gradients/layer_{self.layer_indices[i]}_part_{j}", grad, step=epoch)


# Model and training (similar to Example 1, but with layer selection)
model =  #...Your model...
log_dir = "logs/specific_layer_gradients"
specific_logger = SpecificLayerGradientLogger(log_dir, [1,2]) #Log gradients for layers 1 and 2 (index 0 is the first layer)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[specific_logger])

```

This example demonstrates logging gradients only for specified layers. This is beneficial for focusing analysis on critical parts of the network, thereby reducing the volume of logged data and improving performance. The `layer_indices` parameter allows you to specify which layers' gradients should be logged.


**Example 3: Logging Gradients at the End of Each Batch:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import Callback

class BatchGradientLogger(Callback):
    def __init__(self, log_dir, batch_interval): # Log every N batches
        super(BatchGradientLogger, self).__init__()
        self.log_dir = log_dir
        self.batch_interval = batch_interval
        self.batch_count = 0
        self.summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)


    def on_train_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        self.batch_count +=1
        if self.batch_count % self.batch_interval == 0:
            with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
                inputs = self.model.inputs
                predictions = self.model(inputs)
                loss = tf.reduce_mean(predictions) # Adapt to your actual loss function


            gradients = tape.gradient(loss, self.model.trainable_variables)
            with self.summary_writer.as_default():
                for i, grad in enumerate(gradients):
                    tf.summary.histogram(f"gradients/layer_{i}", grad, step=self.batch_count)

# Model and training (similar to Example 1, but logging per batch)
model = #...Your model...
log_dir = "logs/batch_gradients"
batch_logger = BatchGradientLogger(log_dir, 10) #Log every 10 batches
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[batch_logger])

```

This example logs gradients at the end of every Nth batch, enabling finer-grained observation of gradient behavior during training.  The `batch_interval` parameter controls the logging frequency.  This is useful for detecting transient issues or exploring the dynamics of gradient updates over smaller time windows, at the cost of increased computational overhead.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   TensorFlow documentation on `tf.GradientTape` and `tf.summary`.
*   TensorBoard documentation on visualizing histograms.
*   Keras documentation on custom callbacks.
*   A comprehensive guide on debugging neural networks, focusing on gradient analysis techniques.


Remember to adapt these examples to your specific model architecture and loss function.  Experiment with different logging frequencies to find the optimal balance between monitoring detail and training efficiency.  Carefully analyze the logged histograms to identify potential issues such as exploding or vanishing gradients.  Always prioritize a robust experimental setup to ensure reliable results.
