The discrepancy in output between Keras' Functional and Sequential APIs when using LSTM layers stems fundamentally from the differing ways they handle statefulness and layer instantiation.  While seemingly interchangeable for simple architectures, the subtle differences in internal mechanisms lead to variations, particularly concerning the handling of initial states and weight sharing across multiple inputs within a model.  My experience troubleshooting recurrent neural network discrepancies across various Keras versions underscores this distinction.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Keras Sequential API inherently constructs a linear stack of layers.  Each layer receives its input from the preceding layer, and the output is passed sequentially.  Statefulness in LSTMs within this architecture is managed implicitly.  A single LSTM instance processes the entire sequence. The weights are shared throughout the input sequence, and the hidden state is carried forward from one timestep to the next within that single LSTM instance.

The Functional API, conversely, offers greater flexibility by allowing arbitrary connections between layers.  This flexibility means that when you define multiple LSTM layers within a Functional model, you are essentially creating multiple, independent LSTM instances, unless explicitly specified otherwise.  Each LSTM layer receives its input directly, and importantly, each instance maintains its *own* set of weights and internal state.  Even if the input shape is identical, these separate instances operate independently, leading to diverging internal states and thus, different output predictions.  This distinction is often overlooked, particularly when replicating Sequential models using the Functional API.  The apparent simplicity of a mirrored architecture can mask the critical differences in how Keras manages these independent instances.

Furthermore, the Functional API's ability to create complex graphs introduces the potential for unintended weight sharing. If one unintentionally reuses the same LSTM layer instance in multiple branches of the graph, this will yield different results compared to the Sequential API where each layer is uniquely instantiated. This is due to the accumulation of gradients from distinct branches which would not occur with separate LSTM instances.

In essence, the problem isn't about an inherent flaw in either API, but rather a misunderstanding of how they handle layer instantiation and statefulness. The Sequential API implicitly manages these factors for simple linear models, whereas the Functional API requires explicit control, demanding a precise understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Equivalent Sequential and Functional Models (Identical Output)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Sequential API
model_seq = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True, stateful=True, batch_input_shape=(1, 10, 1)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Functional API (equivalent)
lstm_layer = keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True, stateful=True, input_shape=(10,1))
dense_layer = keras.layers.Dense(1)
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(10,1))
lstm_output = lstm_layer(input_tensor)
output_tensor = dense_layer(lstm_output)
model_func = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)

#Ensure identical weights
model_func.set_weights(model_seq.get_weights())

# Test with same input data. Outputs should be identical.
input_data = tf.random.normal((1, 10, 1))
print("Sequential Output:", model_seq.predict(input_data))
print("Functional Output:", model_func.predict(input_data))
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates how to create functionally equivalent models. By explicitly setting `stateful=True` and using the same `input_shape` and ensuring weights are identical, we force both models to maintain a single LSTM instance and thereby produces identical results.  Critically, the `batch_input_shape` in the Sequential API mirrors the `input_shape` and `batch_size` in the Functional API for this direct comparison to hold.

**Example 2:  Different Results due to Separate LSTM Instances**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Functional API with separate LSTM instances
lstm_layer1 = keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=False) #No statefulness here
lstm_layer2 = keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=False)
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(10, 1))
lstm_output1 = lstm_layer1(input_tensor)
lstm_output2 = lstm_layer2(input_tensor) # separate instance
merged = keras.layers.concatenate([lstm_output1, lstm_output2])
output_tensor = keras.layers.Dense(1)(merged)
model_func_sep = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)

# Test with the same input data
input_data = tf.random.normal((1, 10, 1))
print("Functional Model (separate LSTMs) Output:", model_func_sep.predict(input_data))
```

**Commentary:**  In this example, two separate LSTM instances (`lstm_layer1` and `lstm_layer2`) process the input independently.  They have distinct weights and internal states, leading to different outputs when compared to the previous examples. This demonstrates the core difference:  the Functional API's freedom to instantiate multiple layers independently affects the model's behavior significantly.


**Example 3:  Incorrect Weight Sharing in Functional API**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Functional API with unintentional weight sharing
lstm_layer = keras.layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=False)
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(10, 1))
lstm_output1 = lstm_layer(input_tensor)  # Use the same instance twice
lstm_output2 = lstm_layer(input_tensor)  # Incorrect weight sharing
merged = keras.layers.concatenate([lstm_output1, lstm_output2])
output_tensor = keras.layers.Dense(1)(merged)
model_func_shared = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)

# Test with the same input data
input_data = tf.random.normal((1, 10, 1))
print("Functional Model (weight sharing) Output:", model_func_shared.predict(input_data))
```

**Commentary:** This illustrates the danger of reusing the same LSTM layer instance within the Functional API.  Both `lstm_output1` and `lstm_output2` use the same `lstm_layer`, resulting in unexpected behavior. This unintended weight sharing drastically alters the dynamics, deviating significantly from the Sequential model and even the previous Functional example with distinct LSTM instances.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation, specifically the sections on the Functional API and the detailed explanations of LSTM layer parameters.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, focusing on recurrent networks and practical implementation details.  Finally, peer-reviewed research papers that address advanced architectures employing LSTMs within the Keras framework.  These resources offer the necessary theoretical grounding and practical guidance to avoid the pitfalls highlighted in the examples above.
