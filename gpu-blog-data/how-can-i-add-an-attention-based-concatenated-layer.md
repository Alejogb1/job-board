The core challenge in adding an attention-based concatenated layer in TensorFlow 2.0 lies in efficiently managing the tensor manipulations required to compute attention weights and subsequently concatenate the attended features with the original input.  My experience building sequence-to-sequence models for natural language processing highlighted the importance of carefully handling memory allocation and computational efficiency during this process.  Inefficient implementations can significantly impact training time and overall performance.  This response will detail a robust approach, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

**1.  A Clear Explanation of the Implementation**

The process involves three key steps: calculating attention weights, applying those weights to generate a context vector, and finally concatenating this context vector with the original input.  We'll utilize a scaled dot-product attention mechanism for simplicity and efficiency.  This approach avoids the complexities of more sophisticated attention methods while providing good performance for many tasks.

First, we compute the attention weights.  Given a query tensor (Q), a key tensor (K), and a value tensor (V), all derived from the input, the scaled dot-product attention is defined as:

`Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK<sup>T</sup> / âˆšd<sub>k</sub>)V`

Where `d<sub>k</sub>` is the dimension of the key vectors (preventing vanishing/exploding gradients).  The softmax function normalizes the dot products to produce probability distributions over the keys.  This distribution represents the attention weights.

Next, we use these weights to compute the context vector.  This is achieved by multiplying the attention weights with the value tensor and summing the results. This context vector encapsulates the weighted representation of the input sequence relevant to the current query.

Finally, this context vector is concatenated with the original input tensor, effectively augmenting the input with attention-derived information.  The resulting concatenated tensor is then typically fed into subsequent layers of the neural network.  The choice of the concatenation axis is crucial and should align with the expected input shape of the following layer.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate different aspects of the implementation using TensorFlow 2.0.  I've opted for brevity and clarity, focusing on the core attention mechanism and concatenation.  Error handling and hyperparameter tuning are omitted for conciseness.

**Example 1:  Simple Attention-Based Concatenation Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class AttentionConcatLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, d_k):
        super(AttentionConcatLayer, self).__init__()
        self.d_k = d_k

    def call(self, inputs):
        Q = inputs  # Assuming inputs are already in QKV format or transformed appropriately
        K = inputs
        V = inputs

        attention_scores = tf.matmul(Q, K, transpose_b=True) / tf.sqrt(tf.cast(self.d_k, tf.float32))
        attention_weights = tf.nn.softmax(attention_scores)
        context_vector = tf.matmul(attention_weights, V)
        output = tf.concat([inputs, context_vector], axis=-1) #Concatenate along the last axis
        return output

#Example usage
layer = AttentionConcatLayer(d_k=64)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((32, 10, 64)) #Batch size 32, sequence length 10, embedding dimension 64
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape) #Output shape will be (32, 10, 128)
```

This example demonstrates a basic attention-based concatenation layer.  The assumption here is that the input tensor is already prepared in a format suitable for Q, K, and V. In a real-world scenario, this might involve linear transformations of the input.  The concatenation happens along the last axis (`axis=-1`), effectively doubling the feature dimension.

**Example 2: Handling Different Input Shapes**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MultiHeadAttentionConcat(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, num_heads, d_model, d_k):
        super(MultiHeadAttentionConcat, self).__init__()
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.d_k = d_k
        self.W_q = tf.keras.layers.Dense(d_model)
        self.W_k = tf.keras.layers.Dense(d_model)
        self.W_v = tf.keras.layers.Dense(d_model)
        self.W_o = tf.keras.layers.Dense(d_model)

    def call(self, inputs):
        Q = self.W_q(inputs)
        K = self.W_k(inputs)
        V = self.W_v(inputs)

        #Split into heads
        Q = tf.reshape(Q, (tf.shape(Q)[0], tf.shape(Q)[1], self.num_heads, self.d_k))
        K = tf.reshape(K, (tf.shape(K)[0], tf.shape(K)[1], self.num_heads, self.d_k))
        V = tf.reshape(V, (tf.shape(V)[0], tf.shape(V)[1], self.num_heads, self.d_k))

        #Transpose for efficient calculation
        Q = tf.transpose(Q, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])
        K = tf.transpose(K, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])
        V = tf.transpose(V, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])

        attention_scores = tf.matmul(Q, K, transpose_b=True) / tf.sqrt(tf.cast(self.d_k, tf.float32))
        attention_weights = tf.nn.softmax(attention_scores)
        context_vector = tf.matmul(attention_weights, V)
        context_vector = tf.transpose(context_vector, perm=[0, 2, 1, 3])
        context_vector = tf.reshape(context_vector, (tf.shape(context_vector)[0], tf.shape(context_vector)[1], self.d_model))
        output = tf.concat([inputs, self.W_o(context_vector)], axis=-1)
        return output

#Example usage:
layer = MultiHeadAttentionConcat(num_heads=8, d_model=64, d_k=8)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((32, 10, 64))
output_tensor = layer(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape) #Output shape will be (32, 10, 128)
```

This example incorporates multi-head attention, allowing the model to attend to different aspects of the input simultaneously.  It demonstrates handling of reshaping and transposing operations required for efficient multi-head attention calculations. The output is then linearly transformed before concatenation.

**Example 3:  Integrating with a Keras Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (AttentionConcatLayer definition from Example 1) ...

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(10, 64)), #Input shape
    AttentionConcatLayer(d_k=64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10) #Output layer for a classification task, for example
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.summary()
```

This example shows how to seamlessly integrate the custom `AttentionConcatLayer` into a Keras sequential model.  This allows for easy training and evaluation using Keras's functionalities.  Note that the specific output layer and loss function would depend on the intended application.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of attention mechanisms, I recommend consulting the original "Attention is All You Need" paper.  The TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections covering custom layers and attention mechanisms,  provides invaluable information.  Finally, a comprehensive textbook on deep learning would offer a broader theoretical foundation for understanding these concepts.  Familiarization with linear algebra is essential for grasping the mathematical underpinnings of the attention mechanism.
