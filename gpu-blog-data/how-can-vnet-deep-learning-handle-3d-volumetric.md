A critical challenge in volumetric image segmentation, particularly in medical imaging, is the variability in input size of 3D data. Traditional 2D convolutional networks struggle with true 3D context, and fixed-size 3D networks become impractical when handling diverse acquisition protocols which produce differently sized volumes. VNet, originally proposed by Milletari et al., offers a robust architecture for tackling this, primarily through its use of contracting and expanding paths with learned upsampling, allowing the network to effectively process variable-size inputs during training and inference.

The core of VNet’s ability to handle varying input sizes lies in its fully convolutional nature. Unlike architectures containing fully connected layers that necessitate fixed input dimensions, VNet relies solely on convolutional, pooling, and deconvolutional (or upsampling) operations. Convolutional layers operate on local neighborhoods in the input, their size determined by the filter, not the global image size. This inherent translational invariance allows the network to process feature maps of arbitrary dimensions, limited only by the available memory. Downsampling operations, such as max pooling or strided convolutions, reduce feature map size but don't impose rigid input size constraints. Critically, the expanding path utilizes deconvolutional layers, or transposed convolutions, to learn how to upsample feature maps. These upsampling operations learn how to map lower-resolution feature maps to higher resolutions in a data-driven manner. This learned aspect differentiates it from simple interpolation and it is a critical detail. When a batch of varying size volumes are passed to the network, padding is used to standardize the dimensions within each batch. While the individual volumes may have different original dimensions, padding ensures that feature maps have consistent sizes across the batch as it goes through the network layers. The network therefore is trained on batches which have consistent dimensions. The padding doesn't influence the core learning process because convolutional operations operate locally regardless of padding.

Another technique in VNet to handle different input sizes is to reduce reliance on large filters. By stacking multiple smaller convolutional layers instead of using single large kernel layers, the network can operate efficiently on lower resolution features maps after downsampling, and upsample effectively in the decoder. This reduces computational complexity while providing an adequate receptive field and also allows the network to be trained on a wide variety of input sizes.

Here are three code examples demonstrating different aspects of adapting VNet to varying input sizes. Assume that the code utilizes the PyTorch framework, but the concepts are portable.

**Example 1: Basic VNet Architecture for Variable Input:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class VNetBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(VNetBlock, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv3d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv3d(out_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)

    def forward(self, x):
        residual = x
        out = self.relu(self.conv1(x))
        out = self.relu(self.conv2(out))
        return self.relu(out + residual)

class VNetDown(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(VNetDown, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv3d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=2, stride=2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.conv(x)

class VNetUp(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(VNetUp, self).__init__()
        self.deconv = nn.ConvTranspose3d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=2, stride=2)
        self.conv = nn.Conv3d(2 * out_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)

    def forward(self, x, skip):
        x = self.deconv(x)
        x = torch.cat((x, skip), dim=1)
        return self.relu(self.conv(x))

class VNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, num_filters=16):
        super(VNet, self).__init__()

        # Encoder
        self.enc1 = VNetBlock(in_channels, num_filters)
        self.enc2 = VNetDown(num_filters, num_filters*2)
        self.enc3 = VNetBlock(num_filters*2, num_filters*2)
        self.enc4 = VNetDown(num_filters*2, num_filters*4)
        self.enc5 = VNetBlock(num_filters*4, num_filters*4)
        self.enc6 = VNetDown(num_filters*4, num_filters*8)
        self.enc7 = VNetBlock(num_filters*8, num_filters*8)

        # Decoder
        self.dec1 = VNetUp(num_filters*8, num_filters*4)
        self.dec2 = VNetBlock(num_filters*4, num_filters*4)
        self.dec3 = VNetUp(num_filters*4, num_filters*2)
        self.dec4 = VNetBlock(num_filters*2, num_filters*2)
        self.dec5 = VNetUp(num_filters*2, num_filters)
        self.dec6 = VNetBlock(num_filters, num_filters)
        self.out_conv = nn.Conv3d(num_filters, out_channels, kernel_size=1)

    def forward(self, x):
        # Encoder
        enc1 = self.enc1(x)
        enc2 = self.enc2(enc1)
        enc3 = self.enc3(enc2)
        enc4 = self.enc4(enc3)
        enc5 = self.enc5(enc4)
        enc6 = self.enc6(enc5)
        enc7 = self.enc7(enc6)

        # Decoder
        dec1 = self.dec1(enc7, enc5)
        dec2 = self.dec2(dec1)
        dec3 = self.dec3(dec2, enc3)
        dec4 = self.dec4(dec3)
        dec5 = self.dec5(dec4, enc1)
        dec6 = self.dec6(dec5)
        out = self.out_conv(dec6)
        return out

# Example usage with dummy input tensors
input_shape = (1, 1, 64, 64, 64) # Batch of one with arbitrary spatial dimensions
input_tensor = torch.randn(input_shape) # Random input data
model = VNet(in_channels=1, out_channels=2) # Binary segmentation

output_tensor = model(input_tensor) # Process the input
print(f"Output shape: {output_tensor.shape}")

input_shape_2 = (1, 1, 128, 128, 128)  # Larger spatial input
input_tensor_2 = torch.randn(input_shape_2)
output_tensor_2 = model(input_tensor_2) # Process the larger input
print(f"Output shape: {output_tensor_2.shape}")
```

This example demonstrates a minimal implementation of a VNet with encoder and decoder blocks, capable of processing the dummy input tensors with two different dimensions. The downsampling and upsampling are implemented with convolutional layers with stride two and transpose convolution layers, respectively, maintaining a fully convolutional network structure. The code shows that the output tensors have the shape (1, 2, x, y, z), where x, y and z are the original spatial input dimension, showing the fully convolutional nature of the network.

**Example 2: Data loading with variable sizes and padding:**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import numpy as np

class VolumetricDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, volumes, labels):
        self.volumes = volumes
        self.labels = labels

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.volumes)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        volume = self.volumes[idx]
        label = self.labels[idx]
        return torch.from_numpy(volume).float().unsqueeze(0), torch.from_numpy(label).long()

def collate_fn(batch):
  volumes, labels = zip(*batch)
  max_dims = [max([vol.shape[i] for vol in volumes]) for i in range(2, 5)]  # find maximum size in each spatial dimensions

  padded_volumes = []
  padded_labels = []

  for vol, label in zip(volumes, labels):
      pad_dims = [(0, max_dims[i] - vol.shape[i+1]) for i in range(3)]  # calculate pad for each dimension (start end)
      pad_vol = torch.nn.functional.pad(vol, [x for dim in pad_dims for x in dim], mode='constant', value=0.0)
      pad_label = torch.nn.functional.pad(label, [x for dim in pad_dims for x in dim], mode='constant', value=0)
      padded_volumes.append(pad_vol.unsqueeze(0))
      padded_labels.append(pad_label.unsqueeze(0))


  padded_volumes = torch.cat(padded_volumes, dim=0)
  padded_labels = torch.cat(padded_labels, dim=0)

  return padded_volumes, padded_labels


# Example usage with varying sized data

volumes = [
    np.random.rand(32, 32, 32),
    np.random.rand(64, 64, 64),
    np.random.rand(48, 56, 72)
]
labels = [
    np.random.randint(0, 2, (32, 32, 32)),
    np.random.randint(0, 2, (64, 64, 64)),
    np.random.randint(0, 2, (48, 56, 72))
]
dataset = VolumetricDataset(volumes, labels)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True, collate_fn=collate_fn)

for batch_volumes, batch_labels in dataloader:
    print(f"Padded batch Volume shape: {batch_volumes.shape}")
    print(f"Padded batch Label shape: {batch_labels.shape}")
```

This code illustrates a custom dataset class `VolumetricDataset` for handling 3D data and a custom `collate_fn` to batch images with varying sizes. The `collate_fn` identifies the largest dimension across the batch of volumes and pads smaller volumes with zeros to ensure they have uniform dimensions. This padded batch is then passed to the network, with the VNet's fully convolutional architecture ensuring the network can deal with this padded data. Note that the VNet will still output the entire padded image, therefore, the mask may need to be trimmed after inference based on the original input dimensions.

**Example 3: Inference and masking out padding:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import numpy as np


def inference_and_mask(model, input_volume, original_shape):
    model.eval() # Set model to evaluation mode
    with torch.no_grad(): # Disable gradient computation
        padded_input = torch.from_numpy(input_volume).float().unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0)
        output_tensor = model(padded_input)
        predicted_mask = torch.argmax(output_tensor, dim=1).squeeze().cpu().numpy()

    # Remove the padded section
    trim_mask = predicted_mask[:original_shape[0], :original_shape[1], :original_shape[2]]
    return trim_mask

# Example Usage
input_volume = np.random.rand(32, 40, 50)  # Input shape
original_shape = input_volume.shape
model = VNet(in_channels=1, out_channels=2)  # Binary Segmentation
mask = inference_and_mask(model, input_volume, original_shape)
print(f"Mask shape after removing padding: {mask.shape}")


input_volume_2 = np.random.rand(64, 64, 64) # different size
original_shape_2 = input_volume_2.shape
mask_2 = inference_and_mask(model, input_volume_2, original_shape_2)
print(f"Mask shape after removing padding: {mask_2.shape}")
```

This snippet provides the `inference_and_mask` function. It first feeds the input to a trained model. It then takes the predicted mask output and trims away the padded sections to create the mask for the original input image. This addresses the post-processing step for handling different sized outputs for inference, ensuring the output mask respects the original input dimensions.

For deeper understanding, I recommend studying “3D U-Net: Learning dense volumetric segmentation from sparse annotation” by Çiçek et al. This paper goes into details about a closely related architecture. Further resources include the original VNet paper by Milletari et al., the official PyTorch documentation on convolutional and transposed convolutional layers, and research papers exploring various training strategies for handling large 3D data sets.

In summary, VNet’s architectural design, particularly its fully convolutional nature coupled with the use of upsampling layers, empowers the network to adeptly process 3D volumetric images of varying sizes. Through techniques such as padding, careful selection of filter sizes and appropriate post processing, VNet can be trained effectively and maintain the full 3D context within the data.
