TensorFlow's `tf.math.reduce_sum()` function, by design, propagates NaN values. This means if any input tensor element is NaN, the result of the sum will also be NaN. Over the course of several projects involving sensor data processing, I have frequently encountered the need to perform sums while gracefully handling these problematic Not-a-Number entries, as they are common in real-world datasets. Modifying `tf.math.reduce_sum()` directly is not possible as it's a core library function, but several workarounds effectively achieve the desired behavior of ignoring NaNs. I'll detail the approach and several examples.

The primary method relies on the combination of Boolean masking and conditional selection.  The fundamental principle is to first identify the NaN elements within the input tensor. Subsequently, a Boolean mask is created that represents the locations of the non-NaN values. This mask is then used to conditionally select only the valid numeric elements from the original tensor, which are then summed. A zero value is often used as the replacement for NaN elements before summation if preserving the input tensor shape is desired. This approach ensures that the NaN elements do not influence the sum, effectively "ignoring" them. It's important to note that the output will either have a reduced dimension (sum of valid elements only) or the same dimension as the input tensor (if NaN elements are replaced by zeros prior to summing), based on the requirements.

Let's consider three practical scenarios and their associated implementations.

**Scenario 1: Summing elements of a 1D Tensor, Ignoring NaNs, and Outputting a Scalar**

This scenario deals with the simplest case: a one-dimensional tensor containing numbers and NaNs where we want a single scalar representing the sum of valid numerical elements.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def sum_ignore_nan_1d(tensor):
  """Sums elements of a 1D Tensor, ignoring NaNs, returning a scalar."""
  is_not_nan = tf.math.logical_not(tf.math.is_nan(tensor))
  filtered_tensor = tf.boolean_mask(tensor, is_not_nan)
  return tf.math.reduce_sum(filtered_tensor)

# Example usage
input_tensor = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, np.nan, 4.0, np.nan, 6.0], dtype=tf.float32)
result = sum_ignore_nan_1d(input_tensor)

print("Original Tensor:", input_tensor.numpy())
print("Sum (Ignoring NaNs):", result.numpy()) # Output: 13.0
```
In this example, `tf.math.is_nan(tensor)` generates a Boolean tensor where `True` corresponds to the positions of NaN elements. `tf.math.logical_not()` then inverts this to create a mask where `True` now represents non-NaN locations. `tf.boolean_mask()` filters the original tensor to keep only these valid numerical elements, and finally, `tf.math.reduce_sum()` computes the sum. The output of `sum_ignore_nan_1d` is a single scalar value.

**Scenario 2: Summing Elements of a 2D Tensor Along a Specific Axis, Ignoring NaNs**

Here, we extend the logic to a two-dimensional tensor, summing elements along a specific axis, while still ignoring NaNs. The output is a 1D tensor.

```python
def sum_ignore_nan_2d_axis(tensor, axis):
  """Sums elements of a 2D Tensor along a specific axis, ignoring NaNs."""
  is_not_nan = tf.math.logical_not(tf.math.is_nan(tensor))
  masked_tensor = tf.where(is_not_nan, tensor, tf.zeros_like(tensor))
  return tf.math.reduce_sum(masked_tensor, axis=axis)

# Example usage
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, np.nan],
                            [4.0, np.nan, 6.0],
                            [np.nan, 8.0, 9.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
result_axis_0 = sum_ignore_nan_2d_axis(input_tensor, axis=0)
result_axis_1 = sum_ignore_nan_2d_axis(input_tensor, axis=1)

print("Original Tensor:\n", input_tensor.numpy())
print("Sum (Axis 0, Ignoring NaNs):\n", result_axis_0.numpy()) # Output: [ 5. 10. 15.]
print("Sum (Axis 1, Ignoring NaNs):\n", result_axis_1.numpy()) # Output: [ 3. 10. 17.]
```

In this case, `tf.where()` is used to conditionally replace NaN values with zeros. `tf.zeros_like(tensor)` generates a zero-filled tensor of the same shape as the input tensor. The `tf.where` function then substitutes the `tensor` elements where `is_not_nan` is `True`, while filling in `zeros_like(tensor)` at the `False` (NaN) locations, so that no further Boolean masking is required in order to preserve the shape of the input tensor. This allows `tf.math.reduce_sum()` to sum the masked tensor along a given axis (`axis=0` sums along columns, `axis=1` sums along rows). The output dimension is reduced based on the summation axis chosen.

**Scenario 3: Summing Elements of a 2D Tensor, Ignoring NaNs, While Preserving the Original Shape**

This scenario is slightly different: we want a tensor of the same shape as the input, where each original NaN location in the tensor is now replaced with a zero and all other elements are summed. This is akin to applying a sum with NaN replacement across the entire tensor but keeping the shape.

```python
def sum_ignore_nan_2d_preserve_shape(tensor):
  """Sums all elements of a tensor, ignoring NaNs, preserving the shape by replacing them with zeros."""
  is_not_nan = tf.math.logical_not(tf.math.is_nan(tensor))
  masked_tensor = tf.where(is_not_nan, tensor, tf.zeros_like(tensor))
  return tf.reduce_sum(masked_tensor) #reduce_sum will be applied across the entire tensor (all axes).

# Example usage
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, np.nan],
                            [4.0, np.nan, 6.0],
                            [np.nan, 8.0, 9.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
result = sum_ignore_nan_2d_preserve_shape(input_tensor)

print("Original Tensor:\n", input_tensor.numpy())
print("Sum (Ignoring NaNs, Preserving Shape):\n", result.numpy()) # Output: 30.0
```

This example builds on the previous, again utilizing `tf.where()` to replace NaNs with zeros before summing the entire tensor. The output, instead of being a lower dimensional tensor, represents a single scalar containing the sum of all elements with NaNs treated as zero. This is achieved using `tf.reduce_sum` without explicitly passing an `axis` parameter, which applies it across all axes. This approach effectively ignores NaNs and preserves the shape, by performing the summation over the entire tensor.

These three examples demonstrate the fundamental principles for handling NaN values during summation in TensorFlow. The key lies in using a combination of `tf.math.is_nan()`, `tf.math.logical_not()`, `tf.boolean_mask()`, and `tf.where()` to create appropriate masks and conditionally select non-NaN elements. The specific implementation will depend on whether a scalar result, a sum along a specified axis, or a zero-filled tensor of the original shape is desired.

For further exploration, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation which is comprehensive. Researching the detailed functionalities of `tf.math.is_nan`, `tf.boolean_mask`, and `tf.where` will provide an in-depth understanding of their application in more complex scenarios. Additionally, the TensorFlow tutorials often contain practical examples of data cleaning and manipulation, which might provide further relevant information on handling NaN values. Finally, reviewing papers on numerical stability and robust statistical methods can shed more light on the broader implications of handling missing or invalid data points in numerical computations. A deep dive into the NumPy library's handling of NaNs might also be beneficial for understanding similar approaches.
