The core input challenge with `tf.keras.layers.GRU` revolves around the inherent sequential nature of the layer and the expectations it holds for input data formatting.  Over my years working with recurrent neural networks in TensorFlow, I've consistently encountered issues stemming from a mismatch between the expected input shape and the actual shape of the data provided. This frequently manifests as shape-related errors during model compilation or training.  Addressing this necessitates a clear understanding of the GRU layer's input requirements and how to pre-process data accordingly.

**1. Clear Explanation of Input Issues:**

The `tf.keras.layers.GRU` layer, as a recurrent unit, processes sequential data.  This means it expects input in the form of a three-dimensional tensor. The dimensions represent:

* **Samples:** The number of independent data instances in your dataset (e.g., the number of sentences in a natural language processing task).
* **Timesteps:** The length of each sequence (e.g., the number of words in a sentence).
* **Features:** The dimensionality of the input features at each timestep (e.g., the dimensionality of word embeddings).

Therefore, the expected input shape is `(samples, timesteps, features)`.  Failure to provide data in this format will invariably lead to errors.  Common mistakes include:

* **Incorrect dimensionality:** Providing data with fewer or more than three dimensions.  A single sequence (e.g., a single sentence) must be reshaped to include a "samples" dimension of 1.
* **Inconsistent sequence lengths:**  If your sequences have varying lengths, you'll need to pad or truncate them to ensure uniformity.  Uneven lengths directly violate the expectation of a consistent `timesteps` dimension.
* **Feature mismatch:**  The `features` dimension should accurately reflect the dimensionality of your input representation.  For instance, if you're using word embeddings of size 100, this dimension must be 100.  Using the wrong dimensionality here will lead to incorrect calculations within the GRU unit.
* **Data type incompatibility:** The input data needs to be of a compatible numerical data type (e.g., `float32`).  Using incompatible types (like strings) will cause immediate errors.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Input Shaping for Fixed-Length Sequences:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample data: 10 sentences, each 5 words, with 100-dimensional embeddings
samples = 10
timesteps = 5
features = 100
input_data = tf.random.normal((samples, timesteps, features))

# Define the GRU layer
gru_layer = tf.keras.layers.GRU(units=64) # 64 hidden units

# Process the data
output = gru_layer(input_data)

# Output shape should be (10, 64) - 10 samples, each with a 64-dimensional hidden state
print(output.shape)
```

This example demonstrates the correct input shape for sequences of uniform length.  The `input_data` tensor explicitly follows the `(samples, timesteps, features)` format, ensuring compatibility with the GRU layer.


**Example 2: Handling Variable-Length Sequences with Padding:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data: variable-length sentences, with 100-dimensional embeddings
sentences = [
    np.random.rand(3, 100),
    np.random.rand(5, 100),
    np.random.rand(2, 100)
]

# Pad sequences to the maximum length
max_length = max(len(s) for s in sentences)
padded_sentences = [np.pad(s, ((0, max_length - len(s)), (0, 0)), 'constant') for s in sentences]

# Convert to a numpy array and reshape for GRU input
input_data = np.array(padded_sentences)
input_data = np.reshape(input_data,(input_data.shape[0],input_data.shape[1],input_data.shape[2]))

# Define the GRU layer
gru_layer = tf.keras.layers.GRU(units=64)

# Process the data
output = gru_layer(input_data)

# Output shape should be (3, 64) - 3 samples, each with a 64-dimensional hidden state
print(output.shape)

```

This example addresses the common issue of variable-length sequences.  The `np.pad` function ensures that all sentences are padded to the maximum length, maintaining the required consistent `timesteps` dimension.  Reshaping ensures it fits the (samples, timesteps, features) format.


**Example 3:  Error Handling and Debugging:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Incorrect input shape - missing a dimension
incorrect_input = tf.random.normal((10, 100)) #missing timesteps

try:
    gru_layer = tf.keras.layers.GRU(units=64)
    output = gru_layer(incorrect_input)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #catches and displays the error

# Incorrect data type
incorrect_dtype_input = np.array([['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']])

try:
    gru_layer = tf.keras.layers.GRU(units=64)
    output = gru_layer(incorrect_dtype_input)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #catches and displays the error

```

This example demonstrates how to anticipate and handle potential errors.  By incorporating `try-except` blocks, you can catch `ValueError` (shape-related) and `TypeError` (data type-related) exceptions, providing informative error messages for debugging.
