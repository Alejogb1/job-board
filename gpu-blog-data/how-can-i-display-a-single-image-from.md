Image processing often requires handling multiple images stored as an array, but visualizing just one of them can be surprisingly nuanced depending on the data structure and desired output. I've encountered this frequently during my work on medical image analysis, where multi-slice scans are initially loaded as a 3D array, but individual slices need to be reviewed for quality control or feature detection. The process involves indexing, potential reshaping, and then using a visualization library to render the selected image.

The fundamental challenge lies in correctly selecting the desired image from the multi-dimensional array and transforming it into a format that can be displayed. Assuming the array holds grayscale images represented as a numpy array (which is common in scientific and image processing contexts), the dimensions are usually structured as `[number_of_images, height, width]` or sometimes `[height, width, number_of_images]`. The specific arrangement depends on how the images were loaded or created. Indexing requires understanding this ordering. Once isolated, the selected 2D slice might need to be transposed or scaled depending on the visualization library used.

The choice of visualization library is also crucial. While libraries like `matplotlib` and `PIL` are versatile, they are not equivalent. Matplotlib primarily focuses on plotting and static image display, whereas PIL has more extensive image manipulation capabilities. Using `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow` offers a straightforward way to display a 2D array as an image, provided that the array’s data type and pixel values are appropriate.

The three examples below demonstrate techniques for isolating and displaying a single image from a 3D array using both grayscale and color images and also an additional example with scaling.

**Example 1: Displaying a Grayscale Image from a 3D Array**

Let us assume we have a grayscale image stack loaded as a NumPy array named `image_stack` with the shape `(10, 256, 256)`. This indicates ten grayscale images, each 256x256 pixels in size. To display the 5th image (index 4), we would use the following code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example image stack, replace with your actual data
image_stack = np.random.rand(10, 256, 256) 

image_index = 4
selected_image = image_stack[image_index, :, :]

plt.imshow(selected_image, cmap='gray')
plt.title(f'Grayscale Image at Index {image_index}')
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`import numpy as np` and `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`**: These import the necessary libraries. NumPy for handling the array and matplotlib for visualization.
2.  **`image_stack = np.random.rand(10, 256, 256)`**: This line creates a sample image array. You would replace this with your actual data loading process. It generates random floating-point values which are appropriate for displaying a grayscale image.
3.  **`image_index = 4`**: This variable determines which image from the stack to display (index starts from 0).
4.  **`selected_image = image_stack[image_index, :, :]`**:  Here, the indexing occurs. `image_stack[4, :, :]` selects the entire 256x256 2D slice at index 4.  The `:` notation indicates that we want to include all rows and columns, respectively.
5. **`plt.imshow(selected_image, cmap='gray')`**: `plt.imshow` displays the image. `cmap='gray'` specifies a grayscale colormap, which is needed because the image array consists of single-channel values.
6. **`plt.title(...)` and `plt.show()`**: Sets the title and renders the image on the screen.

This approach provides a straightforward method for viewing a single grayscale image. If your array had a different initial axis configuration, such as `(256, 256, 10)`, you would need to adjust your indexing accordingly (e.g. `selected_image = image_stack[:, :, image_index]`).

**Example 2: Displaying a Color Image (RGB) from a 4D Array**

Color images are commonly represented with three channels (red, green, and blue – RGB). A stack of RGB images might be stored as a 4D array: `[number_of_images, height, width, 3]`. Displaying one of these requires a similar approach:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example color image stack
image_stack_color = np.random.rand(10, 256, 256, 3)

image_index = 7
selected_image_color = image_stack_color[image_index, :, :, :]

plt.imshow(selected_image_color) # no cmap needed for color images
plt.title(f'Color Image at Index {image_index}')
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`image_stack_color = np.random.rand(10, 256, 256, 3)`**:  Here, `3` denotes the three RGB color channels.
2.  **`selected_image_color = image_stack_color[image_index, :, :, :]`**:  The indexing is adjusted to retrieve the appropriate slice while including all color channels.
3.  **`plt.imshow(selected_image_color)`**: No `cmap` is specified since we're dealing with a color image. `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow` will interpret this as an RGB image automatically.

Note that if the images were stored in the RGBA format, which includes the alpha channel for transparency, then a 4th channel would be expected in the array, and you would need to use  `image_stack_color[image_index, :, :, :3]` to obtain just the RGB channels if the plotting function doesn't support RGBA.

**Example 3: Displaying with Scaling (when pixel values are outside the [0,1] range)**

In some scenarios, image arrays might have values outside the [0,1] range, such as with certain scientific instruments. For instance, the pixel values might be integers or floating-point numbers with a large range. It may be necessary to scale or normalize the image data before visualization. Here, we present an example with a random array with values in the range of 0 to 1000.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example array with larger pixel values
image_stack_large_values = np.random.randint(0, 1000, size=(10, 256, 256))

image_index = 2
selected_image_large = image_stack_large_values[image_index, :, :]

# Simple scaling by dividing by the maximum value
scaled_image = selected_image_large / np.max(selected_image_large)

plt.imshow(scaled_image, cmap='gray')
plt.title(f'Scaled Image at Index {image_index}')
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`image_stack_large_values = np.random.randint(0, 1000, size=(10, 256, 256))`**: The image array consists of integers in the range of 0 to 1000.
2.  **`selected_image_large = image_stack_large_values[image_index, :, :]`**: The desired slice is extracted.
3.  **`scaled_image = selected_image_large / np.max(selected_image_large)`**:  This line divides each pixel by the maximum value in that slice. This scales the data such that all pixel values now are between 0 and 1 which is appropriate for display.

This example illustrates the important step of scaling the image data if your pixel values are not in the usual [0,1] or [0, 255] range. Different scaling and normalization techniques exist, and the optimal choice depends on the specifics of your data.

When choosing which functions to use, I would recommend reviewing the documentation for NumPy array indexing and the specifics of your chosen visualization library, such as `matplotlib`, `PIL` or `scikit-image`. There are numerous tutorials that explain array manipulations in Python that would help in handling different configurations of your image data, and how to work with image arrays in detail.
