The root cause of `torch.cuda.is_available()` returning `False` on an SSH server equipped with an NVIDIA GPU frequently stems from a mismatch between the CUDA runtime libraries installed on the server and those expected by the PyTorch installation. This isn't simply a matter of GPU presence;  it requires a correctly configured CUDA environment accessible to the Python process launched over SSH.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous high-performance computing clusters has consistently pointed to this core problem.

**1.  Explanation of the Underlying Issue**

The `torch.cuda.is_available()` function within PyTorch acts as a probe. It doesn't merely check for the physical existence of a GPU; it verifies the presence and accessibility of a correctly configured CUDA runtime environment.  This environment comprises several critical components:

* **CUDA Toolkit:**  This provides the fundamental libraries and tools for CUDA programming, including the driver API and necessary header files.  A mismatch between the CUDA Toolkit version used during PyTorch compilation and the one present on the server will lead to failure.  PyTorch needs to find and successfully load the CUDA libraries it was built against.

* **CUDA Drivers:** These drivers establish the communication bridge between the CPU, the operating system, and the NVIDIA GPU. The drivers need to be correctly installed and compatible with both the CUDA Toolkit and the hardware.  An outdated or incorrectly installed driver is a frequent culprit.

* **NVIDIA Libraries (cuDNN, etc.):**  PyTorch often relies on optimized libraries such as cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) for enhanced performance. These libraries must be installed and correctly linked within the PyTorch environment.  Missing or incompatible versions render `is_available()` false.

* **Permissions and Environment Variables:**  Even with correct installations, the SSH connection might lack the necessary permissions to access the CUDA libraries or the environment variables that PyTorch uses to locate them may not be correctly set.  This is particularly relevant when running processes under different user accounts on the server compared to where the software was initially installed.

When any of these components are missing, mismatched, or inaccessible, PyTorch fails to establish a connection to the CUDA hardware, leading to `False` from `torch.cuda.is_available()`.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different aspects of this problem and their resolution.  I've drawn these from my past work diagnosing similar scenarios in large-scale data processing pipelines.

**Example 1: Verifying CUDA Environment Variables**

```python
import os
import torch

print("CUDA_HOME:", os.environ.get('CUDA_HOME'))
print("LD_LIBRARY_PATH:", os.environ.get('LD_LIBRARY_PATH'))
print("PATH:", os.environ.get('PATH'))
print("PyTorch CUDA availability:", torch.cuda.is_available())
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print("CUDA Device Count:", torch.cuda.device_count())
    print("Current CUDA Device:", torch.cuda.current_device())
```

This code snippet checks for the presence of crucial environment variables (`CUDA_HOME`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `PATH`) that dictate where the CUDA runtime libraries are located.  A missing `CUDA_HOME` or an improperly configured `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` will often cause the issue.  Observe the output carefully; missing or incorrect paths directly indicate potential problems.  This was instrumental in many of my troubleshooting sessions.


**Example 2:  Checking CUDA Driver Version**

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

This simple bash command, executed on the SSH server, provides information about the NVIDIA driver version.  Compare this version with the CUDA Toolkit version used to build your PyTorch installation.  Discrepancies can result in failure.  In one project involving a multi-node cluster, I discovered that a driver update on only a subset of nodes caused this exact problem for certain jobs.  Careful version control and consistent updates across all nodes are crucial.


**Example 3:  Testing CUDA Capability Within a Container (Docker)**

```dockerfile
FROM pytorch/pytorch:1.13.1-cuda11.6-cudnn8-devel

# ... your application code and dependencies ...

CMD ["python", "your_script.py"]
```

Using Docker provides a contained and reproducible environment.  By specifying a PyTorch image with a specific CUDA version, you isolate potential conflicts from the host system.  This Dockerfile ensures that the container has a consistent and correct CUDA environment.  I leveraged this approach extensively in production deployments where consistency and reproducibility are paramount.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

I recommend consulting the official NVIDIA CUDA documentation for comprehensive installation and configuration instructions.  The PyTorch documentation provides detailed information on setting up PyTorch with CUDA.  Refer to your distribution's (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) package management system documentation for information on installing NVIDIA drivers and the CUDA toolkit.  Thorough understanding of environment variable management in your specific shell (bash, zsh, etc.) is also essential.  Pay close attention to user permissions and group affiliations in accessing the CUDA libraries and related files.  Finally, consult the logs for both your SSH connection and the Python process for potential error messages, which often provide clues to the specific issue.
