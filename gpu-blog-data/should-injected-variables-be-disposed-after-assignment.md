The necessity of disposing of injected variables after assignment hinges critically on the lifecycle management of the injected dependency and the variable's scope within the consuming component.  My experience working on large-scale, resource-intensive applications, particularly those involving complex database interactions and external API communication, has highlighted the subtle yet crucial impact of this seemingly straightforward aspect of dependency injection.  Improper handling leads to resource leaks, performance degradation, and, in extreme cases, application instability.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The decision of whether to explicitly dispose of an injected variable depends entirely on the nature of the dependency.  If the injected object manages its own lifecycle and resources (e.g., implements `IDisposable` in .NET, or has a similar mechanism in other frameworks), then explicit disposal is generally unnecessary and can even be detrimental.  The injected object's owning container or framework will usually handle the disposal process when the object is no longer required.  Forcing an explicit disposal can lead to exceptions or unexpected behavior if the object is already being managed elsewhere.  This is particularly true for objects managed by dependency injection containers that employ techniques like object pooling or scope-based lifetime management.

However, if the injected object represents an external resource (like a file handle, network connection, or database connection) that the container does not directly manage, or if the injected object holds references to such external resources, then explicit disposal becomes mandatory. Failing to do so will result in resource leaks, potentially affecting application performance and stability.  The resource might remain locked, unavailable to other parts of the application or even other processes.

In essence, the responsibility of disposal rests on the entity that truly *owns* the resource.  Dependency injection often involves handing off already-initialized objects; the injectee shouldn't assume responsibility for disposal unless explicitly tasked with it.  Understanding the object's lifecycle and resource management strategy is paramount.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Dependency Injection Container Handles Disposal (C#)**

```csharp
public interface IDataService : IDisposable
{
    string GetData();
}

public class DataService : IDataService
{
    private readonly SqlConnection _connection;

    public DataService(string connectionString)
    {
        _connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString);
        _connection.Open();
    }

    public string GetData()
    {
        // ... data retrieval logic using _connection ...
        return "Data Retrieved";
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        _connection.Close();
        _connection.Dispose();
    }
}

public class MyComponent
{
    private readonly IDataService _dataService;

    public MyComponent(IDataService dataService)
    {
        _dataService = dataService;
    }

    public void DoWork()
    {
        string data = _dataService.GetData();
        // No need to dispose _dataService here; the DI container will handle it.
        Console.WriteLine(data);
    }
}
```
In this example, `IDataService` and `DataService` manage the database connection's lifecycle. The dependency injection container will dispose of `DataService` when it's no longer needed, automatically closing the database connection.  Explicit disposal in `MyComponent` is redundant and potentially harmful.


**Example 2: Explicit Disposal Required (Python)**

```python
import sqlite3

class DatabaseConnector:
    def __init__(self, db_path):
        self.connection = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
        self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()

    def execute_query(self, query):
        self.cursor.execute(query)
        return self.cursor.fetchall()

    def close_connection(self):
        self.cursor.close()
        self.connection.close()

class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, connector):
        self.connector = connector

    def process_data(self):
        data = self.connector.execute_query("SELECT * FROM my_table")
        # ... data processing ...
        self.connector.close_connection() # Explicit disposal is crucial here.


db_connector = DatabaseConnector("mydatabase.db")
data_processor = DataProcessor(db_connector)
data_processor.process_data()
```

Here, the `DatabaseConnector` doesn't implement any automatic disposal mechanism.  The `DataProcessor` explicitly calls `close_connection()` to release the database resources.  This is essential because the dependency injection framework (if any) wouldn't inherently know about the `sqlite3` connection's lifecycle.


**Example 3:  Managing a File Handle (Java)**

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

class FileReaderService {
    private final BufferedReader reader;

    public FileReaderService(String filePath) throws IOException {
        reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath));
    }

    public String readLine() throws IOException {
        return reader.readLine();
    }

    public void close() throws IOException {
        reader.close();
    }
}

class DataAnalyzer {
    private final FileReaderService fileReader;

    public DataAnalyzer(FileReaderService fileReader) {
        this.fileReader = fileReader;
    }

    public void analyzeData() {
        try {
            String line;
            while ((line = fileReader.readLine()) != null) {
                // ... data analysis logic ...
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // Handle exception
        } finally {
            try {
                fileReader.close(); // Crucial for resource release.
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // Handle exception
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This Java example demonstrates handling a `BufferedReader`. While not strictly a dependency injection scenario, it highlights the need for explicit resource management (`finally` block) to ensure the file handle is closed, regardless of exceptions during processing. The `FileReaderService` is responsible for encapsulating the file handling logic and providing a method for clean closure.  Depending on how `FileReaderService` is instantiated and managed within a larger application, explicit closure might still be necessary even if the object itself is managed by a container.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of dependency injection, consult Martin Fowler's work on the Inversion of Control pattern.  Explore literature on resource management specific to your chosen programming language and framework.  Study best practices for exception handling and resource cleanup in your environment; the `try-finally` block in Java and the `with` statement in Python are relevant examples.  Thorough familiarity with your framework's documentation on lifecycle management and disposal strategies is indispensable.  Furthermore, the principles of SOLID design are beneficial in guiding the design of components that facilitate proper resource handling through well-defined interfaces and responsibilities.
