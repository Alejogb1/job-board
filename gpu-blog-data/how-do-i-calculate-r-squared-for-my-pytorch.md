Calculating R-squared for a PyTorch regression model requires careful consideration of the prediction and target tensors.  Directly applying the standard R-squared formula necessitates handling potential broadcasting issues and tensor dimensions. My experience building complex predictive models, particularly those involving time-series forecasting and financial modeling, has highlighted the importance of robust R-squared calculation for model evaluation.  Inaccurate implementation can lead to misleading performance metrics.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

R-squared, or the coefficient of determination, represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables in a regression model.  It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.  A value closer to 1 signifies a better model fit. In the context of PyTorch, we need to compute this metric using the predicted and true target values, typically available as tensors. The standard formula is:

R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)

Where:

* SS_res is the sum of squared residuals (errors).  It measures the unexplained variance.
* SS_tot is the total sum of squares. It measures the total variance in the target variable.

Calculating SS_res and SS_tot involves finding the difference between predicted and actual values, squaring these differences, and then summing them. SS_tot additionally requires calculating the mean of the target variable. Direct application of these calculations using NumPy functions after converting PyTorch tensors to NumPy arrays is inefficient. Optimized PyTorch operations can significantly improve performance, particularly for large datasets.

Crucially, the dimensions of the tensors must be carefully managed.  Mismatched dimensions can lead to incorrect calculations.  The `mean()` and `sum()` functions in PyTorch, used for these calculations, are dimension-aware, offering flexibility in handling different tensor shapes. I've personally encountered numerous debugging sessions stemming from oversight in tensor dimensions; meticulously checking this aspect is crucial.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic R-squared Calculation:**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

def calculate_r2(y_true, y_pred):
    """Calculates R-squared.  Assumes y_true and y_pred are 1D tensors."""
    y_true = y_true.cpu().numpy() # move tensor to CPU & convert to NumPy
    y_pred = y_pred.cpu().numpy()
    ss_res = np.sum(np.square(y_true - y_pred))
    ss_tot = np.sum(np.square(y_true - np.mean(y_true)))
    r2 = 1 - (ss_res / ss_tot)
    return r2

# Example usage:
y_true = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
y_pred = torch.tensor([1.2, 1.8, 3.1, 3.9])
r2 = calculate_r2(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward approach, leveraging NumPy for efficient calculations after transferring the PyTorch tensors to the CPU.  This method is suitable for smaller datasets. The conversion to NumPy array is necessary for compatibility with NumPy's array operations. The `cpu()` method ensures computation occurs on the CPU, avoiding potential issues if tensors reside on a GPU.

**Example 2: Handling Multi-dimensional Tensors:**

```python
import torch

def calculate_r2_multidim(y_true, y_pred):
    """Calculates R-squared for multi-dimensional tensors.
       Assumes y_true and y_pred have the same shape."""
    ss_res = torch.sum(torch.square(y_true - y_pred), dim=0) # Sum across samples
    ss_tot = torch.sum(torch.square(y_true - torch.mean(y_true, dim=0)), dim=0)
    r2 = 1 - (ss_res / ss_tot)
    return r2.mean().item() # Average across dimensions


# Example Usage with batch size:
y_true = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]])
y_pred = torch.tensor([[1.2, 1.8], [2.9, 4.2], [5.1, 5.8]])
r2 = calculate_r2_multidim(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")
```

This example extends the calculation to handle multi-dimensional tensors, often encountered in batch processing.  The `dim` argument in `torch.sum` and `torch.mean` specifies the dimension along which the operation is performed. This function averages the R-squared values across all dimensions to provide a single metric.  This approach avoids explicit conversion to NumPy arrays, leveraging PyTorch's built-in tensor operations for efficiency.


**Example 3:  R-squared with Custom Loss Function:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class R2Loss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def forward(self, y_true, y_pred):
        ss_res = torch.sum(torch.square(y_true - y_pred))
        ss_tot = torch.sum(torch.square(y_true - torch.mean(y_true)))
        r2 = 1 - (ss_res / ss_tot)
        return 1-r2 #Return 1-r2 because we often want to minimize loss

# Example usage:
criterion = R2Loss()
y_true = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
y_pred = torch.tensor([1.2, 1.8, 3.1, 3.9])
loss = criterion(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Loss (1-R-squared): {loss}")
```

This example demonstrates integrating R-squared calculation into a custom loss function.  This allows direct optimization of the model based on R-squared.  Note that the returned value is 1 - R², which represents the loss to be minimized.  This approach requires careful handling of tensor dimensions and might be computationally more intensive than post-training evaluation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation, particularly sections on tensor operations and automatic differentiation, provides fundamental information.  Consult a reputable machine learning textbook for a deeper understanding of regression analysis and model evaluation.  Finally, numerous academic papers detail advanced regression techniques and associated evaluation metrics.  Reviewing these resources will strengthen your understanding and refine your implementation of R-squared calculation within the PyTorch framework.
