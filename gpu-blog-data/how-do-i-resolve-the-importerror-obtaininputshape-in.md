The `ImportError: _obtain_input_shape` in Keras typically arises from an inconsistent or outdated installation of Keras, TensorFlow (or other backend), or their dependencies. I've encountered this multiple times while maintaining deep learning pipelines, specifically after migrating between different GPU environments and encountering conflicts with cached module files. The root cause is a failure of the Keras framework to locate a critical internal function responsible for determining the input shape of a model's layers. This function, often located within the Keras source code's utilities, is necessary when creating layers that don’t explicitly define input shapes, relying on the framework to infer it based on prior layers.

The problem manifests primarily when you’re building complex, multi-layered models, especially those employing custom layers or loading models that were previously trained using a different version of the framework. The `_obtain_input_shape` function is part of Keras' internal workings, and its location and specific implementation details can change between versions. If a mismatch exists between your installed Keras version and the versions of other Keras-related packages (like the backend) or previously saved models, the import path to this function might not be accurate, causing the error to be thrown. Often, the problem stems from a cached version of Keras in your Python environment, which is now incompatible with the currently installed packages. When constructing or loading a Keras model, especially one using layers that automatically infer shapes (like convolutional layers with the first layer not having a defined `input_shape`), Keras will call the `_obtain_input_shape` function. If the import fails, Keras cannot build the model. The error usually appears in the model creation or loading stage.

To resolve this, systematic troubleshooting is required, targeting potential inconsistencies within the environment. Firstly, verify the versions of Keras, TensorFlow (or alternative backend), and related packages. Incompatibilities among these are a primary cause. A common scenario involves updating TensorFlow while leaving Keras at an older version, or vice versa, which breaks their internal compatibility. Then, inspect your Python environment for duplicate Keras installations. Sometimes multiple installations exist due to different virtual environment setups or system-wide configurations, which may have different versions. Finally, pay attention to cached module files. If the Keras import path for `_obtain_input_shape` changes between versions and you have not invalidated caches, Python may be importing an outdated version, causing the error.

Here are three code examples that illustrate the error and its potential solutions:

**Example 1: The Error in Model Creation**

This example shows a common scenario where the error can occur during model creation using convolutional layers, without explicit input shape defined for the first layer:

```python
# Incorrect way to define the first Conv2D Layer.
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

try:
    model = keras.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),  # input_shape is missing
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])

    model.build() # Build the model to allow the input to be inferred
    print("Model Successfully created") # This line may not execute due to error
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # ImportError: cannot import name '_obtain_input_shape' from 'keras.layers.convolutional'
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Other error: {e}")
```

In this code, the first `Conv2D` layer is initialized without specifying an `input_shape`. During the model's build process, or when the model attempts to determine its input requirements, Keras calls `_obtain_input_shape`, which is not importable due to inconsistencies. This results in an `ImportError`. The fix here involves explicitly specifying the `input_shape` in the first layer and the use of the .build method, which allows for input shape inference.

**Example 2: The Solution**

The code below provides one correct way to define the same model, thus avoiding the `ImportError`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

try:
    model = keras.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), # Correct way to define the first layer. 
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    
    model.build() # Build the model to allow the input to be inferred
    print("Model Successfully created") # Successfull execution of this
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # This will not be displayed.
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Other error: {e}")
```
By defining `input_shape`, Keras no longer needs to rely on the problematic `_obtain_input_shape`. The `input_shape` parameter specifies the size and number of channels the first layer expects for the incoming images, preventing the error from being thrown. Specifically, the `build` method allows the input shape to be inferred when the shape is not specified, and so, if an `input_shape` is already provided, then `build` simply adds an `input_shape` attribute to the model.

**Example 3: Clearing Cached Files**

Sometimes, the issue isn’t with the code itself, but with cached module files that are no longer compatible with the installed Keras and TensorFlow (or backend) versions. This example shows how to clear cached module files:

```python
import os
import sys
import shutil
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

try:
    model = keras.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), # Correct way to define the first layer. 
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    
    model.build()
    print("Model Successfully created") # Successfull execution of this
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # This will not be displayed.
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Other error: {e}")
    
# Clearing cache
try:
    cache_dir = sys.modules['tensorflow'].__path__[0] + '/__pycache__'  
    if os.path.exists(cache_dir):
        shutil.rmtree(cache_dir)
        print(f"Cache successfully cleared from: {cache_dir}")

    cache_dir = sys.modules['keras'].__path__[0] + '/__pycache__'
    if os.path.exists(cache_dir):
        shutil.rmtree(cache_dir)
        print(f"Cache successfully cleared from: {cache_dir}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Cache clearing failed: {e}")
```

Here, I've added code to identify and remove the `__pycache__` directories within the TensorFlow and Keras module directories after attempting to build a model. This forces Python to reload the latest versions of the modules and ensures it's not using a cached version of `_obtain_input_shape`. The first execution may fail with the `ImportError`, but after clearing the cache, subsequent runs of your model creation should succeed.

To further address the `ImportError`, I recommend several resources for detailed knowledge. The official Keras documentation contains comprehensive guides on model building and layer functionalities, including information on input shapes. Referencing the TensorFlow documentation provides valuable insights on dependency management and module imports. Consulting online forums or community discussions, while taking them with caution, can provide further information and solutions as well. Finally, understanding the Python module import process is fundamental. Knowing how Python searches for modules will provide more knowledge on potential installation and caching issues, which will help to debug this and other import-related errors.
