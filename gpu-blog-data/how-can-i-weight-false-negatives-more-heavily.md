In binary classification tasks, situations often arise where misclassifying a positive instance (a false negative) carries a significantly higher cost than misclassifying a negative instance (a false positive). While `torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss` is a widely used loss function, it doesn't inherently provide a mechanism to weigh false negatives differently. The standard implementation treats both types of errors equally, which can lead to suboptimal performance in scenarios with imbalanced error costs. The goal is therefore to manually adjust the loss to reflect the greater penalty for false negatives.

The core issue with using the vanilla `BCEWithLogitsLoss` when you have disparate error costs is its fundamental design. This loss function calculates the average binary cross-entropy over all predictions without discrimination based on whether they correspond to actual positive or negative cases. Effectively, it computes:

```
Loss = - ( y * log(sigmoid(x)) + (1 - y) * log(1 - sigmoid(x)) )
```

Where *y* is the true label (0 or 1), and *x* is the model output before the sigmoid activation. This formulation penalizes all misclassifications uniformly.

To address the specific need for differentially weighted errors, a modified loss calculation is necessary. Instead of treating all misclassifications the same, we introduce a weight *w* that is applied specifically to instances where the true label is positive (i.e., when *y* = 1). This effectively amplifies the loss incurred when the model predicts a negative value when the actual value was positive, thereby directly addressing the question of weighted false negatives.

The modified loss function can be defined as follows:

```
Modified_Loss = - ( w * y * log(sigmoid(x)) + (1 - y) * log(1 - sigmoid(x)) )
```
This formulation directly applies the weight *w* to the first term within the loss calculation. By using `w > 1`, false negatives (where y=1 but `sigmoid(x)` is low) are penalized more heavily. Conversely, `w<1` would reduce the penalty for false negatives.

Implementation requires careful attention to the PyTorch API. Here's the first code example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def weighted_bce_with_logits(logits, targets, weight):
    """
    Computes weighted binary cross entropy loss with logits.

    Args:
        logits (torch.Tensor): Predicted logits of shape (N, *).
        targets (torch.Tensor): True labels of shape (N, *) with values 0 or 1.
        weight (float): Weight for positive examples.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Weighted loss tensor.
    """
    loss = -1 * (weight * targets * F.logsigmoid(logits) + (1 - targets) * F.logsigmoid(-logits))
    return loss.mean()

# Example usage
logits = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True) # Simulated model output
targets = torch.randint(0, 2, (10,)).float() # Simulated labels (0 or 1)
weight = 5.0 # Higher weight for false negatives

loss = weighted_bce_with_logits(logits, targets, weight)
loss.backward()

print(f"Weighted Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

In this example, `weighted_bce_with_logits` encapsulates the weighted loss logic. Notably, `F.logsigmoid` is used instead of `torch.sigmoid` followed by `torch.log` for numerical stability. This approach leverages the internal optimization present in `logsigmoid` which avoids potential issues arising when small sigmoid outputs result in large negative log outputs. The loss is then averaged over all samples, as is typical for PyTorch. The example demonstrates the core concept â€“ the provided `weight` is applied directly to the positive instance loss calculation. The call to `.backward()` calculates the gradients for the network weights based on this customized loss calculation.

Another approach involves creating a custom `nn.Module` that encapsulates the weighting behavior, providing cleaner integration with PyTorch's model training pipelines:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class WeightedBCEWithLogitsLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, weight=1.0):
        super().__init__()
        self.weight = weight

    def forward(self, logits, targets):
        """
        Computes weighted binary cross entropy loss with logits.

        Args:
            logits (torch.Tensor): Predicted logits of shape (N, *).
            targets (torch.Tensor): True labels of shape (N, *) with values 0 or 1.

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: Weighted loss tensor.
        """

        loss = -1 * (self.weight * targets * F.logsigmoid(logits) + (1 - targets) * F.logsigmoid(-logits))
        return loss.mean()


# Example usage
logits = torch.randn(10, 1, requires_grad=True)
targets = torch.randint(0, 2, (10, 1)).float()
weighted_loss_fn = WeightedBCEWithLogitsLoss(weight=7.0)

loss = weighted_loss_fn(logits, targets)
loss.backward()

print(f"Custom Module Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This `WeightedBCEWithLogitsLoss` class allows you to instantiate a weighted loss function with a user-defined weight. The `weight` parameter is set during the module's initialization, making it readily available during the forward pass. This approach provides a convenient way to manage the loss within a model, allowing for easier parameterization and configuration during training. The `forward` method performs the identical calculation to the previous example, but now integrates with PyTorch's `nn.Module` infrastructure. Crucially, the shape of the inputs `logits` and `targets` is adapted to a common (N,1) shape, demonstrating that the function is not limited to one dimensional outputs.

Lastly, a more granular approach is possible where the weighting is applied on a per-instance basis, not with a single global weight. This is often required when the importance of different examples varies dynamically during training. The weight can be controlled at sample-level granularity, allowing greater flexibility:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def sample_weighted_bce_with_logits(logits, targets, weights):
    """
    Computes weighted binary cross entropy loss with logits with per-sample weights.

    Args:
        logits (torch.Tensor): Predicted logits of shape (N, *).
        targets (torch.Tensor): True labels of shape (N, *) with values 0 or 1.
        weights (torch.Tensor): Per-sample weights of shape (N, *), should be non-negative.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Weighted loss tensor.
    """

    loss = -1 * (weights * targets * F.logsigmoid(logits) + (1 - targets) * F.logsigmoid(-logits))
    return loss.mean()

# Example Usage
logits = torch.randn(10, 1, requires_grad=True)
targets = torch.randint(0, 2, (10, 1)).float()
sample_weights = torch.rand(10, 1) * 10 # Simulated sample weights

loss = sample_weighted_bce_with_logits(logits, targets, sample_weights)
loss.backward()

print(f"Sample Weighted Loss: {loss.item()}")
```
In this third code sample, the function `sample_weighted_bce_with_logits` accepts a tensor `weights` of the same shape as `targets` and `logits`, allowing different weights for every instance within the batch. The example generates random sample weights between 0 and 10. This approach offers the greatest flexibility, allowing the model to focus on specific samples or sample groups during training. Again, the `.backward()` call calculates the gradients based on this fine-grained loss calculation.

For additional resources, consult comprehensive machine learning texts covering loss functions, particularly those dealing with imbalanced datasets. Books on practical deep learning with PyTorch, often contain detailed sections on training strategies that address such situations. Furthermore, the official PyTorch documentation remains an essential resource, offering precise details on its functionalities. Lastly, exploring online courses which detail advanced loss-function design, can enhance understanding and the practical implementation of techniques. Remember that proper experimentation remains vital. The correct weight for the problem is most often empirically determined through a systematic evaluation of model performance.
