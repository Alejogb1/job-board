The crux of the issue with `tf.train.start_queue_runners()` not gracefully closing your TensorFlow queue lies not in the function itself, but rather in the lifecycle management of your threads and the underlying session.  My experience troubleshooting similar scenarios across numerous large-scale TensorFlow deployments points to a consistent set of potential culprits, primarily involving improper session handling and thread termination strategies. `tf.train.start_queue_runners()` only *starts* the queue runners; it doesn't inherently manage their termination.  This requires explicit intervention on the part of the developer.

**1. Explanation:**

`tf.train.start_queue_runners()` operates within a TensorFlow session.  It spawns threads responsible for feeding data into the queue.  The critical omission is often the explicit closure of this session.  Failure to properly close the session prevents the queue runners from receiving the termination signal, effectively leading to a deadlock or resource leak.  Even after calling `coord.request_stop()`, the threads continue to operate unless the session is explicitly closed, preventing the queue from closing.  Furthermore, improperly handling exceptions during queue operation can also prevent clean shutdown.  The `coord.join()` function awaits the termination of these threads, but it's contingent on those threads receiving the appropriate stop signal.  This signal is transmitted via the session's closure.

Another frequently overlooked aspect is the interplay between the queue runner threads and potential blocking operations within your data preprocessing pipelines. If your data fetching or preprocessing steps are susceptible to long-running tasks or indefinite waits (e.g., network requests without timeouts), these threads could remain unresponsive to the `coord.request_stop()` signal.

Finally, ensure you're using the correct `coord` object across your `start_queue_runners` and `join` calls. Using separate `Coordinator` instances can lead to inconsistent behavior and incomplete thread termination.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Correct Usage with Explicit Session Closure:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your queue definition ...

with tf.Session() as sess:
    coord = tf.train.Coordinator()
    threads = tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess=sess, coord=coord)

    try:
        # ... your training/inference loop ...
        for i in range(1000):
            example = sess.run(queue.dequeue())
            # ... process example ...

    except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:
        print("Queue is empty")
    except Exception as e:
        coord.request_stop(e)
    finally:
        coord.request_stop()
        coord.join(threads)
        sess.close() #Crucial for clean shutdown
        print("Session and queue closed successfully")

```

This example demonstrates the correct pattern.  The `try...except...finally` block ensures that `coord.request_stop()` is called even if exceptions occur during processing.  Crucially, `sess.close()` is called within the `finally` block, guaranteeing session closure and thread termination regardless of errors.

**Example 2: Incorrect Usage - Missing Session Closure:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... your queue definition ...

sess = tf.Session()
coord = tf.train.Coordinator()
threads = tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess=sess, coord=coord)

try:
    # ... your training/inference loop ...
    for i in range(1000):
        example = sess.run(queue.dequeue())
        # ... process example ...

except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:
    print("Queue is empty")
except Exception as e:
    coord.request_stop(e)
finally:
    coord.request_stop()
    coord.join(threads)
    # sess.close()  <-- Missing session closure!

```

This example is flawed.  The absence of `sess.close()` prevents the queue runners from receiving the termination signal, leading to the queue remaining open.  The threads will not terminate until the session is closed.


**Example 3: Handling Long-Running Preprocessing:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

# ... your queue definition ...

def preprocess_data(data):
    # Simulate a long-running operation
    time.sleep(5) # Replace with actual preprocessing
    return data

with tf.Session() as sess:
    coord = tf.train.Coordinator()
    threads = tf.train.start_queue_runners(sess=sess, coord=coord)

    try:
        for i in range(1000):
            raw_data = sess.run(queue.dequeue())
            processed_data = preprocess_data(raw_data) #Potentially blocking operation
            # ... process processed_data ...

    except tf.errors.OutOfRangeError:
        print("Queue is empty")
    except Exception as e:
        coord.request_stop(e)
    finally:
        coord.request_stop()
        coord.join(threads, stop_grace_period_secs=10) # Grace period for cleanup
        sess.close()

```

This example introduces a simulated long-running preprocessing step (`time.sleep(5)`).  The `stop_grace_period_secs` argument in `coord.join()` provides a grace period allowing the threads to finish their current tasks before termination, mitigating potential issues caused by blocking operations within the preprocessing pipeline.  The addition of exception handling within the preprocessing function itself may also prove necessary in complex scenarios.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow queue management and thread handling, I strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on queue runners, coordinators, and session management.  Additionally, the TensorFlow tutorials offer practical examples that cover various aspects of data input pipelines.  Reviewing advanced threading concepts in general programming literature will enhance your grasp of the underlying mechanics.  Finally, thorough familiarity with Python's exception handling mechanism is vital for robust error management within your TensorFlow applications.
