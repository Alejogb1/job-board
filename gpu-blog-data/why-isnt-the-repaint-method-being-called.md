The `repaint()` method in AWT and Swing, while seemingly straightforward, often fails to trigger a visual update due to subtleties in the event dispatch thread and the underlying painting mechanism.  My experience debugging numerous UI glitches over the past decade points to several consistent culprits.  The core issue isn't necessarily that `repaint()` is *not* called; rather, it's that the request is either ignored or its effect is overshadowed.

**1. Explanation:**

The `repaint()` method doesn't directly redraw the component.  Instead, it schedules a paint request. This request is processed later by the AWT Event Dispatch Thread (EDT), which handles all UI updates.  If the EDT is busy or if the component's repaint mechanism is improperly configured, the visual update might not happen as expected.  Furthermore, if the component's `paintComponent` (or `paint` for AWT) method isn't correctly implemented, even a correctly scheduled repaint might not produce the desired results.

Several factors contribute to repaint failures:

* **EDT Blocking:**  Long-running operations on the EDT prevent other events, including paint requests, from being processed.  This commonly occurs when computationally intensive tasks are performed within UI event handlers or during the painting process itself.  The EDT essentially becomes a bottleneck, starving the repaint mechanism.

* **Incorrect Component Hierarchy:**  Problems with component visibility, layout managers, or parent-child relationships can effectively hide or prevent the repaint from having a visible effect.  If a component is not visible (e.g., its size is zero or its parent is invisible), `repaint()` will do nothing.  Similarly, flawed layout management can prevent a component from being laid out correctly, thus obscuring updates.

* `paintComponent` Implementation Errors:**  Errors within the `paintComponent` method, such as forgetting to call `super.paintComponent(g)` (in Swing), will lead to incomplete or incorrect painting, even if `repaint()` is called correctly. Failure to handle correctly the graphics context (`g`) will similarly prevent proper painting.

* **Concurrency Issues:**  While `repaint()` is thread-safe in that it can be called from any thread, the actual painting operation happens only on the EDT.  Incorrect synchronization between threads can lead to race conditions where paint requests are lost or overwritten.

* **Invalidating the Component:** Although not strictly related to `repaint()`, neglecting to invalidate the component using `revalidate()` after significant structural changes (e.g., adding or removing subcomponents) can cause the layout manager to not reflect the updates, even though the painting might be correct.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  EDT Blocking:**

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class RepaintBlock extends JFrame {

    private JPanel panel;

    public RepaintBlock() {
        panel = new JPanel();
        add(panel);
        JButton button = new JButton("Block EDT");
        button.addActionListener(e -> {
            long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
            try {
                Thread.sleep(5000); // Simulates a long operation
            } catch (InterruptedException ex) {}
            long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
            System.out.println("EDT blocked for: " + (endTime - startTime) + "ms");
            panel.repaint(); // Repaint after EDT blockage, likely missed updates
        });
        add(button, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
        setSize(300, 200);
        setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        setVisible(true);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new RepaintBlock();
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how a long-running operation on the EDT can delay or prevent the repaint from taking effect. The `Thread.sleep(5000)` call simulates a blocking operation.  During this time, other events, including the paint request generated by `panel.repaint()`, are delayed.  The repaint might occur only after the blocking operation completes, but any updates missed during the blockage won't be reflected.


**Example 2:  Incorrect `paintComponent` Implementation:**

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;

public class RepaintIncorrectPaint extends JPanel {

    @Override
    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        // Missing super.paintComponent(g); leads to no background clearing
        g.setColor(Color.RED);
        g.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 100);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame();
        RepaintIncorrectPaint panel = new RepaintIncorrectPaint();
        frame.add(panel);
        frame.setSize(300, 200);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setVisible(true);
        panel.repaint(); //Repaint won't clear previous content
    }
}
```

Here, the absence of `super.paintComponent(g)` prevents the panel's background from being cleared before drawing the red rectangle. Subsequent repaints will simply add more rectangles on top, without erasing the previous ones.  This isn't a `repaint()` failure, but an improper painting implementation that makes it appear so.


**Example 3: Concurrency Issues (Simplified):**

```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;

public class RepaintConcurrency extends JPanel {

    private volatile boolean repaintRequested = false;

    @Override
    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        if (repaintRequested) {
            g.setColor(Color.BLUE);
            g.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 100);
            repaintRequested = false;
        }
    }

    public void requestRepaint() {
        repaintRequested = true;
        repaint(); //Repaint scheduled, but might be overridden
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      // ... (JFrame setup as before) ...
      new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
                panel.requestRepaint();
            } catch (InterruptedException ex) {}
      }).start();
    }
}
```

This example, though simplified, hints at potential concurrency issues.  A separate thread requests a repaint.  If the EDT is slow to process this request, or if another thread interferes with `repaintRequested`, the blue rectangle might not appear.  Robust synchronization mechanisms (not shown here for simplicity) would be needed in a real-world scenario to manage such concurrent access safely.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **Effective Java (Joshua Bloch):**  Covers fundamental aspects of thread safety and concurrency, crucial for understanding the EDT's role in UI updates.

* **The Java Tutorials (Oracle):** The Swing and AWT sections provide detailed information on event handling, painting, and the EDT.

* **Java Concurrency in Practice (Brian Goetz et al.):** This advanced resource delves deeper into concurrency issues and offers solutions for complex synchronization problems that could affect repaint behavior.


By carefully analyzing the EDT's activity, the component hierarchy, the `paintComponent` method, and addressing potential concurrency problems, one can effectively troubleshoot and resolve repaint issues in Java Swing applications.  The examples highlight common pitfalls, and the suggested resources provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Remember that the problem often lies not in the `repaint()` call itself, but in the context surrounding it.
