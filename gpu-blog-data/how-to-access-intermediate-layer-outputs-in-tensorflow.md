TensorFlow’s computational graph structure facilitates the extraction of intermediate layer outputs, a crucial capability for model analysis, feature visualization, and transfer learning. I’ve utilized this functionality extensively in projects involving image style transfer and recurrent neural network debugging, and I've found that the approach can be nuanced depending on whether you're working with the Keras API or directly with TensorFlow's lower-level operations. The core principle involves identifying the layer’s symbolic tensor within the computation graph and then creating a new model that outputs this specific tensor along with or instead of the original model’s output.

To elaborate, let's explore accessing intermediate layers using both the Keras and the direct TensorFlow API. The Keras API, with its `Model` class, allows for relatively straightforward manipulation of the computational graph after it’s been built. Specifically, it treats layer outputs as tensors, so one can create new models that have specific layers as the output. Conversely, with lower-level operations, we must manually construct operations for the desired outputs and incorporate them into a new model.

Here's an example using the Keras functional API, where I'm extracting the output of the second convolutional layer in a simple image classification network:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define the base model
input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
x = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_tensor)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(x)
second_conv_output = x # Capture output of second conv layer
x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Flatten()(x)
x = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
base_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=x)

# Create a model to output second_conv_output
intermediate_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=second_conv_output)


# Generate a dummy input image for demonstration
import numpy as np
dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)


# Get the output of the second convolutional layer
intermediate_output = intermediate_model.predict(dummy_input)

print("Shape of intermediate output:", intermediate_output.shape)
```

In this code, I first constructed a standard convolutional model using the Keras functional API. The key line is `second_conv_output = x`, where I captured the output tensor after the second convolutional layer. Subsequently, I created a new `tf.keras.Model` named `intermediate_model` that takes the same input as the original model, `input_tensor`, but has `second_conv_output` as its output. This results in a model that outputs the activations of that particular layer. When `intermediate_model.predict()` is executed with some dummy data, I obtain the output of the second convolutional layer rather than the output of the final layer. This demonstrates the straightforward approach facilitated by the Keras API.

Another case I've encountered is a scenario involving recurrent neural networks. Consider a sequence model where I wish to monitor the hidden state of an LSTM layer:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define an LSTM model
input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10, 100)) # Sequence of 10, each feature with 100 elements
lstm_layer = layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True, return_state=True) # Ensure states are returned
lstm_output, hidden_state, cell_state = lstm_layer(input_tensor) # Obtain all output states


# Build the model for hidden states
hidden_state_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=hidden_state)

# Generate dummy sequence input
import numpy as np
dummy_sequence = np.random.rand(1, 10, 100)

# Get hidden state
hidden_state_output = hidden_state_model.predict(dummy_sequence)


print("Shape of hidden state:", hidden_state_output.shape)
```

Here, I created an LSTM layer with `return_sequences=True` and `return_state=True` in order to extract the hidden and cell states alongside the output sequences. The returned tensors are packed according to Keras API output, and then, I built a new model, `hidden_state_model`, whose output is specifically the hidden state. Using `hidden_state_model.predict()` on input data yields only the hidden state activations of the LSTM layer. This allows to observe hidden state dynamics across the sequences, something that might be interesting when debugging long-range dependecies in natural language processing tasks. This approach is useful because often one is not interested in full sequences but only the current layer's output.

The techniques using the Keras API rely on the fact that each layer is a `tf.keras.layers.Layer` object, which creates a corresponding `tf.Tensor` object when applied to other tensors. These outputs can be captured before their application to subsequent layers.

Now, when direct TensorFlow operations are in play, the approach is slightly different because we must manually build the graph structure. Below is an example that shows how to access an intermediate layer when building a model using low-level tensorflow operations, without using the Keras API:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define input placeholder
input_tensor = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 28, 28, 1), name='input_tensor')

# Define layers using TensorFlow operations
conv1_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([3, 3, 1, 32]), name='conv1_weights')
conv1_bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([32]), name='conv1_bias')
conv1_output = tf.nn.relu(tf.nn.conv2d(input_tensor, conv1_weights, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME') + conv1_bias)
pool1_output = tf.nn.max_pool(conv1_output, ksize=[1, 2, 2, 1], strides=[1, 2, 2, 1], padding='SAME')

conv2_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([3, 3, 32, 64]), name='conv2_weights')
conv2_bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([64]), name='conv2_bias')
conv2_output = tf.nn.relu(tf.nn.conv2d(pool1_output, conv2_weights, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME') + conv2_bias) # Captured conv2

pool2_output = tf.nn.max_pool(conv2_output, ksize=[1, 2, 2, 1], strides=[1, 2, 2, 1], padding='SAME')


flatten_output = tf.reshape(pool2_output, [-1, 7 * 7 * 64]) # Flatten before dense
dense_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([7 * 7 * 64, 10]), name='dense_weights')
dense_bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]), name='dense_bias')
output_tensor = tf.nn.softmax(tf.matmul(flatten_output, dense_weights) + dense_bias) # Softmax outut


# Create a model for conv2_output by selecting it as output operation in session run

# Start a session and initialize variables
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
  
  # Create a dummy input image
  import numpy as np
  dummy_input = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)

  # Run session and compute the desired outputs
  intermediate_output = sess.run(conv2_output, feed_dict={input_tensor: dummy_input})
  print("Shape of intermediate output:", intermediate_output.shape)

```

In this example, I built the convolutional neural network using TensorFlow operations directly, without the Keras API. After defining and applying all convolutional and pooling operations, I captured the output of the second convolution layer at `conv2_output`. In the interactive session, I executed `sess.run` specifically with the `conv2_output` tensor as the target to retrieve only this tensor’s value.  This method directly pulls out the activation values without constructing new models or defining a new output tensor; however, it means running a new session each time a tensor is targeted. This can become clunky to manage when many different intermediate outputs need to be observed across a single application. This approach is useful when performing custom operations, such as creating layers that do not exist in the Keras API.

In practice, I recommend consulting these resources for further study: "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron for a comprehensive overview of both Keras and lower-level TensorFlow and “Deep Learning with Python” by François Chollet, the creator of Keras, for detailed explanations of Keras concepts. Additionally, the official TensorFlow documentation serves as an excellent source for the most current information and API details. I have personally found these resources valuable when needing to access a hidden layer in a custom model.

Accessing intermediate layer outputs is a foundational technique in advanced deep learning practice, enabling diverse operations from visualization to model manipulation. The approaches outlined demonstrate how these outputs can be extracted in different contexts within the TensorFlow ecosystem, empowering more intricate model development and analysis.
