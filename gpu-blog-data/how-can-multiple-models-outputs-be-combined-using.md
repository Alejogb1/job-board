The naive approach of averaging multiple model outputs before applying a SoftMax function is statistically unsound and often detrimental to performance.  My experience working on large-scale image classification projects highlighted this issue repeatedly.  Directly averaging probabilities produced by independent models ignores the inherent uncertainty and potential biases present in each individual model's predictions.  A more robust method leverages the SoftMax function not as a final layer, but as an intermediate step within a weighted ensemble, thereby accounting for the varying confidence levels of each constituent model.

**1. Understanding the Limitations of Naive Averaging**

The temptation to simply average the raw probability outputs from multiple models – say, three models predicting class probabilities for images – before applying a SoftMax is strong.  However, this approach fails to account for the reliability of each model.  A model consistently performing poorly will unduly influence the final prediction.  Imagine Model A has a 90% confidence in class 'cat,' Model B has 10% confidence in 'cat,' and Model C has 50% confidence.  A simple average yields (90+10+50)/3 = 50%, which inadequately reflects the higher confidence of Model A.  Applying SoftMax to these averaged probabilities further obscures the individual model's contribution, resulting in a less accurate and less informative final prediction.

**2.  Weighted Averaging and SoftMax for Ensemble Methods**

A superior approach involves a weighted average of the *logit* outputs (pre-SoftMax probabilities) of each model.  This allows each model's contribution to be scaled based on its historical performance or a confidence metric derived during inference.  This weighting accounts for the varying reliability of different models, preventing less accurate models from disproportionately affecting the final prediction.  The weighted average of logits is then passed through a final SoftMax function to obtain properly normalized class probabilities.

The weights, denoted as `w_i`, represent the relative importance of each model.  These weights can be learned through techniques such as cross-validation, where the weights are optimized to maximize overall performance on a held-out validation set.  Alternatively, they can be assigned based on each model's performance on a separate evaluation metric, such as Area Under the Curve (AUC) or accuracy.


**3. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's illustrate with Python and NumPy.  We will assume three models (`model1`, `model2`, `model3`) each outputting a NumPy array of logits.

**Example 1:  Weighted Averaging with Pre-determined Weights**

```python
import numpy as np

def weighted_softmax(logits, weights):
    """Applies weighted averaging and then Softmax."""
    weighted_sum = np.average(logits, axis=0, weights=weights)
    probabilities = np.exp(weighted_sum) / np.sum(np.exp(weighted_sum))
    return probabilities

# Sample Logits (replace with actual model outputs)
model1_logits = np.array([2.0, 1.0, 0.5])  # Logits for classes A, B, C respectively
model2_logits = np.array([1.5, 2.5, 0.0])
model3_logits = np.array([0.8, 1.2, 2.0])

# Weights based on prior evaluation (e.g., model accuracy)
weights = np.array([0.4, 0.35, 0.25]) #Model 1 is most accurate, hence highest weight

logits = np.stack([model1_logits, model2_logits, model3_logits])
probabilities = weighted_softmax(logits, weights)
print(f"Probabilities after weighted softmax: {probabilities}")
```

This example demonstrates the core concept.  The `weighted_softmax` function first performs a weighted average of the logit arrays, and then applies the standard SoftMax function to ensure the output is a probability distribution.


**Example 2:  Learning Weights using Gradient Descent**

While assigning weights based on prior knowledge is useful, learning weights directly during training offers greater flexibility and often leads to improved performance.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf #or other deep learning framework

# Placeholder for model logits
logits = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[3, num_classes]) #3 models, num_classes is the number of classes.

# Learnable weights
weights = tf.Variable(tf.random.uniform([3], minval=0, maxval=1))  # Initialize weights randomly
weights = tf.nn.softmax(weights) # Ensure weights sum to 1

# Weighted averaging
weighted_logits = tf.tensordot(weights, logits, axes=[[0],[0]])

# Softmax
probabilities = tf.nn.softmax(weighted_logits)

# Define loss function (e.g., cross-entropy) and optimizer (e.g., Adam)
# ... (loss and optimization code would be added here)
# This would involve defining a true label placeholder and calculating the loss based on it.


# Training loop
# ... (Training loop using gradient descent to optimize weights)

```

This code snippet illustrates a more sophisticated approach using TensorFlow (or other deep learning frameworks). The weights are now learnable variables, and their values are optimized during training using backpropagation and a suitable loss function, such as cross-entropy loss. This allows the model to automatically learn the optimal weights for each constituent model.


**Example 3:  Handling Missing Outputs**

In real-world scenarios, one or more models might fail to produce outputs due to resource constraints, errors, or other reasons.  Robust code should handle such situations gracefully.

```python
import numpy as np

def weighted_softmax_robust(logits, weights):
  """Handles missing model outputs."""
  valid_indices = np.where(~np.isnan(logits).any(axis=1))[0]
  valid_logits = logits[valid_indices]
  valid_weights = weights[valid_indices]

  if len(valid_logits) == 0:
      return np.ones(logits.shape[1]) / logits.shape[1] #default if no models return output.

  weighted_sum = np.average(valid_logits, axis=0, weights=valid_weights)
  probabilities = np.exp(weighted_sum) / np.sum(np.exp(weighted_sum))
  return probabilities

# Example with one model producing NaN (Not a Number)
model1_logits = np.array([2.0, 1.0, 0.5])
model2_logits = np.array([np.nan, np.nan, np.nan]) #Model 2 failed.
model3_logits = np.array([0.8, 1.2, 2.0])

weights = np.array([0.4, 0.35, 0.25])
logits = np.stack([model1_logits, model2_logits, model3_logits])
probabilities = weighted_softmax_robust(logits, weights)
print(f"Probabilities after robust weighted softmax: {probabilities}")

```

This improved function first identifies and removes models that produce `NaN` values (indicating missing or invalid outputs) before proceeding with the weighted averaging and SoftMax operations.  A default probability distribution is returned if all models fail.


**4. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of ensemble methods, I recommend consulting textbooks on machine learning and pattern recognition.  Furthermore, review papers on model ensembling techniques will provide advanced strategies and comparative analyses.  Finally, exploring research papers on the specific application domain will provide context-specific best practices for combining model outputs.  Understanding the properties of logit outputs and the mathematical underpinnings of the SoftMax function is crucial.
