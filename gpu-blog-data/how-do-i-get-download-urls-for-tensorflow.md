TensorFlow Datasets, despite their ease of use, do not directly expose download URLs for their CSV files. Accessing the raw CSV requires understanding the dataset's structure, which is built around a combination of `tf.data.Dataset` objects and, internally, the TensorFlow I/O library. My experience in data pipeline optimization has often led me down this path; extracting raw files is a common need for debugging, preprocessing outside of TensorFlow, or integration with systems that don't natively support TFDS. Instead of direct URLs, TFDS manages data fetching through its own internal mechanisms. Therefore, getting at the CSV requires a slightly more nuanced approach than you might initially expect.

The core issue is that TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) provides a `tf.data.Dataset` which, conceptually, is a pipeline of data records. The underlying data source is abstracted away; TFDS handles downloads, caching, and data streaming for you. This abstraction is a feature for streamlined model training but a hindrance when direct file access is needed. When a CSV-based dataset is used, its source is often a collection of CSV files stored in cloud storage, managed by the TFDS internal infrastructure.

The process, then, isn't about finding a URL per se, but rather about forcing TFDS to download the data locally. Once locally available, the relevant CSV files can be located within the TFDS data directory. Crucially, you must initialize a dataset via `tfds.load`, specifying both the dataset name and the download directory. This download directory is critical; TFDS will use it to store both the dataset metadata and downloaded data. The `download=True` parameter triggers the downloading of the dataset.

Here's how I typically approach it, illustrated with three code examples.

**Example 1: Basic Download and Data Location**

This first example outlines the fundamental approach: downloading the data and identifying the download location. Note that `as_supervised=True` isn’t strictly required for this use case, but is included as a common practice in handling tabular data. It returns feature/label pairs.

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
import os

# Specify the dataset name and download directory
dataset_name = 'titanic'  #Example dataset, which uses a CSV format.
download_dir = './tfds_downloads' #Use your desired location

#Load the dataset, forcing download.
ds = tfds.load(dataset_name, split='train', download=True, data_dir = download_dir, as_supervised = True)
print("Dataset downloaded, exploring directory")

#Access dataset information
dataset_info = tfds.builder(dataset_name).info

# Access download and extracted path
downloaded_files_path = dataset_info.data_dir
print("Downloaded data directory:", downloaded_files_path)

#Find a CSV file within the downloaded directory
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(downloaded_files_path):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith(".csv"):
            print("Found a CSV File:", os.path.join(root, file))
            break
    else:
        continue
    break
```

This snippet first loads the dataset, triggering a download to the specified directory. Then, it accesses metadata through `dataset_info`, particularly the `data_dir` attribute. Finally, it searches the download directory for a CSV file. Note that dataset structures can vary, so a targeted search might be needed. The CSV may not always be directly in the root of downloaded_files_path.

**Example 2: Exploring Splits and Handling Multiple Files**

Many datasets have multiple splits (train, validation, test). Each split can have its own set of CSV files. This example demonstrates how to iterate through those splits and find files per split. Also, it shows how to handle cases where there may be multiple CSVs in a split or a different path structure than the first example.

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
import os

dataset_name = 'amazon_us_reviews/Electronics_v1_00' #Example: multiple CSVs per split.
download_dir = './tfds_downloads'

#Load dataset without split specifier to get information
ds_info = tfds.builder(dataset_name).info

#Iterate through all available splits
for split_name in ds_info.splits.keys():
    print("Processing split:", split_name)

    # Load data for the current split, forcing download
    ds = tfds.load(dataset_name, split=split_name, download=True, data_dir = download_dir, as_supervised=True)

    # Access data path for split specific files
    split_path = os.path.join(ds_info.data_dir, split_name)

    #Find CSV files for this split
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(split_path):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith(".csv"):
                print("Found a CSV file:", os.path.join(root, file))
```

This example demonstrates the handling of multiple splits. For each split, the code loads the data, constructs a split specific path, and then looks for CSV files within that split's specific directory structure. This is crucial for datasets like the Amazon review datasets that are split across several files per category.

**Example 3: Handling Sharded CSV Files**

Some datasets, particularly large ones, distribute data across multiple sharded CSV files. These are often named with a numerical suffix. This example illustrates how to identify and handle these sharded files, although direct access to all shards requires an understanding of how they are split. The core challenge here is that these individual files represent a fragmented dataset and need to be handled accordingly if you intend to reassemble them into a single unified set. This example primarily focuses on the file discovery.

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
import os
import re # Import regular expressions

dataset_name = 'imdb_reviews'  #Example: sharded csv structure.
download_dir = './tfds_downloads'

ds_info = tfds.builder(dataset_name).info

for split_name in ds_info.splits.keys():
    print("Processing split:", split_name)
    ds = tfds.load(dataset_name, split=split_name, download=True, data_dir = download_dir, as_supervised=True)

    split_path = os.path.join(ds_info.data_dir, split_name)

    #Finding sharded CSV files using a regex pattern
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(split_path):
       for file in files:
         if re.match(r".*\.csv-\d{5}-of-\d{5}$",file):
            print("Found a sharded CSV file:", os.path.join(root, file))
```

This example shows how to locate sharded CSV files by employing a regular expression. The pattern `.*\.csv-\d{5}-of-\d{5}$` matches file names that end with `.csv` followed by a shard ID in the format `-{5_digit_number}-of-{5_digit_number}`.  Note, the number of digits in the suffix of the shard may vary, this regex covers those with 5 digits.

In summary, while TFDS doesn’t provide direct download URLs, the approach focuses on forcing downloads using `tfds.load`, accessing the dataset information via the `data_dir`, and then traversing the resulting directory structure. It’s essential to recognize the diversity in data structures across different TFDS datasets, meaning a thorough directory traversal and file name inspection are often necessary to locate the relevant CSV files.

For further information and specific dataset details, it is recommended to consult the TensorFlow Datasets documentation, specifically looking into the specific dataset's documentation for data layout. The TensorFlow API documentation also provides details on `tf.data.Dataset` usage and manipulation, which can be useful when extracting data records after having located and accessed the CSV files. Furthermore, examining the source code of the relevant dataset builders within the TensorFlow Datasets library can often provide insights into how datasets are constructed and stored. While not a direct path to the download URL, this understanding helps in identifying how and where the data is stored locally once downloaded using the `download=True` parameter of the `tfds.load` function. This approach provides a robust method for accessing raw CSV files within TFDS.
