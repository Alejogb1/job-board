TensorFlow installation failures often stem from unmet dependency requirements, particularly concerning the underlying CUDA toolkit and cuDNN library if you're targeting GPU acceleration.  In my experience troubleshooting installations across diverse Linux distributions, Windows environments, and even macOS systems, neglecting this foundational aspect is the single most common cause.  Correctly addressing these dependencies is paramount; the TensorFlow installer itself is generally robust, but it relies critically on a functional and compatible CUDA ecosystem.

**1. Comprehensive Explanation:**

TensorFlow, being a highly optimized library, leverages hardware acceleration where possible.  GPU acceleration significantly boosts performance, especially in deep learning tasks.  However, enabling this necessitates a compatible NVIDIA GPU, a correctly installed CUDA toolkit matching your GPU's compute capability, and the corresponding cuDNN library. These components work in a hierarchical manner: CUDA provides the low-level interface for programming NVIDIA GPUs, while cuDNN offers highly optimized routines for deep learning primitives, upon which TensorFlow builds.

If you're not aiming for GPU acceleration (CPU-only installation), the dependency requirements simplify considerably.  However, installation still hinges on several factors:  Python version compatibility (TensorFlow often requires specific Python versions, usually 3.7 or higher), appropriate system libraries (like BLAS, LAPACK), and the correct pip or conda package manager usage.  Furthermore, permission issues, especially on Linux systems, can silently prevent installation.  Incorrect environment configurations, where conflicting packages or incompatible versions interfere, are equally problematic.

Discrepancies between the TensorFlow version and the underlying Python environment—such as using a 64-bit Python interpreter with a 32-bit TensorFlow package—are another frequent source of failures.  Finally, network connectivity issues can impede the download of necessary packages during installation.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different installation approaches and potential troubleshooting steps.  Note that specific commands might need slight modifications depending on your operating system and package manager preferences.

**Example 1:  CPU-only installation using pip:**

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip  # Ensure pip is up-to-date
pip3 install tensorflow
```

*Commentary:* This is the simplest approach, suitable when GPU acceleration isn't required.  The `--upgrade pip` command ensures the package manager itself is current, preventing potential conflicts.  Using `pip3` explicitly targets the Python 3 interpreter.  Failure here likely indicates a broader issue with your Python environment or network connectivity.  Check your Python installation, verify internet access, and ensure you have sufficient disk space.

**Example 2: GPU installation using pip with CUDA and cuDNN (Linux):**

```bash
# Prerequisites (ensure these are correctly installed and configured)
# apt-get update
# apt-get install -y build-essential libcudart10-1 libcufft10-1 libcublas10-1 libcusolver10-1 libcurand10-1 libcusparse10-1
# Verify CUDA installation: nvcc --version

# Install TensorFlow with GPU support
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu
```

*Commentary:* This example targets a GPU installation on a Debian-based Linux system using `apt-get`.  Crucially, it underlines the *prerequisite* steps.  Before attempting TensorFlow installation, you must verify the availability and compatibility of CUDA and its dependent libraries.  The `nvcc --version` command verifies the CUDA compiler's installation.  Replacing `apt-get` with `yum` or `pacman` might be necessary for other Linux distributions.  If this fails, double-check CUDA version compatibility with your TensorFlow-gpu version and ensure your CUDA path is correctly set in your system environment variables.  Mismatched versions are a leading cause of failure.

**Example 3:  Conda environment creation and TensorFlow installation:**

```bash
conda create -n tf_env python=3.8  # Create a new conda environment
conda activate tf_env             # Activate the environment
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow  #Install TensorFlow within the environment
```

*Commentary:*  This approach uses conda, a powerful package and environment manager. Creating a dedicated environment (e.g., `tf_env`) isolates TensorFlow and its dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects.  Using `conda-forge` channel often provides more up-to-date and well-maintained packages.  Similar to previous examples, potential failures here often indicate broader issues:  a corrupted conda installation, network connectivity problems, or insufficient disk space.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official TensorFlow installation guide for your operating system.  Refer to the NVIDIA CUDA documentation for details on CUDA toolkit installation and configuration.  Examine the cuDNN documentation for information specific to that library.  Pay close attention to the compatibility matrices provided by NVIDIA and TensorFlow, ensuring that your chosen versions of CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorFlow are mutually compatible.  Finally, review your system's log files for error messages; these often provide crucial clues about the cause of installation failures.  Thoroughly reviewing these resources will significantly aid in resolving most TensorFlow installation problems.
