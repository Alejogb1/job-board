Calculating gradients with respect to trainable variables is fundamental to the training process in TensorFlow.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks for image recognition highlighted the critical importance of efficient gradient computation.  Directly calculating gradients using symbolic differentiation, while conceptually simple, can be computationally expensive for complex models.  TensorFlow's `tf.GradientTape` offers a significantly more efficient approach, especially beneficial for dynamic computation graphs.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow employs automatic differentiation to calculate gradients.  This avoids the manual derivation and implementation of gradient formulas, significantly simplifying the development process.  `tf.GradientTape` is the primary tool for this task.  It records operations performed within its context, allowing for subsequent gradient calculation.  The `watch` method explicitly specifies which variables should be tracked for gradient computation.  Crucially, this selective tracking optimizes memory usage, especially important when dealing with numerous variables.  After the forward pass, `gradient` method computes gradients with respect to the watched variables.

The gradient calculation process involves backpropagation.  During the forward pass, the tape records the computation graph.  The backward pass, initiated by calling `gradient`, traverses this graph in reverse, applying the chain rule to calculate gradients.  The resulting gradients represent how a small change in each trainable variable affects the final output.  This information is subsequently used in the optimization process to update the variables and minimize the loss function.  Understanding the relationship between the computation graph and gradient calculation is key to troubleshooting potential issues.  For instance, gradients might be `None` if variables are not properly watched or if the computation graph is improperly structured.  Incorrectly using `tf.function` can also hinder gradient tracking.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Linear Regression**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define trainable variables
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1]), name='weight')
b = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([1]), name='bias')

# Define the model
def model(x):
  return W * x + b

# Define the loss function
def loss_fn(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

# Sample data
x = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
y_true = tf.constant([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]])

# Gradient calculation
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  y_pred = model(x)
  loss = loss_fn(y_true, y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [W, b])

print("Gradients:", gradients)

# Gradient descent update (Illustrative)
learning_rate = 0.01
W.assign_sub(learning_rate * gradients[0])
b.assign_sub(learning_rate * gradients[1])
```

This example demonstrates the basic workflow. We define a simple linear model, a loss function (mean squared error), and then use `tf.GradientTape` to calculate gradients of the loss with respect to the weight and bias.  The final lines show a basic gradient descent update â€“  a crucial step omitted in many tutorials but essential to understanding the application of calculated gradients.  Observe the clear structure: model definition, loss definition, gradient computation, and finally, the update rule.  This modularity is crucial for debugging and scaling.

**Example 2:  Gradient Calculation with Persistent Tape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(2.0)
y = tf.Variable(3.0)

with tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as tape:
  tape.watch(x)
  tape.watch(y)
  z = x * y

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x) # Calculate gradient of z wrt x
dz_dy = tape.gradient(z, y) # Calculate gradient of z wrt y

print("dz/dx:", dz_dx)
print("dz/dy:", dz_dy)

del tape # Explicitly delete the tape to release resources.  Essential for large models.

```

This example highlights the `persistent=True` option. This allows the same tape to be used for multiple gradient calculations, useful when computing gradients of multiple outputs with respect to the same inputs, saving computational overhead.  However, remember to explicitly delete the tape afterward using `del tape` to free up memory, especially critical when dealing with complex models.  Failing to do so can lead to memory leaks.  I've experienced this firsthand while working on recurrent neural networks.


**Example 3:  Handling Nested Functions and Higher-Order Gradients**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def outer_function(x):
  def inner_function(y):
    return x * y**2

  return inner_function(2.0)

x = tf.Variable(1.0)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  result = outer_function(x)

gradient = tape.gradient(result, x)
print(f"Gradient of outer function wrt x: {gradient}")


with tf.GradientTape() as tape_h:
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    result = outer_function(x)
  gradient_first_order = tape.gradient(result,x)
  gradient_second_order = tape_h.gradient(gradient_first_order,x)

print(f"First order gradient: {gradient_first_order}, Second order gradient: {gradient_second_order}")
```


This illustrates how to handle nested functions. The gradient is correctly calculated even with function nesting.  Moreover, the second part demonstrates the calculation of second-order gradients using nested `tf.GradientTape` contexts.  This functionality is vital for advanced optimization techniques like Hessian-based methods, although computationally expensive.  I incorporated this in a research project involving Bayesian optimization of a generative adversarial network, which demanded higher-order gradient information for efficient exploration of the parameter space.  The explicit creation and deletion of tape instances are crucial for memory management, especially when dealing with computationally demanding procedures.
