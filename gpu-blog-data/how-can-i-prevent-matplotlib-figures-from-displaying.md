The persistence of matplotlib figures in Jupyter Notebooks despite explicit calls to `plt.close()` often stems from a misunderstanding of how Jupyter's interaction with the IPython backend affects figure management.  My experience debugging visualization pipelines in large-scale data analysis projects has shown that the issue isn't always a simple matter of a single `plt.close()` call being insufficient; rather, it's frequently related to the lifecycle of the figure object itself and the Jupyter display mechanisms.  The key is to understand that `plt.close()` only closes a specific figure *handle*, and doesn't necessarily prevent Jupyter from displaying previously rendered content associated with that handle.


**1. Understanding the Display Mechanism:**

Jupyter Notebooks use IPython's display system, which actively renders output from code cells.  When matplotlib generates a figure, it doesn't automatically display; instead, it creates a figure object within the IPython environment.  `plt.show()` explicitly triggers the display of this object, while `plt.close()` removes the figure object from the matplotlib figure manager.  However, if the figure was already displayed prior to the `plt.close()` call, Jupyter's rendering mechanism may have already captured a representation of it, leading to its persistence even after the figure object's removal. This is particularly true when using inline backends.  This isn't a bug; it's a consequence of how the display system works.  The solution lies in managing the figure's display before it gets captured by Jupyter.

**2. Strategies for Preventing Display:**

The most reliable way to prevent unwanted figure display is to avoid showing the figure in the first place.  Directly calling `plt.show()` should be avoided unless the intent is explicit visualization in the notebook. Instead, consider these methods:


* **Saving Figures Directly:** If the goal is to generate figures for later use,  save the figure to a file immediately after creation, bypassing the need for display entirely. This is often the most efficient solution.

* **Using `io.BytesIO` for In-Memory Figures:** For scenarios where you need to manipulate the figure without displaying it on screen, and need to save it to memory only, leverage `io.BytesIO` to create an in-memory buffer.  This allows processing before saving it to disk, as seen in example 3.

* **Controlling the Backend:**  Although less common for direct Jupyter usage, switching backends (e.g., to a non-interactive backend like Agg) can eliminate the display entirely. This requires adjusting matplotlib configuration settings, which might not be the most user-friendly solution for quick adjustments.


**3. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Saving the Figure Directly**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.figure()  # Create a new figure
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.savefig("my_figure.png") #Save the figure directly to a file.
plt.close() #No display, even without plt.show().
```

This example demonstrates the most direct method. The figure is saved to a PNG file;  `plt.close()` is used for good housekeeping, releasing the memory occupied by the figure object, but it's not critical in preventing the display in this instance.


**Example 2:  Illustrating the Problem and a Partial Solution**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.cos(x)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show() #This displays the figure.
plt.close() #The figure is closed, but Jupyter might already have displayed it.
```

This example showcases the problem.  `plt.show()` forces the display before `plt.close()` is called. Even though the figure is subsequently closed, Jupyter might retain the image.  There is no direct fix without avoiding `plt.show()`, as discussed before.


**Example 3: Using `io.BytesIO` for In-Memory Manipulation**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import io

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.exp(-x)

img_buffer = io.BytesIO() #Creates an in-memory byte stream.
plt.figure()
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.savefig(img_buffer, format='png') #Saves to buffer
img_buffer.seek(0) #Rewinds the buffer
plt.close()
# Now you can process the image data from img_buffer, for instance using PIL, without displaying it.

#Example of further processing:
from PIL import Image
img = Image.open(img_buffer)
#Further processing of the image (resizing, cropping, etc.) would go here.
img.save("processed_image.png")
```

This example highlights leveraging `io.BytesIO` for in-memory figure handling. The figure is never directly displayed; itâ€™s saved to an in-memory buffer, processed if needed, and then saved to disk, preventing accidental display in Jupyter.  This is particularly useful in more complex pipelines where you process figures programmatically without needing immediate visual inspection.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

Matplotlib documentation,  IPython documentation,  the official Jupyter documentation, and a comprehensive guide on Python data visualization. These resources contain detailed explanations of plotting, backend management, and IPython interaction with plotting libraries.  Consulting these resources would enhance your understanding of the underlying mechanisms.  Familiarizing yourself with the `matplotlib.backends` module will further illuminate backend options.  Learning about image processing libraries, like PIL (Pillow), will be beneficial if you plan to manipulate images saved in memory using methods like `io.BytesIO`.
