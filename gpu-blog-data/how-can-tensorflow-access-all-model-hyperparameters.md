TensorFlow's hyperparameter access isn't centralized in a single, readily accessible attribute.  My experience developing and deploying large-scale TensorFlow models across diverse hardware platforms has shown that accessing hyperparameters requires a multifaceted approach, dependent heavily on how the model and its training process were defined.  There is no universal `model.hyperparameters` attribute. Instead, the retrieval strategy hinges on understanding the model's construction and training loop.

1. **Direct Access via the Model Definition:** If you've meticulously defined your model using the `tf.keras.Sequential` or `tf.keras.Model` APIs, and you've passed hyperparameters directly as arguments to the model's constructor or layer constructors, those hyperparameters remain accessible within the model's object structure.  However, this requires disciplined coding practices; you'll need to explicitly retain these values as attributes of your model class.

   Consider the following example:

   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf

   class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
       def __init__(self, learning_rate, hidden_units, activation='relu', **kwargs):
           super(MyModel, self).__init__(**kwargs)
           self.learning_rate = learning_rate
           self.hidden_units = hidden_units
           self.activation = activation
           self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(hidden_units, activation=activation)
           self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)

       def call(self, inputs):
           x = self.dense1(inputs)
           return self.dense2(x)

   model = MyModel(learning_rate=0.01, hidden_units=64)

   print(f"Learning rate: {model.learning_rate}")
   print(f"Hidden units: {model.hidden_units}")
   print(f"Activation: {model.activation}")
   ```

   This code explicitly stores the `learning_rate`, `hidden_units`, and `activation` as attributes of the `MyModel` class.  Retrieving them is straightforward.  This method provides the most direct and reliable access, but demands careful attention during model development.  Note that this approach does not cover hyperparameters used within custom training loops.


2. **Indirect Access via the Training Loop and Callbacks:** In scenarios where hyperparameters influence the training process but aren't directly part of the model's structure – such as batch size, epochs, or optimizer parameters – you must access them from where they were defined.  This typically means the training loop itself or associated callbacks.

   For example:

   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf

   model = tf.keras.Sequential([
       tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
       tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
   ])

   optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)  #Hyperparameter here
   epochs = 100 #Hyperparameter here
   batch_size = 32 #Hyperparameter here

   #Access within the training loop:
   for epoch in range(epochs):
       # Accessing hyperparameters during training
       print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}/{epochs}, Learning rate: {optimizer.learning_rate.numpy()}, Batch Size: {batch_size}")
       # ... Training code ...

   ```

   Here, the `learning_rate`, `epochs`, and `batch_size` are defined outside the model, but accessed directly within the training loop.  This approach is crucial when dealing with hyperparameter tuning or optimization algorithms where parameters might dynamically change during training.


3. **Leveraging Custom Callbacks:** For more sophisticated control and logging, custom callbacks are invaluable. They permit intercepting events during training and logging hyperparameter values alongside metrics.

   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf

   class HyperparameterLogger(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
       def __init__(self, hyperparameters):
           super(HyperparameterLogger, self).__init__()
           self.hyperparameters = hyperparameters

       def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs=None):
           print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}: Hyperparameters: {self.hyperparameters}")


   model = tf.keras.Sequential([
       tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
       tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
   ])

   optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
   hyperparams = {'learning_rate': optimizer.learning_rate.numpy(), 'epochs': 100, 'batch_size': 32}

   model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')
   model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, callbacks=[HyperparameterLogger(hyperparams)])
   ```

   This example showcases a custom callback that logs hyperparameters at the beginning of each epoch. This offers a structured and organized way to track hyperparameters throughout the entire training process, particularly useful for reproducibility and analysis. This method provides a clear separation of concerns, especially beneficial in collaborative projects or when dealing with complex training pipelines.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* Official TensorFlow documentation on Keras models and training.
* TensorFlow's guide on custom training loops and callbacks.
*  Textbooks and online courses on deep learning, focusing on TensorFlow's practical applications. These often cover best practices for organizing hyperparameters.
* Advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on model building and training intricacies.  These often highlight the importance of structured hyperparameter management.


In summary, accessing TensorFlow model hyperparameters necessitates a clear understanding of your model's architecture and training process. There's no single solution; the best approach depends on where and how these hyperparameters were initially defined and utilized.  My years of experience have shown that consistent, well-documented coding practices from the outset are crucial for effective hyperparameter management in TensorFlow.  The techniques outlined above – direct access, inspection within the training loop, and utilization of custom callbacks – provide a comprehensive toolkit for managing and accessing these critical parameters throughout the model lifecycle.
