The 64KB limitation on CUDA memory transfers, when not handled correctly, stems from the underlying hardware architecture and how the CPU and GPU communicate. Specifically, transfers larger than this size, when utilizing certain functions without proper staging or asynchronous operations, can lead to blocking behavior due to the limited capacity of the PCI Express (PCIe) transfer buffers associated with host-to-device (and device-to-host) communication.

To elaborate, the PCIe bus acts as a critical pipeline for data exchange between the CPU's system memory and the GPU's dedicated device memory. Direct, synchronous transfers, particularly those exceeding 64KB, often overwhelm the available PCIe buffers, forcing the CPU to pause its execution and wait until the GPU has fully ingested the data. This blocking behavior results in substantial performance penalties. The 64KB threshold is not an arbitrary limit imposed by CUDA itself; rather, it represents the typical size of a single page in the PCIe system. When a transfer exceeds this page size, the system often has to perform additional overhead, contributing to the blocking effect.

The root problem lies in the fact that the default CUDA memory copy functions like `cudaMemcpy()` are inherently synchronous. When you call this function, the CPU thread which invoked it will be blocked until the entire memory transfer, regardless of size, has completed on the GPU. For transfers larger than the available buffer, this becomes especially pronounced, as the system spends a significant duration waiting for the data to traverse the bus. Smaller transfers, within the 64KB window, are more likely to fit within the bus's buffers. Therefore, they can happen relatively quickly, appearing to be non-blocking. This behavior however, still incurs a potential performance bottleneck.

Fortunately, CUDA provides multiple methods to mitigate this blocking behavior. Asynchronous memory transfers, achieved with functions like `cudaMemcpyAsync()`, combined with the use of pinned (or page-locked) host memory, offer substantial improvements. Pinned memory allows the host to interact directly with the DMA (Direct Memory Access) engine on the PCIe bus, facilitating faster and more efficient data movement. When used in conjunction with streams, it enables concurrent data transfers and computation on the GPU, thereby hiding the transfer latency. The use of `cudaMemcpy2D()` or `cudaMemcpy3D()` with parameters specifying pitches enables even more flexible transfer of data beyond contiguous chunks.

The correct way to handle larger data transfers isn’t about avoiding transfers larger than 64KB, but rather, changing how they're handled. It's about avoiding direct, synchronous transfers. To illustrate further, consider the following three code snippets, each demonstrating different aspects of this limitation and its mitigation:

**Code Example 1: Synchronous Blocking Transfer (Illustrates the problem)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

void checkCudaError(cudaError_t error) {
    if (error != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "CUDA error: " << cudaGetErrorString(error) << std::endl;
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}

int main() {
    const size_t size = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB
    float* host_data = new float[size];
    float* device_data;
    
    checkCudaError(cudaMalloc((void**)&device_data, size * sizeof(float)));

    // Initialize host data (arbitrary initialization).
    for(size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        host_data[i] = static_cast<float>(i);
    }
    
    // Synchronous copy - Will likely block for larger transfers
    cudaError_t error = cudaMemcpy(device_data, host_data, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    checkCudaError(error);

    std::cout << "Copy Complete (Likely Blocked CPU During Copy)" << std::endl;

    checkCudaError(cudaFree(device_data));
    delete[] host_data;
    return 0;
}
```

This code initializes host memory, allocates device memory, and then performs a large synchronous copy (1MB in this example) from host to device using `cudaMemcpy()`. The execution time will reflect the blocked state of the CPU thread during the transfer operation. The program will only proceed after all data is transferred. In a larger application with a high rate of data transfer, this will cause significant performance bottlenecks.  The program's progress will appear to halt until `cudaMemcpy` returns.

**Code Example 2: Asynchronous Transfer with Pinned Memory (Demonstrates a better method)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

void checkCudaError(cudaError_t error) {
    if (error != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "CUDA error: " << cudaGetErrorString(error) << std::endl;
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}

int main() {
    const size_t size = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB
    float* host_data;
    float* device_data;
    
    // Allocate pinned host memory
    checkCudaError(cudaMallocHost((void**)&host_data, size * sizeof(float)));

    checkCudaError(cudaMalloc((void**)&device_data, size * sizeof(float)));

    // Initialize host data
    for(size_t i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
        host_data[i] = static_cast<float>(i);
    }
    
    // Create CUDA Stream
    cudaStream_t stream;
    checkCudaError(cudaStreamCreate(&stream));

    // Asynchronous copy
    checkCudaError(cudaMemcpyAsync(device_data, host_data, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream));

    // Perform some other work (CPU Task)
    std::cout << "Transfer Started (CPU Can Perform other Tasks)" << std::endl;
    
    // Wait for completion of the transfer
    checkCudaError(cudaStreamSynchronize(stream));
    std::cout << "Copy Complete" << std::endl;

    // Free memory and stream
    checkCudaError(cudaStreamDestroy(stream));
    checkCudaError(cudaFree(device_data));
    checkCudaError(cudaFreeHost(host_data));
    return 0;
}
```

Here, instead of using regular allocated memory, pinned host memory is used via `cudaMallocHost()`. This type of memory allocation allows for direct memory access via the PCIe bus. The transfer is performed using `cudaMemcpyAsync()`, which does not block the CPU. A stream object, `stream`, is used to manage asynchronous operations. While the transfer occurs, the CPU can perform other work until `cudaStreamSynchronize()` is called to ensure the transfer has completed. Note that the CPU will block at the `cudaStreamSynchronize` call, but not during the asynchronous `memcpy`. The combination of pinned memory and asynchronous transfer is critical for achieving better performance when large transfers are involved.

**Code Example 3: Using cudaMemcpy2D with Pinned Memory (Demonstrates more flexible transfer)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

void checkCudaError(cudaError_t error) {
    if (error != cudaSuccess) {
        std::cerr << "CUDA error: " << cudaGetErrorString(error) << std::endl;
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
}

int main() {
    const size_t width = 1024;
    const size_t height = 1024;
    const size_t pitch = width * sizeof(float);

    float* host_data;
    float* device_data;

    checkCudaError(cudaMallocHost((void**)&host_data, pitch * height));

    checkCudaError(cudaMalloc((void**)&device_data, pitch * height));

    for (size_t y = 0; y < height; ++y) {
      for (size_t x = 0; x < width; ++x) {
        host_data[y * width + x] = static_cast<float>(y * width + x);
      }
    }

    // Create CUDA Stream
    cudaStream_t stream;
    checkCudaError(cudaStreamCreate(&stream));

    // Asynchronous 2D copy with pitch
    checkCudaError(cudaMemcpy2DAsync(device_data, pitch, host_data, pitch, pitch, height, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream));

    // Perform other operations
    std::cout << "Transfer started (can compute on CPU here)" << std::endl;

    checkCudaError(cudaStreamSynchronize(stream));
    std::cout << "Copy complete" << std::endl;
    

    checkCudaError(cudaStreamDestroy(stream));
    checkCudaError(cudaFree(device_data));
    checkCudaError(cudaFreeHost(host_data));
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, data is copied in a 2D pattern using `cudaMemcpy2DAsync()`, where ‘pitch’ denotes the memory alignment of each row. This technique extends the principle demonstrated previously, now handling multi-dimensional data using aligned memory which is often required for efficient GPU processing.  This is also done with a CUDA stream. It shows that  CUDA offers memory transfer functionality beyond just copying contiguous 1D arrays, and further helps mitigate potential bottlenecks. This example is particularly useful in scenarios where the data has some structure rather than existing as a simple contiguous block.

To deepen the understanding of these concepts, further investigation should be directed towards the following resource areas:
* **NVIDIA CUDA Documentation:**  The official documentation offers comprehensive explanations and guidance on all CUDA functions, along with best practices for achieving optimal performance. Specifically, sections concerning memory management and asynchronous operations will be relevant.
* **CUDA Samples:** The CUDA Toolkit contains many sample projects, including several that thoroughly demonstrate efficient memory transfer mechanisms. Reviewing these codes can solidify understanding and provide valuable, practical examples.
* **Advanced CUDA Programming books:** Numerous textbooks delve into the intricacies of CUDA programming, often including detailed explanations of the underlying hardware architecture, particularly memory access patterns and the subtleties of the PCIe bus communication.

Through understanding the root causes of blocking, and through appropriate use of asynchronous transfers, pinned memory, and other memory management techniques, one can overcome the apparent limitations of memory transfer sizes and harness the full power of GPU acceleration. The critical point is to always avoid synchronous blocking calls to the `memcpy` function when transferring amounts of memory that are large, and use streams with pinned memory for efficient GPU programming.
