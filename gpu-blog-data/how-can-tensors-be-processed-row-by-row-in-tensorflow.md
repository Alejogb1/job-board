TensorFlow's inherent parallelization capabilities often overshadow the need for explicit row-wise processing.  However, scenarios exist where iterating through tensor rows sequentially is beneficial, particularly for operations incompatible with TensorFlow's optimized matrix computations or when dealing with stateful operations that depend on previous row calculations.  My experience with large-scale time-series analysis frequently demanded this approach, especially when handling irregularly sampled data which resisted straightforward batch processing.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Row-by-row tensor processing in TensorFlow primarily leverages Python's iteration constructs in conjunction with TensorFlow's tensor slicing capabilities.  The core concept is to extract individual rows (or, more generally, slices along a specific axis) from a tensor within a loop, process them using TensorFlow operations (or other Python functions), and potentially accumulate the results into a new tensor.  Directly applying TensorFlow's vectorized operations to the entire tensor remains more efficient whenever possible; this row-wise approach should be considered a strategy for handling exceptions or specific algorithmic requirements, not a default approach.

Efficient row-wise processing hinges on minimizing data transfer overhead between Python and the TensorFlow graph.  Employing `tf.Tensor.numpy()` to convert a tensor slice to a NumPy array within the loop, while seemingly simple, incurs significant performance penalties for large tensors.  Instead, itâ€™s generally preferable to remain within the TensorFlow graph as much as possible, leveraging TensorFlow operations for processing individual row slices.

The choice between using `tf.while_loop` for dynamic loop lengths and a standard Python `for` loop depends on context.  A `for` loop is often sufficient for known tensor dimensions, offering simpler syntax.  `tf.while_loop` is essential when the number of iterations is determined dynamically during execution, maintaining TensorFlow's computational graph optimization potential.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Row-wise summation using `tf.while_loop` (dynamic loop length):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def row_wise_sum(tensor, shape):
  """Calculates the sum of each row in a tensor using tf.while_loop.

  Args:
    tensor: Input tensor.
    shape: Shape of the input tensor.  Used to dynamically determine loop iterations.

  Returns:
    Tensor containing the sum of each row.
  """
  i = tf.constant(0)
  sums = tf.zeros([shape[0], 1], dtype=tensor.dtype) # Initialize sum tensor

  def condition(i, sums):
    return tf.less(i, shape[0])

  def body(i, sums):
    row = tf.gather(tensor, i)  # Efficiently extract the i-th row
    row_sum = tf.reduce_sum(row)
    sums = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update(sums, [[i]], [[row_sum]])
    return tf.add(i, 1), sums

  _, final_sums = tf.while_loop(condition, body, [i, sums])
  return final_sums

# Example Usage
tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
shape = tf.shape(tensor)
result = row_wise_sum(tensor, shape)
print(result) # Output: [[ 6], [15], [24]]
```

This example demonstrates a robust approach for tensors of unknown shape at compile time. The `tf.while_loop` ensures the code executes correctly for different input sizes.  `tf.gather` provides efficient row extraction within the TensorFlow graph. `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update` is used for efficient accumulation of results avoiding costly tensor concatenation within the loop.

**Example 2:  Row-wise custom operation using a `for` loop (static loop length):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def row_wise_custom_op(tensor):
  """Applies a custom operation to each row of a tensor.

  Args:
    tensor: Input tensor.  Shape must be known at compile time.

  Returns:
    Tensor with custom operation applied row-wise.
  """
  rows = tf.shape(tensor)[0]
  result = tf.TensorArray(dtype=tensor.dtype, size=rows, dynamic_size=False)

  for i in range(rows):
    row = tensor[i, :] # Simple slicing
    processed_row = tf.math.sqrt(tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(row))) # Example custom op: L2 norm
    result = result.write(i, processed_row)

  return result.stack()

# Example usage
tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
result = row_wise_custom_op(tensor)
print(result) # Output: [[2.236...] [5.0] [7.81...] ]

```

This exemplifies processing with a known number of rows. Direct slicing is used for simplicity. The `tf.TensorArray` efficiently accumulates results without repeated tensor concatenation, a performance bottleneck in iterative approaches.  The example demonstrates a custom operation (L2 norm calculation), easily replaceable with any other operation applicable to a single row.


**Example 3: Row-wise processing with external Python function (limited applicability):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def external_row_processor(row):
    """Processes a single row using a NumPy function. (Avoid unless necessary)."""
    return np.sum(row) * 2

def row_wise_external_op(tensor):
  """Applies an external function to each row (less efficient)."""
  result = []
  for row in tf.unstack(tensor):
    result.append(external_row_processor(row.numpy())) # NumPy conversion - performance impact
  return tf.constant(result)

tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
result = row_wise_external_op(tensor)
print(result)
```

This approach should be used sparingly.  The constant conversion to NumPy arrays significantly impacts performance, especially for large tensors. It's included to highlight when such a method might be unavoidable (if, for instance, an external library is required that lacks TensorFlow integration).


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further exploration, I would suggest reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation, focusing on sections detailing `tf.while_loop`, tensor slicing, and efficient tensor manipulation techniques.  A deep understanding of TensorFlow's execution model and graph optimization will help in designing efficient row-wise processing strategies.  Furthermore, exploring resources on numerical linear algebra and performance optimization within TensorFlow will prove invaluable for handling large-scale tensor computations.  Consider exploring advanced topics such as XLA compilation for potential performance improvements in computationally intensive row-wise operations.
