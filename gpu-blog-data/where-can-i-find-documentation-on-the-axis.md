The `axis` parameter in PyTorch's `torch.sum` function, unlike its NumPy counterpart, doesn't directly correspond to a single, readily accessible documentation section.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues within large-scale deep learning projects highlights the need to approach this understanding through a combination of inferential analysis based on its behavior and cross-referencing with related PyTorch functions operating on tensor dimensions.  Direct documentation is often implicit, relying on a conceptual grasp of tensor operations rather than explicit parameter definitions.

**1.  Explanation:**

The `axis` argument in `torch.sum` isn't a standalone parameter; its functionality is derived from how PyTorch handles tensor dimensions and reduction operations.  PyTorch tensors, fundamentally, are multi-dimensional arrays.  The `sum` function, in essence, reduces the dimensionality of a tensor by summing along specified axes.  The absence of explicit documentation stems from this implicit linkage to broader tensor manipulation concepts.  Understanding tensor dimensions and broadcasting is key.

Unlike NumPy, which uses negative indexing for axes counting from the end, PyTorch's `axis` argument works only with positive indices, representing the dimension along which the summation is performed.  If the `axis` argument is omitted, PyTorch performs a sum across *all* dimensions, effectively reducing the tensor to a scalar value.

Consider a 3D tensor with dimensions (x, y, z). Specifying `axis=0` would sum along the x-dimension, resulting in a (y, z) tensor. Similarly, `axis=1` sums along the y-dimension, producing a (x, z) tensor, and `axis=2` sums along the z-dimension, resulting in a (x, y) tensor. Supplying multiple axes as a tuple, such as `axis=(0,1)`, performs summation across both specified axes sequentially. The order of axes in the tuple matters â€“ PyTorch sums along the first axis, then the second, relative to the resulting tensor after the first summation.  This sequential reduction is crucial to remember.  Ignoring this leads to common misunderstandings and debugging headaches.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Summation**

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.tensor([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
print(f"Original tensor:\n{tensor}")
sum_all = torch.sum(tensor)
print(f"Sum across all dimensions: {sum_all}") # Output: 36

sum_axis0 = torch.sum(tensor, axis=0)
print(f"Sum along axis 0:\n{sum_axis0}")  # Output: tensor([[ 6,  8], [10, 12]])

sum_axis1 = torch.sum(tensor, axis=1)
print(f"Sum along axis 1:\n{sum_axis1}") # Output: tensor([[ 6, 10], [18, 22]])

sum_axis2 = torch.sum(tensor, axis=2)
print(f"Sum along axis 2:\n{sum_axis2}")  # Output: tensor([[ 3,  7], [13, 15]])

sum_axis01 = torch.sum(tensor, axis=(0,1))
print(f"Sum along axes 0 and 1:\n{sum_axis01}") # Output: tensor([16, 22])


```

This example demonstrates the fundamental usage of `axis`. Observe how different `axis` values produce different summation results, highlighting the sequential reduction when using tuples.


**Example 2:  Handling Higher-Dimensional Tensors**

```python
import torch

tensor_4d = torch.randn(2, 3, 4, 5)
sum_axis_2_4d = torch.sum(tensor_4d, axis=2) #sums along dimension of size 4
print(f"Shape after summing along axis 2: {sum_axis_2_4d.shape}") # Output: torch.Size([2, 3, 5])
sum_axis_0_1_4d = torch.sum(tensor_4d, axis=(0,1)) #sums along dimensions of size 2 and 3
print(f"Shape after summing along axes 0 and 1: {sum_axis_0_1_4d.shape}") # Output: torch.Size([4, 5])
```

This illustrates the scalability of `axis` to higher-dimensional tensors.  Understanding the dimension reduction is crucial for efficient code.


**Example 3:  Combining `axis` with `keepdim`**

```python
import torch

tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
sum_axis_0_keepdim = torch.sum(tensor, axis=0, keepdim=True)
print(f"Sum along axis 0, keepdim=True:\n{sum_axis_0_keepdim}") # Output: tensor([[4, 6]])
sum_axis_1_keepdim = torch.sum(tensor, axis=1, keepdim=True)
print(f"Sum along axis 1, keepdim=True:\n{sum_axis_1_keepdim}") # Output: tensor([[3], [7]])

```
The `keepdim=True` argument preserves the dimensionality of the original tensor along the summed axis.  This is particularly useful for broadcasting operations that require consistent tensor shapes during subsequent calculations.  The lack of explicit documentation for `axis` further stresses the importance of exploring related parameters like `keepdim` to achieve the desired functionality.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend exploring the official PyTorch documentation on tensor manipulation, focusing on sections detailing tensor operations, broadcasting, and reduction functions.  Thoroughly examine examples related to `torch.sum`, `torch.mean`, `torch.prod`, and other similar functions to consolidate your understanding of the underlying principles governing dimension reduction in PyTorch.  Supplement this with tutorials focused on PyTorch's tensor mechanics, emphasizing practical applications and common pitfalls.  Furthermore, reviewing the source code of PyTorch (available on GitHub) for the implementation of `torch.sum` can offer valuable insight. These resources offer a far more effective pathway to understanding the `axis` parameter's behavior than searching for its explicit documentation, as such direct documentation is often absent.  This iterative approach reflects the reality of working with large-scale, evolving libraries.
