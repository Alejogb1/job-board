The most common reason fetched data doesn't display in a React Native application stems from a mismatch between the asynchronous nature of data fetching and the synchronous rendering behavior of React components.  The component renders before the data arrives, leading to an empty or null state.  This issue manifests in various ways, often masked by seemingly unrelated problems, such as incorrect state management or improper lifecycle method usage.  I've encountered this numerous times over my years building React Native applications, and have developed a systematic approach to debugging this precise problem.

**1. Clear Explanation**

React Native, like React itself, is declarative.  This means you describe *what* the UI should look like, not *how* to build it.  The framework takes your description and efficiently updates the view.  Data fetching, however, is inherently asynchronous.  Network requests take time; the data isn't instantaneously available.  If your component attempts to render before the fetch completes, it renders with the initial, likely undefined, state of the data variable.

The solution lies in using asynchronous programming patterns to handle the data lifecycle.  Effectively, this means waiting for the fetch to resolve before updating the component's state with the fetched data. This generally involves utilizing either `async/await` or promises, combined with state management techniques.  Failing to do so will always result in the lack of displayed data, even if the fetch itself is successful (verifiable via network tools such as the browser's developer console or similar debugging tools).  Furthermore, improper error handling during the fetch process can lead to silent failures, further compounding the problem, obscuring the actual reason for the missing data.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Using `async/await` and useState**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        const jsonData = await response.json();
        setData(jsonData);
      } catch (error) {
        setError(error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  if (loading) {
    return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <Text>Error: {error.message}</Text>;
  }

  if (data) {
    return (
      <View>
        {/* Display data here */}
        <Text>{JSON.stringify(data)}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }

  return <Text>No data</Text>; //Should ideally never reach here if loading and error states are handled properly
};

export default MyComponent;
```

**Commentary:** This example uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch data only once after the component mounts (the empty dependency array `[]`). The `async/await` syntax makes the code cleaner and easier to read.  Crucially, it includes error handling and a loading state, providing feedback to the user and preventing crashes.  The conditional rendering ensures that appropriate messages are displayed during loading, error, or absence of data.  Proper state management using `useState` updates the UI reactively whenever the data, error, or loading states change.


**Example 2: Using Promises and useState**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => {
        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        return response.json();
      })
      .then(jsonData => setData(jsonData))
      .catch(error => setError(error));
  }, []);

  if (data) {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{JSON.stringify(data)}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }

  if(error){
    return <Text>Error: {error.message}</Text>;
  }

  return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

**Commentary:** This alternative uses the `.then()` and `.catch()` methods of Promises.  While functionally similar to the `async/await` example, the structure might feel less intuitive for developers unfamiliar with promise chaining.  Note the absence of an explicit loading state; the "Loading..." message serves as a placeholder until data is available.  This approach, while functional, lacks the explicit loading state, which is generally preferred for a better user experience.


**Example 3:  Context API for Data Management (Illustrative Snippet)**

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const DataContext = createContext();

const DataProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    //Fetch data here, similar to previous examples.  Handle loading and error states.
    //setData(...)
  }, []);
  return (
    <DataContext.Provider value={data}>{children}</DataContext.Provider>
  );
};

const MyComponent = () => {
  const data = useContext(DataContext);
  if(data){
    return <Text>{JSON.stringify(data)}</Text>
  }
  return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
};

export default MyComponent;
```


**Commentary:** This demonstrates a simplified application of the Context API for data management.  The `DataProvider` fetches data and makes it available to all components wrapped within it.  This is particularly useful for sharing data across multiple components without prop drilling.  The full implementation would require the addition of error handling and a loading state within the `DataProvider`, akin to the previous examples.  This method offers a scalable solution for managing global application state, but requires a careful understanding of its implications for performance and complexity.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official React documentation;  A comprehensive React Native textbook;  Articles on asynchronous programming in JavaScript;  Documentation on React Native's lifecycle methods;  Guides on effective state management in React Native.  Thoroughly understanding asynchronous programming concepts and React's state management mechanisms are paramount to mastering data fetching in React Native.  Practicing these concepts through several small projects is highly recommended.  Debugging tools built into the React Native ecosystem will also prove invaluable for identifying issues and tracking data flow.
