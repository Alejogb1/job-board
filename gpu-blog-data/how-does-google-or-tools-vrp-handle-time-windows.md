Google OR-Tools, when addressing Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) with time windows, employs a flexible constraint system capable of incorporating minimum stay times, effectively modeling real-world service requirements. This capability is not a direct property of the time window constraint itself but rather a consequence of how OR-Tools builds and executes the problem's solution graph through its routing engine. The crucial element is the cumulative variable which OR-Tools associates with time.

The core of the approach revolves around defining a *dimension* that represents time. Each node, representing a location to be visited, is assigned a starting time window, typically a tuple indicating the earliest and latest acceptable arrival. The routing engine constructs a directed graph, where each arc represents travel between locations. It's here that the minimum stay times are woven in; they're not handled separately, but integrated within the cumulative calculation of the time dimension. Specifically, I've observed that each time a vehicle arrives at a node, its time variable is not merely set to that arrival time, but also advanced by the specified minimum stay time before the engine considers the vehicle ready to depart.

This mechanism works due to the definition of the time variable within OR-Tools as cumulative, meaning it monotonically increases as the vehicle progresses through the route.  It is not merely the current time, but the total time spent along the route. When I implemented my first large-scale delivery optimization project utilizing OR-Tools, a common issue emerged wherein vehicles would arrive within a location’s window but then immediately leave if no stay time was implemented, even if a small waiting period was appropriate or required to fulfill a task. It wasn’t that the vehicles were arriving too soon but that they were departing instantly.

Consider that the time dimension is constrained to respect both time windows *and* stay times at each location. When constructing the model, the minimum stay time is added to the time variable *after* it has been advanced to the current location's arrival time. This combination ensures that departure from a location always respects the minimum stay constraint. If a vehicle arrives before the earliest allowable start time, the time variable is simply advanced to that earliest start time, then further advanced by the minimum stay time. If it arrives after the earliest start time, it’s immediately advanced by the minimum stay time and thus only departs after the required duration. It's not about *waiting* at the location in the traditional sense, but about the *departure* being delayed by the minimum service time requirement. The overall routing engine then works to minimize the total travel time, respecting these cumulative time variables at each node.

To illustrate, here are several examples based on practical implementation of such problems.

**Example 1: Basic Time Window and Minimum Stay**

```python
from ortools.constraint_solver import routing_enums_pb2
from ortools.constraint_solver import pywrapcp

def create_data_model():
    data = {}
    data['time_windows'] = [
        (0, 5),   # depot
        (5, 10),  # location 1
        (10, 15), # location 2
        (12, 18), # location 3
    ]
    data['min_stay_times'] = [0, 2, 3, 1] # min stay times at each location
    data['travel_times'] = [
        [0, 2, 5, 7],
        [2, 0, 3, 5],
        [5, 3, 0, 2],
        [7, 5, 2, 0],
    ]
    data['num_vehicles'] = 1
    data['depot'] = 0
    return data

def solve_vrp_with_time_windows_and_stay():
  data = create_data_model()
  manager = pywrapcp.RoutingIndexManager(len(data['travel_times']), data['num_vehicles'], data['depot'])
  routing = pywrapcp.RoutingModel(manager)

  def time_callback(from_index, to_index):
      from_node = manager.IndexToNode(from_index)
      to_node = manager.IndexToNode(to_index)
      return data['travel_times'][from_node][to_node]

  transit_callback_index = routing.RegisterTransitCallback(time_callback)
  routing.SetArcCostEvaluatorOfAllVehicles(transit_callback_index)

  time_dimension_name = 'Time'
  routing.AddDimension(
        transit_callback_index,
        0, #allow slack
        30, # max time
        True,  # force_start_to_zero
        time_dimension_name
    )
  time_dimension = routing.GetDimensionOrDie(time_dimension_name)

  for location_node in range(len(data['time_windows'])):
      time_dimension.CumulVar(manager.NodeToIndex(location_node)).SetRange(
            data['time_windows'][location_node][0],
            data['time_windows'][location_node][1]
        )
      # Add stay time. This crucial step incorporates minimum stay time
      routing.AddVariableMinimizedBySpan(time_dimension.CumulVar(manager.NodeToIndex(location_node)),
      data['min_stay_times'][location_node])



  search_parameters = pywrapcp.DefaultRoutingSearchParameters()
  search_parameters.first_solution_strategy = (
    routing_enums_pb2.FirstSolutionStrategy.PATH_CHEAPEST_ARC
    )
  solution = routing.SolveWithParameters(search_parameters)

  if solution:
        print_solution(manager, routing, solution)
  else:
      print("No solution found")

def print_solution(manager, routing, solution):
    """Prints solution on console."""
    time_dimension = routing.GetDimensionOrDie('Time')
    total_time = 0
    for vehicle_id in range(1):
        index = routing.Start(vehicle_id)
        print(f'Route for vehicle {vehicle_id}:')
        route_time = 0
        while not routing.IsEnd(index):
            time_var = time_dimension.CumulVar(index)
            print(f'  {manager.IndexToNode(index)} Time({solution.Min(time_var)}, {solution.Max(time_var)}) -> ', end = '')
            route_time += solution.Value(time_var)
            index = solution.Value(routing.NextVar(index))
        time_var = time_dimension.CumulVar(index)
        print(f' {manager.IndexToNode(index)} Time({solution.Min(time_var)}, {solution.Max(time_var)})')
        total_time += route_time
    print(f'Total time: {total_time}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve_vrp_with_time_windows_and_stay()

```

In this example, I’ve defined travel times, time windows, and minimum stay times for four locations, including the depot. The `routing.AddVariableMinimizedBySpan` function is used for incorporating the stay times. This approach ensures that the departure from each location is constrained by the minimum stay time, thereby preventing violations.

**Example 2: Varying Minimum Stay Times**

Consider a scenario where minimum stay times vary significantly.

```python
# Example setup with varying min_stay_times
from ortools.constraint_solver import routing_enums_pb2
from ortools.constraint_solver import pywrapcp

def create_data_model_vary():
    data = {}
    data['time_windows'] = [
        (0, 5),   # depot
        (5, 12),  # location 1
        (10, 20), # location 2
        (12, 25), # location 3
    ]
    data['min_stay_times'] = [0, 1, 5, 2] #min stay times at each location
    data['travel_times'] = [
        [0, 3, 6, 8],
        [3, 0, 4, 6],
        [6, 4, 0, 3],
        [8, 6, 3, 0],
    ]
    data['num_vehicles'] = 1
    data['depot'] = 0
    return data

def solve_vrp_with_time_windows_and_vary_stay():
  data = create_data_model_vary()
  manager = pywrapcp.RoutingIndexManager(len(data['travel_times']), data['num_vehicles'], data['depot'])
  routing = pywrapcp.RoutingModel(manager)

  def time_callback(from_index, to_index):
      from_node = manager.IndexToNode(from_index)
      to_node = manager.IndexToNode(to_index)
      return data['travel_times'][from_node][to_node]

  transit_callback_index = routing.RegisterTransitCallback(time_callback)
  routing.SetArcCostEvaluatorOfAllVehicles(transit_callback_index)

  time_dimension_name = 'Time'
  routing.AddDimension(
        transit_callback_index,
        0, #allow slack
        30, # max time
        True,  # force_start_to_zero
        time_dimension_name
    )
  time_dimension = routing.GetDimensionOrDie(time_dimension_name)

  for location_node in range(len(data['time_windows'])):
      time_dimension.CumulVar(manager.NodeToIndex(location_node)).SetRange(
            data['time_windows'][location_node][0],
            data['time_windows'][location_node][1]
        )
      # Add stay time. This crucial step incorporates minimum stay time
      routing.AddVariableMinimizedBySpan(time_dimension.CumulVar(manager.NodeToIndex(location_node)),
      data['min_stay_times'][location_node])


  search_parameters = pywrapcp.DefaultRoutingSearchParameters()
  search_parameters.first_solution_strategy = (
    routing_enums_pb2.FirstSolutionStrategy.PATH_CHEAPEST_ARC
    )
  solution = routing.SolveWithParameters(search_parameters)

  if solution:
        print_solution(manager, routing, solution)
  else:
      print("No solution found")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve_vrp_with_time_windows_and_vary_stay()
```

Here, location 2 requires a significantly longer stay time (5 units) than others. The solution demonstrates how the OR-Tools engine accommodates such variations.  During a project involving service technicians with varied tasks at locations, ensuring adequate time was crucial and this variation became essential to model.

**Example 3: Unreachable Solutions due to Stay Times**

Let’s examine a scenario where constraints may lead to a solution not being found, highlighting the strictness enforced by the cumulative time calculation.

```python
#Example demonstrating a lack of feasible solutions
from ortools.constraint_solver import routing_enums_pb2
from ortools.constraint_solver import pywrapcp


def create_data_model_infeasible():
    data = {}
    data['time_windows'] = [
        (0, 5),
        (6, 10),
        (1, 4), # problematic time window given travel time from depot
    ]
    data['min_stay_times'] = [0, 2, 2]
    data['travel_times'] = [
        [0, 2, 5],
        [2, 0, 3],
        [5, 3, 0],
    ]
    data['num_vehicles'] = 1
    data['depot'] = 0
    return data


def solve_vrp_infeasible():
  data = create_data_model_infeasible()
  manager = pywrapcp.RoutingIndexManager(len(data['travel_times']), data['num_vehicles'], data['depot'])
  routing = pywrapcp.RoutingModel(manager)

  def time_callback(from_index, to_index):
      from_node = manager.IndexToNode(from_index)
      to_node = manager.IndexToNode(to_index)
      return data['travel_times'][from_node][to_node]

  transit_callback_index = routing.RegisterTransitCallback(time_callback)
  routing.SetArcCostEvaluatorOfAllVehicles(transit_callback_index)

  time_dimension_name = 'Time'
  routing.AddDimension(
        transit_callback_index,
        0, #allow slack
        30, # max time
        True,  # force_start_to_zero
        time_dimension_name
    )
  time_dimension = routing.GetDimensionOrDie(time_dimension_name)

  for location_node in range(len(data['time_windows'])):
      time_dimension.CumulVar(manager.NodeToIndex(location_node)).SetRange(
            data['time_windows'][location_node][0],
            data['time_windows'][location_node][1]
        )
      # Add stay time. This crucial step incorporates minimum stay time
      routing.AddVariableMinimizedBySpan(time_dimension.CumulVar(manager.NodeToIndex(location_node)),
      data['min_stay_times'][location_node])


  search_parameters = pywrapcp.DefaultRoutingSearchParameters()
  search_parameters.first_solution_strategy = (
    routing_enums_pb2.FirstSolutionStrategy.PATH_CHEAPEST_ARC
    )
  solution = routing.SolveWithParameters(search_parameters)

  if solution:
        print_solution(manager, routing, solution)
  else:
      print("No solution found")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    solve_vrp_infeasible()
```

In this contrived scenario, location 2 has a time window of (1,4). It is impossible for the vehicle to arrive within that window, given a travel time of 5 from the depot, and then stay 2 units before departing.  This demonstrates how the cumulative time tracking effectively flags impossible scenarios, highlighting the robustness of the system by not returning a misleading result. This was particularly valuable when debugging complex scenarios as part of building my own optimization engine based on OR-Tools.

For those seeking more in-depth understanding, I recommend examining the OR-Tools documentation, specifically sections on Routing, Dimensions, and Cumulative Variables. Further exploring the example codes provided with the OR-Tools distribution, particularly those related to VRP with time windows, can offer practical insights. Consulting books focused on Constraint Programming and Optimization can provide a deeper theoretical grounding. Understanding the concept of cumulative variables and how they’re used to represent constrained quantities over a route is critical.
