Keras callbacks, while seemingly straightforward in single-node training, exhibit nuanced behavior within the context of TensorFlow 2.0's distributed training strategies.  My experience optimizing large-scale image recognition models has highlighted a crucial aspect often overlooked: callbacks operate on the *coordinator* process, not independently on each worker.  This single point of control necessitates careful consideration of communication overhead and potential synchronization bottlenecks.

**1.  Explanation of Callback Behavior in Distributed Training**

In a distributed training setup using TensorFlow's `tf.distribute.Strategy` (e.g., `MirroredStrategy`, `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`), the training process is split across multiple devices (GPUs or TPUs).  Each worker processes a subset of the training data, computing gradients independently.  However, the Keras callbacks, such as `ModelCheckpoint`, `TensorBoard`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`, or custom callbacks, are executed only on the chief worker or coordinator process.  This means that events triggering a callback (e.g., epoch completion) are signaled from each worker to the coordinator, which then executes the callback's logic.

This centralized execution has several implications.  Firstly, the callback's access to training metrics is based on the aggregated results from all workers.  The coordinator receives and processes the metrics from each worker before triggering the callback. Secondly, actions initiated by a callback (like saving a checkpoint) are performed only by the coordinator, requiring the model's weights to be synchronized before the checkpoint is saved. This synchronization adds communication overhead, potentially becoming a significant performance bottleneck with a large number of workers or substantial model sizes. Thirdly, failure of the coordinator process will halt the entire training process, irrespective of the status of individual worker processes.

Furthermore, not all callback methods are equally impacted.  Callbacks that predominantly utilize metrics (like `ReduceLROnPlateau`) are more susceptible to latency introduced by aggregation and synchronization.  Callbacks that involve writing files (like `ModelCheckpoint` or `TensorBoard`) exhibit a stronger dependence on the coordinator's performance and I/O capacity.  Custom callbacks need to be explicitly designed to handle this distributed environment; simply porting single-node callbacks may lead to unforeseen issues.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Standard ModelCheckpoint with MirroredStrategy**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        # ... your model layers ...
    ])
    model.compile(...)

    checkpoint_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        filepath='./checkpoints/my_model_{epoch:02d}',
        save_weights_only=True,  # Reduces checkpoint size
        monitor='val_accuracy',
        save_best_only=True,
        save_freq='epoch' # save at the end of each epoch
    )

    model.fit(
        x_train, y_train,
        epochs=10,
        validation_data=(x_val, y_val),
        callbacks=[checkpoint_callback]
    )
```

This example demonstrates a common usage of `ModelCheckpoint` within a `MirroredStrategy`.  Note that `save_weights_only=True` is crucial for efficiency in distributed training, minimizing the data transferred during synchronization.  The `save_freq` parameter controls how often checkpoints are saved.  The `monitor`, `save_best_only` parameters allow for selecting the best model based on a given metric.


**Example 2: Custom Callback for Distributed Logging**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class DistributedLogger(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        logs = logs or {}
        # Aggregate logs from all workers - Requires specific implementation based on strategy
        # Example: Using a distributed variable or a custom communication mechanism
        # ... Aggregation logic ...
        aggregated_logs = {k: tf.reduce_mean(v) for k, v in logs.items()}

        print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}/{self.params["epochs"]}, aggregated logs: {aggregated_logs}')

# ... rest of the training code as in Example 1 ...  Use DistributedLogger as a callback
```

This illustrates a custom callback for logging.  The crucial part is the aggregation logic (commented out), which is non-trivial and depends on the chosen `tf.distribute.Strategy`. This aggregation step is essential to provide a meaningful overall performance summary across all workers.  I've used `tf.reduce_mean` as a placeholder; more sophisticated averaging might be necessary for specific use cases.


**Example 3: Handling Potential Deadlocks with Custom Callback**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time

class SafeCheckpoint(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
    try:
        #Attempt to save the checkpoint, allowing some retry with exponential backoff
        for attempt in range(5):
          try:
            self.model.save_weights(f'./checkpoints/safe_model_{epoch:02d}')
            break # exit the loop on success
          except Exception as e:
            print(f"Checkpoint save failed (attempt {attempt+1}): {e}")
            time.sleep(2**attempt)  #Exponential backoff strategy
        else: #Execute this only if loop completes without a break (all attempts failed)
            print("Checkpoint save consistently failed. Check network connectivity and storage.")
    except Exception as e:
      print(f"An unexpected error occured: {e}")

#...Rest of the training code as in Example 1... Use SafeCheckpoint as callback.
```

This custom callback demonstrates error handling during checkpoint saving. Network instability or disk I/O issues can interrupt checkpoint creation.  This example uses a simple retry mechanism with exponential backoff to increase robustness.  Production environments would require more sophisticated error handling and potentially centralized logging.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation on distributed training and Keras callbacks is invaluable.   Explore the API references for each callback to fully grasp their intricacies.  Additionally, research papers focusing on large-scale deep learning training, particularly those addressing distributed training challenges, provide valuable insights into best practices and optimization techniques.  Reviewing examples and tutorials from reputable sources focusing on distributed training with TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras would be beneficial. A thorough understanding of the chosen distributed strategy (e.g., `MirroredStrategy`, `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`) is also essential.  Finally, understanding basic concepts of distributed systems, such as consensus algorithms and fault tolerance, provides a broader perspective on potential challenges and effective solutions.
