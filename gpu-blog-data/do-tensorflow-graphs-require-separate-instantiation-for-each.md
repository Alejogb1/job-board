TensorFlow graphs, prior to the 2.x eager execution paradigm shift, demanded careful consideration regarding instantiation.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition systems highlighted a critical misunderstanding often encountered:  the graph itself isn't instantiated per class; rather, the *operations* within the graph are, and their instantiation is dictated by the graph's structure and the data flowing through it.  This distinction is crucial for efficient resource management and avoiding redundant computations.

**1. Explanation:**

The TensorFlow graph, in its traditional definition, represents a computational workflow as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).  Nodes in this graph represent operations (like matrix multiplication or convolution), and edges represent the tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) flowing between them. When you define a TensorFlow graph, you're essentially specifying this DAG structure.  This definition is independent of any specific class or instance.  The act of "instantiation" refers to the allocation of resources and execution of these operations.

Crucially, the graph itself is not directly executed. Instead, a session is created to run the defined operations within the graph.  During execution, the session allocates memory and computes the results according to the data provided as input.  This process is the same regardless of the class to which the graph definition belongs.  A single graph definition can be used across multiple classes or instances, providing a significant performance advantage by avoiding repeated graph construction.

The confusion arises from the way we often structure our code.  We frequently define graph-building functions within classes to encapsulate model-specific logic. This doesn't mean a new graph is created for each class instance.  Instead, the class method builds or modifies a shared graph structure, which is subsequently executed by a session.  The difference lies in the scope of the graph definition versus the instantiation of the operations within the graph.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Shared Graph Across Classes**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a graph-building function
def build_model(input_shape):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    return model

class ClassifierA:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = build_model((784,)) #Shared graph definition

class ClassifierB:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = build_model((784,)) #Shared graph definition

#Both ClassifierA and ClassifierB use the same graph structure.
classifier_a = ClassifierA()
classifier_b = ClassifierB()

#Session management (simplified, assuming eager execution is disabled)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    #Execute model for both classifiers. Note: this is simplified for illustration.  Actual execution within a production environment involves more sophisticated session handling.
    sess.run(...)
```

**Commentary:**  Both `ClassifierA` and `ClassifierB` utilize the same `build_model` function to construct their models. This function defines the graph structure, but only one graph is created.  Each class instance then holds a reference to this shared graph structure.  Note the use of  `tf.compat.v1.Session()` which reflects code written for TensorFlow 1.x  for illustrative purposes. This practice is largely superseded by the Keras API's built-in session management in TensorFlow 2.x.

**Example 2: Class-Specific Graph Modifications**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class ClassifierC:
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        self.model = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
        ])

classifier_c1 = ClassifierC(10)
classifier_c2 = ClassifierC(5)

# classifier_c1 and classifier_c2 have different output layers (different number of classes) within the same basic graph structure
```

**Commentary:**  Here, the graph structure is slightly modified based on the `num_classes` parameter. However, it's still a single graph structure; the modification only affects the final layer's output.  The underlying structure remains the same.

**Example 3:  Illustrating potential for shared weights (Illustrative, not recommended without careful consideration)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

shared_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')

class ClassifierD:
    def __init__(self, num_classes):
        self.model = tf.keras.Sequential([
            shared_layer, #Shared layer instance
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
        ])

classifier_d1 = ClassifierD(10)
classifier_d2 = ClassifierD(5)
```

**Commentary:** This example shows how a single layer instance (`shared_layer`) can be reused across multiple model instances. While this can lead to memory savings in some specific cases, it's crucial to understand the implications for training and potential conflicts in weight updates.  This approach necessitates a thorough understanding of variable sharing mechanisms in TensorFlow and is generally best avoided unless absolutely necessary for very specific optimization scenarios. This should be approached with great caution due to potential complexities in training and weight updates.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections covering graph construction, session management (in the context of TensorFlow 1.x for historical understanding), and the Keras API (for TensorFlow 2.x) are invaluable.  A thorough understanding of directed acyclic graphs and their representation in computational frameworks is essential.  Textbooks on deep learning and machine learning often contain chapters dedicated to implementing and understanding neural networks using TensorFlow, providing valuable context.  Finally, examining well-documented open-source projects utilizing TensorFlow can offer practical insights into effective graph construction and management techniques.
