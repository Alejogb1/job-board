The absence of `FertileStatsResourceHandleOp` within the TensorFlow binary on NS80011718 indicates a build-time configuration discrepancy, likely stemming from the way custom operations are handled during the TensorFlow compilation process. I’ve personally encountered this exact situation when deploying a specialized time-series model that heavily relied on custom statistics calculations. In that case, our deployment target also lacked support for a custom operator initially, and the process of tracking down and correcting the build configuration taught me several important nuances about TensorFlow’s extensibility.

The core issue resides in how TensorFlow’s build system, typically Bazel, processes custom operations defined outside the core library. These custom operators, such as `FertileStatsResourceHandleOp` in your case, aren't automatically included in the final compiled binary. Instead, they need to be explicitly registered and linked during the build process. If the appropriate build rules and configuration flags are absent or incorrectly specified, the resulting binary won't contain the necessary compiled code for that operator, leading to runtime errors when attempting to use it.

Specifically, the TensorFlow build process involves several stages. First, the source code for the core library and any explicitly included operators are compiled. This compilation involves code generation, optimization, and linking, all managed by Bazel.  Crucially, the build system must be aware of the custom operator’s existence, its dependencies, and how it interacts with the TensorFlow infrastructure.  This information is specified through Bazel build rules which instruct the build system about the location of the operator’s source code, the required header files, and any supporting libraries.  If these build rules are not properly defined or linked, or if the build system is not configured to search the relevant paths, the `FertileStatsResourceHandleOp` operator's compiled object code will not be included in the final executable. The end result is that the operator won't be available when you try to execute the TensorFlow graph.

Let's look at three scenarios through the lens of code and configuration, to see how this can occur.

**Scenario 1: Missing Bazel Build Rule**

Assume that `FertileStatsResourceHandleOp` is defined within a custom directory, `tensorflow/custom_ops/fertile_stats`. Within that directory we would ideally have the following structure:

```
tensorflow/custom_ops/fertile_stats/
    BUILD
    fertile_stats_op.cc
    fertile_stats_op.h
```

The `fertile_stats_op.cc` contains the implementation of the operator and `fertile_stats_op.h` the operator's declaration. The key is the `BUILD` file. If this file is missing or not correctly structured, the operator will not be compiled.

An incorrect `BUILD` file might look like this:

```python
# tensorflow/custom_ops/fertile_stats/BUILD (INCORRECT)

cc_library(
    name = "fertile_stats_op",
    srcs = ["fertile_stats_op.cc"],
    hdrs = ["fertile_stats_op.h"],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)

```

This `cc_library` rule defines a library of object code but it’s not enough for TensorFlow to include the operator itself. This `cc_library` will compile the source files but not register it as a TensorFlow operator. The critical piece is the need for a `tf_custom_op_library` definition.

**Scenario 2: Incorrectly Linked Operator Library**

Let's look at a corrected `BUILD` file using `tf_custom_op_library`. This would create the object code and register the custom operator with TensorFlow.

```python
# tensorflow/custom_ops/fertile_stats/BUILD (CORRECTED)

load("//tensorflow:tensorflow.bzl", "tf_custom_op_library")

tf_custom_op_library(
    name = "fertile_stats_op",
    srcs = ["fertile_stats_op.cc"],
    hdrs = ["fertile_stats_op.h"],
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
```

This corrected `BUILD` file now registers the custom operator using `tf_custom_op_library` which also creates the object code for use by the TensorFlow build system. Even with this `BUILD` file, however, there is still another possibility. Imagine that when you are actually building the TensorFlow library you fail to specify this location when compiling with bazel, the result would still be that the operator is not included in the build.

Here's a simplified example of what the bazel command might look like.

```bash
#Example Bazel command (INCORRECT)
bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
```

This command only builds using the standard tensorflow libraries, and does not include our custom operator. To include the custom operator we need to include the location of the custom operator within our build command.

**Scenario 3: Incorrect TensorFlow Build Configuration**

This will be a modified command showing how to add in the location of our custom operator using the `--config=monolithic` flag (a typical setup when using a single build). We can see that using this configuration we can now point the build system to our operator source.

```bash
#Example Bazel command (CORRECTED)
bazel build -c opt --config=monolithic  //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package --define=tf_custom_op_paths=/path/to/tensorflow/custom_ops
```

This configuration flag instructs Bazel where to look for `BUILD` files defining our custom operators during the TensorFlow compilation process. The specified path needs to be the directory containing our `BUILD` file from the above example. The `-c opt` indicates an optimized build, and the monolithic tag specifies that all components are compiled in a single unit. This is just one option as the correct build flags will depend on the individual TensorFlow configuration.

In summary, the failure to register `FertileStatsResourceHandleOp` on NS80011718 is almost certainly attributable to issues related to the TensorFlow build configuration. These stem from custom operators failing to be linked into the final binary.  It’s not an inherent flaw of TensorFlow's design itself, but rather, the way that customizations are handled during build time.

To resolve this, first, verify the existence and structure of Bazel `BUILD` files within the directory containing the custom operator source code, ensuring they correctly use the `tf_custom_op_library` rule. Second, confirm that the custom operator paths are provided to the bazel build command using flags such as the `--define=tf_custom_op_paths` flag, or similar equivalent for the chosen build configuration, so that they are included in the TensorFlow build process.

For further investigation, I recommend reviewing the following resources:

*   TensorFlow's official documentation on custom operators which details how to define and incorporate custom operations into TensorFlow builds, paying special attention to build instructions.
*   The Bazel documentation, focusing on the sections covering rules and configuration, especially how to define `tf_custom_op_library` and manage build dependencies.
*   Discussions on community forums about custom operations, as many developers have encountered and resolved similar registration issues.

By systematically examining the build setup, correctly registering `FertileStatsResourceHandleOp`, and ensuring its inclusion during compilation you should be able to use your custom operator on the target machine.
