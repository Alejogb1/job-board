Inspecting TensorFlow 2.0 datasets effectively requires understanding their underlying structure as iterative Python objects, not simple data containers. This stems from the shift towards eager execution and the adoption of the `tf.data.Dataset` API for optimized data pipelining. I've spent considerable time debugging training pipelines that relied on custom data loading, and I’ve found this crucial for identifying bottlenecks and validating data integrity before feeding it to a model. The following details my approach to inspecting these datasets.

A TensorFlow `tf.data.Dataset` is essentially a Python iterable, producing elements based on its definition. However, these elements are often not directly accessible as raw NumPy arrays until explicitly converted. The challenge lies in inspecting these elements efficiently without disrupting the data pipeline, as attempting to convert an entire dataset to a list, for instance, can lead to memory exhaustion with larger datasets. Therefore, a deliberate inspection strategy is key. My typical process involves the following steps: 1) creating a small subset for immediate inspection, 2) inspecting individual elements to understand their structure and types, and 3) verifying statistical properties and distributions using `tf.data` API functionalities wherever applicable, while avoiding full materialization.

**Element Structure and Type Inspection:**

The primary method for inspecting individual elements is by using the `take()` method coupled with iteration. `take(n)` returns a new dataset containing the first 'n' elements of the original dataset. This allows for controlled inspection without processing the entire dataset. Once you have a smaller dataset, you can iterate over it and inspect individual elements using standard Python debugging techniques like printing and utilizing the `type()` function, often within a Jupyter notebook or interactive console. This often uncovers inconsistencies in data types or the shape of tensors across different batches. The following example demonstrates this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulated data creation
images = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28, 3).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=100).astype(np.int32)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((images, labels))

# Take first 5 elements
sample_dataset = dataset.take(5)

# Inspect element structure and types
for element in sample_dataset:
    image, label = element
    print(f"Image type: {type(image)}, Image shape: {image.shape}, Image dtype: {image.dtype}")
    print(f"Label type: {type(label)}, Label value: {label}, Label dtype: {label.dtype}")

    # Check tensor type
    print(f"Is image a tensor? {tf.is_tensor(image)}")
    print(f"Is label a tensor? {tf.is_tensor(label)}")

    # Convert to NumPy for specific analysis (use with caution for large data)
    image_np = image.numpy()
    print(f"Image type (NumPy): {type(image_np)}, NumPy shape: {image_np.shape}")
```
This code first creates a simulated dataset using `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices`. Then, using `take(5)` I extracted a smaller dataset that's then iterated over. Inside the loop I retrieve the image and label tensors and use `type()` and `shape` attribute checks along with a check on the `dtype` attribute.  I also demonstrate how to convert to NumPy using `numpy()` for more granular inspection, which is very helpful if specific analysis outside TensorFlow operations are required. However, as the comment indicates, this operation should be used with extreme caution, as converting large datasets to NumPy arrays will lead to memory exhaustion. I've witnessed several training runs prematurely terminated due to such naive manipulations during debug. Importantly, the `tf.is_tensor()` call confirms if the returned values are TensorFlow tensors which is often important when manipulating data within the training loop.

**Batch Structure Inspection:**

When datasets are batched, the element structure becomes one level deeper. Instead of single data samples, the output is a tensor of multiple samples aggregated into a batch. Debugging batching issues can be important, especially when trying to leverage specific hardware accelerators. It is equally important to inspect the shape of individual tensors within a batch, especially after pre-processing using techniques such as image resizing, shuffling, or data augmentations that can change these shapes. Here’s an example showing inspection of a batched dataset:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulated data creation
images = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28, 3).astype(np.float32)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=100).astype(np.int32)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((images, labels)).batch(32)

# Take the first batch
sample_batch = next(iter(dataset))

# Inspect batch element structure and types
image_batch, label_batch = sample_batch

print(f"Image batch type: {type(image_batch)}, Image batch shape: {image_batch.shape}, Image batch dtype: {image_batch.dtype}")
print(f"Label batch type: {type(label_batch)}, Label batch shape: {label_batch.shape}, Label batch dtype: {label_batch.dtype}")

# Inspect first image and first label inside the batch
first_image_in_batch = image_batch[0]
first_label_in_batch = label_batch[0]

print(f"First image in batch type: {type(first_image_in_batch)}, First image shape: {first_image_in_batch.shape}, First image dtype: {first_image_in_batch.dtype}")
print(f"First label in batch type: {type(first_label_in_batch)}, First label value: {first_label_in_batch}, First label dtype: {first_label_in_batch.dtype}")
```
The example demonstrates how a dataset with batching is inspected. The `batch(32)` call aggregates the data into batches of 32. `next(iter(dataset))` retrieves the first batch. The rest is similar to the previous example, checking the type, shape, and `dtype` attributes of the tensors. Specifically, this example demonstrates that while the image and label are tensors within the dataset, after batching the elements become a batch of tensors. The shape attribute reflects the batch size. Indexing using the `[0]` subscript operator allows access to the first image in the batch or first label, showing their original structure and shape. Batch-specific debugging is often crucial when utilizing data sharding across multiple GPUs, as the shape, size, or data types might deviate when partitioning the data.

**Statistical Analysis Within the Dataset API:**

While element-wise inspection allows for understanding structure and data types, inspecting statistical properties such as mean, variance, and distribution is often crucial for numerical stability and bias checks. Directly computing these values on the entire dataset is inefficient and prone to memory issues. The `tf.data` API does not provide explicit functions for this type of computation. Instead I prefer to construct dedicated computation graphs that are integrated into the data processing pipeline and then inspect the results using `take`. An example of this methodology is demonstrated below using a dataset of labels:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulated data
labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=1000).astype(np.int32)
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(labels).batch(100)

def count_labels(label_batch, classes=10):
    # Ensure the batch is a tensor and contains integers
    label_batch = tf.cast(label_batch, tf.int32)
    counts = tf.zeros(classes, dtype=tf.int32)
    for label in range(classes):
        counts = tf.tensor_scatter_nd_add(counts, [[label]], [tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(label_batch == label, tf.int32))])
    return counts

# Aggregate counts for the whole dataset
all_counts = tf.zeros(10, dtype=tf.int32)
for label_batch in dataset:
    batch_counts = count_labels(label_batch)
    all_counts = all_counts + batch_counts

print("Label counts:", all_counts.numpy())

# Inspect an example batch count
sample_batch = next(iter(dataset))
sample_batch_counts = count_labels(sample_batch)
print("Sample batch label counts: ", sample_batch_counts.numpy())
```
The provided example code computes the label counts across the dataset. I defined a function `count_labels` that takes a batched tensor of labels and counts the frequency of each unique label. The main loop then iterates over the dataset (which was pre-batched). The count is aggregated using `tf.tensor_scatter_nd_add` and the final aggregated result is stored in `all_counts`. After that a specific batch is taken out of the dataset and the label counts are computed individually for inspection purposes. Note that this is just one example and this type of methodology can be easily adapted to inspect means, variances or other statistical properties. The key is to express your computation in TensorFlow operations and not use the NumPy API if you want to use the computation within your graph and thus be GPU accelerated.

In summary, effective inspection of TensorFlow 2.0 datasets involves carefully selecting subsets, understanding the structure and types of data elements, and leveraging the `tf.data` API to gather crucial information without fully materializing the data. By focusing on small dataset samples and utilizing TensorFlow operations for statistical analysis, I can prevent memory issues and ensure data quality during model training. I found the TensorFlow Data API guide and the API documentation are the most helpful resources for further learning on this topic. Consulting tutorials that cover advanced usage of the tf.data API often offers helpful insights for more advanced debugging scenarios.
