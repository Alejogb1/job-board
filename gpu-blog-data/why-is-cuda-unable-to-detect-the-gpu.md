The inability of CUDA to detect a GPU typically stems from a mismatch between the CUDA driver version, the GPU's compute capability, and the CUDA toolkit version installed on the system.  During my years working on high-performance computing projects, I've encountered this issue frequently, often masked by seemingly unrelated errors.  A thorough diagnostic approach is crucial for accurate resolution.

**1.  Explanation:**

CUDA, Nvidia's parallel computing platform, requires a precise alignment of software components.  The CUDA driver acts as the interface between the operating system and the GPU, enabling CUDA applications to access and utilize the GPU's resources. The driver itself is version-specific to both the operating system and the GPU architecture.  The compute capability, a number representing the GPU's architectural generation (e.g., 7.5, 8.6), dictates the instruction set the GPU understands. Finally, the CUDA toolkit, containing the libraries and headers necessary to compile and run CUDA code, must be compatible with both the driver and the compute capability.  An incompatibility in any of these three components will lead to CUDA failing to detect the GPU.

Several contributing factors often exacerbate the core problem.  Firstly, incorrect driver installation or corruption can prevent CUDA from accessing the hardware. Secondly, a mismatch between the CUDA toolkit's target compute capability and the GPU's actual capability will cause compilation or runtime errors, often manifesting as a GPU detection failure. Thirdly, insufficient permissions or conflicting software might restrict access to the GPU.

Diagnostics should start with verifying the driver's installation and version.  Confirming the GPU's compute capability, readily available from Nvidia's website using the GPU's model number, is critical.  Finally, comparing this compute capability against the CUDA toolkit version's supported capabilities eliminates incompatibility issues.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different diagnostic approaches using the `nvidia-smi` command-line tool and a simple CUDA program.  `nvidia-smi` provides crucial information about the system's GPU(s) and driver status.

**Example 1: Verifying GPU Presence and Driver Information:**

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

**Commentary:**  This command is the first step in troubleshooting. Its output should clearly display the GPU(s) detected by the driver.  Absence of GPU information indicates a driver installation or configuration problem.  Pay close attention to the driver version reported; this is crucial for comparing against the CUDA toolkit version.  Errors or warnings within the `nvidia-smi` output often pinpoint specific driver issues.  I’ve seen cases where a seemingly minor driver update resolved detection failures.  For example, a message indicating a driver version mismatch or driver failure to load will clearly signal driver issues.

**Example 2: A Minimal CUDA Program to Check for GPU Detection:**

```c++
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int deviceCount;
    cudaGetDeviceCount(&deviceCount);

    if (deviceCount == 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "No CUDA-capable devices detected.\n");
        return 1;
    } else {
        int device;
        cudaGetDevice(&device);
        cudaDeviceProp prop;
        cudaGetDeviceProperties(&prop, device);
        printf("Detected GPU: %s\n", prop.name);
        printf("Compute Capability: %d.%d\n", prop.major, prop.minor);
        return 0;
    }
}
```

**Commentary:** This program utilizes the CUDA runtime API to retrieve the number of CUDA-capable devices.  If `cudaGetDeviceCount` returns 0, it conclusively indicates that CUDA cannot detect any GPUs.  If successful, it will then retrieve properties of the first detected GPU, including its name and compute capability, confirming successful detection and allowing for verification against the CUDA toolkit's supported compute capabilities.  Compilation failures often pinpoint toolkit/driver incompatibility. The compilation command needs to specify the correct CUDA architecture, which must match the GPU's compute capability.  For example, compiling with `nvcc -arch=sm_75` would target compute capability 7.5.


**Example 3:  Checking CUDA Toolkit and Driver Version Compatibility:**

This step involves manual comparison. The CUDA toolkit's documentation (available on Nvidia's website) specifies the supported compute capabilities for each version.  This information must be cross-referenced with the compute capability obtained from `nvidia-smi` (Example 1) and the program output (Example 2).

**Commentary:**  Inconsistency here is the most frequent cause of detection failures.  Using an older CUDA toolkit that doesn't support the GPU's compute capability is a classic scenario.  For instance, a CUDA toolkit compiled for compute capability 6.x attempting to access a GPU with capability 8.x will invariably fail.  Conversely, a newer toolkit might successfully detect the GPU.  In my experience, reinstalling the CUDA toolkit with the correct version often resolves the problem.  The installation process should include selecting the appropriate compute capability during the installation process.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Nvidia's CUDA documentation, the CUDA Toolkit installation guide, and the `nvidia-smi` command-line tool's documentation are essential resources.  Understanding the concepts of CUDA drivers, compute capability, and the CUDA toolkit’s architecture is fundamental to effective troubleshooting.   Additionally, examining the CUDA runtime API reference allows for more in-depth diagnostics.  Checking system logs for errors related to the Nvidia driver can also be helpful.  Focusing on the order of driver and toolkit installation to prevent conflicts is also highly valuable.  Finally, reviewing the outputs and error messages of the various diagnostic commands is crucial for accurate diagnosis.


By systematically applying these steps and utilizing the recommended resources, you should be able to pinpoint the reason for CUDA's inability to detect your GPU and implement a suitable solution.  Remember, meticulous attention to detail and a structured diagnostic approach are key to resolving this complex issue.
