The issue with `ptr_vector` not being freed correctly almost always stems from improper ownership management, specifically the failure to account for the lifetimes of the pointers it holds.  My experience debugging memory leaks in C++ over the past decade has shown this to be a pervasive problem, especially when working with dynamically allocated memory managed outside the standard library's smart pointer ecosystem.  The root cause often lies in a mismatch between the `ptr_vector`'s destruction and the actual deallocation of the pointed-to objects.  This necessitates a careful examination of both the vector's lifecycle and the lifecycle of the objects it references.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

A `ptr_vector`, assuming it's a custom implementation or a wrapper around `std::vector<void*>` (which is generally discouraged), holds pointers. It doesn't inherently manage the memory those pointers point to. The responsibility of allocating and deallocating the memory pointed to by the elements in the `ptr_vector` rests solely with the code managing the `ptr_vector`.  If the code doesn't explicitly delete each pointer before the `ptr_vector` is destroyed, a memory leak occurs.  Furthermore, if the pointers point to objects with destructors, those destructors won't be called, potentially leading to resource leaks or data corruption beyond simple memory allocation.

The crucial element missing in most faulty implementations is a mechanism to iterate through the `ptr_vector` upon its destruction (or prior to destruction in certain scenarios) and explicitly free the memory each pointer references. This often requires a custom destructor or a separate cleanup function.  Simply relying on the vector's destructor to free the pointers themselves will result in memory corruption or, at best, undefined behavior.  This is fundamentally different from using `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<T>>` or `std::vector<std::shared_ptr<T>>`, where smart pointers automatically manage the lifetime of the pointed-to objects.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Implementation (Memory Leak)**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

struct MyData {
  int data;
  MyData(int d) : data(d) { std::cout << "MyData constructor called for " << data << std::endl; }
  ~MyData() { std::cout << "MyData destructor called for " << data << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
  std::vector<MyData*> ptr_vector;
  ptr_vector.push_back(new MyData(10));
  ptr_vector.push_back(new MyData(20));

  // ... some operations ...

  // Incorrect:  The memory pointed to by the elements is NOT freed.
  // This will lead to a memory leak.
  return 0; 
}
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates a classic memory leak.  The `MyData` objects are allocated on the heap using `new`, but their memory is never explicitly deallocated using `delete`. The `ptr_vector`'s destructor only destroys the vector itself, not the objects it points to. This results in a memory leak; the program keeps the allocated memory even after `main()` returns.  Note the absence of destructor calls for `MyData` objects.

**Example 2: Correct Implementation using a Destructor**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

struct MyData {
  int data;
  MyData(int d) : data(d) { std::cout << "MyData constructor called for " << data << std::endl; }
  ~MyData() { std::cout << "MyData destructor called for " << data << std::endl; }
};

class MyPtrVector {
private:
  std::vector<MyData*> data;
public:
  void push_back(MyData* ptr) { data.push_back(ptr); }
  ~MyPtrVector() {
    for (MyData* ptr : data) {
      delete ptr;
    }
  }
};

int main() {
  MyPtrVector ptr_vector;
  ptr_vector.push_back(new MyData(10));
  ptr_vector.push_back(new MyData(20));

  // ... some operations ...

  // Correct: The destructor now iterates and deletes each pointer.
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This corrected version introduces a custom class `MyPtrVector` with a destructor that explicitly iterates through the `data` vector and deletes each `MyData*` element. This ensures proper memory deallocation and invokes the `MyData` destructors, preventing the memory leak.


**Example 3:  Correct Implementation using a separate Cleanup function (for complex scenarios)**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>

struct MyData {
    int data;
    MyData(int d) : data(d) { std::cout << "MyData constructor called for " << data << std::endl; }
    ~MyData() { std::cout << "MyData destructor called for " << data << std::endl; }
};

void cleanupPtrVector(std::vector<MyData*>& vec) {
    for (MyData* ptr : vec) {
        delete ptr;
    }
    vec.clear(); //Optional, but good practice for clarity
}

int main() {
    std::vector<MyData*> ptr_vector;
    ptr_vector.push_back(new MyData(10));
    ptr_vector.push_back(new MyData(20));

    // ... some operations ...

    cleanupPtrVector(ptr_vector); // Explicit cleanup before exiting
    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:**  This approach separates the cleanup logic from the `main` function and the lifecycle of `ptr_vector`. This is beneficial in more complex scenarios where the `ptr_vector`'s lifetime may be more intricate.  The `cleanupPtrVector` function clearly handles the memory deallocation, improving code readability and maintainability.  This approach is especially useful when dealing with exception handling, allowing for guaranteed cleanup regardless of how the function exits.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   **Effective C++ by Scott Meyers:** This book thoroughly covers resource management and object lifetime issues in C++.
*   **More Effective C++ by Scott Meyers:**  Further expands on the topics presented in Effective C++.
*   **Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied by Andrei Alexandrescu:**  Provides advanced techniques for managing resources efficiently.
*   **A good C++ reference book:**  A comprehensive reference detailing memory management aspects of the language.  Consistent use of a debugger is also critical for identifying such issues.  Understanding the specifics of memory allocation and deallocation at the lower levels (e.g., how `new` and `delete` work) are also extremely useful.

By understanding the intricacies of pointer ownership and applying techniques like those shown in the examples, you can effectively prevent memory leaks and other related issues when using `ptr_vector` or similar custom container types.  Avoid using raw pointers whenever possible. Smart pointers significantly simplify memory management and reduce the likelihood of errors. Remember, always choose the solution that best suits your specific needs and complexity.  Using RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles is fundamental to robust C++ development.
