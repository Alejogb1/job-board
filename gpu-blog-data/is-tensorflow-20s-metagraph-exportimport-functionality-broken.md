The shift to TensorFlow 2.0, with its emphasis on eager execution and Keras integration, significantly altered how models are saved and loaded, presenting challenges that weren't prominent in the 1.x graph-based paradigm. Specifically, the traditional 'metagraph' concept, central to TF 1.x for its separation of graph structure and variable values, isn't directly applicable in the same way. This is often perceived as "broken" by users accustomed to the 1.x workflow, but it's fundamentally a change in architecture, not a malfunction.

The primary method for saving and loading models in TensorFlow 2.x is through the `tf.saved_model` API. This API, while robust, operates on a different principle compared to the metagraph. It serializes the entire computational graph, including both the operations (equivalent to the 1.x metagraph) and the weights, into a standardized directory structure. This difference in approach is critical for understanding why direct "metagraph export/import" is not a valid operation. In version 1, we would save the graph and the checkpoint file separately, allowing flexibility in loading and potentially sharing weights. In version 2.x, these concepts are merged. This consolidation, while providing portability and simplified usage, removes the granular control users might expect from the previous system, leading to the mischaracterization of the functionality as “broken.”

It’s crucial to realize that the `saved_model` API effectively performs the function of both metagraph saving and variable saving, just in an integrated manner. Consequently, the questions I see often aren’t about the system actually failing, but more about how the new save process differs from the 1.x paradigm. I experienced this firsthand during a model deployment project where I had to port several older models from TensorFlow 1.15 to 2.4. Initially, I looked for the 1.x functionalities I was familiar with, but quickly discovered the new approach, requiring significant rework on the loading and inference scripts.

To illustrate, let's examine three common scenarios regarding saving and loading in TensorFlow 2.x, highlighting the practical implications of this architecture shift.

**Scenario 1: Saving and Loading a Basic Keras Model**

This is the most straightforward use case. Here, we create a simple sequential Keras model, train it briefly, and save it using `tf.saved_model.save`. The model is then reloaded, and we perform a prediction test to verify it loads correctly.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# 1. Create a simple Keras model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)
])

# 2. Compile the model for training purposes (not essential for saving)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# 3. Generate dummy training data
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 2)

# 4. Train the model briefly
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)

# 5. Save the model to a specified directory
save_path = 'my_saved_model'
tf.saved_model.save(model, save_path)

# 6. Load the model back from the saved directory
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(save_path)

# 7. Generate some test data for prediction
test_input = np.random.rand(1, 5)

# 8. Make a prediction using the loaded model
prediction = loaded_model(test_input)
print(prediction)
```

In this example, the entire model, including its architecture and trained weights, is encapsulated within the saved directory ‘my_saved_model’.  When we load the model, we get back a function that we can directly call to make predictions. This highlights the holistic nature of the saved model in TensorFlow 2.x and is in stark contrast with the separate graph and checkpoint files of 1.x.

**Scenario 2: Saving and Loading Subclassed Models**

Subclassed models, defining custom layers and operations, are essential for more advanced implementations.  Here, we demonstrate how a custom layer is defined and integrated into a model, and the saving and loading behavior is demonstrated. It's important to understand that the saved model can reconstruct the entire class structure.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


# 1. Define a custom layer
class MyDenseLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(MyDenseLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
      self.w = self.add_weight(name='kernel', shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                         initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
      self.b = self.add_weight(name='bias', shape=(self.units,),
                         initializer='zeros', trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
      return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b


# 2. Create a custom model
class MyCustomModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    super(MyCustomModel, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    self.layer1 = MyDenseLayer(10)
    self.layer2 = MyDenseLayer(2)

  def call(self, inputs):
    x = self.layer1(inputs)
    return self.layer2(x)


# 3. Instantiate the model
model = MyCustomModel()

# 4. Generate dummy training data and train the model briefly
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 2)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)


# 5. Save the model to the specified directory
save_path = 'my_custom_saved_model'
tf.saved_model.save(model, save_path)

# 6. Load the model back from the saved directory
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(save_path)

# 7. Generate some test data
test_input = np.random.rand(1, 5)

# 8. Make a prediction using the loaded model
prediction = loaded_model(test_input)
print(prediction)
```

Notice how the `MyDenseLayer` and `MyCustomModel` classes are defined and saved seamlessly. Upon loading, `loaded_model` has the correct structure and internal parameters, all thanks to the `saved_model` API. This emphasizes that the mechanism successfully handles the entire model description and does not require an explicit metagraph description.

**Scenario 3: Working with Signatures and Functions**

Sometimes, we require more control over the input and output tensors of our saved model.  Signatures allow us to define specific named functions within our model, offering a defined interface for loading and execution.  This example demonstrates how we can use the signature to invoke a specific function.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np


# 1. Create a model with an explicit input signature.
class MyModelWithSignature(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(MyModelWithSignature, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.layer1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')
        self.layer2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)

    @tf.function(input_signature=[tf.TensorSpec(shape=(None, 5), dtype=tf.float32)])
    def my_infer(self, inputs):
        x = self.layer1(inputs)
        return self.layer2(x)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.my_infer(inputs)

# 2. Instantiate and train model briefly
model = MyModelWithSignature()
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 2)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)

# 3. Save the model
save_path = 'my_signature_saved_model'
tf.saved_model.save(model, save_path)

# 4. Load the model and access its signatures.
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(save_path)

# 5. Obtain the loaded model function from the signature
infer_function = loaded_model.signatures["my_infer"]

# 6. Generate some test data and invoke the function
test_input = np.random.rand(1, 5)
prediction = infer_function(tf.constant(test_input)).numpy()
print(prediction)
```

By specifying input signatures, we can ensure the expected data format when loading the function through the `signatures` attribute. This is a powerful mechanism for managing complex models with diverse inputs and outputs.

In conclusion, the perception that TensorFlow 2.0's “metagraph” is “broken” arises from a misunderstanding of the architecture change.  The `saved_model` API replaces the separated graph/variables with an integrated model representation, handling both functions implicitly. While the granular control of the past is no longer directly available, this consolidated system ensures reliable and consistent model saving and loading.  Users coming from TensorFlow 1.x should focus on mastering this new methodology rather than expecting a direct equivalent to the old metagraph paradigm.
