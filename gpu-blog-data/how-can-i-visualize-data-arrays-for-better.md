Data visualization is crucial for effective data analysis;  a poorly presented dataset obscures insights, whereas a well-crafted visualization reveals patterns instantaneously.  My experience working on large-scale genomic datasets taught me this early on.  I've found that the optimal visualization technique hinges heavily on the data's nature, dimensions, and the specific questions being investigated.  Therefore, a multifaceted approach, utilizing various libraries and techniques, is usually necessary.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Data array visualization requires understanding the array's dimensionality.  One-dimensional arrays (vectors) are straightforward; two-dimensional arrays (matrices) present more complexity; and higher-dimensional arrays demand more sophisticated approaches.  Regardless of dimension, the core principle is to translate numerical data into a visual representation that facilitates pattern recognition.  This involves choosing appropriate plot types to reflect data characteristics.  For instance, histograms are suitable for visualizing the distribution of values in a one-dimensional array, while heatmaps effectively display the values of a two-dimensional array. Scatter plots are powerful for showing relationships between two variables represented as one-dimensional arrays, or exploring correlations within a higher dimensional dataset by projecting onto a 2D plane.

Choosing the right visualization depends on your goals.  Do you want to understand the distribution of values, identify outliers, or visualize relationships between variables?  The answer dictates the choice of visualization technique.  Further considerations include scaling, color palettes, and labeling to ensure clarity and avoid misinterpretations. Effective legends and titles are essential for context.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples utilize Python and popular libraries, reflecting my personal preference and experience in scientific computing.  Similar functionalities exist in R, MATLAB, and other environments.

**Example 1: Histograms for One-Dimensional Arrays**

This example demonstrates visualizing the distribution of gene expression levels, represented as a one-dimensional NumPy array.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample gene expression data (fictional)
gene_expression = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=2, size=1000)

# Create histogram
plt.hist(gene_expression, bins=30, edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel('Gene Expression Level')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Gene Expression Levels')
plt.show()
```

This code generates a histogram using `matplotlib.pyplot.hist`. The `bins` parameter controls the number of bins in the histogram, affecting granularity.  `edgecolor` improves visual clarity.  Clear labels and a title are essential for interpretation.  The data itself is simulated using NumPy's random number generator; in a real-world scenario, this would be replaced with actual data loaded from a file.

**Example 2: Heatmaps for Two-Dimensional Arrays**

This illustrates visualizing a correlation matrix, a common task in many scientific fields and a classic application of heatmaps.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Sample correlation matrix (fictional)
correlation_matrix = np.random.rand(10, 10)
correlation_matrix = np.triu(correlation_matrix) + correlation_matrix.transpose() - np.diag(np.diag(correlation_matrix))  #Ensure symmetry


# Create heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=".2f")
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()

```

This example leverages `seaborn`, a library built on top of `matplotlib`, providing enhanced aesthetics.  `sns.heatmap` generates the heatmap.  `annot=True` displays values within the heatmap cells.  `cmap` specifies the color palette; 'coolwarm' is a suitable choice for representing both positive and negative correlations.  `fmt=".2f"` formats the displayed numbers to two decimal places.  The matrix generation ensures a symmetric matrix which represents true correlation data.


**Example 3: Scatter Plots for Exploring Relationships**

Here, we visualize the relationship between two variables, for instance, protein concentration and gene expression.  This scenario is very common in biological data analysis.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data (fictional)
protein_concentration = np.random.normal(loc=5, scale=1, size=100)
gene_expression = 2 * protein_concentration + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=0.5, size=100)


# Create scatter plot
plt.scatter(protein_concentration, gene_expression)
plt.xlabel('Protein Concentration')
plt.ylabel('Gene Expression')
plt.title('Relationship between Protein Concentration and Gene Expression')
plt.show()
```

This code utilizes `matplotlib.pyplot.scatter` to create the scatter plot.  Each point represents a data point with its x-coordinate representing protein concentration and its y-coordinate representing gene expression.  The relationship between the two is clearly observable, allowing for an initial assessment of potential correlations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of data visualization principles, I recommend exploring standard statistical textbooks focusing on data analysis and visualization.  Many excellent resources detail the use of specific libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python, and equivalent packages in R or other statistical programming languages.  Furthermore, dedicated texts on scientific visualization can be invaluable for those working with complex, multidimensional data.  Finally, browsing through published scientific papers in your field of interest is an excellent way to gain insights into best practices for data visualization specific to your area of research.  The effective use of these resources will significantly enhance your ability to visualize and interpret data arrays.
