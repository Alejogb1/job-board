GPU memory limitations frequently hinder large-scale NumPy array processing.  My experience working on high-resolution satellite imagery analysis highlighted this acutely.  The naive approach of loading entire datasets directly into GPU memory often resulted in `CUDA out of memory` errors, necessitating alternative strategies.  The core principle to prevent this is to process data in smaller, manageable chunks, leveraging the inherent capabilities of NumPy and CUDA for efficient memory management.


**1.  Chunking and Iterative Processing:**

The most effective strategy involves dividing the large NumPy array into smaller, independently processable chunks. This prevents loading the entire dataset at once, significantly reducing memory demands.  The process involves calculating the optimal chunk size based on available GPU memory and the array's dimensions, iterating over these chunks, performing computations on each, and aggregating the results.  Careful consideration must be given to the nature of the computation; some operations can be parallelized more effectively than others.  For instance, element-wise operations generally benefit more from chunking than those requiring global array information.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Element-wise Operation Chunking**

This example demonstrates processing a large array with an element-wise square root operation.  I've utilized this method extensively for preprocessing hyperspectral images, where each band requires independent processing.

```python
import numpy as np

def process_array_chunked(array, chunk_size, operation):
    """Processes a large NumPy array in chunks using a specified operation.

    Args:
        array: The input NumPy array.
        chunk_size: The size of each chunk.
        operation: The function to apply to each chunk (e.g., np.sqrt).

    Returns:
        A NumPy array containing the processed data.
    """

    rows, cols = array.shape
    result = np.empty_like(array)

    for i in range(0, rows, chunk_size):
        for j in range(0, cols, chunk_size):
            chunk = array[i:i+chunk_size, j:j+chunk_size]
            result[i:i+chunk_size, j:j+chunk_size] = operation(chunk)

    return result

# Example usage:
large_array = np.random.rand(10000, 10000)  # Simulate a large array
chunk_size = 1000
result_array = process_array_chunked(large_array, chunk_size, np.sqrt)
```

This code iterates over the array in chunks defined by `chunk_size`.  The `operation` function is applied to each chunk individually, minimizing memory usage.  The resulting processed chunks are assembled into the final `result_array`. The choice of `chunk_size` is crucial and depends on available GPU memory, which needs to be determined experimentally.

**Example 2:  Memory-Mapped Files for Disk-Based Processing**

For extremely large arrays that cannot be accommodated even with chunking, memory-mapped files provide an efficient solution. This approach maps a file to virtual memory, enabling access to data without fully loading it into RAM.  I've successfully used this approach when working with terabyte-sized datasets from climate modeling simulations.

```python
import numpy as np

def process_array_mmap(filename, chunk_size, operation):
    """Processes a large NumPy array stored in a memory-mapped file.

    Args:
        filename: The path to the memory-mapped file.
        chunk_size: The size of each chunk.
        operation: The function to apply to each chunk.

    Returns:
        A NumPy array containing the processed data.  This may be a view into the mmaped file, depending on the operation.
    """
    mmap_array = np.memmap(filename, dtype='float64', mode='r+') # Adjust dtype as needed
    rows, cols = mmap_array.shape
    # ...  (similar chunking logic as Example 1, operating on mmap_array) ...

# Example usage:
# ... create a large array and save it to a file ...
# ... then process using process_array_mmap
```

This example demonstrates how to read and process data from a memory-mapped file, limiting the amount of data loaded into RAM at any given time.  Note that modifications to `mmap_array` will directly affect the file on disk, so the operation must be carefully chosen, and potential memory mapping limitations regarding write access need to be considered.

**Example 3:  Dask for Parallel and Out-of-Core Computation**

Dask offers a more sophisticated approach to parallel and out-of-core computation, ideal for datasets exceeding available RAM. Dask arrays provide a lazy evaluation mechanism, deferring computation until necessary.  I found it indispensable when dealing with massive datasets from particle simulations, where traditional NumPy approaches were intractable.

```python
import dask.array as da
import numpy as np

# Example usage
large_array = da.random.random((10000, 10000), chunks=(1000, 1000)) # Define chunk size
result_array = np.sqrt(large_array) # Operation applied lazily
result_array.compute() # Trigger computation

```

This example shows how to create a Dask array with specified chunk sizes, perform operations lazily, and trigger computation only when required, leveraging parallel processing capabilities. Dask handles the intricacies of scheduling and managing data across multiple cores and potentially disk, significantly reducing the memory footprint compared to loading the entire array into a single NumPy array.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of NumPy's memory management, consult the official NumPy documentation.  Explore resources on CUDA programming and parallel computing to optimize performance.  Familiarize yourself with memory profiling tools to identify memory bottlenecks and optimize chunk sizes effectively.  Furthermore, examining the documentation for Dask, including its array and data structures, will be beneficial for scaling to truly massive datasets.  Finally, understanding the differences and advantages of virtual memory and memory mapping techniques can be invaluable for memory management in high-performance computing.
