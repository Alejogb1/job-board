The crucial aspect of utilizing Keras' `MultiHeadAttention` layer with a tensor of shape `[None, 6, 8]` lies in understanding the meaning of each dimension.  `None` represents the variable batch size, `6` is the sequence length, and `8` is the dimension of the embedding for each element in the sequence.  This implies we are dealing with sequences of length 6, where each element is represented by an 8-dimensional vector.  Incorrect usage often stems from neglecting the requirement for a properly shaped query, key, and value tensors, and a misinterpretation of the `return_attention_scores` parameter.  My experience debugging this in various sequence-to-sequence and transformer-based models has highlighted these issues consistently.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The `MultiHeadAttention` layer, a core component of many attention-based architectures, requires three inputs: queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V).  These are typically derived from the same input tensor through linear transformations, ensuring they all have the same embedding dimension (in our case, 8).  The layer computes attention weights based on the dot product of queries and keys, then uses these weights to create a weighted sum of the values. This process is repeated multiple times (hence "multi-head"), allowing the model to attend to different aspects of the input sequence.  The output shape of the `MultiHeadAttention` layer, therefore, remains `[None, 6, 8]`, reflecting the same sequence length and embedding dimension, but with the information now enriched by the attention mechanism.

The `return_attention_scores` parameter dictates whether the attention weights are returned alongside the output.  Setting it to `True` yields a tuple containing the attention scores tensor (shape `[None, num_heads, 6, 6]`) and the output tensor.  Understanding this parameter is crucial for model interpretation and visualization. Incorrect setting can lead to unexpected outputs or memory issues.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic MultiHeadAttention application**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(6, 8))
attention_layer = keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=2, key_dim=8)
output_tensor = attention_layer(input_tensor, input_tensor) # Q, K, V are all the same
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)
model.summary()

#Sample input data
sample_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 6, 8)) #batch size of 10
output = model(sample_input)
print(output.shape)  # Output: (10, 6, 8)
```

This example demonstrates the simplest usage.  The input tensor serves as queries, keys, and values.  The `num_heads` parameter is set to 2, meaning the attention mechanism will use two separate sets of query, key, and value transformations.  `key_dim` must match the last dimension of the input tensor.  The output shape confirms that the sequence length and embedding dimension are preserved.

**Example 2:  Utilizing return_attention_scores**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(6, 8))
attention_layer = keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=2, key_dim=8, return_attention_scores=True)
output_tensor, attention_scores = attention_layer(input_tensor, input_tensor)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=[output_tensor, attention_scores])
model.summary()

sample_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 6, 8))
output, attention = model(sample_input)
print(output.shape)  # Output: (10, 6, 8)
print(attention.shape)  # Output: (10, 2, 6, 6)
```

This showcases the usage of `return_attention_scores`. The model now returns both the output tensor and the attention scores. The attention scores' shape reflects the batch size, number of heads, sequence length, and sequence length (as the attention is computed for every element against every other element in the sequence).

**Example 3:  Handling different query, key, and value tensors (advanced)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(6, 8))
query_dense = keras.layers.Dense(8)(input_tensor)
key_dense = keras.layers.Dense(8)(input_tensor)
value_dense = keras.layers.Dense(8)(input_tensor)
attention_layer = keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=2, key_dim=8)
output_tensor = attention_layer(query_dense, key_dense, value_dense)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)
model.summary()

sample_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 6, 8))
output = model(sample_input)
print(output.shape)  # Output: (10, 6, 8)
```

This example demonstrates a more complex scenario where the query, key, and value tensors are generated through separate dense layers. This provides more flexibility, allowing for different transformations of the input before the attention mechanism is applied.  This is particularly useful in cases where separate embeddings might be needed for different aspects of the input data.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on the `MultiHeadAttention` layer provides comprehensive details on its parameters and functionalities.  The "Deep Learning with Python" book by Francois Chollet offers a practical approach to understanding attention mechanisms within the Keras framework.  Furthermore, numerous research papers focusing on Transformer architectures and their applications provide in-depth theoretical insights into the workings of multi-head attention.  Carefully studying these resources will solidify your understanding of this layer and its applications.  Thorough experimentation with varying parameters and input data is also critical to mastering its usage.
