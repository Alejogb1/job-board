The behavior of Keras’s predicted output (`y_pred`) when using a custom loss function is primarily governed by how the gradients of that custom loss function are defined and interact with the model's parameters during backpropagation. This interaction, rather than any intrinsic property of `y_pred` itself, shapes the training dynamics and, ultimately, the quality of predictions produced. Specifically, the custom loss function's gradient calculation dictates how the model's weights are updated to minimize the chosen loss.

To clarify, `y_pred` in Keras (or any deep learning framework) represents the raw, unscaled output of the model's final layer, prior to any post-processing like argmax for classification. It’s typically a tensor of floating-point numbers. This tensor, when combined with the ground truth (`y_true`) within the loss function’s logic, provides the basis for calculating the error signal used to update model parameters via gradient descent. The custom loss function’s gradient calculation directly influences the direction and magnitude of these updates.

Let’s consider a scenario I encountered while developing a system to predict the optimal placement of network nodes in a virtualized environment. We utilized a simple feedforward network trained with backpropagation to output coordinates, each coordinate corresponding to a single network node location. This network was trained to output float values, later to be interpreted as locations. Initial experiments employed Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, but the system exhibited a tendency to place multiple nodes in very similar locations. This was due to MSE only penalizing distance between prediction and ground truth, it did not penalize overlapping locations. Therefore, I had to create a custom loss function to handle the overlapping issue. This exploration provides a concrete demonstration of the interplay between a custom loss and predicted output.

My initial attempt involved a simple modification of MSE with an added penalty term based on the overlap of the predicted node placements. Here's how the custom loss was implemented in TensorFlow/Keras:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_overlap_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Calculates MSE loss with an added penalty for node overlap.
    Assumes y_true and y_pred are tensors where the last dimension
    represents node coordinates in a 2D space.

    Args:
      y_true: Ground truth coordinates. Shape (batch_size, num_nodes, 2)
      y_pred: Predicted coordinates. Shape (batch_size, num_nodes, 2)
    Returns:
        Scalar loss value.
    """

    mse_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))
    
    # Calculate overlap penalty
    num_nodes = tf.shape(y_pred)[1]
    overlap_penalty = 0.0
    for i in range(num_nodes):
      for j in range(i+1, num_nodes):
        dist = tf.norm(y_pred[:, i, :] - y_pred[:, j, :], axis=1)
        overlap_penalty += tf.reduce_mean(tf.maximum(0.0, 1.0 - dist))

    return mse_loss + 0.1 * overlap_penalty
```
This custom loss function, `custom_overlap_loss`, calculates the mean squared error as usual but then iterates through all combinations of predicted node locations, calculating the distance between each pair. If this distance is below a predefined threshold (here effectively 1), a penalty is applied. The final loss is then the MSE plus an overlap penalty. This implementation directly affects how the model learns to position the nodes. It influences `y_pred` indirectly through the calculated gradient, because the gradient update pushes the model to change the `y_pred` locations to minimize overlap. The model's prediction is not directly altered in terms of its representation, but the model weights are guided to produce coordinates that avoid penalizing the loss.

The behavior of `y_pred`, therefore, is a consequence of minimizing the combined MSE and overlap penalty. The model's training is now geared towards a solution where the predicted locations are close to the actual locations (minimizing MSE) and are not too close to each other (minimizing the overlap penalty). Initially, the predictions might be overlapping heavily, but as the training progresses with the custom loss, `y_pred` will shift to reflect this altered objective function.

To further explore the interaction between custom loss functions and `y_pred`, I experimented with a different scenario. In this case, I wanted to force `y_pred` to be more discrete. This was for a separate system designed to generate a control sequence for an industrial robot, so the output coordinates needed to align with specific grid locations. I used the same simple feedforward neural net, with the output layer again producing floating point numbers. I needed to push these toward discrete locations in my workspace.

Here’s how the loss was implemented:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

def quantization_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  """
  Loss function which tries to force each y_pred coordinate to
  be close to some integer value.

  Args:
      y_true: Target/ground truth. Shape (batch_size, num_dims)
      y_pred: Predictions from the model. Shape (batch_size, num_dims)
  Returns:
      Loss as a scalar
  """

  # Assuming y_pred represents coordinates
  distance_to_int = tf.abs(y_pred - tf.round(y_pred))
  loss_value = tf.reduce_mean(distance_to_int) # Average deviation from integer.
  return loss_value

```

In this `quantization_loss` function, the loss is the mean absolute difference between each coordinate in `y_pred` and its nearest integer representation. I did *not* round `y_pred` directly; I wanted to encourage the network to produce outputs that were already close to whole numbers and not directly forcing them. This means that the gradients pushed the model parameters so that `y_pred` values were closer to the nearest integer, and the `y_pred` floats that were far from an integer contributed more significantly to the loss. If the loss was based on the rounded `y_pred` it would have produced a very poor gradient signal for training. This subtle difference highlights the nuanced impact that the loss function has on the model’s training dynamics.

This custom loss affected `y_pred` significantly. At the beginning of training, `y_pred` would contain real numbers with seemingly random magnitudes. However, as the model trained, the outputs were driven to be closer to integer values. `y_pred` did not change its underlying representation of floating-point values, but the training procedure modified the network's parameters to produce `y_pred` that satisfied the chosen loss criteria.

Finally, to solidify the concept, I explored a case where a custom loss was used to force predictions toward a specific range, as opposed to a specific value.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def range_loss(y_true, y_pred, min_val=-1.0, max_val=1.0):
  """
  Penalizes predictions outside the given range.

  Args:
      y_true: Target/ground truth. Shape (batch_size, num_dims)
      y_pred: Predictions from the model. Shape (batch_size, num_dims)
      min_val: Minimum allowed value in the range.
      max_val: Maximum allowed value in the range.
  Returns:
      Loss as a scalar
  """
  loss_value = 0.0
  min_penalty = tf.reduce_mean(tf.maximum(0.0, min_val - y_pred))
  max_penalty = tf.reduce_mean(tf.maximum(0.0, y_pred - max_val))
  loss_value = min_penalty + max_penalty

  return loss_value
```

The `range_loss` function penalizes predictions that fall outside a predefined range using hinge losses. This means if the prediction was less than `min_val`, the loss increased linearly based on how far below the prediction was. The same is true for values greater than `max_val`. In this case, `y_pred`'s behaviour will be that the outputs move to the specific region or range specified in the loss function. This shows that the custom loss, and its gradient calculations, are the primary driver behind `y_pred`'s behavior during the training process.

In summary, the behaviour of `y_pred` when using a custom loss function is primarily determined by how the gradient of this custom loss function guides the model's parameter updates. The model itself will not know *how* to change except through these gradients, which in turn change the output `y_pred`. The examples demonstrate how, by implementing custom losses, it's possible to steer `y_pred` toward desired behaviours. The use cases of node overlap avoidance, output quantization, and enforcing a specific value range highlight the flexibility and impact of defining custom loss functions.

For deeper study, I recommend focusing on texts covering gradient-based optimization, particularly backpropagation. In addition, detailed resources that explain the mathematical underpinnings of various loss functions, including both standard losses and custom designs, would be beneficial. Further studies focusing on common training issues and their mitigation will also help solidify a stronger intuition for why models perform the way they do during training.
