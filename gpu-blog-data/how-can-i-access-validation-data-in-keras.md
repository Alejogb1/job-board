Accessing validation data within the Keras workflow when employing scikit-learn's `GridSearchCV` requires a nuanced understanding of how both libraries handle data flow and model evaluation.  My experience optimizing hyperparameters for complex convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification highlighted the critical need for direct access to validation metrics during the grid search process.  Simply relying on the final `best_score_` attribute of `GridSearchCV` often proved insufficient for in-depth analysis and debugging.

The core issue stems from the fact that `GridSearchCV` inherently uses cross-validation on the training data provided.  Keras, on the other hand, typically uses a separate validation set, defined during model compilation.  `GridSearchCV` doesn't directly interact with this Keras-managed validation set; its scoring is based on the cross-validation folds of the training data. Therefore, to access validation metrics, we need a strategic approach involving custom scoring functions and careful data management.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The most reliable method involves crafting a custom scoring function that explicitly leverages the Keras `validation_data` argument during model fitting. This function calculates metrics on the designated validation set after each fold of the cross-validation process performed by `GridSearchCV`.  This necessitates separating your dataset into training and validation sets *before* feeding it to `GridSearchCV`.

The custom scorer receives a fitted Keras model as input and calculates the desired metrics using the model's `evaluate` method with the validation data.  The resulting metric is then returned to `GridSearchCV`, which uses this value for hyperparameter ranking.  Subsequently, accessing the validation metrics requires examining the `cv_results_` attribute of the fitted `GridSearchCV` object. This attribute contains a dictionary where the validation scores for each fold and each hyperparameter combination are explicitly available.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Custom scoring function for accuracy**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, KFold
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier

def custom_keras_scorer(estimator, X, y):
    """
    Custom scorer for Keras models using validation data.

    Args:
        estimator: Fitted KerasClassifier model.
        X: Training data (ignored in this scorer).
        y: Training labels (ignored in this scorer).

    Returns:
        Validation accuracy.
    """
    val_loss, val_acc = estimator.model.evaluate(X_val, y_val, verbose=0) #X_val and y_val defined separately.
    return val_acc

# Define your Keras model (example: a simple sequential model)
def create_model(units=32):
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(units, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model


#Create data (replace with your actual data)
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model)
param_grid = {'units': [32, 64, 128]}
grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, scoring=custom_keras_scorer, cv=KFold(3))
grid_result = grid.fit(X_train, y_train) #X_train and y_train are passed for cross-validation


#Access validation accuracy
print("Best: %f using %s" % (grid_result.best_score_, grid_result.best_params_))
means = grid_result.cv_results_['mean_test_score']
stds = grid_result.cv_results_['std_test_score']
params = grid_result.cv_results_['params']
for mean, stdev, param in zip(means, stds, params):
    print("%f (%f) with: %r" % (mean, stdev, param))
```

This example showcases a custom scorer explicitly using the pre-defined `X_val` and `y_val`. Note the crucial separation of the data into training and validation sets *before* initiating the grid search.


**Example 2: Handling multiple metrics**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, KFold
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer

def custom_keras_scorer_multiple(estimator, X, y):
    val_loss, val_acc, val_precision = estimator.model.evaluate(X_val, y_val, verbose=0)
    return {'accuracy': val_acc, 'precision': val_precision}

# ... (Keras model definition remains the same as in Example 1) ...

# ... (Data definition remains the same as in Example 1) ...

model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model)
param_grid = {'units': [32, 64, 128]}
grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, scoring=make_scorer(custom_keras_scorer_multiple, greater_is_better=True), cv=KFold(3))
grid_result = grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Accessing multiple metrics requires careful parsing of cv_results_
for i in range(len(grid_result.cv_results_['params'])):
    print(f"Hyperparameters: {grid_result.cv_results_['params'][i]}")
    print(f"Validation Accuracy: {grid_result.cv_results_['split0_test_accuracy'][i]}")
    print(f"Validation Precision: {grid_result.cv_results_['split0_test_precision'][i]}")
    # Repeat for split1, split2 etc., based on the number of folds in cv


```

This example expands upon the first by demonstrating how to return multiple metrics within the custom scorer and subsequently access those metrics from the `cv_results_` dictionary. Note the use of `make_scorer` to handle the dictionary output of the custom scorer.


**Example 3: Using callbacks for real-time validation monitoring (less precise for GridSearchCV)**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, KFold
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier
from keras.callbacks import Callback

class ValidationMetricsCallback(Callback):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ValidationMetricsCallback, self).__init__()
        self.validation_metrics = []

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        self.validation_metrics.append(logs)

# ... (Keras model definition remains similar to Example 1) ...

# ... (Data definition remains the same as in Example 1) ...

model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model)
param_grid = {'units': [32, 64, 128]}

# This approach is less reliable for accurate comparison across folds
# as epochs might vary and direct access to validation data within GridSearchCV is not provided.
grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, scoring='accuracy', cv=KFold(3))
validation_callback = ValidationMetricsCallback()
grid_result = grid.fit(X_train, y_train, callbacks=[validation_callback])

#Access Validation Metrics (Note: Less reliable for GridSearchCV due to variable number of epochs)
print(validation_callback.validation_metrics)

```

This approach, while providing real-time monitoring during training, is less reliable for precise comparison across different hyperparameter settings within `GridSearchCV`.  The number of epochs can vary between folds and hyperparameter combinations, making direct comparison of validation metrics difficult. It is best suited for monitoring individual model training rather than precise hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Scikit-learn documentation, Keras documentation,  books on machine learning and deep learning covering hyperparameter optimization techniques.  Advanced texts focusing on model evaluation and validation strategies will provide further insights.  Consider exploring the source code of `GridSearchCV` for a deeper understanding of its internal workings.  Understanding the interplay between scikit-learn's cross-validation strategy and Keras's model fitting and evaluation is crucial for effective implementation.
