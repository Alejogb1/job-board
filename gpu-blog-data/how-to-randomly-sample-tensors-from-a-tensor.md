TensorFlow's tensor manipulation capabilities extend beyond standard linear algebra operations; efficient random sampling from within a tensor is a crucial component of many machine learning workflows, particularly in areas like data augmentation, bootstrapping, and Monte Carlo methods.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition models at Xylos Corporation highlighted the performance implications of choosing the right sampling strategy.  Directly slicing a tensor based on randomly generated indices, while conceptually straightforward, becomes computationally inefficient for high-dimensional tensors and large sample sizes.  The optimal approach leverages TensorFlow's built-in functionalities designed for efficient random tensor operations.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Random sampling from a TensorFlow tensor involves selecting a subset of elements without replacement or with replacement, based on a defined probability distribution.  The most efficient methods avoid explicit looping or index generation for large tensors.  Instead, they utilize TensorFlow's optimized random number generation and gather operations.  The core strategy involves generating a random index tensor, consistent with the desired sampling methodology (e.g., uniform random sampling, weighted sampling), and then using TensorFlow's `tf.gather` or `tf.gather_nd` function to extract the corresponding elements from the original tensor.  The choice between `tf.gather` and `tf.gather_nd` depends on the dimensionality and structure of the index tensor.  `tf.gather` is suitable for 1D indices, while `tf.gather_nd` handles higher-dimensional indexing schemes.

Consider a scenario where we need to sample 'k' elements from a tensor 'T' of shape (N,).  For uniform random sampling without replacement, we could generate a random permutation of indices from 0 to N-1 and take the first 'k' elements.  For sampling with replacement, we could generate 'k' random indices independently from the range [0, N-1).  These indices are then used to extract the corresponding elements from the tensor 'T'.  Extending this logic to higher dimensional tensors involves generating multi-dimensional index tensors, reflecting the sampling requirements along each dimension.  The key is to utilize TensorFlow's capabilities to perform this index generation and the subsequent element retrieval efficiently.  In scenarios demanding weighted sampling, the probability distribution needs to be explicitly incorporated into the random index generation process, often using functions like `tf.random.categorical`.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Uniform Random Sampling Without Replacement from a 1D Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
tensor_a = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100])

# Number of samples
k = 3

# Generate random indices without replacement
indices = tf.random.shuffle(tf.range(tf.shape(tensor_a)[0]))[:k]

# Gather samples
samples = tf.gather(tensor_a, indices)

# Print results
print(f"Original Tensor: {tensor_a.numpy()}")
print(f"Sampled Indices: {indices.numpy()}")
print(f"Sampled Tensor: {samples.numpy()}")
```

This example demonstrates a basic uniform random sampling without replacement.  `tf.random.shuffle` efficiently permutes the indices, and `tf.gather` directly retrieves the elements.  The `.numpy()` method is used for convenient printing; in actual production code, this step should be minimized for performance reasons.

**Example 2:  Uniform Random Sampling With Replacement from a 2D Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
tensor_b = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Number of samples
k = 4

# Generate random indices with replacement
num_rows = tensor_b.shape[0]
num_cols = tensor_b.shape[1]
row_indices = tf.random.uniform((k,), minval=0, maxval=num_rows, dtype=tf.int32)
col_indices = tf.random.uniform((k,), minval=0, maxval=num_cols, dtype=tf.int32)

# Create multi-dimensional indices for tf.gather_nd
indices = tf.stack([row_indices, col_indices], axis=1)

# Gather samples
samples = tf.gather_nd(tensor_b, indices)

# Print results
print(f"Original Tensor:\n{tensor_b.numpy()}")
print(f"Sampled Indices:\n{indices.numpy()}")
print(f"Sampled Tensor: {samples.numpy()}")

```

Here, we sample from a 2D tensor with replacement.  `tf.random.uniform` generates random row and column indices independently.  `tf.stack` combines them into a suitable format for `tf.gather_nd`, which efficiently handles multi-dimensional indexing.


**Example 3: Weighted Random Sampling from a 1D Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
tensor_c = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

# Weights (probabilities must sum to 1)
weights = tf.constant([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.15])

# Number of samples
k = 2

# Generate weighted random indices
indices = tf.random.categorical(tf.math.log(weights), k)

# Gather samples
samples = tf.gather(tensor_c, tf.squeeze(indices, axis=1))

# Print results
print(f"Original Tensor: {tensor_c.numpy()}")
print(f"Weights: {weights.numpy()}")
print(f"Sampled Indices: {indices.numpy()}")
print(f"Sampled Tensor: {samples.numpy()}")
```

This example demonstrates weighted random sampling using `tf.random.categorical`.  The logarithmic transformation of weights is crucial for numerical stability;  this prevents potential underflow issues with very small probabilities. The `tf.squeeze` function removes the unnecessary dimension added by `tf.random.categorical`.
