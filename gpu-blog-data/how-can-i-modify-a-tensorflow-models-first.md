The core issue lies in the incompatibility between the input shape expected by a pre-trained TensorFlow convolutional neural network (CNN) and the number of channels present in your new input data.  This mismatch arises because the first convolutional layer's filters are specifically designed to operate on a predetermined number of input channels. Directly feeding data with a differing number of channels will result in a shape mismatch error during model execution.  My experience working on hyperspectral image classification extensively highlighted this challenge;  re-training the entire model is often computationally infeasible.  Therefore, efficient modification of the input layer is crucial.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

The solution involves modifying the first convolutional layer's weights and bias.  The input layer, generally a convolutional layer, has a kernel (filter) with a shape defined by `(filter_height, filter_width, input_channels, output_channels)`.  When we change the number of input channels, we need to adjust the kernel accordingly.  Simply changing the input shape will not suffice; the model needs to learn how to process the new channel information.  We can address this in three ways: adding channels, removing channels, or both, each with its own implications.


**Adding Channels:** If your new input has *more* channels than the original, you need to add new filter weights.  These new weights should be initialized randomly (using a suitable method like Xavier/Glorot initialization), to ensure the added channels do not disproportionately influence the model's early layers. This ensures fairness and helps avoid the training process being dominated by the newly added features. The existing weights remain untouched.

**Removing Channels:** If your new input has *fewer* channels, you must remove the corresponding filter weights and biases from the kernel.  Removing weights directly is simple, but care must be taken to ensure consistency.  Simply slicing the tensor is acceptable, but ensures the remaining weights are still correctly aligned with the remaining input channels.

**Both Adding and Removing Channels:** This is the most general case, combining the approaches above.  The strategy is the same: add new weights for the added channels (initialized randomly) and remove the weights corresponding to the removed channels.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The examples below utilize Keras, a high-level API for TensorFlow.  Assume `model` is a pre-trained model loaded using `tf.keras.models.load_model()`.

**Example 1: Adding Channels**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original model's input layer
original_input_layer = model.layers[0]
original_kernel = original_input_layer.kernel
original_bias = original_input_layer.bias
original_input_channels = original_kernel.shape[-2]

# New number of input channels
new_input_channels = original_input_channels + 2

# Create new kernel with added channels
new_kernel = tf.Variable(tf.concat([original_kernel, tf.keras.initializers.glorot_uniform()(
    (original_kernel.shape[0], original_kernel.shape[1], 2, original_kernel.shape[3]))], axis = -2))

# Keep original bias
new_bias = original_bias


#Reconstruct layer.  Note that this assumes the convolutional layer is the first and only the weights need modification.
model.layers[0].set_weights([new_kernel, new_bias])

#Verify changes
print(f"Original input channels: {original_input_channels}")
print(f"New input channels: {new_kernel.shape[-2]}")

```
This code snippet adds two input channels. The `tf.keras.initializers.glorot_uniform()` initializes the new weights to prevent biases. The key is using `tf.concat` to combine the existing kernel with newly initialized weights along the channel axis (-2). The bias remains unchanged since it relates to the output channels, not the input.

**Example 2: Removing Channels**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Original model's input layer
original_input_layer = model.layers[0]
original_kernel = original_input_layer.kernel
original_bias = original_input_layer.bias
original_input_channels = original_kernel.shape[-2]

# New number of input channels
new_input_channels = original_input_channels - 2

# Remove channels from kernel
new_kernel = original_kernel[:, :, :new_input_channels, :]

# Keep original bias
new_bias = original_bias

#Reconstruct layer
model.layers[0].set_weights([new_kernel, new_bias])


#Verify changes
print(f"Original input channels: {original_input_channels}")
print(f"New input channels: {new_kernel.shape[-2]}")
```
This example demonstrates removing two channels.  We simply slice the kernel along the channel dimension using array slicing. The bias remains unaffected.  The simplicity of this approach contrasts with adding channels, where weight initialization is crucial.


**Example 3:  Modifying Input Shape and Weights**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, Input

# Assume model is a sequential model
original_input_layer = model.layers[0]
original_kernel = original_input_layer.get_weights()[0]
original_bias = original_input_layer.get_weights()[1]
original_input_shape = original_input_layer.input_shape
original_input_channels = original_input_shape[-1]
new_input_channels = 5


# Define a new input layer with the desired number of channels
new_input = Input(shape=(original_input_shape[1], original_input_shape[2], new_input_channels))

# Create a new convolutional layer with the modified kernel and bias
if new_input_channels > original_input_channels:
  new_kernel = tf.Variable(tf.concat([original_kernel, tf.keras.initializers.glorot_uniform()(
    (original_kernel.shape[0], original_kernel.shape[1], new_input_channels-original_input_channels, original_kernel.shape[3]))], axis=-2))
else:
  new_kernel = original_kernel[:,:,:new_input_channels,:]

new_conv_layer = Conv2D(filters=original_kernel.shape[-1], kernel_size=original_kernel.shape[:2],
                     activation=original_input_layer.activation, use_bias=True,
                     weights=[new_kernel, original_bias])(new_input)



# Rebuild the model, replacing the original input layer
new_model = Model(inputs=new_input, outputs=new_conv_layer)
# Add remaining layers from the original model
for i in range(1,len(model.layers)):
    new_model.add(model.layers[i])

new_model.compile(optimizer=model.optimizer, loss=model.loss, metrics=model.metrics)

print(f"Original input channels: {original_input_channels}")
print(f"New input channels: {new_input_channels}")
```

This example demonstrates a more robust approach by building a new model with modified first layer, handling both cases of increased and decreased channels.   The remaining layers are added to maintain the pre-trained architecture. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex models or when the modifications require changes beyond just the weights and biases.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

"Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet,  "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, and the official TensorFlow documentation. These resources provide comprehensive coverage of the topics discussed, including detailed explanations of CNN architecture and layer manipulation within the TensorFlow/Keras framework.  Further study of weight initialization strategies will prove invaluable. Remember to always verify the changes made and monitor the model's performance after modification.
