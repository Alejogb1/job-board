TensorFlow's efficiency hinges on vectorized operations.  Directly iterating through tensors for conditional averaging is computationally inefficient and defeats the purpose of using a library designed for parallel processing.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural network training routines highlighted this precisely: naive approaches to threshold-based averaging introduced unacceptable performance bottlenecks. The optimal solution leverages TensorFlow's built-in functions for efficient element-wise operations and boolean masking.

**1. Explanation:**

The core strategy involves creating a boolean mask identifying elements exceeding the threshold. This mask is then used to select only those elements from the original tensor. Finally, TensorFlow's built-in reduction functions compute the average of the selected elements.  The key to efficiency is avoiding explicit loops and instead relying on TensorFlow's optimized tensor operations. This approach ensures that the computation is performed in parallel across the tensor's elements, leveraging the underlying hardware acceleration (GPUs or TPUs if available).  Furthermore, this method elegantly handles tensors of arbitrary dimensions, maintaining scalability and adaptability across diverse applications.  Failure to utilize this approach frequently results in significantly increased processing time, especially for large datasets.

Consider a tensor `x` and a threshold `t`. The steps are as follows:

1. **Create a boolean mask:**  This mask, `mask`, will be a tensor of the same shape as `x`, with `True` where elements in `x` are greater than `t`, and `False` otherwise.  This step leverages TensorFlow's element-wise comparison operators.

2. **Apply the mask:** This is achieved by using TensorFlow's boolean indexing, effectively selecting only the elements corresponding to `True` values in the `mask`.

3. **Calculate the average:** Finally, TensorFlow's `tf.reduce_mean()` function computes the average of the selected elements.  Handling potential division by zero (if no element exceeds the threshold) requires careful consideration.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple 1D Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
threshold = 3.0

mask = tf.greater(x, threshold)  # Creates boolean mask
filtered_x = tf.boolean_mask(x, mask)  # Applies mask
average = tf.reduce_mean(filtered_x) if tf.size(filtered_x) > 0 else 0.0 # Handles empty tensor

print(f"Tensor: {x.numpy()}")
print(f"Mask: {mask.numpy()}")
print(f"Filtered Tensor: {filtered_x.numpy()}")
print(f"Average of elements above {threshold}: {average.numpy()}")
```

This example demonstrates the basic workflow for a simple 1D tensor.  The `tf.greater()` function efficiently creates the boolean mask. `tf.boolean_mask()` selects the relevant elements, and the conditional statement prevents errors when no elements exceed the threshold.  The `.numpy()` method is used for clear output visualization; in production code, this conversion should be minimized for performance reasons.

**Example 2: Multi-Dimensional Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]])
threshold = 5.0

mask = tf.greater(x, threshold)
filtered_x = tf.boolean_mask(x, mask)
average = tf.reduce_mean(filtered_x) if tf.size(filtered_x) > 0 else 0.0

print(f"Tensor:\n{x.numpy()}")
print(f"Mask:\n{mask.numpy()}")
print(f"Filtered Tensor: {filtered_x.numpy()}")
print(f"Average of elements above {threshold}: {average.numpy()}")
```

This extends the concept to a 2D tensor.  The process remains identical; the boolean masking and averaging operations seamlessly adapt to higher dimensions.  Note that `tf.boolean_mask` flattens the resulting tensor; if preserving the original tensor shape is crucial, more complex reshaping might be necessary.

**Example 3:  Handling potential NaN values**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, float('nan')], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]])
threshold = 5.0

mask = tf.greater(x, threshold)
filtered_x = tf.boolean_mask(x, mask)
filtered_x = tf.where(tf.math.is_nan(filtered_x), tf.zeros_like(filtered_x), filtered_x) #Handle NaN values
average = tf.reduce_mean(filtered_x) if tf.size(filtered_x) > 0 else 0.0

print(f"Tensor:\n{x.numpy()}")
print(f"Mask:\n{mask.numpy()}")
print(f"Filtered Tensor: {filtered_x.numpy()}")
print(f"Average of elements above {threshold}: {average.numpy()}")

```

This example showcases handling potential `NaN` (Not a Number) values within the tensor.  The `tf.math.is_nan()` function identifies `NaN` values, and `tf.where()` replaces them with zeros before calculating the average. This prevents `NaN` values from propagating and corrupting the result.  Alternative strategies could involve ignoring `NaN` values entirely or using a different imputation technique, depending on the specific application requirements.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guidance on tensor manipulation and mathematical operations.  Thorough understanding of NumPy array operations is also beneficial, given the conceptual similarities.  Books on numerical computing and linear algebra offer valuable background knowledge for optimizing similar calculations within larger programs.  Finally, exploring TensorFlow's performance profiling tools is crucial for identifying and resolving bottlenecks in computationally intensive tasks.
