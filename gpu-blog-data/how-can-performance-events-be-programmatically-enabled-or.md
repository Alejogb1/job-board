Programmatically controlling performance events is crucial for isolating specific code segments during profiling and for minimizing the overhead of event collection when not required. The core mechanism usually involves a combination of operating system-level APIs, library hooks, and conditional logic within the profiled application itself. I’ve spent the last decade working on performance-critical systems, primarily in C++ and Python, and enabling or disabling these events dynamically has been a recurring necessity.

The most direct approach involves leveraging operating system specific profiling interfaces. These interfaces often provide mechanisms to start and stop event recording based on predefined criteria. For instance, on Linux, the perf subsystem exposes the `perf_event_open` system call, which can be paired with `ioctl` commands to control event monitoring. While direct interaction with this system call is sometimes needed for the most fine-grained control, higher-level libraries and frameworks often encapsulate these mechanisms for convenience. The key is to understand the underlying mechanics even when using helper tools.

The second, and often more practical method involves conditional instrumentation within the code. This approach uses conditional compilation flags, preprocessor directives, or runtime checks to decide whether or not to record an event. While it is less precise than system level control, it allows targeting events with a much higher degree of application context.

Thirdly, many modern profilers offer programmatic control through their API. These APIs vary significantly depending on the profiler. Using these APIs means working within the specific profiling tool’s ecosystem, which may be a limitation, but also brings benefits including integration with the profiler's visualization tools.

Let's examine each approach with examples.

**Example 1: Conditional Compilation (C++)**

This example illustrates how preprocessor directives can control event instrumentation. It is suitable when the decision to enable or disable an event is known at compile-time.

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Define a macro to control event recording.
#define ENABLE_PERF_EVENTS 1 // Set to 0 to disable events

// A basic timing helper function
struct Timer {
    std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::time_point start;

    Timer() {
        start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
    }

    ~Timer() {
        auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end - start).count();
        #if ENABLE_PERF_EVENTS
            std::cout << "Elapsed time: " << duration << " us\n";
        #endif
    }
};


void some_function() {
    Timer t; // starts timer
    // Some work here
    std::string s;
    for(int i=0; i < 10000; i++){
      s += "test";
    }
}


int main() {
  some_function();
  return 0;
}

```

*   **Explanation:** The macro `ENABLE_PERF_EVENTS` acts as a switch. When set to 1, timing details are printed. When set to 0, the timing instrumentation is effectively removed from the compiled code. The `Timer` structure uses RAII to automatically track the duration. The conditional compilation with the `#if ENABLE_PERF_EVENTS` block makes the logging of the timer duration dependant on the value of the macro.
*   **Usage:** When compiling, one can set the `#define` to 0 to remove overhead of the `std::cout` statement during production builds.
*   **Caveats:** This approach is limited to compile-time decisions. It requires recompilation to change the event enablement status. It also requires code duplication to have the timer logic in both the compiled and uncompiled paths.

**Example 2: Runtime Conditional Logic (Python)**

This example demonstrates runtime-based control over event recording, useful when enablement depends on program state. It utilizes a global variable that can be modified during execution.

```python
import time
import os

# Global flag to control event recording
record_events = True

def time_function(func, *args, **kwargs):
    global record_events
    if record_events:
        start = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        duration = (end - start) * 1000 * 1000
        print(f"Function {func.__name__} took {duration:.2f} microseconds")
    else:
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
    return result


def some_function(n):
    acc = 0
    for i in range(n):
        acc += os.urandom(1)[0] # some work here
    return acc


if __name__ == "__main__":
    time_function(some_function, 10000)
    record_events = False
    time_function(some_function, 10000)
```

*   **Explanation:** The `record_events` global variable acts as a runtime switch. The `time_function` decorator wraps the original function, and only records execution time when `record_events` is set to `True`.
*   **Usage:** In this example, the first call will output the time to complete, while the second does not because the `record_events` flag has been switched to `False`.
*   **Caveats:** There is still a minimal overhead due to the conditional check. This approach may be difficult to scale if there are hundreds or thousands of events in play. Debugging and reasoning about the state of the flags across larger programs can become error-prone.

**Example 3: Profiler API (Simplified C++)**

This example shows how a hypothetical profiling API might control the start and end of an event. While I am not going to use a specific third-party tool, the principle remains the same across profilers. This is where understanding the core concepts is important for adaptation to your specific chosen tool.

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>

// Hypothetical Profiler API
class ProfilerAPI {
public:
    static void start_event(const std::string& name) {
        if (enabled) {
            std::cout << "Event Start: " << name << "\n";
            // Real implementation would initiate event recording
            start_time = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
        }
    }

    static void end_event(const std::string& name) {
      if (enabled) {
            auto end_time = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
            auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end_time - start_time).count();
            std::cout << "Event End: " << name << " Duration: " << duration << " us\n";
            // Real implementation would terminate event recording and report data
      }
    }

    static void enable_profiling(bool enable) {
        enabled = enable;
    }

private:
    static bool enabled;
    static std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::time_point start_time;
};

bool ProfilerAPI::enabled = true;
std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::time_point ProfilerAPI::start_time;

void some_function(){
    ProfilerAPI::start_event("some_function");
    // Some work here
    for(int i = 0; i < 100000; i++){
        double x = i* 2.0;
    }
    ProfilerAPI::end_event("some_function");
}

int main() {
  some_function();
  ProfilerAPI::enable_profiling(false);
  some_function();
  return 0;
}
```

*   **Explanation:** This class provides static methods to `start_event`, `end_event`, and `enable_profiling`. The `enabled` boolean controls the recording. The real-world implementation of such API would be very specific to the profiler you are using, however the general pattern of enabling and disabling specific named events is a common characteristic across them.
*   **Usage:** In this example the first call to some_function will have start and end events printed, whilst the second call will not.
*   **Caveats:** This is a simplified interface. Real profiler APIs are often more intricate, potentially requiring asynchronous operation and additional data processing. It is also specific to this particular interface.

For more in-depth learning I recommend exploring the documentation for specific profiling tools and techniques. Books on system programming, operating systems concepts, and advanced C++ and Python programming techniques are good sources of knowledge. For instance, "Operating System Concepts" by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of operating systems. "Effective Modern C++" by Scott Meyers offers excellent techniques for writing efficient C++ code. For a Python specific resource, “Fluent Python” by Luciano Ramalho, provides in depth coverage of many of the more advanced Python concepts.  Furthermore, consider attending talks and presentations at relevant conferences; often new techniques and strategies are presented in such environments.
