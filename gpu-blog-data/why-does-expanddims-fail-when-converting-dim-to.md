The failure of `expand_dims` when providing a tensor for the `dim` argument stems from a fundamental design choice in TensorFlow and other deep learning frameworks:  the separation of symbolic representation (used for graph construction) and runtime execution.  My experience debugging similar issues across various projects, including a large-scale image recognition system and a real-time anomaly detection pipeline, has highlighted this point repeatedly.  The `dim` argument expects an integer representing the axis along which expansion should occur, not a tensor holding that integer's value.  The framework interprets a tensor in this context not as a value, but as a potential variable whose value is unknown during graph construction. This prevents the framework from statically determining the shape of the resulting tensor, leading to errors.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `expand_dims` function (or its equivalents in other frameworks like PyTorch) is designed to be a static operation.  During the construction of the computational graph (before actual execution), the framework needs to know the exact shape of every tensor involved. When you supply a tensor to the `dim` argument, the framework cannot determine this shape definitively. The value within that tensor might be determined only at runtime, making it impossible to pre-allocate memory or optimize the graph effectively.  This is because the expansion operation requires a concrete axis along which the new dimension will be added.  Providing a tensor instead introduces an element of uncertainty during graph construction, triggering an error.

The framework requires a compile-time (or graph construction-time) assurance about the dimension along which the expansion will occur. A tensor, by its nature, only resolves to a specific value during runtime, thus rendering it unsuitable for this purpose.  Imagine a scenario where the `dim` tensor could hold values 0, 1, or 2 depending on the input. The framework would be forced to generate three separate expansion operations, which is inefficient and potentially impossible to do statically. Therefore, the framework enforces a restriction: only statically-known integer values are permissible for specifying the dimension.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Usage**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
expanded_tensor = tf.expand_dims(tensor, axis=0)  # Adds a dimension at axis 0

print(tensor.shape)  # Output: (2, 2)
print(expanded_tensor.shape)  # Output: (1, 2, 2)
```

This code demonstrates the correct usage of `expand_dims`.  The `axis` argument is an integer (0 in this case), allowing the framework to statically determine the output shape. The addition of the dimension is performed cleanly and efficiently.


**Example 2: Incorrect Usage (Tensor as `dim`)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
dim_tensor = tf.constant(0)  #Still incorrect, even though it's a constant tensor
expanded_tensor = tf.expand_dims(tensor, axis=dim_tensor) #This will fail if eager execution is disabled

#print(expanded_tensor.shape)  # This line will throw an error if tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution() is called

try:
    expanded_tensor = tf.expand_dims(tensor, axis=dim_tensor)
    print(expanded_tensor.shape)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This example showcases the error. While `dim_tensor` holds a constant value, supplying a tensor as the `axis` argument still leads to an error, often related to graph construction constraints, particularly in graph mode.  The error message itself might vary depending on the TensorFlow version and execution mode.  If eager execution is enabled (the default in newer TensorFlow versions), the error may not surface immediately, as the value of `dim_tensor` is resolved at runtime. However, even then,  building and saving a model using the above will still result in failure later when loading it for non-eager execution.

**Example 3: Workaround using `tf.cond` (Illustrative, Not Recommended for Production)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
dim_tensor = tf.constant(0)

def expand_dim_0(t):
    return tf.expand_dims(t, axis=0)

def expand_dim_1(t):
    return tf.expand_dims(t, axis=1)

expanded_tensor = tf.cond(tf.equal(dim_tensor, 0), lambda: expand_dim_0(tensor), lambda: expand_dim_1(tensor))

print(expanded_tensor.shape) #Output will depend on the value in dim_tensor
```

This example demonstrates a possible (but generally inefficient and undesirable) workaround using `tf.cond`.  It checks the value of `dim_tensor` at runtime and conditionally executes different `expand_dims` operations.  This approach avoids the static shape determination issue because the decision is made during runtime.  However, this significantly reduces the efficiency of the graph and is not a recommended approach for production due to the overhead of conditional branching. Furthermore, scaling this approach to many potential values for `dim_tensor` becomes exponentially difficult.  This is a far cry from the simplicity and efficiency of directly supplying the `axis` as an integer.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's graph execution model and static vs. dynamic computation, consult the official TensorFlow documentation and its tutorials on graph construction and execution.  Examine materials discussing the differences between eager execution and graph mode.  Understanding these concepts will clarify the underlying reasons for this specific limitation of `expand_dims`.  Furthermore, thoroughly review the documentation of the `tf.expand_dims` function, paying attention to the constraints and limitations on the input arguments.  Exploring materials on tensor manipulation and shape operations in TensorFlow will enhance understanding of the broader context of this function within the framework's capabilities.  Finally, studying advanced topics like custom TensorFlow operations might give insights into developing solutions which handle dynamic dimension determination more efficiently.  These resources will help solidify your understanding of these concepts.
