The 2018 Intel Python distribution for Linux did not directly include a conda package for Intel's optimized TensorFlow.  My experience working on large-scale machine learning projects at that time involved extensive interaction with Intel's offerings, and this was a recurring point of friction. While the distribution bundled optimized libraries for other components of the data science stack, TensorFlow's integration was managed separately, predominantly through a dedicated installer or via a separate conda channel maintained by Intel.  This necessitated a multi-step installation process, distinct from a simple `conda install` command.

This separation stemmed from the rapid evolution of TensorFlow's ecosystem in 2018.  Intel's optimization efforts required tight coupling with specific TensorFlow releases, making consistent inclusion within a general-purpose Python distribution challenging.  Furthermore, managing dependencies within a conda environment, especially for highly specialized packages like optimized TensorFlow, required a more controlled approach beyond a straightforward distribution bundling.  The separate channel or installer allowed for better version management and targeted patching, ensuring compatibility with specific Intel hardware and driver versions.

Let's clarify this with concrete examples illustrating the installation process in that period, showcasing the differences and the steps needed to utilize Intel's optimized TensorFlow.


**Example 1: Direct Installation from Intel's Installer**

During that period, Intel provided standalone installers for their optimized TensorFlow package.  This approach bypassed the conda package manager entirely. The installer typically handled all dependency management internally, ensuring compatibility with the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) and other required components.

```bash
# Download the Intel Optimized TensorFlow installer for your specific Linux distribution and TensorFlow version.
# Example command (replace with actual filename and path):
wget https://example.intel.com/intel-tensorflow-2.0-linux-x86_64.sh

# Make the installer executable:
chmod +x intel-tensorflow-2.0-linux-x86_64.sh

# Run the installer, carefully following the on-screen prompts:
sudo ./intel-tensorflow-2.0-linux-x86_64.sh
```

This method provided the most direct path to installation, particularly for users prioritizing ease of use and who were less concerned with managing the environment through conda. However, this approach risked dependency conflicts if other Python packages relied on different TensorFlow versions or related libraries.


**Example 2: Utilizing Intel's Dedicated Conda Channel**

Intel maintained a separate conda channel containing their optimized TensorFlow builds.  This approach allowed for better integration within conda environments, but required users to add the channel and then perform the installation.  This method provided better isolation and dependency management than direct installation but required greater user familiarity with conda.

```bash
# Add Intel's conda channel:
conda config --add channels intel

# Update conda's package index:
conda update -n base -c defaults conda

# Install Intel's optimized TensorFlow (replace with correct package name and version):
conda install -c intel intel-tensorflow-2.0
```

This method ensured better compatibility with other packages managed through conda, reducing the risk of unforeseen dependency conflicts. However, it did require an understanding of conda channels and the potential need to manage conflicting dependencies manually.  This was particularly relevant if other packages within the conda environment depended on a non-Intel optimized TensorFlow.



**Example 3:  Manual Environment Creation with Specific Dependencies (Advanced)**

For advanced users, particularly those requiring very fine-grained control over the environment, building a custom conda environment was the most robust solution.  This involved specifying all dependencies, including the Intel MKL and other libraries, ensuring absolute compatibility.  This required a deep understanding of TensorFlow's dependencies and the Intel optimized libraries.

```bash
# Create a new conda environment:
conda create -n intel-tf python=3.7

# Activate the environment:
conda activate intel-tf

# Install Intel MKL and other necessary libraries (replace with actual package names and versions):
conda install -c conda-forge mkl

# Download and install Intel's optimized TensorFlow manually (if not available through conda):
# ... (steps similar to example 1, potentially needing to link MKL appropriately) ...

# Install other TensorFlow-related dependencies:
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow-addons  # Example additional package

```

This example illustrates the most complex and controlled approach.  It demanded detailed knowledge of both the Intel tools and the TensorFlow ecosystem. However, it offered the greatest flexibility and allowed for the construction of an optimally configured environment tailored to specific project needs and hardware configurations.


**Resource Recommendations:**

Intel's official documentation at the time (archived versions may be available),  the conda documentation, and the official TensorFlow documentation.  Thorough reading of these sources would have been essential to navigate the intricacies of the installation process in 2018.  Furthermore, searching within the Intel developer forums would have provided access to community support and solutions to common installation challenges.  Finally, understanding the differences between the various builds of TensorFlow (CPU, GPU, etc.) and their corresponding dependencies was crucial.
