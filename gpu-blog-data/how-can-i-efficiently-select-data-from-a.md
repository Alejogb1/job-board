My experience optimizing database queries, particularly with large datasets, has shown that understanding index usage is paramount for performance. When a table possesses multiple indexes and your `WHERE` clause specifically targets a column covered by *one* of those indexes, the database engine doesn't always automatically select the optimal path. The key is to understand how the query planner works and to use that to your advantage.

The core issue revolves around the fact that while a table might have multiple indexes, only *one* index is typically utilized per table lookup in most database scenarios for a single query. This index is selected by the query planner based on a cost-based analysis. The planner evaluates different potential access paths—using a specific index, performing a full table scan, or even a merge-join operation with another table (though that's outside our immediate scope)—and chooses the path it deems least expensive. The "cost" is usually a combination of factors like the number of disk I/O operations, CPU time, and memory usage. Consequently, simply having an index on a column doesn't guarantee its use if the planner judges another access method to be more efficient.

Therefore, when you have a `WHERE` clause targeting a column covered by an index, it is critically important to ensure the database utilizes *that* specific index. The absence of such selection can result in a full table scan, dramatically increasing query execution time, particularly as table sizes increase. A common misconception is that if an index exists, the database will automatically use it whenever the indexed column appears in the `WHERE` clause, but this is not necessarily the case. Several conditions can prevent index usage. Firstly, the data distribution itself impacts the choice. For example, if a column contains only a few unique values, the optimizer might determine that a full table scan is faster than using the index because the cost to locate many rows via index is higher than scanning all rows. Secondly, the specific query expression can impede index usage. For instance, using functions on the indexed column in the WHERE clause can force the database to scan every row. Thirdly, the cost analysis might be skewed by statistics that don't accurately represent the data. Maintaining updated database statistics is crucial for optimal plan generation.

Consider, for example, a table `products` with columns `product_id`, `category_id`, and `price`, having a primary key on `product_id` and a non-clustered index on `category_id`.

**Example 1: Sub-Optimal Index Usage (Leading to a Table Scan)**

Suppose we execute the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE category_id = 10;
```

Initially, without any database statistics, or with outdated statistics, the query planner might incorrectly choose a full table scan. I've frequently seen this in development environments with limited test data, where the planner incorrectly estimates that the proportion of rows matching the condition is very high. This is especially true if your table has a very large number of rows, and the `category_id` has very few distinct values. In essence, it is making a poor decision based on skewed or absent information. The `WHERE` clause is straightforward, and the index `idx_category_id` should be the natural selection. However, the planner might disregard this index because it believes that accessing most of the table's rows through the index is inefficient when compared to a straight table scan. This often happens when the number of rows having a specific `category_id` is a large proportion of the table.

To rectify this, you might need to update database statistics:

```sql
ANALYZE TABLE products;  -- (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
UPDATE STATISTICS products; -- (SQL Server)
```

After updating statistics, the planner has a better understanding of the cardinality of each column and can make better decisions.

**Example 2: Index Utilization (After Updating Statistics)**

Following statistics updates, and assuming there are sufficient values for `category_id`, the same query may now leverage the index effectively:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE category_id = 10;
```

This time, the planner understands the distribution of `category_id` values and correctly chooses `idx_category_id`. The query executes much faster as the database can now jump directly to relevant rows, avoiding a full table scan. This highlights the critical role of updated statistics. In real-world projects, incorporating regular database statistics updates in maintenance tasks has always provided significant performance gains. The statistics give the query planner accurate insight into the distribution of data, which is the foundation for making informed index selection decisions.

**Example 3: Index Usage with Additional Filtering**

Now let's introduce an additional condition not explicitly covered by the index.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE category_id = 10
  AND price > 100;
```

Here, the planner will still likely use the index on `category_id`, as the selectivity of the `category_id` condition provides an initial subset of data. This indexed result set is then filtered based on `price > 100`. Though a composite index on `category_id` and `price` *could* potentially further improve this query's performance (and should be considered if you frequently query using both columns), the crucial point is the query planner chooses the index on `category_id` as the primary access path based on its selectivity.

In situations where you're having trouble convincing the query planner to choose your desired index, you can examine query execution plans, which detail which indexes the query is using, and how it’s using them. Tools for viewing execution plans are included in most database management tools. Sometimes, a query might seem that it *should* use the index, but for one reason or another, it isn’t. Examining the plan will usually reveal the reason. Common issues are not having updated statistics or that the condition on the indexed column is not as selective as you think it is.

In conclusion, efficient data selection with indexes requires an understanding of the query planner's operation and data statistics. Simple index existence is insufficient; the database needs accurate cost information to make optimal decisions. Updating database statistics and examining execution plans are vital for diagnosing and resolving performance issues when dealing with multiple indexes. Beyond the points explored, I’ve also found further value in carefully crafting SQL conditions to promote index usage. Often, slight changes in how a SQL condition is structured can lead to significant performance differences by enabling better index selections from the query planner. For example, sometimes switching from functions to direct column comparison, avoiding the use of `OR`, or ensuring the use of single value comparisons with indexes can drive performance up. These strategies, learned from real projects, have proven essential in maximizing database query performance.

For additional learning, consult your specific database engine's documentation regarding query optimization. Publications like "SQL Performance Explained" and "Effective SQL" offer valuable insights into SQL optimization techniques. Consider exploring resources on database indexing strategies, and delve into material detailing query plan analysis. The principles outlined in those sources will significantly aid in tackling complex query optimization problems and provide a strong foundation for writing efficient database queries.
