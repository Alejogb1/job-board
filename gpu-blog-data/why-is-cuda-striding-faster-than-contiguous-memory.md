CUDA's performance advantage with strided memory access over contiguous access isn't universal; it's a nuanced situation dependent on several interacting factors, primarily the stride length and the hardware architecture.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing kernels for geophysical simulations has repeatedly demonstrated that while contiguous memory access is generally preferred, carefully structured strided access can outperform it under specific conditions.  The key lies in understanding how CUDA's memory hierarchy and coalesced memory transactions interact with access patterns.

**1. Explanation of the Phenomenon:**

The perceived speed advantage of strided access in certain CUDA kernels stems from a misinterpretation of performance metrics or arises in specific scenarios where the stride pattern aligns with the underlying hardware.  Contiguous memory access is inherently faster because it allows for coalesced memory transactions.  A coalesced memory transaction involves multiple threads accessing consecutive memory locations within a single warp (a group of 32 threads).  The GPU efficiently transfers this block of data in a single memory request.  This significantly reduces the overhead associated with individual memory transactions, leading to higher bandwidth utilization.

However, when accessing memory with a stride, the threads within a warp might access non-contiguous memory locations.  If the stride is not a multiple of the warp size, multiple memory transactions are required, negating the advantage of coalesced memory access.  This leads to fragmentation of memory requests, significantly decreasing bandwidth and increasing latency.  This is usually the case, and therefore, contiguous memory access is favored.

The exception arises when the stride length aligns perfectly with the underlying memory architecture's organization.  For example, if the stride neatly aligns with the size of a cache line or a memory page, the GPU can prefetch data effectively, potentially mitigating the negative impact of non-coalesced memory access.  This is unlikely to occur accidentally and requires careful programming and understanding of the target GPU's architecture. Another factor is the data size. For small data sets, the overhead of managing non-coalesced memory accesses might be insignificant compared to the computational cost of the kernel.

Furthermore, my work has shown that the observed speed differences are often amplified by profiling inaccuracies or improper benchmarking methodologies.  Inaccurate timing mechanisms or neglecting other performance-limiting factors (e.g., insufficient register usage, excessive branch divergence) can mask the true impact of memory access patterns.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the impact of different memory access patterns on CUDA kernel performance.  These examples are simplified for clarity but highlight the core concepts.

**Example 1: Contiguous Access (Optimal)**

```c++
__global__ void contiguousKernel(float *input, float *output, int N) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    output[i] = input[i] * 2.0f;
  }
}
```

This kernel demonstrates ideal contiguous memory access.  Each thread accesses a consecutive element in both the input and output arrays.  This maximizes coalesced memory transactions, leading to optimal performance.

**Example 2: Non-Coalesced Access (Suboptimal)**

```c++
__global__ void nonCoalescedKernel(float *input, float *output, int N, int stride) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    output[i] = input[i * stride] * 2.0f;
  }
}
```

This kernel introduces a stride.  Unless `stride` is a multiple of the warp size (32), this will result in non-coalesced memory access.  Performance will degrade significantly as the stride increases, particularly for larger values of `N`.

**Example 3: Potentially Optimized Strided Access (Specific Scenario)**

```c++
__global__ void potentiallyOptimizedKernel(float *input, float *output, int N, int stride) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < N) {
    int index = i * stride;
    // Assuming stride is a multiple of the cache line size for potential prefetching
    output[index] = input[index] * 2.0f;
  }
}
```

This kernel uses a stride, but the assumption is made that `stride` is carefully chosen to align with the underlying memory architecture's organization.  This *might* lead to improved performance compared to the non-coalesced example, but only under very specific circumstances concerning the stride value and hardware characteristics.  Without this alignment, the performance will still be inferior to contiguous access.  Testing and profiling are crucial to validate the performance in this case.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the CUDA Programming Guide, the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide, and the relevant GPU architecture specifications from NVIDIA.  Furthermore, studying performance analysis tools such as NVIDIA Nsight Compute and the NVIDIA Visual Profiler is essential for identifying memory access bottlenecks and optimizing CUDA code effectively.  Finally, dedicated textbooks on parallel computing and GPU programming provide invaluable theoretical background.



In conclusion, while CUDA may *appear* faster with strided memory access in isolated cases due to specific hardware alignment or small dataset sizes, it's crucial to understand that contiguous memory access remains the preferred approach for achieving optimal performance in most scenarios.  The perception of faster execution with strides often arises from overlooked factors or specific, unlikely hardware alignments.  Careful profiling, meticulous code design, and a deep understanding of the GPU's memory architecture are crucial for effective CUDA programming and avoiding performance pitfalls related to memory access patterns.
