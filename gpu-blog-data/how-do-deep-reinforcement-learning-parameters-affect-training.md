The dominant factor influencing training time in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) applied to simple games is the interplay between exploration-exploitation strategies and network architecture complexity.  Over my years working on agent development for retro-style arcade games, I've observed that poorly tuned hyperparameters can lead to exponential increases in training time, even in seemingly straightforward environments.  This is primarily due to the agent's inability to efficiently balance the need to explore the state-action space and exploit already discovered rewarding strategies.  Furthermore, excessively complex neural networks increase computational demands, exacerbating the training time issue.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Training a DRL agent involves iteratively updating its policy, a mapping from states to actions, based on interaction with the environment. The core of this process relies on the agent receiving rewards, positive or negative signals indicating the desirability of its actions.  The agent learns to maximize cumulative rewards over time.  Key hyperparameters significantly impacting training speed include:

* **Learning Rate (α):** This parameter controls the step size during policy updates.  A smaller learning rate leads to more stable but slower learning, while a larger learning rate can result in faster learning but potentially unstable training dynamics, causing oscillations or divergence.  Finding an optimal learning rate often requires experimentation using techniques like grid search or more sophisticated optimization methods.  My experience suggests that starting with a smaller learning rate and gradually increasing it if progress is slow can be a robust approach.

* **Discount Factor (γ):** This parameter determines the importance of future rewards compared to immediate rewards. A high discount factor emphasizes long-term rewards, leading agents to plan further ahead. This can result in better long-term performance but might slow down initial learning.  A lower discount factor prioritizes immediate rewards, potentially leading to faster initial learning but potentially suboptimal strategies in the long run.  The choice depends on the nature of the game; games with distant rewards benefit from a high γ, whereas those with immediate rewards might perform better with a lower γ.

* **Exploration Strategy:**  The exploration-exploitation dilemma is central to DRL.  Exploration involves trying out new actions to discover potentially rewarding states, while exploitation involves repeatedly performing actions known to yield high rewards.  Common exploration strategies include ε-greedy (random action selection with probability ε), softmax action selection (probabilistic action selection based on estimated action values), and more advanced techniques like Boltzmann exploration and noisy networks.  The choice and tuning of the exploration strategy significantly affect training speed.  Insufficient exploration can lead to the agent getting stuck in local optima, requiring substantially longer training times to escape.  Excessive exploration, on the other hand, can lead to inefficient learning due to wasted time on unproductive actions.  In my experience, gradually decreasing ε in ε-greedy exploration or adjusting the temperature parameter in softmax exploration has often proved effective.

* **Network Architecture:** The complexity of the neural network used to represent the agent's policy directly affects training time.  Deeper and wider networks possess greater representational capacity but require more computational resources and longer training times.  Simpler networks may learn faster but might not be able to capture the nuances of the game, leading to suboptimal performance.  Careful consideration of network architecture is crucial for balancing performance and computational efficiency.  Experimenting with different network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks for image-based inputs and recurrent neural networks for sequential data, is essential to finding a suitable balance.  Feature engineering can also play a crucial role in reducing the required complexity of the neural network, thus accelerating the learning process.

* **Batch Size:** In many DRL algorithms, updates are performed on batches of experiences. A larger batch size provides more stable updates but requires more memory and may lead to slower training.  A smaller batch size might be computationally cheaper but may result in noisier updates and slower convergence.  The optimal batch size depends on the available computational resources and the specific algorithm used.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the impact of hyperparameters in a simple CartPole environment using the Stable Baselines3 library (Python).  These examples are illustrative; actual results may vary depending on the hardware and specific random seed.

**Example 1: Impact of Learning Rate**

```python
import gymnasium as gym
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv

env = DummyVecEnv([lambda: gym.make("CartPole-v1")])

# Model with small learning rate
model_small_lr = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, learning_rate=0.0001, verbose=1)
model_small_lr.learn(total_timesteps=100000)

# Model with large learning rate
model_large_lr = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, learning_rate=0.01, verbose=1)
model_large_lr.learn(total_timesteps=100000)

# Evaluate and compare performance
```

This code compares training with a small and large learning rate. The `verbose=1` parameter displays training progress. The smaller learning rate will likely exhibit slower initial progress, but may be more stable and avoid divergence.  The larger learning rate might show rapid initial improvement, but could become unstable, potentially requiring adjustments or termination before reaching the desired performance.


**Example 2: Impact of Discount Factor**

```python
import gymnasium as gym
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv

env = DummyVecEnv([lambda: gym.make("CartPole-v1")])

# Model with low discount factor
model_low_gamma = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, gamma=0.9, verbose=1)
model_low_gamma.learn(total_timesteps=100000)

# Model with high discount factor
model_high_gamma = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, gamma=0.99, verbose=1)
model_high_gamma.learn(total_timesteps=100000)

# Evaluate and compare performance
```

This example demonstrates the effect of the discount factor.  A lower discount factor will prioritize immediate rewards, possibly leading to faster initial learning but potentially a less optimal long-term strategy.  The higher discount factor will encourage the agent to plan further into the future, resulting in potentially better but slower learning.

**Example 3: Impact of Exploration Strategy**

```python
import gymnasium as gym
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv

env = DummyVecEnv([lambda: gym.make("CartPole-v1")])

# Model with epsilon-greedy exploration
model_epsilon_greedy = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, exploration_fraction=0.1, exploration_final_eps=0.01, verbose=1)
model_epsilon_greedy.learn(total_timesteps=100000)

# Model with softmax exploration (requires modification of the PPO algorithm; not directly supported in default implementation)
# This would require custom implementation or utilizing a different algorithm offering softmax exploration.

# Evaluate and compare performance
```

This demonstrates the usage of ε-greedy exploration.  `exploration_fraction` controls the initial exploration rate, gradually decaying to `exploration_final_eps`.  The second part highlights that implementing alternative exploration strategies like softmax often requires modifications to the standard algorithm or using alternative libraries offering such functionalities.  Careful parameter selection for each strategy is crucial to avoid ineffective exploration.
