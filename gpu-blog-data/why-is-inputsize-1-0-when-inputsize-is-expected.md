The issue of `input.size(-1)` returning 0 when an input size of 28 is expected frequently stems from a mismatch between the expected tensor dimensions and the actual tensor's structure, often originating from data loading or preprocessing errors.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous PyTorch projects, particularly those involving image classification, has shown this to be a common pitfall.  The crucial point here is that `input.size(-1)` accesses the size of the *last* dimension.  If this dimension is unexpectedly 0, it indicates the tensor is likely either empty or improperly shaped.


**1. Explanation:**

The PyTorch `size()` method, when called with the index `-1`, retrieves the size of the last dimension of a tensor.  A return value of 0 explicitly states that the last dimension contains no elements.  Therefore, the problem isn't merely a discrepancy in the *total* number of elements; it points specifically to a deficiency in the final dimension of your tensor. This usually points to one of three main sources:

* **Empty Dataset/Batch:**  The most straightforward cause is an empty dataset or an empty batch being passed to your model.  If your dataloader is not functioning correctly or if filtering has inadvertently removed all samples, the result will be an empty tensor, causing `input.size(-1)` to be 0.  Double-check your data loading pipeline and the size of your batches.

* **Incorrect Data Transformation:**  During data preprocessing (e.g., image resizing, normalization, augmentation), an error might inadvertently reshape or completely remove the final dimension of your input tensor. This can manifest if a transformation applies incorrectly or is accidentally skipped.  Examine each step of your data pipeline closely.  For images, for instance, if the channels are unexpectedly removed or if the image's height or width becomes zero after resizing, this would lead to the observed issue.

* **Incompatible Data Type:** Your data loading might be attempting to interpret data in an unexpected format. For instance,  if you are attempting to load image data expecting a tensor but instead encounter a null or an empty array, this will result in `input.size(-1)` returning 0. Check the consistency of your input data types throughout the loading and pre-processing steps.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**


**Example 1: Empty Batch Issue**

```python
import torch

# Simulating an empty batch
empty_batch = torch.empty(0, 28, 28, 1) # Example: 0 samples, 28x28 images, 1 channel

print(empty_batch.size())  # Output: torch.Size([0, 28, 28, 1])
print(empty_batch.size(-1)) # Output: 1 (The last dimension is 1, not 0)

#Correct way to check for an empty batch
if empty_batch.numel() == 0:
    print("Empty batch detected")
```

In this example, we create an empty batch. Note that even though the batch is empty, `size(-1)` reflects the size of the last dimension which still exists, but is not populated. To detect an empty batch, it's crucial to check the total number of elements using `.numel()`.

**Example 2:  Incorrect Data Transformation (Image Resizing)**

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

# Simulate an image (replace with your actual image loading)
image = Image.new('RGB', (28, 28))

# Incorrect transform - resizing to 0 width
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((0, 28)),  # Incorrect resizing to 0 width
    transforms.ToTensor(),
])

tensor_image = transform(image)
print(tensor_image.size()) #Output: torch.Size([3, 0, 28]) - Notice the width is 0
print(tensor_image.size(-1)) # Output: 28, misleading because the dimension before is 0.

#Correct Transform
correct_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((28, 28)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
])

correct_tensor_image = correct_transform(image)
print(correct_tensor_image.size()) #Output: torch.Size([3, 28, 28])
print(correct_tensor_image.size(-1)) # Output: 28
```

This demonstrates how an incorrect resize operation can lead to a zero dimension. The incorrect transformation results in a zero width, leading to a non-intuitive outcome where `size(-1)` might not immediately indicate the error. Careful inspection of the entire tensor shape is vital.

**Example 3:  Data Type Mismatch**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

#Incorrect Data type
numpy_array = np.zeros((28, 28))
try:
  tensor = torch.tensor(numpy_array)  # Creates a tensor from the NumPy array
  print(tensor.size(-1))  # Output: 28. This works fine because it's a valid NumPy array.
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error creating tensor: {e}") # This would catch potential issues that lead to zero-sized tensors.

#Simulate error in data loading
invalid_data = None #Null value
try:
  tensor_invalid = torch.tensor(invalid_data)
  print(tensor_invalid.size())
except Exception as e:
  print(f"Error: Could not create tensor from invalid data: {e}")
```

This illustrates how attempting to create a tensor from invalid data (e.g., `None`) will raise an error, preventing the calculation of `.size(-1)`.  Robust error handling is crucial in data loading to prevent silent failures.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I strongly advise reviewing the official PyTorch documentation on tensors, data loading, and common data transformation methods.  Consulting a comprehensive guide on PyTorch's data handling capabilities, possibly one focusing on best practices, is beneficial. Thoroughly examining the error messages and stack traces during debugging, paired with the use of print statements strategically placed within your data loading and preprocessing functions, can offer crucial clues to pinpoint the exact location and nature of the problem.  Lastly, understanding NumPy array manipulation, especially for data preparation before converting to PyTorch tensors, will prove extremely valuable.
