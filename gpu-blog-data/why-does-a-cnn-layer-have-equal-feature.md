Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) don't inherently mandate equal feature dimensions across all layers.  The perception of equal dimensions often arises from specific architectural choices and the prevalence of simplified examples.  In reality, feature map dimensions can, and often do, change throughout a CNN's depth, dictated by the convolution operation's parameters and the inclusion of pooling or upsampling layers.  My experience working on image segmentation models for medical imaging highlighted this nuance repeatedly.  Misunderstanding this leads to flawed model design and inefficient training.


**1.  Convolutional Operation and Dimensional Changes:**

The core of a CNN is the convolutional layer.  This layer applies a set of learnable filters (kernels) to the input feature maps.  The output's spatial dimensions are determined by three key factors: the input's dimensions (height and width), the filter's dimensions (kernel size), and the stride and padding parameters.

The formula governing the output height (H_out) and width (W_out) is:

H_out = floor((H_in - kernel_size + 2 * padding) / stride) + 1
W_out = floor((W_in - kernel_size + 2 * padding) / stride) + 1


where:

* H_in, W_in: Input height and width
* kernel_size:  Dimension of the convolutional kernel (often square, e.g., 3x3 or 5x5)
* padding: Number of pixels added to the input's borders
* stride: Number of pixels the filter moves in each step


Unless you explicitly set `kernel_size = 1`, `stride = 1`, and `padding` to compensate for the kernel size (e.g., `padding = (kernel_size - 1) / 2` for same padding), the output dimensions will differ from the input dimensions.  The depth (number of channels) of the output feature map is determined by the number of filters used in the convolution.


**2.  Pooling and Upsampling Layers:**

Pooling layers (e.g., max pooling, average pooling) reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while retaining the depth.  This is crucial for downsampling, reducing computational cost and increasing the receptive field of subsequent layers.  Conversely, upsampling layers (e.g., bilinear interpolation, transposed convolution) increase the spatial dimensions, often used in decoder networks for tasks like semantic segmentation.  These layers directly impact the dimensional consistency across CNN layers.


**3.  Code Examples Illustrating Dimensional Changes:**


**Example 1:  Simple Convolution with Dimension Reduction:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define input tensor (Batch size, Height, Width, Channels)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3))

# Define convolutional layer with 3x3 kernel, stride 2, no padding
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=3, strides=2, padding='valid')(input_tensor)

# Print output shape
print(conv_layer.shape) # Output: (1, 13, 13, 16)  Dimensions reduced
```

This example demonstrates how a standard convolutional layer, without careful padding and stride selection, reduces the spatial dimensions.  The output has reduced height and width compared to the input.


**Example 2:  Convolution with Same Padding:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3))

# Define convolutional layer with 3x3 kernel, stride 1, same padding
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding='same')(input_tensor)

# Print output shape
print(conv_layer.shape) # Output: (1, 28, 28, 16) Dimensions maintained
```

Here, 'same' padding ensures the output spatial dimensions match the input, crucial for maintaining feature map size across layers.  However, this comes at the cost of increased computational complexity due to the additional padding.


**Example 3:  Convolution, Pooling, and Upsampling:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 3))

# Convolutional Layer
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding='same')(input_tensor)

# Max Pooling Layer
pool_layer = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(conv_layer)

# Upsampling Layer (Transposed Convolution)
upsample_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2DTranspose(filters=3, kernel_size=2, strides=2, padding='same')(pool_layer)

# Print shapes at each stage
print("Convolution:", conv_layer.shape)  # (1, 28, 28, 16)
print("Pooling:", pool_layer.shape)    # (1, 14, 14, 16)
print("Upsampling:", upsample_layer.shape) # (1, 28, 28, 3)
```

This comprehensive example explicitly shows how convolutional, pooling, and upsampling layers alter dimensions. Notice that while the upsampling layer attempts to restore the original spatial dimensions, it might not perfectly match due to the nature of the upsampling operation.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest reviewing introductory materials on CNN architectures and their mathematical foundations.  A solid grasp of linear algebra and matrix operations will be particularly beneficial.  Furthermore,  carefully examine the documentation of deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) focusing on the convolutional, pooling, and upsampling layer functionalities.  Lastly, dedicated textbooks on deep learning provide a comprehensive treatment of these topics.  Work through various practical examples, experimenting with different parameter settings to solidify your understanding.  This hands-on experience will highlight the dynamic nature of feature map dimensions in CNNs.
