Gradients, pivotal for training neural networks, are not exclusive to floating-point and complex tensors. While these data types are the most common and computationally efficient for representing continuous values required in differentiable operations, integer tensors can also participate in gradient calculations under specific conditions, though not as directly as their floating-point counterparts.

The core misunderstanding stems from the inherent nature of gradient descent. Gradient descent relies on the concept of a differentiable loss function â€“ a function where the rate of change (the gradient) with respect to each input parameter can be calculated. This rate of change allows us to iteratively update parameters in the direction that minimizes the loss. Floating-point numbers, with their ability to represent fractional values, facilitate smooth, continuous variations required for these gradient calculations. Complex numbers, expanding into the imaginary dimension, maintain the differentiability necessary for specialized calculations, particularly in signal processing or quantum computing applications.

Integer tensors, however, represent discrete values. A naive derivative calculation on an integer value would invariably be zero. Consider a simple integer tensor: [1, 2, 3]. If we attempted to calculate the derivative of, for example, the value at index 1, the result would be zero, as an infinitely small perturbation of the value (2) would not change the integer representation. This presents an obvious problem for directly applying integer tensors to gradient-based optimization.

Despite this, integer tensors play crucial roles in the computational graph, and can impact gradients through several indirect methods. Notably, they are often used as indices or indicators, influencing how gradients flow through operations. These operations themselves will, of course, involve floating point tensors that have continuous values. They also facilitate computations in discrete layers, and where differentiation of non-continuous functions is possible through approximations or techniques like Straight-Through Estimators.

The most common scenario where integer tensors influence gradients is when they act as indices in operations involving floating-point tensors. When an integer tensor dictates which elements of a floating-point tensor are used in a computation, a change in that integer could alter the overall result, thus affecting the gradients. The gradients, therefore, would propagate from the result back to the associated floating-point tensors, not the integer tensors themselves, but the effect of the integer is felt.

Consider a scenario where we use a gather operation. The floating point tensor has the values from which we gather. The integer tensor has the indices of the elements to gather. In this case, a change to the elements of the index tensor will result in a different floating point tensor as an output of the gather operation. Therefore, even though the index tensor does not directly produce a gradient, it is impacting it indirectly.

**Example 1: Indexing with Integer Tensors**

```python
import torch

# Floating-point tensor
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)

# Integer tensor used for indexing
indices = torch.tensor([0, 2])

# Gather operation using the indices
y = x[indices].sum()

# Perform backpropagation
y.backward()

# Output the gradients
print("Gradients for x:", x.grad)
# print("Gradients for indices:", indices.grad) # This would throw an error, since integer tensors dont have gradients
```

In this example, 'x' is a floating-point tensor requiring gradients. 'indices', an integer tensor, is used to gather elements from 'x'. During backpropagation, gradients flow through the `gather` operation to x. However, attempting to print `indices.grad` would result in an error as integer tensors do not directly accumulate gradients. The integer values themselves are not the targets of the gradient adjustment, the floating-point tensor values are, but the specific values chosen contribute to the output and, thus, participate in the gradient calculation.

**Example 2: Integer Tensors in Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Predicted probabilities (floating-point tensor)
logits = torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.9], [0.8, 0.2]], requires_grad=True)

# True labels (integer tensor)
labels = torch.tensor([1, 0])

# Calculate the loss using categorical cross-entropy
loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, labels)

# Perform backpropagation
loss.backward()

# Output the gradients
print("Gradients for logits:", logits.grad)
# print("Gradients for labels:", labels.grad)  # This would throw an error
```

Here, `logits` represent predicted probabilities as floating point numbers, while `labels` are integer representations of class indices. The `F.cross_entropy` function computes the loss and implicitly maps the integer labels to a one-hot encoding, and its gradients backpropagate to the `logits` tensor. The integer labels dictate which probability distribution is compared against, but don't directly acquire gradients themselves. This exemplifies how integer tensors can influence gradients via loss functions. Integer tensors are effectively used as pointers to the correct classes within our categorical classification problem.

**Example 3: Straight-Through Estimator**

```python
import torch

# Input tensor (floating-point)
x = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)

# A function that makes a discrete jump, with no gradient at x=0.5
def step_function(x):
  return (x >= 0.5).float()


# Normal gradient flow through the network, non-differentiable
# discrete_result = step_function(x)

# Straight-through estimator to allow gradients to pass
discrete_result = step_function(x)
# The gradient of a step function is zero everywhere, except at the location where it jumps, which we do not use.
# In this case, we use the identity function as an approximation for the derivative.

# Forward pass
# In the forward pass we use the output of the step function
identity_result = x

# Straight through estimator
discrete_result = identity_result + (discrete_result - discrete_result.detach())


loss = (discrete_result - 1)**2

loss.backward()

print("Gradients:", x.grad)
```
Here, the step function, `step_function`, is inherently non-differentiable. The output is an integer, (0 or 1). Therefore, if we use the output directly, we can't back propagate. To make it differentiable, we make use of the Straight Through Estimator (STE) in the form of `identity_result + (discrete_result - discrete_result.detach())`, we bypass the non-differentiable part and use the identity for the gradient update. We are therefore using an integer operation in a situation where we can get gradient flow.

In summary, only floating point and complex tensors can directly accumulate gradients for the purpose of gradient descent optimization. Integer tensors participate in computations, but do not have their values directly adjusted during backpropagation using gradient methods. Their influence on gradients stems from their role in operations such as indexing and loss calculations, and can be used as part of approximation techniques like the Straight Through Estimator for situations where non-differentiable functions are present. The effect of the integer tensor on the floating point tensors is the method by which an integer tensor can have an indirect influence on the values of other tensors. This ensures gradients propagate appropriately to all floating-point tensors involved in a differentiable computational graph.

For a deeper understanding, I would recommend reviewing documentation on automatic differentiation as implemented in popular deep learning frameworks, alongside resources covering mathematical underpinnings of gradients. Additionally, research papers or textbooks on deep learning often explain the role of integers in operations like gather and loss functions. I also recommend looking up straight through estimator techniques. Finally, studying the mechanics of backpropagation in general will be crucial for understanding the difference.
