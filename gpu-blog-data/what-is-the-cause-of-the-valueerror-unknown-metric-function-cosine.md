The error "ValueError: Unknown metric function: cosine" in machine learning contexts, particularly when using libraries like TensorFlow or scikit-learn, arises because the specified string identifier 'cosine' does not correspond to a registered or recognized cosine similarity metric function. I've encountered this scenario several times while developing custom recommendation systems, and each instance pointed towards slightly different root causes within the application's metric handling. The issue isn't that cosine similarity itself is invalid; instead, it stems from how the system interprets and locates the intended function.

Specifically, machine learning libraries often utilize string identifiers to refer to pre-defined or user-supplied functions. When you specify "cosine" as a metric, the library attempts to find a function mapped to this string. The error signals that this mapping either does not exist, or that the mapping exists but is not accessible within the current execution context. This can be a result of several factors.

Firstly, some libraries expect a metric function to be provided directly as a function object, not just the string name. For example, if I incorrectly passed the string "cosine" where a callable metric function was expected, a similar error would arise. This is common when constructing custom loss or evaluation functions. The library tries to perform a lookup based on the string but fails to find an associated function. Furthermore, the "cosine" metric may be available, but not under that exact string, especially in custom environments. Implementations often require a specific naming convention, or an import statement to make available pre-built options. There can also be discrepancies in how libraries handle metrics. Some accept string names directly; others require import statements and a pointer to an actual function.

Another critical source of this issue involves situations with custom or third-party libraries. If the "cosine" function, perhaps from a separate package, is not correctly imported and registered for the particular library, the lookup will fail, again resulting in this ValueError. Even if the metric *is* present, if the library lacks knowledge about how to locate or access it, it would still fail. Finally, incorrect parameterization of the function call, or incorrect API usage can lead to the error by implicitly referencing "cosine" string when the code should be passing an actual function.

To illustrate these potential issues, consider the following code examples:

**Example 1: Incorrect String Passing in TensorFlow:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'y_true' and 'y_pred' are TensorFlow tensors.
y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]])
y_pred = tf.constant([[0.8, 0.2], [0.1, 0.9]])

try:
    # Incorrect: passing a string where a function is expected
    metric_value = tf.keras.metrics.MeanAbsoluteError(metric="cosine")(y_true, y_pred)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Correct Usage: passing the tf.keras.losses.cosine_similarity function
metric_value_correct = tf.keras.metrics.MeanAbsoluteError(
    metric=tf.keras.losses.cosine_similarity
)(y_true, y_pred)

print(f"Correct Metric Value: {metric_value_correct}")
```
Here, we use TensorFlow to show the error, this is a common example that directly shows that passing the string "cosine" is not accepted. Instead, an instantiated metric function, i.e. `tf.keras.losses.cosine_similarity` should be used.

**Example 2: Custom Metric Handling with `sklearn`:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer

def my_cosine_similarity(y_true, y_pred):
    """Custom cosine similarity implementation."""
    y_true = np.array(y_true)
    y_pred = np.array(y_pred)

    dot_product = np.sum(y_true * y_pred, axis=1)
    norm_true = np.linalg.norm(y_true, axis=1)
    norm_pred = np.linalg.norm(y_pred, axis=1)
    return dot_product / (norm_true * norm_pred)

# Example of incorrect usage, using 'cosine' as metric when a callable function is expected
try:
    cosine_scorer_wrong = make_scorer(score_func="cosine")
    # Assume 'y_true_arr' and 'y_pred_arr' are numpy arrays.
    y_true_arr = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])
    y_pred_arr = np.array([[0.8, 0.2], [0.1, 0.9]])
    score_wrong = cosine_scorer_wrong(y_true_arr, y_pred_arr)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Correct usage, passing the callable custom function
cosine_scorer_correct = make_scorer(score_func=my_cosine_similarity)
score_correct = cosine_scorer_correct(y_true_arr, y_pred_arr)

print(f"Correct Score: {score_correct}")
```

In this example, we define a custom cosine similarity function. When using `make_scorer`, we need to explicitly pass the function object `my_cosine_similarity`. Passing a string "cosine" fails because the `make_scorer` function is not designed to look up a function via a string within this scope.

**Example 3:  Missing Dependency/Import:**

```python
# Assume a library 'my_metrics' which contains a cosine metric.
# If not present or incorrectly imported an error would occur when trying to use the string

# The following code may raise the error if the metric is not defined
# or correctly imported into the namespace.

# from my_metrics import cosine_metric

def use_cosine_metric(y_true, y_pred, metric_name):
    try:
         # Fictional metric access
        metric_func = metrics[metric_name] # This part depends on actual implementation and how the library works.
        return metric_func(y_true, y_pred)
    except KeyError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None

# Example where lookup may fail if library is not loaded
# This depends on how external metric libraries are used
# If there is no global dictionary 'metrics' containing a callable function named "cosine", this example will result in a KeyError.
y_true_example = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])
y_pred_example = np.array([[0.8, 0.2], [0.1, 0.9]])
# The following call results in a KeyError if no dictionary 'metrics' exists with key "cosine"

result_error = use_cosine_metric(y_true_example, y_pred_example, "cosine")
```
This example shows a scenario where the "cosine" metric is expected to be provided by external package or defined as a global variable within `metrics`. However, the access will fail if it's not correctly loaded or defined. The specific implementation will vary, but it will lead to an error such as KeyError, which is closely related to ValueError when strings are used incorrectly.

To resolve the "ValueError: Unknown metric function: cosine", one should first carefully examine the library documentation to understand the accepted format for specifying metrics. Libraries such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, PyTorch all have unique implementations and requirements. Ensure that the `cosine` metric is imported and registered correctly, using the appropriate function names when needed, not only strings. When utilizing custom implementations, make sure that the function is callable in the context and is used as an argument, instead of a string identifier.

For further guidance on implementing and utilizing metrics, consult resources such as the official library documentations for TensorFlow, scikit-learn and PyTorch. Additionally, resources on model evaluation, and specifically the section on metric functions will offer further knowledge.
