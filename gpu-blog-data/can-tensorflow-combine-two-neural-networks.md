TensorFlow's ability to combine neural networks isn't a simple yes or no.  The approach depends heavily on the architectures of the networks in question and the intended outcome.  My experience building complex recommendation systems for a major e-commerce platform involved extensive experimentation with network combination strategies.  I've found that understanding the flow of data and the representational capabilities of each network is crucial.  Direct concatenation rarely suffices; more sophisticated techniques are usually required.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental methods for combining neural networks in TensorFlow revolve around manipulating their outputs and potentially their internal layers.  We can categorize these methods broadly into three approaches:  Sequential concatenation, parallel concatenation with merging, and fine-tuning through shared layers.

* **Sequential Concatenation:**  This is the simplest approach, where the output of one network feeds directly into the input of another.  This is suitable when the first network's output provides a useful representation that the second network can leverage. For example, one network might perform feature extraction, and the second network might perform classification based on those extracted features. The limitations become apparent when the output dimensions and data types are incompatible.

* **Parallel Concatenation with Merging:**  Here, both networks process the same input (or different but related inputs) independently. Their outputs are then combined, often using a merging layer like concatenation or averaging, before being fed into a final layer for the ultimate prediction. This allows for the exploitation of diverse features learned by independent networks.  This approach is particularly useful when integrating networks with complementary strengths, such as one specializing in spatial features and another in temporal features.  Careful consideration must be given to the merging strategy, ensuring the merged information isn't redundant or conflicting.

* **Fine-tuning through Shared Layers:** This technique involves creating a new network with shared layers between the existing networks.  The pre-trained weights of the individual networks can be used to initialize the shared layers, allowing for transfer learning. This is advantageous when dealing with related tasks or datasets, leveraging knowledge learned in one network to improve performance in another.  This requires a careful analysis of the architectures to identify suitable layers for sharing, often demanding modifications to the original network architectures.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate the three approaches, using a simplified scenario for clarity. Assume `model_A` and `model_B` are pre-trained Keras models.

**Example 1: Sequential Concatenation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume model_A outputs a vector of size 10
# Assume model_B expects an input of size 10 and outputs a single scalar

# Create a sequential model
combined_model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    model_A,
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Model B's final layer simplified
])

combined_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
combined_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

```

This example directly uses `model_A`'s output as the input for a new dense layer.  `model_B` is implicitly integrated as the final dense layer. This is suitable if `model_A` acts as a feature extractor. The simplicity hides the fact that incompatibility between the output of `model_A` and the expected input of `model_B` might require additional layers for dimension adjustments.


**Example 2: Parallel Concatenation with Merging**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume both model_A and model_B output a vector of size 5
# Assume the final output is a vector of size 10

input_layer = tf.keras.Input(shape=(input_dim,)) # Define the input layer

# Create parallel branches
output_A = model_A(input_layer)
output_B = model_B(input_layer)

# Concatenate outputs
merged = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([output_A, output_B])

# Add a final layer
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(merged)

# Create the combined model
combined_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

combined_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
combined_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

```

This code showcases parallel processing using `model_A` and `model_B`. The `concatenate` layer merges the outputs before the final prediction layer.  This method is effective when combining networks learning complementary features.  Adjusting the final layer's dimensions is necessary to accommodate the merged output size.


**Example 3: Fine-tuning through Shared Layers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume model_A and model_B share a common convolutional base

# Extract the convolutional base from model_A
base_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=model_A.input, outputs=model_A.get_layer('conv_layer_3').output) # Example: Sharing the 3rd convolutional layer. Adjust accordingly.

# Create branches for model_A and model_B's specific layers
branch_A = base_model.output
branch_A = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')(branch_A)
branch_A = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(branch_A) # Specific output for model A's task

branch_B = base_model.output
branch_B = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='relu')(branch_B)
branch_B = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(branch_B) # Specific output for model B's task

# Create the combined model
combined_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=[branch_A, branch_B])

combined_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=['binary_crossentropy', 'binary_crossentropy'], loss_weights=[0.5, 0.5], metrics=['accuracy']) # Multi-output model compilation
combined_model.fit(X_train, [y_train_A, y_train_B]) # Requires separate target variables

```

This example requires careful architecture analysis. The `base_model` represents the shared layers, with separate branches for `model_A` and `model_B`. The loss function and training data must be adjusted to handle the multi-output nature.  This approach benefits from transfer learning, leveraging the pre-trained weights of the shared layers.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend studying the official TensorFlow documentation, focusing on the Keras functional API and model subclassing.  Explore publications on transfer learning and multi-task learning within the context of deep learning.  Finally, examining case studies showcasing combined neural network architectures in relevant application domains is invaluable.  These resources will provide a robust foundation for tackling complex network combination scenarios.
