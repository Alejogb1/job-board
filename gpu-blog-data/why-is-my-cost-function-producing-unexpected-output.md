A cost function exhibiting unexpected behavior often stems from a mismatch between the mathematical formulation, the numerical implementation, and the nature of the data being processed. This frequently manifests as either a cost that does not decrease with iteration (indicating an optimization failure) or one that fluctuates wildly, despite a seemingly stable system. My experience debugging neural network training pipelines has shown these issues usually trace back to subtle errors rather than conceptual flaws.

The core issue frequently resides in how the chosen cost function interacts with the gradients computed during backpropagation. In essence, the cost function quantifies the discrepancy between the predicted output of a model and the true target values. When implemented correctly, this cost provides a direction for the model’s parameters to adjust to minimize the error. However, if the cost function is poorly selected for the data, if its derivative is incorrectly computed, or if there are numerical issues during computation, it can lead to the described unexpected outputs.

Let’s consider a simple scenario. Suppose we are training a linear regression model with the mean squared error (MSE) as the cost function. The MSE calculates the average of the squared differences between predictions and actual values. Its analytical derivative, which is essential for gradient-based optimization, is well-defined. However, even with this standard formulation, problems can arise.

Firstly, there may be an error in implementing the cost function itself. For example, the squaring operation could be omitted, introducing a non-quadratic dependence on the error. Such an error would lead to incorrectly computed gradients and prevent convergence. Secondly, numerical issues related to the chosen data type for computation can be the culprit. If the values become too large or too small, and are not handled properly, a cost function can display unexpected behaviour due to numerical instability. Thirdly, the learning rate, used in optimization methods like gradient descent, may be too high or low. A too-large value could cause the system to oscillate and fail to converge, and a value that is too small would result in the loss function decreasing at an extremely slow pace. Finally, regularization techniques, if used, need careful attention. If not configured properly, they can overwhelm the original cost function and lead to unexpected results. This is especially relevant when the regularization strength is too large, causing the model to prefer simple solutions with minimal weights, irrespective of the data fit.

I'll illustrate three common scenarios with code examples in Python using `numpy`, each with accompanying commentary.

**Example 1: Incorrect Cost Function Implementation**

```python
import numpy as np

def mse_incorrect(predictions, targets):
    """Incorrect MSE implementation (missing squaring)."""
    return np.mean(predictions - targets)

def mse_correct(predictions, targets):
    """Correct MSE implementation."""
    return np.mean((predictions - targets)**2)

# Dummy data
predictions = np.array([1.2, 2.5, 3.1])
targets = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Demonstrating the discrepancy
incorrect_cost = mse_incorrect(predictions, targets)
correct_cost = mse_correct(predictions, targets)

print(f"Incorrect Cost: {incorrect_cost}")
print(f"Correct Cost: {correct_cost}")
```

In this example, `mse_incorrect` demonstrates a common mistake. The intended mean squared error formula was not implemented; the squaring of the difference between the predictions and targets is missing. This would result in the gradients for the model not correctly indicating the direction of improvement since the error would not have a quadratic dependence on the difference in predictions and targets. Thus, using the `mse_incorrect` function during training will likely cause problems, even if the gradient of the `mse_incorrect` was calculated correctly. The `mse_correct` function implements the standard formula and is more suitable for training a model. As demonstrated by this code, the two cost functions compute completely different values. This shows why the incorrect implementation of the cost function can directly lead to an unexpected outcome.

**Example 2: Numerical Instability**

```python
import numpy as np

def mse(predictions, targets):
    """MSE implementation."""
    return np.mean((predictions - targets)**2)

# Dummy data with large values
predictions_large = np.array([1e10, 2e10, 3e10], dtype=np.float64)
targets_large = np.array([1.1e10, 2.1e10, 3.1e10], dtype=np.float64)

# Demonstration of numerical instability
cost_large = mse(predictions_large, targets_large)
print(f"Cost with Large Values: {cost_large}")


# Dummy data with small values
predictions_small = np.array([1e-10, 2e-10, 3e-10], dtype=np.float64)
targets_small = np.array([1.1e-10, 2.1e-10, 3.1e-10], dtype=np.float64)
cost_small = mse(predictions_small, targets_small)
print(f"Cost with Small Values: {cost_small}")
```

Here, the `mse` function is correctly implemented. However, using data with extremely large or small values can lead to numerical issues. While `float64` provides greater precision compared to `float32`, it cannot completely eliminate numerical instability when processing values that are orders of magnitude apart. In real-world cases, this can manifest as a loss that either plateaus very early or appears to randomly fluctuate due to rounding errors and underflow. Data scaling techniques are crucial for mitigating this issue before providing the data to the neural network or related algorithm.

**Example 3: Improper Regularization**

```python
import numpy as np

def mse_regularized(predictions, targets, weights, lambda_val):
    """MSE with L2 regularization."""
    mse_val = np.mean((predictions - targets)**2)
    l2_reg = lambda_val * np.sum(weights**2)
    return mse_val + l2_reg

# Dummy data
predictions = np.array([1.2, 2.5, 3.1])
targets = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
weights = np.array([0.5, 0.8, -0.2]) # Assume these are weights of a linear model
lambda_strong = 100 # Strong regularization
lambda_weak = 0.01  # Weak regularization

# Comparing regularized costs
cost_strong = mse_regularized(predictions, targets, weights, lambda_strong)
cost_weak = mse_regularized(predictions, targets, weights, lambda_weak)

print(f"Cost with Strong Regularization: {cost_strong}")
print(f"Cost with Weak Regularization: {cost_weak}")

```

In this example, L2 regularization is added to the mean squared error function. If `lambda_val`, the regularization parameter, is set too high, as with `lambda_strong`, the regularization term will dominate the cost function. The model is strongly penalized for large weight values. This results in a cost that is largely determined by the size of the weights, even if these weights may contribute to a better fit with the training data. This can hinder effective learning and result in high bias, underfitting, and a large cost. On the other hand, a small value of `lambda_val` results in a small regularization term, letting the model fit better and produce better outcomes.

Debugging cost functions requires a systematic approach. I recommend validating each stage of the calculation. Start by manually computing cost values for a small, controlled set of inputs. Next, review the mathematical derivation of the cost function and ensure that each term is being implemented as intended. Compare these manual results to the code outputs to pinpoint discrepancies. Verify the gradients using numerical differentiation which provides a sanity check of the gradients computed by backpropagation. Finally, always monitor the norm of the weights and gradients during the training process, especially when regularization is used. This can also help identify any numerical or convergence issues that could be causing unexpected outputs.

For further study, consider the following. "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow et al. provides a thorough theoretical overview, encompassing different cost functions and regularization strategies. Online courses that cover machine learning foundations can also offer practical knowledge on handling numerical stability and model optimization. In addition, practical notebooks published by major open source machine learning libraries are always beneficial. Exploring implementations of different loss functions in such notebooks, coupled with hands-on experience, is crucial for developing an intuition on loss function behaviour.
