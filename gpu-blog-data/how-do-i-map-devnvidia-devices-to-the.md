The discrepancy between `/dev/nvidia*` device nodes and the GPUs listed by `nvidia-smi` frequently stems from driver initialization and kernel module loading inconsistencies.  My experience troubleshooting this on numerous embedded systems and high-performance computing clusters points to a critical understanding of the underlying kernel interaction with the NVIDIA driver.  The `/dev/nvidia*` nodes represent character devices created by the NVIDIA kernel driver (typically `nvidia-driver-xxx`), while `nvidia-smi` interacts directly with the driver's internal representation of the GPUs.  A mismatch implies a failure in this communication pathway.

**1.  Explanation of the Mapping and Potential Discrepancies:**

The NVIDIA driver, upon successful loading, creates several character devices under `/dev/nvidia*`. These typically include `/dev/nvidia0`, `/dev/nvidia1`, and so on, each representing a detected GPU.  The driver then establishes a communication channel with these devices, allowing applications (including `nvidia-smi`) to query and manage the GPUs.  `nvidia-smi` doesn't directly read the device nodes; instead, it uses the driver's internal API to obtain GPU information.  This internal API maintains a mapping between the physical GPUs and the indices used in `/dev/nvidia*` and internal driver structures.

Discrepancies arise from several sources:

* **Driver Installation Issues:** An incomplete or corrupted driver installation can lead to inconsistencies between the detected hardware and the driver's internal representation.  This often manifests as missing or incorrectly numbered `/dev/nvidia*` devices or a `nvidia-smi` output that doesn't reflect the available hardware.

* **Kernel Module Conflicts:**  Conflicting kernel modules or improperly configured kernel parameters can prevent the NVIDIA driver from correctly identifying and initializing the GPUs.

* **Hardware Issues:**  Physical problems with the GPU itself, such as faulty connections or hardware failures, can prevent the driver from detecting the GPU, resulting in missing entries in both `/dev/nvidia*` and the `nvidia-smi` output.

* **Permissions:** Lack of sufficient permissions to access `/dev/nvidia*` can prevent applications from interacting with the GPUs, even if the driver reports them correctly.

Therefore, directly mapping `/dev/nvidia*` to the `nvidia-smi` list requires ensuring the correct driver installation and addressing any kernel module conflicts.  The `nvidia-smi` output should reflect the devices present in `/dev/nvidia*` if the driver is functioning correctly.  Any deviation signals an underlying problem that must be diagnosed.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how to gather relevant information and diagnose potential issues. They focus on diagnosing the problem rather than attempting a direct mapping, as a direct mapping is not necessary nor advisable. The driver handles this internally.

**Example 1:  Verifying Driver Installation and Module Loading:**

```bash
# Check for NVIDIA driver presence
lsmod | grep nvidia

# Check the driver version
nvidia-smi -q | grep Driver

# Check the kernel log for errors during driver loading
dmesg | grep nvidia
```

This code snippet helps determine if the NVIDIA driver is properly loaded and identify potential errors during the loading process.  The output of `lsmod` will show the loaded kernel modules, while `nvidia-smi -q` provides driver version information.  `dmesg` displays kernel messages, potentially revealing errors that prevent correct GPU initialization.

**Example 2: Listing Available Devices and Comparing with `nvidia-smi`:**

```bash
# List NVIDIA devices
ls /dev/nvidia*

# Get GPU information from nvidia-smi
nvidia-smi -L
```

This shows a direct comparison between the devices listed in `/dev/` and the GPUs reported by `nvidia-smi`. Any mismatch in number or naming indicates a problem.  For instance, if `ls /dev/nvidia*` shows `/dev/nvidia0` and `/dev/nvidia1`, but `nvidia-smi -L` only shows one GPU, it highlights a discrepancy requiring investigation.

**Example 3: Checking Permissions:**

```bash
# Check permissions for /dev/nvidia0 (replace with your device)
ls -l /dev/nvidia0
```

This command verifies that the user has the necessary permissions to access the `/dev/nvidia*` devices.  Insufficient permissions will prevent applications from interacting with the GPUs, even if they're correctly detected by the driver.  This is especially relevant in multi-user environments or when running applications as a non-root user.  Appropriate permissions are typically granted by group membership (e.g., `video`).


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official NVIDIA documentation for your specific GPU and driver version. Refer to your system's kernel documentation for information on kernel module management and troubleshooting. Examine the log files generated by the NVIDIA driver and the system's boot process for error messages or warnings.  Familiarize yourself with the output of `lspci` to verify hardware detection at the BIOS level.  Understanding the interaction between the kernel and the NVIDIA driver is key to resolving discrepancies.  Detailed logs and output from various system utilities, as mentioned above, provide the data necessary to pinpoint specific issues.
