A significant cause of low accuracy in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using TensorFlow/Keras stems from inadequate handling of the vanishing or exploding gradient problem, especially during backpropagation. This issue manifests as a diminished ability of the network's weights to effectively learn features, ultimately hindering accurate classification or regression. My experience building image classification models, particularly those with deeper architectures, has repeatedly demonstrated this.

The backpropagation algorithm relies on the chain rule of calculus to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network's weights. These gradients are then used to update the weights in a direction that minimizes the loss. However, during the backpropagation process, these gradients can become vanishingly small or explosively large as they are propagated backward through the layers. In very deep networks, especially those with multiple convolutional and fully connected layers, this effect is exacerbated, leading to significant issues.

A vanishing gradient occurs when the gradients become so small that the early layers of the network learn very slowly, or not at all. This is frequently observed when activation functions with bounded derivatives, such as sigmoid or tanh, are used. The repeated multiplication of derivatives, often values less than one, during backpropagation results in the gradients tending towards zero. Consequently, weights in these early layers remain largely unchanged, and the network becomes incapable of capturing low-level features, essential for downstream processing.

Conversely, an exploding gradient arises when the gradients become excessively large. This can lead to unstable training and can cause the network's weights to update too aggressively, preventing convergence. The large updates result in oscillating behavior of the loss function instead of smoothly converging towards an optimum. This situation is less frequent than vanishing gradients but is equally problematic for training. Exploding gradients can particularly occur with poorly chosen learning rates or weight initialization schemes.

Several techniques are effective in mitigating these gradient problems. Activation functions with consistently non-zero gradients, such as ReLU and its variants (Leaky ReLU, ELU), are highly beneficial. ReLU's simple piecewise linear nature, having a derivative of one for positive inputs, significantly lessens the likelihood of the vanishing gradient. Proper weight initialization is also crucial. Techniques such as Xavier or He initialization aim to initialize weights such that the variance of activations remains consistent across layers, aiding in more stable gradient flow. Finally, batch normalization, a technique that normalizes the activations of each layer, further stabilizes training by preventing internal covariate shift, a change in the distribution of layer inputs which can be detrimental to the learning process.

Let's consider three practical code examples.

First, examine the impact of an inappropriate activation function on network performance. Assume an image classification task using a simple convolutional network:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def build_bad_network():
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Assuming 10 classes
    ])
    return model

bad_model = build_bad_network()
bad_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# bad_model.fit(...) # Example training - you would expect low accuracy here
```

In this *bad_network* example, employing the sigmoid activation function throughout the convolutional layers will likely lead to poor performance as the derivatives will be between zero and one and therefore will shrink with each backpropagation leading to the vanishing gradient problem. The output is likely to converge to suboptimal result with slow training speed and low accuracy.

Next, let's improve the above example with ReLU and proper initialization along with batch normalization:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def build_improved_network():
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', kernel_initializer='he_normal', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
        layers.BatchNormalization(),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', kernel_initializer='he_normal'),
         layers.BatchNormalization(),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Assuming 10 classes
    ])
    return model

improved_model = build_improved_network()
improved_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# improved_model.fit(...) # Example training - expect significantly higher accuracy
```

The use of ReLU in conjunction with 'he_normal' weight initialization and batch normalization significantly improves the training dynamics and the final accuracy in *improved_network*. The ReLU avoids the saturation region seen in the sigmoid and the 'he_normal' initialization aids in consistent gradient flow. Batch normalization assists in maintaining activation distributions and preventing internal covariate shift during training. This typically translates to faster learning, and most importantly, a higher overall accuracy.

Finally, let's examine an example with an extremely deep network, which emphasizes the problem. A deeply layered network with the previous *bad_network* setup will amplify the vanishing gradient problem. Below, a very deep network is constructed with sigmoid activations:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def build_deep_network_sigmoid():
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
         layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same'),
         layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(256, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Assuming 10 classes
    ])
    return model


deep_sigmoid_model = build_deep_network_sigmoid()
deep_sigmoid_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# deep_sigmoid_model.fit(...) # Example training - Very low accuracy
```

The *deep_network_sigmoid* will suffer severely from vanishing gradient issues, showing very poor convergence. Even with numerous epochs of training, the accuracy will likely remain substantially low. The accumulated product of derivatives from each layer's sigmoid activation will approach zero and very little will be learnt in the initial layers. If you substitute ReLU activation in this case, along with batch norm and 'he_normal', you can observe massive improvements. This example accentuates the problem of vanishing gradients in deeper networks and why proper mitigation strategies are essential.

Beyond the scope of these examples, other factors contribute to low CNN accuracy. Insufficient training data, leading to underfitting; overfitting to the training data due to overcomplex models; inappropriate choice of hyperparameters, like learning rate or regularization coefficients; and imbalanced datasets, which bias the model towards the majority class, are all frequent culprits.

For further exploration, I recommend reviewing the original papers on ReLU activation functions, batch normalization, and the various weight initialization techniques, as well as research papers regarding deeper network structures. Investigating case studies specific to image classification, particularly those dealing with larger datasets such as ImageNet, can also prove beneficial. A clear grasp of the underlying mathematics of backpropagation, the chain rule, and gradient descent is always invaluable. A deep conceptual understanding of these areas will allow for a more nuanced and successful implementation of CNNs.
