TensorFlow's ability to manage convolutional strides with independent height and width is fundamental to its flexibility in processing diverse input shapes and feature maps. This capability allows the creation of models with varying receptive field characteristics across different spatial dimensions, a vital element in many computer vision and signal processing applications. My practical work extensively involves crafting custom models with non-uniform subsampling, so this topic is particularly relevant.

Fundamentally, TensorFlow, specifically when employing the `tf.nn.conv2d` and similar operations, defines stride as a 1D array containing two integer values: `[stride_height, stride_width]`. This representation explicitly allows for independent control over the movement of the convolutional kernel along the height and width axes of the input tensor. It is not an inherent restriction, as the operation is designed to interpret these stride values separately. The stride determines how many pixels the convolution kernel shifts after each computation, defining how densely the kernel samples the input. A stride of `[1, 1]` results in the kernel moving one pixel at a time in both directions, whereas `[2, 1]` would move two pixels vertically and one horizontally, essentially downsampling more significantly along the height.

When implementing convolutional operations, it is essential to understand that these stride values are directly used during the address computation for accessing input feature map data. The kernel position along the height (or width) direction after the n-th (or m-th) convolution is given by n * `stride_height` (or m * `stride_width`), provided n and m start at 0. The process starts at the beginning of the input tensor, and using the stride, a sliding window of the filter’s size moves across the input. The result of each step is an output value that will become a pixel in the output feature map. Consequently, with different `stride_height` and `stride_width`, the output feature map shape will change non-uniformly. Higher stride values will lead to a smaller output feature map.

The flexibility afforded by independent stride control also allows for tailored downsampling strategies. A model designed to process images that are taller than they are wide might benefit from a different stride in height than width, helping to reduce the computational load and control receptive field shape. This contrasts with traditional pooling operations which often use uniform downsampling in each spatial dimension. Therefore, the ability to handle varying strides is critical to implementing complex model architectures effectively, often leading to increased accuracy and faster performance.

To illustrate this, consider the following code examples:

**Example 1: Uneven Strides in a Single Convolutional Layer**

This example demonstrates a straightforward convolutional layer with distinct stride values for height and width.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor (batch, height, width, channels)
input_tensor = tf.constant(tf.random.normal((1, 10, 20, 3)), dtype=tf.float32)

# Convolutional layer with 3x3 kernel and different strides
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(
    filters=16,
    kernel_size=(3, 3),
    strides=(2, 1),
    padding='valid',
    use_bias=False
)

# Apply the convolution
output_tensor = conv_layer(input_tensor)

# Print output tensor shape
print(f"Input Shape: {input_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Output Shape: {output_tensor.shape}")
```

In this case, I've defined a convolutional layer with a 3x3 kernel, a stride of 2 in the height direction and 1 in the width direction, and `valid` padding. The input tensor is of size (1, 10, 20, 3). The convolution operation reduces the height dimension by a factor of two while maintaining the width dimension (due to the different strides), demonstrating how the output dimensions are directly affected by the stride parameters. The output size of the convolutional operation can be computed using `(input_size - kernel_size + 2 * padding) / stride + 1`, rounding down. For this example, we get height = (10 - 3 + 0)/2 + 1 = 4.5 and then rounding to 4. Width = (20 - 3 + 0)/1 + 1 = 18. This accounts for output shape (1,4,18,16) given a filter size of 16.

**Example 2: Strides with Multiple Convolutional Layers**

This extends the previous example, utilizing different strides in consecutive convolutional layers within a simplified neural network model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor (batch, height, width, channels)
input_tensor = tf.constant(tf.random.normal((1, 32, 64, 3)), dtype=tf.float32)

# Define sequential model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(2, 1), padding='same', use_bias=False),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3, 3), strides=(1, 2), padding='same', use_bias=False)
])


# Apply convolution
output_tensor = model(input_tensor)

# Print output tensor shape
print(f"Input Shape: {input_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Output Shape: {output_tensor.shape}")
```

Here, I created a sequential model consisting of two convolutional layers. The first layer utilizes strides of 2 in the height direction and 1 in the width, while the second uses the opposite, 1 in height and 2 in width. Both convolutions apply 'same' padding, ensuring that the output has nearly the same shape (aside from the strides) as the input. The output of this operation demonstrates how different strides in successive layers influence the resulting feature map dimensions and, by extension, the network’s receptive field composition. In this case, the padding will add dimensions so that the calculation uses the same formula and results in: height = 32/2 = 16. Width = 64/1=64.  Second layer height = 16/1 =16. Width = 64/2 = 32. Hence we get the output (1,16,32,64).

**Example 3: Non-square kernels with varying strides**

This example shows how non-square kernels can be combined with non-uniform strides.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor (batch, height, width, channels)
input_tensor = tf.constant(tf.random.normal((1, 40, 80, 3)), dtype=tf.float32)


# Convolutional layer with non-square kernel and different strides
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(
    filters=16,
    kernel_size=(5, 3),
    strides=(2, 3),
    padding='valid',
    use_bias=False
)

# Apply convolution
output_tensor = conv_layer(input_tensor)

# Print output tensor shape
print(f"Input Shape: {input_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Output Shape: {output_tensor.shape}")
```

This demonstrates combining non-square kernels and non-uniform strides. I used a 5x3 kernel with strides of 2 in the height and 3 in the width direction. These settings can sometimes be necessary when feature maps are not uniform or for specific signal processing applications where varying receptive field sizes are required in different dimensions.  The output dimensions are again calculated as (40-5)/2 + 1 = 18.5 (rounding down to 18), and (80-3)/3 + 1 = 26.6 (rounding down to 26). The output is therefore (1, 18, 26, 16) as we expect.

For further understanding and application of these techniques, I would recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation for `tf.nn.conv2d` and `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D`, as these sources provide detailed information about operation parameters. Additionally, I often find studying the implementation details in computer vision model architectures using these techniques to be valuable to understanding the practical benefits of non-uniform strides. Books on deep learning which cover the mathematical underpinnings of convolutional operations and the different types of feature extraction are also a great resource. Moreover, studying research papers on advanced convolutional architectures will show how the flexibility of strides is harnessed for various applications. Understanding how stride affects receptive field and feature map dimensionality is important.
