Image rotation, a common data augmentation technique, introduces variance into training datasets, improving model robustness and generalization. I've consistently found that restricting the rotation angle, rather than applying completely random rotations, yields more stable training, particularly when working with datasets containing inherently oriented objects. This approach also reduces the risk of introducing unnatural artifacts into the data. Using only TensorFlow Keras, specifically with constrained angles, is achievable through a combination of the `tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation` layer and careful parameter configuration.

The core principle rests on understanding the behavior of `RandomRotation`. This layer doesn’t apply a single, global rotation to the entire batch of images. Instead, for each image in the batch, it independently samples a rotation angle from a specified range. The default behavior is to sample uniformly from the interval `[-factor, factor]`, where factor is specified as a fractional value corresponding to a proportion of 2π radians (360 degrees). Therefore, specifying constraints on the rotation angle requires meticulous selection of this 'factor' parameter. Directly defining minimum and maximum angles requires a conversion from degrees to radians, and some mathematical manipulation.

The key challenge isn't in performing the rotation itself, which `RandomRotation` handles effectively. It's about precisely defining the angular range and preventing rotations outside that range. I’ve observed in several projects that careless specification can lead to unexpected augmentation and degraded model performance. The solution involves manually setting the rotation factor based on the desired angle bounds and then potentially post-processing the images if any slight overrotation happens due to random nature of the layer.

Let's consider a scenario where we want to rotate images by a minimum of -15 degrees and a maximum of +15 degrees. This amounts to constraining the rotation between these two values. We need to convert these degree values to radians, understanding that 1 degree equals π/180 radians. Thus:

-   -15 degrees = -15 * (π/180) ≈ -0.2618 radians
-   +15 degrees = +15 * (π/180) ≈ +0.2618 radians

The `RandomRotation` layer, by default, samples uniformly within the bounds specified by `factor`. If we want to have a range of `[-0.2618, 0.2618]` using single `factor` argument, we need to pass a factor of `0.2618`. This sets the bounds as desired.

Now, I will present three distinct code examples using TensorFlow Keras to illustrate this process, each with varying complexities and additional consideration:

**Example 1: Basic Rotation with Constrained Angle**

This code demonstrates the most straightforward approach. We define the `RandomRotation` layer with the appropriate factor to bound rotation angles between -15 and +15 degrees.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Convert degrees to radians
degrees_to_radians = np.pi / 180.0
min_angle_degrees = -15.0
max_angle_degrees = 15.0
factor = max(abs(min_angle_degrees), abs(max_angle_degrees)) * degrees_to_radians

# Define the RandomRotation layer
rotation_layer = tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation(factor=factor)

# Example image (replace with your actual data)
image = tf.random.uniform(shape=(200, 200, 3))
image = tf.expand_dims(image, axis=0)

# Apply the rotation
rotated_image = rotation_layer(image)

# Print resulting image shape (for verification)
print("Shape of rotated image:", rotated_image.shape)

```

The code first establishes constants to convert angles from degrees to radians and then calculates the necessary `factor` value for `RandomRotation`. The layer is then applied to a synthetic image. The output shows that the shape of rotated images remains the same as the input image's shape, confirming that only rotation is performed.

**Example 2: Multiple Layers and Data Pipeline Integration**

Here, we expand upon Example 1 and demonstrate the integration into a larger data processing pipeline using `tf.data.Dataset`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Constants - Degrees to radians conversion
degrees_to_radians = np.pi / 180.0
min_angle_degrees = -10.0
max_angle_degrees = 10.0
rotation_factor = max(abs(min_angle_degrees), abs(max_angle_degrees)) * degrees_to_radians

# Example data augmentation layer that includes resizing and rotation
def augment_image(image):
    image = tf.image.resize(image, [128, 128])
    image = tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation(factor=rotation_factor)(image)
    return image

# Create a sample dataset (replace with your data loading mechanism)
images = tf.random.uniform(shape=(10, 200, 200, 3))
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(images)
dataset = dataset.map(augment_image)
batched_dataset = dataset.batch(4) # create batches

# Apply augmentation to the entire dataset
for batch in batched_dataset.take(2):
    print("Shape of batch:", batch.shape)
```

This example illustrates how to define an image transformation function combining resizing and constrained rotation that can then be used with TensorFlow Dataset API. This method allows efficient augmentation on larger datasets without excessive memory usage. The loop shows how to iterate through the batches of the augmented data.

**Example 3: Combining RandomRotation with other augmentations**

This example demonstrates a situation in which multiple augmentation layers are combined in a more complex data augmentation pipeline

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define angle constraints
degrees_to_radians = np.pi / 180.0
min_angle_degrees = -20.0
max_angle_degrees = 20.0
rotation_factor = max(abs(min_angle_degrees), abs(max_angle_degrees)) * degrees_to_radians

# define augmentation function
def combined_augmentation(image):
    image = tf.image.random_brightness(image, max_delta=0.2) # example brightness augmentation
    image = tf.keras.layers.RandomFlip("horizontal")(image) # example random flip
    image = tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation(factor=rotation_factor)(image) # constrained rotation
    image = tf.image.random_contrast(image, lower=0.8, upper=1.2) # example random contrast
    return image


# Create a sample dataset
images = tf.random.uniform(shape=(5, 150, 150, 3)) # example image data
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(images)
dataset = dataset.map(combined_augmentation) # apply combined augmentations

# iterate to apply and print resulting shape
for augmented_image in dataset:
  print("Shape of augmented image:", augmented_image.shape)
```

This example shows how `RandomRotation`, constrained by our methodology, can seamlessly coexist with other augmentation layers within a function, which makes it adaptable for use in various complex augmentation pipelines in practice. Each image is processed in sequence with the augmentations and outputted.

For additional learning, I recommend referring to the TensorFlow documentation for detailed information on `tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation` and the `tf.data` API. Furthermore, texts covering image processing and computer vision often provide further context on the practical applications of data augmentation strategies. Works focusing on practical deep learning also provide guidance in assembling effective data augmentation pipelines. The key concept here is that the selection of the appropriate factor for the `RandomRotation` layer is determined by the desired angular constraints, and not by merely using arbitrary values. This leads to precise control of the augmentation applied and consequently, better training outcomes.
