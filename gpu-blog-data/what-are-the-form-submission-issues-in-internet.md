Internet Explorer's form submission behavior deviates significantly from modern browsers, primarily due to its legacy rendering engine and inconsistent adherence to web standards.  My experience troubleshooting legacy applications revealed a recurring pattern:  IE's quirks frequently manifested during the submission process itself, impacting both client-side validation and server-side handling. These problems aren't solely about compatibility; they stem from fundamental differences in how IE interpreted and processed HTML forms, leading to unexpected errors and failures.


**1.  Encoding and Character Sets:**

One consistent issue I've encountered involves encoding discrepancies.  IE, particularly older versions, had a more lenient approach to character encoding declarations within HTML forms.  While modern browsers strictly adhere to the `charset` meta tag and HTTP headers, IE might default to a system-specific encoding or interpret it incorrectly, leading to garbled data on the server-side. This was particularly problematic when dealing with non-Latin character sets, such as those used in East Asian languages.  The server would receive corrupted data, failing validation and processing. This would often manifest as seemingly random errors or unexpected data values within the server-side processing logic.

**2.  Input Type Handling:**

IE's handling of various input types, especially those introduced more recently, presented numerous challenges. For instance, the `<input type="date">`, `<input type="time">`, and `<input type="datetime">` elements often behaved unpredictably across different IE versions. Some versions failed to correctly parse or validate the input format, leading to incomplete or erroneous data reaching the server.  In other cases, the browser's default date/time pickers might have been incompatible with the server-side validation rules, resulting in validation failures even with seemingly correctly formatted input.  I had to frequently resort to using JavaScript polyfills and fallback mechanisms to ensure consistent behavior across various IE versions.

**3.  `multipart/form-data` and File Uploads:**

File uploads through forms using `enctype="multipart/form-data"` constituted another area of significant concern. Older IE versions exhibited problems with larger file uploads, exceeding memory limits or encountering unexpected timeouts.  There were also instances where incorrect content types were reported by IE, leading to server-side rejections. The solution usually involved adjusting server-side configuration (increasing upload limits, tweaking timeout settings) alongside client-side modifications for better progress monitoring and error handling.  Proper use of `<progress>` elements and AJAX upload techniques were crucial here.  The lack of standardization in IE's implementation often required careful testing and debugging.

**4.  JavaScript Compatibility and Client-Side Validation:**

Even with compatible JavaScript code, IE's JavaScript engine (JScript) possessed subtle differences that often led to unforeseen errors during form submission.  Issues surrounding event handling, DOM manipulation, and the overall execution environment were common. I remember spending countless hours debugging seemingly trivial JavaScript code, only to find the issue stemmed from inconsistencies between IE and other browsers. The use of JavaScript frameworks and libraries (prior to widespread adoption of standardized solutions) often required customized workarounds to support IE.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Encoding Issue Mitigation**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Form Submission</title>
</head>
<body>
  <form action="/submit" method="post" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
    <input type="text" name="name" value="你好，世界">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
</body>
</html>
```

**Commentary:**  This simple form demonstrates the importance of the `charset` meta tag.  Explicitly setting the character encoding to UTF-8 ensures consistent handling across browsers, including IE.  However, the server-side script must also be configured to handle UTF-8 correctly.  Failure to do so will still result in encoding errors.


**Example 2:  Date Input Polyfill**

```javascript
// Polyfill for date input (if necessary)
if (!('type' in document.createElement('input') && 'date' === 'date')) {
  //Implementation of a datepicker library (e.g. jQuery UI Datepicker) would go here.
  //This would ensure a consistent date-picking experience across all browsers, including older IE versions.
}
```

**Commentary:** This code snippet illustrates the need for a polyfill to handle the lack of native support for the `<input type="date">` element in older IE versions. A full-fledged polyfill, often involving a date picker library, would ensure a consistent user experience.


**Example 3:  AJAX File Upload with Progress Monitoring**

```javascript
//Simplified AJAX file upload example with progress bar
const form = document.getElementById('uploadForm');
const progressBar = document.getElementById('progressBar');

form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const formData = new FormData(form);
  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('POST', '/upload', true);

  xhr.upload.onprogress = function(e) {
    if (e.lengthComputable) {
      const percentComplete = (e.loaded / e.total) * 100;
      progressBar.value = percentComplete;
    }
  };

  xhr.onload = function() {
    if (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) {
      //Success
    } else {
      //Error handling
    }
  };

  xhr.send(formData);
});
```

**Commentary:** This illustrates a more robust approach to file uploads, using AJAX to handle the upload process asynchronously.  The `onprogress` event provides feedback to the user, which is beneficial in scenarios involving large files, reducing the likelihood of timeouts and unexpected errors.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*   Microsoft's documentation for older versions of Internet Explorer (archived if necessary).  This might provide insights into specific quirks and limitations.
*   Comprehensive JavaScript libraries aimed at cross-browser compatibility. These often include specific workarounds for IE.
*   Books on legacy web development, focusing on handling browser inconsistencies. These offer structured guidance on dealing with the complexities of older browsers.



Addressing form submission issues in IE requires a methodical approach, combining thorough understanding of its limitations with the skillful application of JavaScript polyfills, robust error handling, and careful server-side configuration. The challenge lies not just in understanding the quirks but also in building solutions that gracefully degrade while preserving the functionality of the application across a range of browsers.  Over the course of my experience, I've repeatedly learned that the solution is rarely a single fix; rather it often involves a layered approach that addresses multiple facets of the problem.
