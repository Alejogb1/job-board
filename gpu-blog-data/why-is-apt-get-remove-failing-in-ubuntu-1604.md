The failure of `apt-get remove` in Ubuntu 16.04, while often appearing as a generic issue, typically stems from specific underlying conditions related to package management inconsistencies or resource conflicts. My experience across numerous server deployments and troubleshooting sessions has revealed several common causes. These range from a corrupted package database to unmet dependencies during removal, with the specific root cause dictating the required remedy.

A primary cause, and one I have encountered frequently, is a disrupted or inconsistent package database. The Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) maintains a record of installed packages, their versions, and their relationships in a series of files located primarily in `/var/lib/apt/`. Errors can arise when these files become corrupted, are incompletely written, or are mismatched following interrupted package operations. In such scenarios, APT's `remove` command cannot accurately determine the state of the system, leading to failures. Furthermore, if the package was installed by non-APT methods (e.g., directly using dpkg or compiling from source), APT is not fully aware of its presence or the removal process.

Another frequent contributor involves dependency resolution. When `apt-get remove` is executed, it examines the package's dependencies. If another installed package relies on the target, the removal process will fail unless the user adds flags to remove the dependent package, or the dependency is resolved through other package manipulation. This dependency check is crucial to prevent inadvertently breaking the system by removing crucial components. The system will block removal if it results in leaving the system in a non-functional state.

Finally, I have observed instances where package management tools like `apt-get` are actively locked by other processes. This locking mechanism is in place to prevent conflicts if multiple instances are attempting to modify the system's package configuration simultaneously. While this is primarily a preventative feature, it can present as a failure if a previous operation has stalled, leaving the lock in place, preventing further operations from completing. Understanding this locking behavior is crucial to debugging scenarios involving stalled or hung processes.

Let's examine a typical error scenario and the corresponding remedial actions:

**Example 1: Corrupted Package Database**

Imagine an attempt to remove `apache2` fails with an error resembling:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove apache2
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  libapr1 libaprutil1 libexpat1 libldap-2.4-2
Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.
The following packages will be REMOVED:
  apache2
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 1 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
1 not fully installed or removed.
After this operation, 0 B of additional disk space will be used.
dpkg: error processing package apache2 (--remove):
 subprocess installed post-removal script returned error exit status 1
Errors were encountered while processing:
 apache2
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
```

This error typically indicates that `dpkg` (the low-level package manager that `apt` interacts with) encountered an issue during the `post-removal` script execution. While this can be due to specific script errors, it often points to the corrupted package database. To rectify the situation, I would execute:

```bash
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt-get -f install
sudo apt-get remove apache2
```

The first command `dpkg --configure -a` attempts to reconfigure any packages that are only partially installed. This often corrects inconsistencies and triggers the scripts that `dpkg` encountered errors with, re-configuring and running them to a complete state. The second command `apt-get -f install` attempts to correct any broken dependencies and install any missing files and is often required to fix any lingering issues. Once these steps are complete, a subsequent `apt-get remove` is often successful.

**Example 2: Dependency Conflicts**

Suppose I attempted to remove a package named `my-application` which relies on `libwidget1`. The command results in:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove my-application
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  other-application depends on my-application
E: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.
```

This indicates that another package, `other-application`, depends on `my-application` and blocking its removal. To address this I can utilize a force remove, but it's worth noting the danger of such a command and the potential of breaking the system if used without appropriate knowledge:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove my-application --force-depends
```

By using the `--force-depends` flag, I am instructing `apt-get` to disregard the dependencies and forcefully remove `my-application`. However, the dependent package is now in an incomplete state and might not work correctly until it is either removed or re-configured. A better approach in most cases would be to use:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove my-application other-application
```

This command removes both applications together. The system will automatically remove `my-application` and reconfigure `other-application`. This method will maintain the system's integrity and remove all the packages as requested.

**Example 3: Locked Package Manager**

If I attempt to remove `nginx` and get the following error:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove nginx
E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
```

This output clearly states that another process is currently using the package manager, resulting in a lock on the resource. The typical solution is to identify the offending process and terminate it. `lsof` is my preferred tool for this:

```bash
sudo lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock
```

This command shows which process has the `/var/lib/dpkg/lock` file opened. Armed with this information, I would kill the process using its PID and attempt the `apt-get remove nginx` command again. If the command is `apt` or `dpkg`, this indicates a stalled process and can be removed without worry. A stalled process is one that has stopped responding. If the command was not apt, then a full understanding of the process should be undertaken before its termination.

In my experience, these three scenarios encapsulate the majority of `apt-get remove` failures on Ubuntu 16.04. Resolving such issues requires a methodical approach, analyzing the error messages carefully, and applying the appropriate corrective action. While force-removing or ignoring dependency is an option, it should only be applied after a thorough analysis of the situation.

For further study and more detailed information on package management, I recommend exploring the official Ubuntu documentation, specifically the sections concerning APT and `dpkg`. The resources on package management within online forums can also provide additional insight and community-driven solutions for obscure errors. Consider consulting material on operating systems administration for the Linux environment for a comprehensive view of system integrity and package management.
