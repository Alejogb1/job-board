The core challenge in aggregating data across three related Django models using nested `Sum()` annotations lies in properly traversing the relationships to reach the desired fields for summation.  My experience building large-scale e-commerce platforms highlighted this frequently, especially when dealing with complex order structures involving products, order items, and discounts.  Inefficient aggregation queries can significantly impact performance, especially with a growing database.  The solution hinges on understanding Django's ORM capabilities and strategically constructing the annotation queryset.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The process involves chaining `annotate()` calls, each targeting a specific relationship.  The innermost annotation performs the initial summation, then subsequent annotations accumulate these sums up the relational chain.  Correctly specifying the `through` field is crucial when dealing with many-to-many relationships, and understanding the order of annotation is paramount.  An incorrect sequence can lead to inaccurate results or database errors.  The final queryset will contain the aggregated sum for each instance of the top-level model.

Crucially, performance optimization is critical.  Avoid unnecessary database hits by carefully selecting which fields are included in the queryset.  Using `only()` or `defer()` methods can considerably enhance speed, especially with large datasets.  Additionally, ensure appropriate indexing on the relevant database fields to further optimize query execution time.  My experience showed that neglecting database indexing frequently resulted in significant performance degradation in such aggregations.

We assume the following model structure for illustration:

```python
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)

class Order(models.Model):
    order_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    # ... other order details ...

class OrderItem(models.Model):
    order = models.ForeignKey(Order, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='items')
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    quantity = models.IntegerField()
```

This setup represents a common scenario:  Products are sold within Orders, with OrderItems detailing the quantity of each Product per Order.  The goal is to aggregate the total price of products per order, considering the quantity of each item.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Aggregation**

This example demonstrates the fundamental approach:

```python
from django.db.models import Sum

orders_with_total = Order.objects.annotate(
    total_price=Sum(
        Sum('items__product__price', field='items__quantity')
        , field='items'
    )
)

for order in orders_with_total:
    print(f"Order {order.order_id}: Total Price = {order.total_price}")
```

This code first uses a nested `Sum` to calculate the total price for each `OrderItem` (`items__product__price * items__quantity`). The outer `Sum` then aggregates these individual item totals for each order. The  `field` argument in the inner Sum ensures that the multiplication occurs correctly before the outer Sum is performed. This avoids potential errors that can arise from incorrect aggregation order.  Note the `related_name='items'` defined in the `OrderItem` model; this allows for easy access to related OrderItems.

**Example 2: Handling Null Values**

This addresses scenarios where an `OrderItem` might have a null `quantity`:

```python
from django.db.models import Sum, F, Case, When

orders_with_total = Order.objects.annotate(
    total_price=Sum(
        Case(
            When(items__quantity__isnull=False, then=F('items__product__price') * F('items__quantity')),
            default=0,
            output_field=models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
        ), field='items'
    )
)

for order in orders_with_total:
    print(f"Order {order.order_id}: Total Price = {order.total_price}")
```

This uses `Case` and `When` to handle null `quantity` values.  If `items__quantity` is not null, it performs the multiplication; otherwise, it defaults to 0, preventing errors and ensuring correct aggregation. The explicit `output_field` declaration ensures the correct data type for the sum. This is crucial for precision and data integrity.

**Example 3:  Including Discounts (Many-to-Many)**

Let's introduce a `Discount` model with a many-to-many relationship to `Order`:

```python
class Discount(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    orders = models.ManyToManyField(Order, through='OrderDiscount')

class OrderDiscount(models.Model):
    order = models.ForeignKey(Order, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    discount = models.ForeignKey(Discount, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    applied_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
```

Aggregating with discounts necessitates considering the `OrderDiscount` model:

```python
from django.db.models import Sum, F

orders_with_total = Order.objects.annotate(
    total_item_price=Sum(F('items__product__price') * F('items__quantity')),
    total_discount=Sum('orderdiscount__applied_amount'),
    final_total=F('total_item_price') - F('total_discount')
).values('order_id', 'final_total')

for order in orders_with_total:
    print(f"Order {order.order_id}: Final Total Price = {order.final_total}")
```

This example first calculates the total item price as before.  It then uses `Sum('orderdiscount__applied_amount')` to aggregate the applied discounts from the `OrderDiscount` model. Finally, it subtracts the total discount from the total item price to get the final total. The `.values()` call optimizes the queryset by only returning necessary fields.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, consult the official Django documentation on database API and querysets.  A thorough grasp of SQL joins and aggregate functions is also highly beneficial. Studying advanced queryset techniques, such as using `Subquery` expressions, is invaluable for complex scenarios.  Finally, mastering database optimization techniques, such as indexing and query planning, is essential for maintaining application performance.  Careful consideration of these points proved crucial in managing performance during my work.
