The failure of a PyTorch ResNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on test data when not all classes are present during training stems fundamentally from a mismatch between the model's learned feature space and the distribution of the unseen classes.  This isn't simply a matter of insufficient data; it's a problem of representational inadequacy.  During training, the network learns to discriminate between the *present* classes, optimizing its internal weights to effectively separate them within its multi-dimensional feature space.  When encountering a class completely absent during training, the network lacks the necessary learned features to correctly classify it.  This phenomenon is exacerbated by the inherent complexity of ResNet architectures and the subtleties of learned feature hierarchies.

My experience working on image classification projects for medical imaging, specifically identifying rare pathologies, highlighted this issue repeatedly.  We frequently encountered datasets with class imbalances, where certain conditions were significantly under-represented.  While data augmentation techniques mitigated some of the issues related to class imbalance, the complete absence of a class during training proved consistently problematic.  The model wouldn't simply misclassify the unseen class – it would often produce outputs with highly erratic confidence scores, indicating a complete lack of internal representation for that particular category.

This behavior can be understood by considering the nature of ResNet's residual blocks. These blocks facilitate the learning of increasingly complex features through the use of skip connections.  If a class is entirely missing during training, the network's deeper layers, responsible for higher-level feature abstraction, may not develop representations that are general enough to encompass the features of that unseen class.  The network effectively learns a representation optimized solely for the seen classes, leaving a 'gap' in its feature space for the missing ones.

Let's illustrate this with three code examples demonstrating progressively more sophisticated approaches to handling this problem.  The core issue remains the same – the need to ensure that the model's feature space sufficiently accounts for all potential classes in the real-world application.

**Example 1:  Naive Training and Prediction**

```python
import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Assume a ResNet18 model and predefined transforms
transform = transforms.Compose(
    [transforms.ToTensor(),
     transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))])

trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True,
                                        download=True, transform=transform)
trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=4,
                                          shuffle=True, num_workers=2)

testset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False,
                                       download=True, transform=transform)
testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=4,
                                         shuffle=False, num_workers=2)

#  Modified to exclude a class (e.g., class 9 - trucks) during training
trainset_modified = [(image, label) for image, label in trainset if label != 9]
trainloader_modified = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset_modified, batch_size=4, shuffle=True, num_workers=2)

net = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=False, num_classes=9)  # Reduced number of classes
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

for epoch in range(2):  # loop over the dataset multiple times
    running_loss = 0.0
    for i, data in enumerate(trainloader_modified, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = net(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

correct = 0
total = 0
with torch.no_grad():
    for data in testloader:
        images, labels = data
        outputs = net(images)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

print(f'Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images: {100 * correct / total} %')
```
This example demonstrates the problem directly.  Training on a subset of classes leads to poor performance on the test set containing all classes.

**Example 2:  One-vs-Rest Approach (OVR)**

```python
# ... (previous imports remain the same) ...

# Train separate ResNet models for each class, using binary classification
num_classes = 10
models = [torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=False, num_classes=1).to('cuda') for _ in range(num_classes)]
optimizers = [optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9) for model in models]
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()  #Binary Cross Entropy


#training loop (simplified for brevity)
for i in range(num_classes):
  for epoch in range(2): # training for each class separately
    for img, label in trainloader:
      #one vs rest logic here (masking for current class and training)
      pass # implementation left out for brevity


#Prediction
for img,label in testloader:
  class_probs = torch.stack([model(img) for model in models])
  _,predicted_class = torch.max(class_probs,0)
```
This illustrates a method to partially mitigate the issue. By training separate models for each class, the network addresses the absent class by treating the prediction as a multi-label problem.  However, it requires significantly more computational resources and may not provide optimal performance.


**Example 3:  Data Augmentation and Pre-training**

```python
# ... (imports remain the same) ...

#Data augmentation
transform_train = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomCrop(32, padding=4),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465), (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010)),
])

transform_test = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465), (0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010)),
])


trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True,
                                        download=True, transform=transform_train)
testset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False,
                                       download=True, transform=transform_test)

net = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=True, num_classes=10) #Pretrained weights used
#...training and testing as in the first example
```
This addresses the problem indirectly.  Pre-training on a larger dataset, like ImageNet, and employing aggressive data augmentation techniques can help the network learn more generalizable features, improving its ability to handle unseen classes.

In conclusion, the absence of classes during training fundamentally limits the representational capacity of a ResNet CNN.  While strategies like OVR and pre-training with data augmentation can mitigate this, they do not entirely solve the core problem. The most effective solution remains ensuring that the training dataset adequately represents the entire range of classes expected during real-world deployment.  This often necessitates careful dataset curation, collection of more data (especially for under-represented classes), and the strategic application of advanced training techniques.
