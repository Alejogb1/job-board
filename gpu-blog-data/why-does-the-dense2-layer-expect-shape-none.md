The discrepancy between the expected input shape of a dense layer and the received input shape in neural networks, specifically the case of `dense_2` expecting `(None, 256)` while receiving `(16210, 4096)`, stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how data flows and is transformed through successive layers within a network, as well as the typical role of dense layers in processing the output of upstream layers. My experience over several years building various deep learning models highlights that this kind of shape mismatch is a common source of errors, especially for those newly encountering complex architectures.

The root of the problem is that `dense_2`, by virtue of its instantiation, has been designed with a specific understanding of the dimensionality of its incoming data. Typically, the first dimension of a tensor represents the batch size, often denoted as `None` in Keras and TensorFlow to allow for flexibility in the number of samples processed. The second dimension, in this case, `256`, specifies the number of features the layer expects. This expectation was defined when the dense layer was created. When the layer receives an input with a different shape such as `(16210, 4096)`, this mismatch results in a computational incompatibility.

In a typical network, the preceding layers perform transformations that alter the shape of the data. It’s very likely, given the `(16210, 4096)` shape that we are seeing, that the immediate preceding layers have flattened feature map, or produced an output vector, where each sample has a dimensionality of 4096. This situation occurs after convolutional or recurrent layers where the output is often a multi-dimensional tensor. Typically a flattening layer is introduced to convert these higher dimensional tensors to two dimensional tensors for further processing.

The issue can be broken into two related parts: understanding where the `(16210, 4096)` input is coming from, and understanding why `dense_2` is expecting `(None, 256)`. Let's explore this with code examples.

**Example 1: A typical sequence of Convolution, Flatten, and Dense Layer.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), # Convolutional layer - input is single channel (grayscale) images
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),  # Flatten the tensor output from Convolutional layers into 2D tensor
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', name='dense_2') # dense layer expects 256 features
])


#Dummy input data shape. Batch size of 16, with 28x28 pixel images and single channel
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(16, 28, 28, 1))

output = model(dummy_input)

print(output.shape)
#The final output shape from this model is (16, 256) as dense_2 is the last layer.
```

In this example, the input images undergo convolution and max pooling operations that transform the image data into feature maps.  `Flatten` layer is used to restructure these multi-dimensional feature maps into a vector.  `dense_2` then takes the flattened vector and outputs another vector of size 256.  Crucially, the input shape to `dense_2` after the flatten operation has the correct dimensionality, i.e., some batch size `(None, x)`, where `x` is determined by the convolutional layers and the maxpooling layers used. In this specific example, `x` will be calculated as follows. The input 28x28 image is subjected to two convolutions (padding is `valid` by default) each reduce the size of the image by 2. Two MaxPooling operations, also of size 2, further reduce the size. The resulting feature map from convolutions is of size 5x5. The 32 and 64 filter channels result in 5x5x64 output. The flattening results in a flattened tensor of `5 * 5 * 64 = 1600` dimensions. The shape of input of `dense_2` will therefore be `(None, 1600)`. The expected shape of `dense_2`, however, will always be `(None, 256)`, as the `dense_2` layer always produces a tensor of 256 features for every element in the batch. The code, if run, will not throw the error discussed.

**Example 2: Mismatch Example due to missing Flatten layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    #layers.Flatten(),  # Missing flatten layer
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', name='dense_2') # dense_2 expected input shape (None, 256)
])

#Dummy input data shape
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(16, 28, 28, 1))

#This will cause error
try:
  output = model(dummy_input)
  print(output.shape)
except Exception as e:
  print(e)

# Output:
# ValueError: Exception encountered when calling layer 'dense_2' (type Dense).
# Input 0 is incompatible with layer: expected min_ndim=2, found ndim=4. Full input shape: (None, 5, 5, 64)
```

This second example demonstrates the error condition.  Here, the `Flatten` layer has been intentionally omitted.  The output of the second `MaxPooling2D` layer is a tensor of shape `(None, 5, 5, 64)`. This 4D tensor is then passed directly to the `dense_2` layer.  Dense layers are designed to operate on 2D tensors. The resulting error message, `ValueError: Exception encountered when calling layer 'dense_2' (type Dense). Input 0 is incompatible with layer: expected min_ndim=2, found ndim=4. Full input shape: (None, 5, 5, 64)` makes it very clear why an error was thrown. The error message is stating that the `dense_2` layer expected a minimum number of dimensions of 2 and found 4. The tensor shape `(None, 5, 5, 64)` is 4D. The dimensions `5, 5` and `64` do not make sense to the dense layer's internal computation. Note, a batch size `None` was also present in the error message.

**Example 3: Using Reshape to correct the input shape**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Reshape((-1, 5*5*64)),  # Reshape to 2D
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', name='dense_2') # dense_2 expected input shape (None, 256)
])

#Dummy input data shape
dummy_input = tf.random.normal(shape=(16, 28, 28, 1))
output = model(dummy_input)
print(output.shape)
# Output:
# (16, 256)
```

In this third example, instead of the flattening layer, a `Reshape` layer is used. This reshapes the output of MaxPooling to the required shape of `(None, 1600)`. The `Reshape` layer is critical because it prepares the data appropriately so that the `dense_2` layer can perform its calculations. Notice that the model now executes and the output of the model is a vector of shape `(16, 256)`.

In the original problem, `dense_2` expects `(None, 256)`, meaning that the layer’s weight matrix is sized for 256 input features. The input received was of shape `(16210, 4096)`.  This suggests that the layer immediately preceding `dense_2` produced an output tensor that was 4096 dimensional per sample. The batch size, 16210, is irrelevant to the specific error being encountered, although the mismatch in shape is, ultimately, due to that prior layer and its operation.

To address the issue, one must identify the immediate preceding layer to `dense_2` and investigate how it produces a 4096 dimensional output.  The `Flatten` layer, as previously illustrated, is a typical solution if the preceding layers generate multi-dimensional feature maps.  Alternatively, if the preceding layers output a one-dimensional tensor already, it must be verified how its output features relate to the 4096 dimensionality. The dimension 4096 might be coming from a set of fully connected layer. In either case, a `Reshape` layer will have to be introduced to get the correct dimensionality to the `dense_2` layer. One could also add a `Dense(256)` layer instead of the `Reshape` layer as this will transform data to the required shape.

For further learning, I would recommend consulting documentation such as the Keras API documentation on `Dense`, `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Flatten`, and `Reshape` layers. Additionally, the TensorFlow documentation offers more in-depth descriptions of tensor manipulation and shape compatibility. Furthermore, textbooks and online courses on deep learning provide detailed information on various neural network architectures and how they handle shape transformation during data processing.
