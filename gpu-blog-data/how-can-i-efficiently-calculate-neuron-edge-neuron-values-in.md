Efficiently calculating neuron-edge-neuron values, particularly in larger neural networks, hinges on leveraging matrix operations rather than iterative approaches.  My experience optimizing backpropagation algorithms for large-scale image recognition models taught me the crucial importance of this.  Directly iterating through each neuron and its connections is computationally expensive, scaling poorly with network size.  Instead, the entire process can be elegantly expressed and computed using linear algebra.

The core concept lies in representing the network's weights as matrices and the neuron activations as vectors.  A layer's output is then the result of a matrix multiplication followed by an activation function. This allows for efficient computation using optimized libraries such as NumPy or similar tools within TensorFlow or PyTorch.  The "neuron-edge-neuron values," which I interpret as the contribution of each edge (weight) to the final output through a specific neuron, can be derived through backpropagation, also formulated as matrix operations.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Consider a simple feedforward network with L layers. Let  `Wᵢ` represent the weight matrix connecting layer `i` to layer `i+1`, and let `aᵢ` be the activation vector of layer `i`. The forward pass can be expressed as:

`aᵢ₊₁ = f(Wᵢaᵢ + bᵢ)`

where `f` denotes the activation function (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU) and `bᵢ` is the bias vector for layer `i`.  The output of the network is `aₗ`.  During backpropagation, we calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights `Wᵢ`. This process effectively computes the influence of each weight on the final output, representing the "neuron-edge-neuron value" implicitly.

To obtain a more explicit representation of each weight's contribution through a specific neuron, we can examine the gradient calculation.  The gradient of the loss function `L` with respect to a weight `Wᵢⱼₖ` (connecting neuron `j` in layer `i` to neuron `k` in layer `i+1`) is a measure of how a change in that weight affects the loss.  This gradient is calculated using the chain rule, propagating the error from the output layer back through the network.  The partial derivative ∂L/∂Wᵢⱼₖ inherently captures the influence of the edge connecting neuron `j` and `k` through their respective activations.  Crucially, this calculation can be vectorized and efficiently performed using matrix multiplications.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Forward Pass and Backpropagation using NumPy:**

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return x * (1 - x)

# Sample network parameters
W1 = np.array([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]])
W2 = np.array([[0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.8]])
b1 = np.array([0.1, 0.2])
b2 = np.array([0.3, 0.4])

# Input data
X = np.array([0.5, 0.5])

# Forward pass
a1 = sigmoid(np.dot(W1, X) + b1)
a2 = sigmoid(np.dot(W2, a1) + b2)

# Sample loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error) and target
target = np.array([0.8, 0.2])
loss = np.mean((a2 - target)**2)

# Backpropagation
delta2 = (a2 - target) * sigmoid_derivative(a2)
dW2 = np.outer(a1, delta2)
db2 = delta2
delta1 = np.dot(W2.T, delta2) * sigmoid_derivative(a1)
dW1 = np.outer(X, delta1)
db1 = delta1


print("Gradients dW1:", dW1)
print("Gradients dW2:", dW2)

```

This code demonstrates a basic forward and backward pass using NumPy. `dW1` and `dW2` contain the gradients—the implicit "neuron-edge-neuron values" showing each weight's influence on the loss.


**Example 2:  Illustrative Calculation of Individual Weight Influence:**

```python
import numpy as np

#Simplified example to illustrate individual weight impact
W = np.array([[0.2, 0.3]])
x = np.array([0.5])
a = np.dot(W,x)  #output of a single layer

#Let's perturb the first weight by a small amount and observe the impact
W_perturbed = np.array([[0.2 + 0.01, 0.3]])
a_perturbed = np.dot(W_perturbed, x)

#The difference shows how much change in output is caused by the first weight
weight_impact = a_perturbed - a
print(f"Impact of changing the first weight: {weight_impact}")

```

This simplified example illustrates how perturbing a single weight affects the output, offering a direct albeit less efficient way to visualize an individual weight's contribution.  Note: this is not a replacement for backpropagation in complex networks.


**Example 3: Leveraging Automatic Differentiation with TensorFlow:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(1,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Sample data
X = np.array([[0.5]])
y = np.array([[0.8, 0.2]])

# Train the model (single step for illustration)
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(X)
    loss = tf.keras.losses.mse(y, predictions)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

#gradients will contain gradients for all weights and biases
print(gradients)

```

TensorFlow's automatic differentiation handles the complexities of backpropagation.  The `gradients` variable contains the gradients for all weights and biases, which reflect the neuron-edge-neuron values implicitly.

By embracing linear algebra and utilizing optimized libraries, you can efficiently compute and interpret the influence of each connection in a neural network, moving beyond computationally expensive iterative approaches.  The examples illustrate how to achieve this through direct matrix manipulations,  leveraging automatic differentiation libraries for more complex scenarios.  Understanding the underlying mathematical concepts is crucial for achieving optimal performance and gaining insightful interpretation of the network's workings.
