The performance degradation observed when combining two similar joins, even when each performs adequately in isolation, typically stems from the interaction of the query optimizer's choices with the underlying data distribution and indexing strategies. My experience optimizing complex SQL queries for large-scale financial transaction databases has repeatedly highlighted this issue.  The apparent simplicity of adding a second join often masks a significant increase in the cardinality of the intermediate result set, leading to substantial performance penalties. This isn't simply a matter of additive time; the exponential growth of data involved can dwarf any linear time increases.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The primary reason for slowdown lies in the optimizer's inability to efficiently process the expanded data volume generated by the combined joins.  When executing a single join, the optimizer can leverage indexes and statistics to identify the most efficient join algorithm (e.g., nested loop, hash join, merge join). This selection is heavily influenced by the selectivity of the join condition—the proportion of rows that satisfy the join predicate.  High selectivity leads to smaller intermediate results, benefiting most join algorithms.

However, chaining two similar joins—especially when they involve overlapping or related columns—can drastically reduce selectivity.  Consider two tables, `Transactions` and `Accounts`, joined first on `Transactions.account_id = Accounts.account_id`, and subsequently joined with a `Customers` table on `Accounts.customer_id = Customers.customer_id`.  If `Transactions` contains numerous entries for a few high-activity accounts, the first join will produce a relatively small intermediate result.  Adding the second join, however, significantly expands the intermediate result set if `Customers` has multiple accounts per customer. The subsequent processing of this much larger intermediate dataset by the second join substantially impacts the query's overall runtime.

Furthermore, the choice of join order becomes critical.  The optimizer might choose an inefficient execution plan when faced with the combined joins, perhaps performing a nested loop join on a large table first,  negating any performance gains from indexes on other tables.  In contrast, executing each join individually might allow the optimizer to exploit indexes more effectively, leading to significantly faster execution.

Finally, the underlying database statistics play a crucial role. Outdated or inaccurate statistics can lead the optimizer to choose suboptimal join plans.  Regularly updating statistics is vital, especially after significant data modifications, to maintain query performance.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's assume three tables: `Transactions`, `Accounts`, and `Customers`, with relevant columns as described above.  Each example demonstrates a different aspect of the performance issue.  Note that specific performance metrics will vary greatly based on database systems, data volumes, and indexing.

**Example 1: Single Join (Fast)**

```sql
SELECT
    t.transaction_id,
    a.account_balance
FROM
    Transactions t
JOIN
    Accounts a ON t.account_id = a.account_id
WHERE
    t.transaction_date >= '2023-01-01';
```

This query joins `Transactions` and `Accounts` based on `account_id`.  If appropriate indexes exist on `account_id` in both tables, the database can efficiently locate matching rows, leading to quick execution.

**Example 2: Double Join (Slow)**

```sql
SELECT
    t.transaction_id,
    c.customer_name
FROM
    Transactions t
JOIN
    Accounts a ON t.account_id = a.account_id
JOIN
    Customers c ON a.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE
    t.transaction_date >= '2023-01-01';
```

This query adds a join with the `Customers` table.  If `Customers` has many accounts per customer, the intermediate result from the first join is greatly expanded by the second join, leading to a significant performance decrease compared to Example 1. The optimizer's choice of join order and algorithm might exacerbate this effect.

**Example 3: Optimized Double Join (Potentially Faster)**

```sql
SELECT
    t.transaction_id,
    c.customer_name
FROM
    (SELECT t.transaction_id, a.customer_id FROM Transactions t JOIN Accounts a ON t.account_id = a.account_id WHERE t.transaction_date >= '2023-01-01') subquery
JOIN
    Customers c ON subquery.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

This example illustrates a potential optimization: using a subquery.  This can sometimes force the optimizer to choose a more efficient plan. By pre-filtering the `Transactions` and `Accounts` tables before the second join, we might reduce the size of the intermediate result and improve performance compared to Example 2. The effectiveness of this depends on the optimizer and the data distribution.  Note: this could also slow the query if the subquery's execution is inefficient.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend exploring detailed documentation on your specific database system's query optimizer, particularly regarding join algorithms and execution plan analysis.  Consult advanced SQL optimization guides focusing on performance tuning techniques, including indexing strategies, statistics management, and query rewriting. Familiarize yourself with the concept of cardinality estimation and its impact on query performance. Finally, investing in a database profiling tool to analyze query execution plans will prove invaluable in pinpointing performance bottlenecks.  Thorough examination of the execution plans for each of the example queries, along with analysis of table statistics, will illuminate the reasons for observed performance differences.
