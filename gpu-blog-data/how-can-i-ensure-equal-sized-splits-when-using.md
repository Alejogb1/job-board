The core challenge with `np.split` lies in its behavior when the array length isn't perfectly divisible by the number of desired splits.  My experience working with large-scale numerical simulations highlighted this repeatedly; uneven splits lead to imbalances in computational load and, consequently, inaccurate results.  Simply specifying the number of splits isn't sufficient for guaranteed equal-sized partitions; you need a strategy to handle the remainder.

**1.  A Clear Explanation:**

`np.split` divides an array into sub-arrays along a specified axis. When the array length along that axis is not evenly divisible by the number of splits (`indices_or_sections`), the function distributes the remainder unevenly.  The first few sub-arrays receive an extra element. This is predictable but problematic for scenarios requiring balanced workloads or consistent data processing across partitions. To ensure equal-sized splits, one must explicitly manage the array length and indices to guarantee consistent sub-array sizes, often employing floor division (`//`) and modulo operations (`%`).

The algorithm involves:

1. **Determining Sub-array Size:** Calculate the base size of each sub-array using floor division of the total length by the number of splits.
2. **Handling the Remainder:**  Determine the remainder using the modulo operator. This represents the extra elements to be distributed.
3. **Creating Split Indices:**  Generate a list of indices to use with `np.split`. This list will increment by the base size, with adjustments made to account for the remainder.  The remainder is distributed strategically – usually by adding one extra element to the first `remainder` number of sub-arrays.

This approach, unlike relying solely on `np.array_split`, guarantees uniform sub-array size except for at most one sub-array that may be slightly larger to accommodate the remainder.  I've personally found this crucial when implementing parallel algorithms where uneven data distribution would cause significant performance bottlenecks.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Equal Splitting**

```python
import numpy as np

def equal_split(arr, num_splits):
    """Splits an array into equal-sized sub-arrays, handling remainders."""
    arr_len = len(arr)
    base_size = arr_len // num_splits
    remainder = arr_len % num_splits
    split_indices = [i * base_size + min(i, remainder) for i in range(num_splits + 1)]
    return np.split(arr, split_indices[1:-1]) #Exclude first and last indices

my_array = np.arange(17)
splits = equal_split(my_array, 5)
print(splits)
print([len(s) for s in splits]) #Verify sub-array lengths
```

This function directly implements the algorithm described above. The list comprehension efficiently generates the split indices, accounting for the remainder. The `min(i, remainder)` ensures that only the first `remainder` sub-arrays get an extra element.  The slicing `[1:-1]` removes the redundant first and last indices generated by the list comprehension.  The print statements verify the equal-sized (or near equal-sized) splits.


**Example 2:  Handling Multi-Dimensional Arrays**

```python
import numpy as np

def equal_split_multidim(arr, num_splits, axis=0):
    """Splits a multi-dimensional array along a specified axis."""
    arr_len = arr.shape[axis]
    base_size = arr_len // num_splits
    remainder = arr_len % num_splits
    split_indices = [i * base_size + min(i, remainder) for i in range(num_splits + 1)]
    return np.split(arr, split_indices[1:-1], axis=axis)

my_array_2d = np.arange(24).reshape(4,6)
splits_2d = equal_split_multidim(my_array_2d, 3, axis=1)
print(splits_2d)
print([s.shape for s in splits_2d]) #Verify shapes
```

This extends the functionality to handle multi-dimensional arrays.  The `axis` parameter allows the user to specify the axis along which to split.  Crucially, it applies the same remainder handling logic as the previous example, ensuring equal-sized splits along the chosen axis.  Note the shape verification using `s.shape` to confirm consistent sub-array dimensions.


**Example 3: Error Handling and Input Validation**

```python
import numpy as np

def robust_equal_split(arr, num_splits, axis=0):
    """Splits an array, handling errors and validating inputs."""
    if not isinstance(arr, np.ndarray):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a NumPy array.")
    if num_splits <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Number of splits must be positive.")
    if axis >= len(arr.shape) or axis < -len(arr.shape):
        raise ValueError("Invalid axis specified.")

    arr_len = arr.shape[axis]
    base_size = arr_len // num_splits
    remainder = arr_len % num_splits
    split_indices = [i * base_size + min(i, remainder) for i in range(num_splits + 1)]
    return np.split(arr, split_indices[1:-1], axis=axis)


my_array_3d = np.arange(24).reshape(2,3,4)
splits_3d = robust_equal_split(my_array_3d, 2, axis=1)
print(splits_3d)
print([s.shape for s in splits_3d]) #Verify shapes
```

This demonstrates error handling. It explicitly checks for invalid input types, negative or zero split counts, and out-of-bounds axis indices, raising appropriate exceptions.  Robust error handling is vital for production-ready code, preventing unexpected crashes due to improper inputs – a lesson learned from numerous debugging sessions.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of NumPy array manipulation, I strongly recommend the official NumPy documentation and a reputable introductory textbook on Python for scientific computing.  A focus on array indexing and slicing is particularly helpful.  Exploring the source code of well-established scientific computing libraries can provide valuable insights into best practices for efficient and robust array operations.  Finally, practice is key; working through various array manipulation scenarios will solidify understanding and improve coding proficiency.
