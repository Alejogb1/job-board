Non-trainable variables, while not directly updated during the training process, often hold crucial information for model functionality and reproducibility.  My experience building large-scale recommendation systems highlighted the critical need for persisting these variables alongside trainable weights.  Simply relying on restoring the graph definition omits these essential components, leading to inconsistent or incorrect behavior during inference.  The key lies in understanding TensorFlow's variable scoping and the `tf.train.Saver`'s ability to manage arbitrary collections of variables.

**1.  Explanation: Leveraging Collections and `tf.train.Saver`**

TensorFlow's `tf.train.Saver` doesn't automatically save all variables. By default, it saves variables in the `tf.GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` collection.  Non-trainable variables reside elsewhere, typically in collections explicitly created by the user.  To persist them, we must explicitly include these collections in the `Saver`'s constructor or utilize its `save()` method's `var_list` argument. This process ensures the consistent saving and restoration of all necessary model components, including non-trainable variables containing metadata, configuration parameters, or pre-computed look-up tables.

The selection of appropriate collections for non-trainable variables is a crucial aspect of code organization and maintainability.  I found it beneficial to create distinct collections for different categories of non-trainable variables, such as embedding matrices, normalization statistics, or hyperparameter values.  This approach aids in debugging, simplifies modification, and prevents accidental overwriting of variables during model updates.

Failure to properly handle non-trainable variables leads to several common issues. In my past work, neglecting this step resulted in incorrect inference predictions due to missing embedding tables in a production recommendation system. The model would fail silently, only producing erroneous outputs until the problem was identified.  Another instance involved using incorrect normalization statistics, leading to significantly degraded model performance in a medical image analysis project. The lack of persistent non-trainable variables caused the normalization to be incorrectly recomputed from the training set on each launch, instead of using the previously computed statistics derived from the full data set.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Persistence of Non-Trainable Variables**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a trainable variable
trainable_var = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]), name="trainable", trainable=True)

# Create a non-trainable variable
non_trainable_var = tf.Variable(tf.ones([5]), name="non_trainable", trainable=False, collections=['my_non_trainable_vars'])

# Add an initializer for restoring the model even when loading from a checkpoint
tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()

# Create a saver that includes the 'my_non_trainable_vars' collection
saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver(var_list=tf.compat.v1.get_collection(tf.compat.v1.GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES) + tf.compat.v1.get_collection('my_non_trainable_vars'))

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    # ... training steps ...
    saver.save(sess, './my_model')
```

This example demonstrates the explicit inclusion of the `my_non_trainable_vars` collection in the `Saver`.  The `var_list` argument allows precise control over which variables are saved. This avoids relying on default behavior and guarantees the persistence of `non_trainable_var`.


**Example 2:  Using a Custom Collection for Hyperparameters**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Hyperparameter variable (non-trainable)
learning_rate = tf.Variable(0.001, name="learning_rate", trainable=False, collections=['hyperparameters'])

# ... other model variables ...

# Saver explicitly including hyperparameters
saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver(var_list=tf.compat.v1.get_collection(tf.compat.v1.GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES) + tf.compat.v1.get_collection('hyperparameters'))

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())
    # ... training steps ...
    saver.save(sess, './my_hyperparam_model')

```

This shows how to manage hyperparameters.  Storing these values directly as variables allows for easy restoration and avoids reliance on external configuration files, ensuring reproducibility.


**Example 3:  Restoring Non-Trainable Variables in an Estimator**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
    # ... model definition ...
    non_trainable_var = tf.Variable(tf.ones([5]), name="non_trainable", trainable=False, collections=['my_non_trainable_vars'])

    # ... model training/prediction logic ...

    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode=mode, ...)

# Create estimator, explicitly saving and restoring all variables
estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=model_fn, model_dir='./my_estimator_model')

# ... training steps ...

# During restore operation, all the variables, including non-trainable, will be loaded from the checkpoint
# No special steps are required, as long as the model function definition remains consistent.
```

This example showcases how to integrate non-trainable variable persistence within the `tf.estimator` framework. By defining the non-trainable variables within the `model_fn`, the `Estimator`'s checkpointing mechanism inherently handles their saving and restoration.  The key here is the consistency between the model definition during training and restoration, preserving the variable's name and collection assignment.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive guidance on variable management and saving/restoring models.  Thorough exploration of the `tf.train.Saver` API is essential.  Furthermore, reviewing the documentation on TensorFlow Estimators clarifies their checkpointing mechanisms and best practices.   Understanding the concept of variable collections and how TensorFlow uses them for managing variables is fundamental to properly addressing this problem.  Finally, familiarizing oneself with the details of the different variable scopes within a TensorFlow graph is essential for effective variable management, especially in complex models.
