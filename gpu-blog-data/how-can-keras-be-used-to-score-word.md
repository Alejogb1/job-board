The inherent ambiguity in "scoring word combinations" necessitates a precise definition before proceeding.  My experience working on NLP projects at Xylos Corporation highlighted the importance of this:  a seemingly simple request often masks diverse underlying tasks.  Therefore, I will assume we aim to score the semantic relatedness or contextual appropriateness of bigram (two-word) combinations.  Trigrams and n-grams could be handled with similar approaches, albeit with increased computational cost.  We will focus on leveraging Keras for this task, specifically utilizing pre-trained word embeddings and building a simple scoring model.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Our approach involves creating a Keras model that takes two word embeddings as input, combines them using a suitable operation (e.g., element-wise averaging, concatenation), and then feeds the result through a dense layer to produce a single score.  The score, typically a floating-point number, represents the predicted relatedness.  High scores signify high relatedness, while low scores indicate low relatedness.  Pre-trained word embeddings like GloVe or Word2Vec are crucial here; they provide dense vector representations of words, capturing semantic information effectively.  The model learns to map these vector representations into a relatedness score, implicitly learning the complex relationships between words from the training data.  The training data itself consists of word pairs labeled with their corresponding relatedness score, which can be sourced from various resources like human annotations or co-occurrence statistics.

The choice of combining word embeddings is critical. Element-wise averaging offers simplicity and computational efficiency, while concatenation provides a richer representation but requires a larger model.  More sophisticated methods such as multiplicative interactions or attention mechanisms are also feasible, but we'll stick to simpler methods for clarity.  The output layer, a single dense neuron with a suitable activation function (e.g., sigmoid for a score between 0 and 1, or linear for an unbounded score), produces the final relatedness score.

This architecture benefits from the expressiveness of deep learning models while remaining computationally tractable.  The use of pre-trained embeddings significantly reduces the need for vast amounts of labeled data, a common bottleneck in NLP tasks.  The model's parameters are tuned during training to optimize the prediction of relatedness scores, allowing it to learn nuanced relationships between words beyond simple co-occurrence statistics.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Element-wise Averaging**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, Lambda
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Assume pre-trained embeddings are loaded as 'embeddings' dictionary
#  e.g., embeddings['word1'] = np.array([0.1, 0.2, ...])

def create_model_average(embedding_dim):
    input1 = Input(shape=(embedding_dim,))
    input2 = Input(shape=(embedding_dim,))

    # Element-wise averaging
    averaged = Lambda(lambda x: (x[0] + x[1]) / 2)([input1, input2])

    output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(averaged)  # Sigmoid for 0-1 score
    model = Model(inputs=[input1, input2], outputs=output)
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') # Mean Squared Error loss function
    return model

#Example Usage (replace with your actual data)
embedding_dim = 300  # Example dimension
model = create_model_average(embedding_dim)
word_pairs = [(['word1', 'word2'], 0.8), (['word3', 'word4'], 0.2)] # Example data, score 0-1
X = [[embeddings[pair[0][0]],embeddings[pair[0][1]]] for pair in word_pairs]
y = [pair[1] for pair in word_pairs]
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10) #Train the Model

#Prediction
new_pair = ['word5','word6']
prediction = model.predict([embeddings[new_pair[0]], embeddings[new_pair[1]]])
print(f"Relatedness score for {new_pair}: {prediction[0][0]}")
```

This example uses element-wise averaging for simplicity.  The `Lambda` layer applies the averaging function.  Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the loss function, suitable for regression tasks like score prediction.  A sigmoid activation function confines the output to the range [0, 1].


**Example 2: Concatenation**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, concatenate
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

def create_model_concat(embedding_dim):
    input1 = Input(shape=(embedding_dim,))
    input2 = Input(shape=(embedding_dim,))

    # Concatenation
    merged = concatenate([input1, input2])

    output = Dense(1, activation='linear')(merged)  # Linear for unbounded score
    model = Model(inputs=[input1, input2], outputs=output)
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    return model

# Example usage (replace with your actual data)
embedding_dim = 300
model = create_model_concat(embedding_dim)
# ... (training and prediction as in Example 1, adapting to the new model)

```

This example demonstrates concatenation, offering a more expressive model.  A linear activation function is used, allowing for unbounded scores.


**Example 3:  Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
#... (other imports as before)

def handle_oov(word, embeddings, oov_vector):
    return embeddings.get(word, oov_vector)

def create_model_oov(embedding_dim):
    # ... (model architecture as in previous examples)

    # Example usage
    oov_vector = np.zeros(embedding_dim)  # Vector for unknown words
    word1 = 'knownword'
    word2 = 'unknownword'
    embedding1 = handle_oov(word1, embeddings, oov_vector)
    embedding2 = handle_oov(word2, embeddings, oov_vector)
    prediction = model.predict([embedding1, embedding2])
    print(prediction)

```

This example illustrates how to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, a common issue in NLP.  An OOV vector (e.g., a zero vector) is used to represent words not present in the pre-trained embeddings.

This detailed response provides a practical approach to scoring word combinations using Keras, along with code examples demonstrating key techniques and considerations. Remember to adapt these examples to your specific data and requirements, paying close attention to data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.  The choice of embedding model, combination method, and activation function significantly impacts performance and should be carefully considered within the context of the specific application.
