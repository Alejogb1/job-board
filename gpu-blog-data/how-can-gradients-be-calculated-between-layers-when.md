The core challenge in calculating gradients when input values are unavailable lies in the inability to directly apply the chain rule of calculus, the cornerstone of backpropagation in neural networks.  My experience working on a large-scale image recognition project highlighted this precisely;  we encountered this issue during the implementation of a generative adversarial network (GAN) where the generator's output was treated as the input to the discriminator.  This meant the discriminator lacked access to the raw input data that fed the generator.  The solution requires a nuanced understanding of computational graphs and the application of alternative gradient estimation techniques.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The standard backpropagation algorithm relies on the chain rule to propagate errors and compute gradients layer by layer.  Given a loss function L and a network with layers  `L1, L2, ..., Ln`, the gradient of L with respect to the weights of a layer `Li` (∂L/∂Wi) is calculated recursively using the gradients from subsequent layers. This process necessitates the availability of the input values to each layer. However, when input values are unavailable, this direct approach fails.

Several strategies can mitigate this:

* **Surrogate Inputs:** If the input data is unknown but its statistical properties (e.g., mean, variance) are known, we can use these properties to generate surrogate input values.  The gradients calculated using these surrogates will be approximations, but they provide a direction for optimization.  The accuracy of this approach hinges on how well the surrogate input represents the true distribution of the missing data.

* **Implicit Differentiation:** If the relationship between layers is defined implicitly, we can employ implicit differentiation. This technique involves finding the gradients without explicitly solving for the input values. It's particularly useful in scenarios involving complex, non-linear relationships between layers. The downside is that it can lead to more complex computations.

* **Gradient Estimation Techniques:** Various estimation techniques, such as finite differences or Monte Carlo methods, can be employed to estimate the gradients.  Finite differences approximate the gradient by calculating the change in the loss function resulting from small perturbations in the layer's parameters.  Monte Carlo methods use random sampling to estimate the gradient. These methods are computationally expensive but offer a practical alternative when direct calculation is impossible.

The choice of method depends on the specific problem's constraints, the nature of the missing data, and the computational resources available.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate different strategies for calculating gradients when input values are missing.  These examples use simplified scenarios for illustrative purposes.

**Example 1: Surrogate Inputs (using NumPy)**

```python
import numpy as np

# Assume a simplified layer with weights 'w' and a surrogate input 'x_surrogate'
w = np.array([0.5, 0.2])
x_surrogate = np.array([1, 2])

# Define a simple loss function (Mean Squared Error)
def loss(w, x):
    y_pred = np.dot(w, x)
    return np.mean((y_pred - 1)**2) # Target value is 1

# Calculate gradient using finite differences (approximation)
epsilon = 0.001
grad_w = np.zeros_like(w)
for i in range(len(w)):
    w_perturbed = w.copy()
    w_perturbed[i] += epsilon
    grad_w[i] = (loss(w_perturbed, x_surrogate) - loss(w, x_surrogate)) / epsilon

print("Gradient using surrogate input and finite differences:", grad_w)
```

This example uses a simple linear layer and finite differences to estimate the gradient.  The surrogate input `x_surrogate` replaces the unavailable actual input. The accuracy of the gradient is directly linked to the quality of the surrogate.


**Example 2: Implicit Differentiation (using TensorFlow/Autograd)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define implicit relationship between layers (simplified example)
x = tf.Variable(1.0, name='x') # Placeholder for unavailable input, initialized arbitrarily
y = tf.Variable(2.0, name='y') # Output of a previous layer

# Implicit relationship (example: a constraint)
constraint = x**2 + y**2 - 5

# Define loss function based on y (assuming it's related to the missing input x)
loss = y**2

# Use TensorFlow's automatic differentiation to calculate gradients
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch([x, y])
  loss_value = loss
  tape.watch(constraint)

grad_x, grad_y = tape.gradient(loss_value, [x, y],unconnected_gradients='zero')

print("Gradient of loss with respect to x (implicit differentiation):", grad_x.numpy())
print("Gradient of loss with respect to y (implicit differentiation):", grad_y.numpy())
```


This illustrates implicit differentiation where the gradient with respect to the unavailable `x` is calculated implicitly using the constraint. Note that the initialization of `x` can impact the gradient estimation's accuracy.

**Example 3: Monte Carlo Estimation (using PyTorch)**


```python
import torch

# Assume a layer with weights 'w' and a probability distribution for the unavailable input
w = torch.tensor([0.5, 0.2], requires_grad=True)

# Define a simple loss function
def loss(w, x):
    y_pred = torch.dot(w, x)
    return torch.mean((y_pred - 1)**2) # Target value is 1


# Monte Carlo estimation: sample inputs and average gradients
num_samples = 1000
total_grad = torch.zeros_like(w)
for _ in range(num_samples):
    # Sample from a placeholder distribution (replace with actual distribution)
    x = torch.randn(2)
    loss_val = loss(w,x)
    loss_val.backward()
    total_grad += w.grad
    w.grad.zero_()

average_grad = total_grad / num_samples
print("Gradient using Monte Carlo estimation:", average_grad)
```

This example showcases Monte Carlo estimation.  The unavailable input `x` is replaced with samples from a random distribution. The gradient is estimated as the average of gradients calculated from these samples.  The accuracy improves with more samples but at increased computational cost.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further study, I recommend consulting advanced texts on optimization and machine learning, focusing on chapters detailing backpropagation, automatic differentiation, and gradient estimation techniques.  Also, look for publications on generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders, as these architectures frequently grapple with the problem of unavailable inputs during training. A solid grasp of probability and statistics will also greatly benefit your understanding.  Finally, reviewing source code of established deep learning libraries will give insight into their implementations of automatic differentiation engines.
