The discrepancy between the CUDA version reported by `nvidia-smi` and the actual CUDA toolkit version being used by an application arises because `nvidia-smi` reports the *driver* version's compatibility, not the installed toolkit's version. I've encountered this issue frequently while managing GPU resources for various deep learning projects; understanding this distinction is critical for troubleshooting CUDA-related errors.

The `nvidia-smi` utility queries the NVIDIA kernel driver directly, and the CUDA version reported is the highest CUDA version supported by that specific driver. It essentially communicates the maximum API level the driver can handle, not the version of the CUDA toolkit currently installed. This differs fundamentally from, say, querying the `nvcc` compiler or other CUDA runtime libraries which would reveal the toolkit version. Consider this a matter of interface compatibility â€“ the driver advertises its ability to interact with a specific range of CUDA API levels, and this range often encompasses multiple versions of the CUDA toolkit.

The CUDA toolkit, on the other hand, includes the `nvcc` compiler, libraries, headers, and other development tools necessary to build CUDA applications. It's the toolkit version that dictates which CUDA features are available to the programmer at compile time. For instance, if a program is compiled with CUDA 11.8, it will not be able to leverage features present in CUDA 12, even if the driver reports compatibility with a higher version. Therefore, having a driver capable of CUDA 12 does not automatically imply that CUDA 12 is installed, or being utilized.

A scenario where this difference becomes problematic involves environments with multiple CUDA toolkits installed. Often, a user might install multiple versions of the CUDA toolkit for different project dependencies or maintain legacy codebases. It is possible to have multiple toolkits present on the system while only one driver is installed and loaded by the operating system. In such cases, `nvidia-smi` provides a snapshot of the driver's capability, while the toolkit in use for a specific application will be dictated by environment variables such as `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Consequently, an application compiled with CUDA 11.8 might execute flawlessly with a driver reporting CUDA 12 compatibility, yet fail if libraries required by the older toolkit aren't located correctly within the path settings. Similarly, if the user attempts to compile a project expecting CUDA 12 features while only CUDA 11.8 headers are present, the compilation will fail.

To illustrate, consider the following three scenarios.

**Example 1: Driver Reports Higher Version**

Suppose a system has a driver supporting up to CUDA 12.0, as indicated by `nvidia-smi`. However, the CUDA toolkit installed and used for an application is version 11.6. Running `nvidia-smi` in the command-line shell might produce output similar to this (edited for brevity):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NVIDIA-SMI 525.105.17   Driver Version: 525.105.17   CUDA Version: 12.0     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id    Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr. ECC |
| Fan  Temp  Perf  Pwr:Usage/Cap|        Memory-Usage | GPU-Util  Compute M. |
|===============================+======================+======================|
|   0  NVIDIA GeForce...  Off  | 00000000:01:00.0  On |                  N/A |
| N/A   56C    P0    29W / N/A  |    312MiB /  6144MiB |      0%      Default |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

This output indicates that the driver is capable of running CUDA 12 applications. If an application is compiled with the CUDA 11.6 toolkit and run on this system, it will execute successfully since the driver's CUDA 12 compatibility covers the CUDA 11.6 API. However, attempting to directly build a CUDA application requiring features only present in CUDA 12.0 using the installed toolkit would result in build errors because the necessary include files and libraries for CUDA 12 are not present.

**Example 2: Explicitly Querying Toolkit Version**

To ascertain the actual version of the CUDA toolkit in use, one must query the `nvcc` compiler or inspect the `cuda` directory structure. If a developer, working in the same scenario as example 1, were to use the command-line `nvcc --version`, a different output is generated:

```
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2021 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Tue_May_25_21:17:08_PDT_2021
Cuda compilation tools, release 11.6, V11.6.124
Build cuda_11.6.r11.6/compiler.31057828_0
```

This clearly indicates that the CUDA compiler being used is from the CUDA 11.6 toolkit, despite the driver reporting CUDA 12 compatibility. It highlights the crucial distinction: the driver's compatibility is not synonymous with the toolkit's version installed and used to compile an application. Furthermore, if the application were reliant on `CUDA_VERSION` preprocessor macro, the value would also reflect the installed toolkit version not the driver reported version.

**Example 3: Using the CUDA Runtime API**

A further method involves inspecting the output of a simple CUDA program that utilizes the runtime API to determine the CUDA version being targeted during compilation. Here is a simple C++ program:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda.h>

int main() {
    int driverVersion = 0;
    int runtimeVersion = 0;
    cudaDriverGetVersion(&driverVersion);
    cudaRuntimeGetVersion(&runtimeVersion);
    std::cout << "CUDA Driver Version: " << driverVersion / 1000 << "." << (driverVersion % 1000) / 10 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "CUDA Runtime Version: " << runtimeVersion / 1000 << "." << (runtimeVersion % 1000) / 10 << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Compiling this program and executing it on the system in example one will produce output similar to this:

```
CUDA Driver Version: 525.10
CUDA Runtime Version: 11.6
```

Note the discrepancy between the driver version obtained programmatically and the runtime version;  the runtime version corresponds to the CUDA toolkit version utilized for compiling this application.  This programmatic confirmation further clarifies that `nvidia-smi` and the program itself retrieve version information from different sources. The driver is consulted by `nvidia-smi`, while the CUDA runtime libraries and includes, dictated during compilation by linking to the appropriate libraries, inform the runtime version.

In summary, `nvidia-smi`'s output reflects the *driver* compatibility with CUDA API levels, whereas the true CUDA toolkit version needs to be confirmed using `nvcc --version` or similar runtime checks, and is ultimately governed by your build environment. The distinction is essential for debugging CUDA-related problems.

For additional information and troubleshooting techniques, the NVIDIA CUDA documentation and release notes are invaluable resources. Technical blogs and articles within the AI and HPC communities are also beneficial. Also, exploring the available documentation for the specific libraries you are attempting to compile or link with CUDA will prove fruitful. Finally, consulting the manuals of CUDA-aware programming tools, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow is often needed since they also report the CUDA toolkit they were built against. These resources, combined with the understanding that `nvidia-smi` reports driver compatibility and not toolkit version, can help diagnose and resolve many CUDA-related errors encountered in development.
