The absence of a deployed Dataflow job following a successful Airflow DAG run often stems from a mismatch between Airflow's perceived success and the actual state of the Dataflow job lifecycle.  My experience troubleshooting this across numerous large-scale ETL pipelines indicates that the problem rarely lies within a single, obvious point of failure, but rather a confluence of factors related to error handling, job submission mechanisms, and Dataflow's own internal states.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Airflow, as a workflow orchestrator, primarily focuses on managing the execution and dependencies between tasks.  It signals a task's success based on the return code of the executed command.  However, the Dataflow job submission process involves several steps beyond a simple command execution.  A successful command doesn't guarantee a successfully created and running Dataflow job.  The issue can arise from:

* **Transient Network Issues:** The Airflow worker might successfully execute the `gcloud` command to submit the Dataflow job, but transient network problems could prevent the command from fully completing its communication with the Google Cloud Dataflow API. This results in a seemingly successful Airflow task while the Dataflow job remains uncreated or in a failed state.

* **Insufficient Permissions:**  The service account used by the Airflow worker might lack the necessary permissions to create and manage Dataflow jobs. This is a common oversight, especially in multi-tenant environments where permissions are carefully managed.  The Airflow worker might execute without encountering an explicit permission error, but the underlying Dataflow API call fails silently.

* **Dataflow Job Configuration Errors:**  Errors in the Dataflow job template itself, such as incorrect project IDs, region specifications, or resource constraints, can lead to job creation failure without explicit feedback to the Airflow worker.  The submission command might run without error, but the Dataflow service rejects the job request internally.

* **Improper Error Handling:** Airflow tasks often lack robust error handling.  The `gcloud` command's output needs to be meticulously parsed to identify subtle failures beyond a simple non-zero exit code.  A simple `check_call()` might mask deeper issues in the Dataflow job creation process.

* **Asynchronous Job Submission:**  Dataflow job creation is asynchronous.  The `gcloud` command returns immediately after submitting the job, not after it's fully created and running. Airflow's success check should incorporate a polling mechanism to verify the Dataflow job's status before marking the task as complete.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Inadequate Error Handling:**

```python
from subprocess import check_call

def submit_dataflow_job(project_id, region, template_path):
    command = ["gcloud", "dataflow", "jobs", "run", "--project={}".format(project_id),
               "--region={}".format(region), "--template={}".format(template_path)]
    check_call(command) # This lacks detailed error handling

# ... Airflow task using this function ...
```

This example demonstrates inadequate error handling.  `check_call` simply raises an exception if the command fails with a non-zero exit code, providing no information about the nature of the failure.  It's crucial to capture stdout and stderr for proper diagnostics.


**Example 2: Improved Error Handling and Polling:**

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from time import sleep
from google.cloud import dataflow_v1beta3 as dataflow

def submit_dataflow_job(project_id, region, template_path):
    command = ["gcloud", "dataflow", "jobs", "run", "--project={}".format(project_id),
               "--region={}".format(region), "--template={}".format(template_path)]
    process = Popen(command, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
    stdout, stderr = process.communicate()

    if process.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError("Dataflow job submission failed: {}".format(stderr.decode()))

    #Polling to verify job creation
    client = dataflow.JobsV1Beta3Client()
    job_id = extract_job_id_from_stdout(stdout.decode()) #Helper function to extract job ID

    while True:
        try:
            job = client.get_job(request={'project_id': project_id, 'job_id': job_id, 'location': region})
            if job.current_state == dataflow.Job.State.JOB_STATE_RUNNING:
                return job_id
            elif job.current_state in [dataflow.Job.State.JOB_STATE_FAILED, dataflow.Job.State.JOB_STATE_CANCELLED]:
                raise RuntimeError(f"Dataflow job {job_id} failed with state: {job.current_state}")
        except Exception as e:
            sleep(10) #retry after 10 secs
            if isinstance(e, dataflow.exceptions.NotFound):
                raise RuntimeError(f"Dataflow job {job_id} not found. Probable submission failure.")

#Helper function implementation omitted for brevity
```

This example significantly improves error handling by capturing and analyzing the `gcloud` command's output. Additionally, it introduces polling using the Dataflow API to verify job creation and status.


**Example 3: Using a Dedicated Service Account:**

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from google.cloud import dataflow_v1beta3 as dataflow

credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    '/path/to/dataflow-service-account.json',
    scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform']
)
client = dataflow.JobsV1Beta3Client(credentials=credentials)

# ... subsequent code using the client with explicit credentials ...
```

This example demonstrates using a dedicated service account with appropriate Dataflow permissions, circumventing potential permission issues associated with the Airflow worker's default credentials.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Google Cloud Dataflow documentation, the Airflow documentation, and the Python libraries for interacting with the Google Cloud APIs are essential resources. Consult the troubleshooting sections within these documents to address specific issues. Furthermore, understanding the intricacies of service accounts and IAM roles within Google Cloud is crucial for successful deployment and management.  Thorough familiarity with exception handling in Python and best practices for subprocess management will be invaluable.  Finally, investing time in logging practices will aid significantly in identifying the root cause of problems in a complex workflow.
