TensorFlow's `tf.gather` function, while efficient for selecting elements from a tensor based on indices, presents a challenge when dealing with indices that fall outside the bounds of the input tensor.  My experience working on large-scale recommendation systems highlighted this precisely; improperly handled out-of-range indices frequently led to silent failures or unexpected behavior, significantly impacting model performance and debugging efforts.  The key to robustly handling these situations lies in careful pre-processing of the index vector and understanding the behavior of `tf.gather`'s optional parameters.

**1. Understanding `tf.gather` Behavior and Out-of-Range Indices**

`tf.gather` fundamentally performs element selection. Given a tensor `params` and an index tensor `indices`, it returns a new tensor containing elements from `params` at positions specified by `indices`.  Crucially, the default behavior for out-of-range indices varies depending on the context.  In eager execution, an `errors.InvalidArgumentError` is generally raised.  However, within a `tf.function` or during graph execution, the behavior might be less predictable, potentially leading to silent errors or undefined values.  This inconsistency makes proactive handling of potentially problematic indices paramount.

The core strategy is to identify and either clip or mask out-of-range indices *before* passing them to `tf.gather`.  This prevents runtime errors and ensures consistent behavior across execution modes.  The choice between clipping and masking depends on the specific application and the desired interpretation of out-of-range indices.

**2. Code Examples Illustrating Different Handling Strategies**

The following examples demonstrate different approaches, focusing on clarity and robustness:

**Example 1: Clipping Out-of-Range Indices**

This method limits indices to the valid range of `params`. Indices exceeding the upper bound are replaced with the maximum valid index, while indices below the lower bound are replaced with 0.  This approach is suitable when out-of-range indices should be treated as referring to the boundary elements.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

params = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
indices = tf.constant([0, 2, 5, 3, -1])

# Clip indices to the valid range [0, 4]
clipped_indices = tf.clip_by_value(indices, 0, tf.size(params) - 1)

gathered_tensor = tf.gather(params, clipped_indices)

print(f"Original indices: {indices.numpy()}")
print(f"Clipped indices: {clipped_indices.numpy()}")
print(f"Gathered tensor: {gathered_tensor.numpy()}")
```

This code first defines `params` and `indices`. Then, `tf.clip_by_value` ensures all indices are within the bounds [0, 4]. Finally, `tf.gather` operates safely on the clipped indices.


**Example 2: Masking Out-of-Range Indices**

This approach identifies and masks out-of-range indices, effectively ignoring them. This might be preferable when out-of-range indices indicate missing or invalid data.  A default value is used to replace the result of gathering the out-of-range index.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

params = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
indices = tf.constant([0, 2, 5, 3, -1])

# Create a mask to identify in-range indices
mask = tf.logical_and(indices >= 0, indices < tf.size(params))

# Apply the mask to select in-range indices
in_range_indices = tf.boolean_mask(indices, mask)

# Gather only in-range indices
gathered_tensor = tf.gather(params, in_range_indices)

# Pad with a default value to maintain original size (optional)
default_value = 0
padded_tensor = tf.pad(gathered_tensor, [[0, tf.size(indices) - tf.size(in_range_indices)]], constant_values=default_value)

print(f"Original indices: {indices.numpy()}")
print(f"In-range indices: {in_range_indices.numpy()}")
print(f"Gathered tensor: {gathered_tensor.numpy()}")
print(f"Padded tensor: {padded_tensor.numpy()}")

```

Here, a boolean mask is generated to filter out-of-range indices. Only the valid indices are used with `tf.gather`.  The optional padding ensures the output maintains the original shape, filling missing values with `default_value`.


**Example 3:  Handling Out-of-Range with a Custom Function and `tf.where`**

For more complex scenarios requiring conditional logic, a custom function coupled with `tf.where` offers greater flexibility.  This example uses a custom function to map out-of-range indices to a specific value, while using tf.where for efficient conditional handling.


```python
import tensorflow as tf

params = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
indices = tf.constant([0, 2, 5, 3, -1])

def handle_out_of_range(index, params_size):
  return tf.cond(tf.logical_or(index < 0, index >= params_size), lambda: -1, lambda: index)

processed_indices = tf.map_fn(lambda idx: handle_out_of_range(idx, tf.size(params)), indices)

gathered_tensor = tf.gather(params, processed_indices)

print(f"Original indices: {indices.numpy()}")
print(f"Processed indices: {processed_indices.numpy()}")
print(f"Gathered tensor: {gathered_tensor.numpy()}")
```

This example defines `handle_out_of_range`, which checks if an index is out-of-range. If it is, it maps the index to -1, otherwise it returns the index itself. `tf.map_fn` applies this function to each index, allowing for customized handling of each index individually.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's tensor manipulation functions, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  The documentation provides detailed explanations, examples, and API references covering a wide range of functionalities.  A thorough study of  TensorFlow's error handling mechanisms is also crucial.  Finally, exploring advanced TensorFlow concepts like custom gradient implementations and graph optimization can improve performance and control over tensor operations.  These resources, combined with practical experience, will equip you with the knowledge to handle more complex scenarios effectively.
