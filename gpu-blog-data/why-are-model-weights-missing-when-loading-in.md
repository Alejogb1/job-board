During my tenure building machine learning pipelines, I’ve frequently encountered a frustrating issue: model weights appearing to be missing or not loaded correctly when using PyTorch. This isn't usually an outright failure to load the file itself, but rather a mismatch between the loaded state dictionary and the model's expected parameters, leading to either poorly performing models or outright errors.

Fundamentally, the issue stems from PyTorch’s `state_dict()` mechanism. When saving a model using `torch.save()`, the default action is to serialize the model's `state_dict`. This dictionary stores all the learned parameters, such as weights and biases, associated with each layer. When loading, the expectation is that the loaded `state_dict` will be compatible with the architecture of the target model, allowing `model.load_state_dict()` to seamlessly transfer the learned parameters. A discrepancy in the structure or size of the keys in the loaded dictionary or the model will cause issues.

One primary source of this mismatch arises from variations in the model definition between the saving and loading stages. Even seemingly minor changes to the model architecture, such as adding or removing a layer, using a different activation function, or altering the dimension of a convolutional filter, will cause the `state_dict` keys to become incompatible. The keys in the dictionary are layer names as defined in the model's forward pass, and changing the forward pass directly affects these keys. When loading a model in PyTorch, the dictionary's keys must exactly match the target model to apply the parameters correctly. The `load_state_dict` function in PyTorch attempts a strict match; failing this, it may ignore parameters, produce errors, or, sometimes, silently proceed with partially initialized parameters.

Another common cause involves discrepancies arising from using different ways to encapsulate a model. Specifically, wrapping a model within modules such as `torch.nn.DataParallel` or `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` during training but loading them directly into the base model without stripping the wrapping. These wrappers typically prefix the keys within the `state_dict`, creating a mismatch between the saved parameters and the current model's requirements. Similarly, using nested models will add another layer of nesting to the parameters, causing issues during loading, as the loaded dictionary reflects the model's structure during saving.

Furthermore, when using pre-trained models, it’s critical to verify that the saved state dictionary exactly matches the target model’s parameters. When you utilize pre-trained weights, often loaded from third-party sources or frameworks, mismatches may occur due to differences in naming conventions or the way the model architectures are serialized. For instance, parameters extracted from a TensorFlow model are not compatible with a PyTorch model directly because they use different internal representations, requiring conversion routines and potentially adjustments to the state dictionary. Similarly, even when using pre-trained weights from PyTorch itself, differing versions of the library can lead to minor variations in the model architecture, and consequently, the state dictionary's keys.

To avoid these issues, meticulous attention to detail when saving and loading models is paramount. Ensuring the exact same model definition, including all layers and their specific parameters, during both save and load processes is necessary. Furthermore, when working with distributed training, careful handling of the prefixes introduced by `DataParallel` or `DistributedDataParallel` is critical.  When loading state dictionaries obtained from external sources, particularly those from different deep learning frameworks, pre-processing or conversion of the parameters may be required.

Now, let's explore three illustrative code examples highlighting these scenarios:

**Example 1: Model Architecture Mismatch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Model Definition (Version 1)
class ModelV1(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ModelV1, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(20, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Model Definition (Version 2) - modified
class ModelV2(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ModelV2, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 30) # changed to 30
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(30, 10) # Changed to 30

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x


# Scenario: Training with V1 and Loading into V2.
model_v1 = ModelV1()
torch.save(model_v1.state_dict(), 'model.pth')

model_v2 = ModelV2()
try:
    model_v2.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth')) #This will throw an error
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error during state dictionary loading: {e}")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the fundamental issue of architecture mismatch. `ModelV1`, having a different hidden layer size than `ModelV2`, results in a `RuntimeError` when attempting to load the saved state dictionary. The sizes of `fc1` and `fc2` are different. The keys are different, causing the error. This is not a file loading issue; rather, a parameter incompatibility problem.

**Example 2: DataParallel Wrapping**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

# Training with DataParallel (simulated)
model = SimpleModel()
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    model = nn.DataParallel(model)
# Simulate some training steps and saving the model after training
model_state_dict = model.state_dict()
torch.save(model_state_dict, 'model_parallel.pth')

# Loading without handling DataParallel prefix
model_no_parallel = SimpleModel()
try:
    model_no_parallel.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_parallel.pth'))
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error during loading without handling DataParallel: {e}")

# Correct way to load from a DataParallel model.
model_no_parallel = SimpleModel()
loaded_state_dict = torch.load('model_parallel.pth')
# Remove the prefix 'module.' from keys.
loaded_state_dict = {k.replace('module.', ''): v for k, v in loaded_state_dict.items()}
model_no_parallel.load_state_dict(loaded_state_dict)
print("Successfully loaded model after removing prefix")
```

*Commentary:* In this case, the use of `DataParallel` during simulated training adds the prefix ‘module.’ to each key in the state dictionary. When the attempt is made to load this into the standard, unwrapped `SimpleModel`, it fails as the keys do not match. Correctly loading requires stripping this ‘module.’ prefix. Ignoring the wrapping can lead to an error, or incorrect parameter loading.

**Example 3: Pre-trained Model Mismatch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import collections

class PreTrainedModelV1(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
      super(PreTrainedModelV1, self).__init__()
      self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3)
      self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3)
      self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32*5*5, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

class PreTrainedModelV2(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
      super(PreTrainedModelV2, self).__init__()
      self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=5) #Changed Kernel Size
      self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=5) #Changed Kernel Size
      self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32*3*3, 10) # Convolutions result in different tensor shape

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x


# Simulate pre-trained weights (different model)
model_pretrained_v1 = PreTrainedModelV1()
pretrained_state_dict = model_pretrained_v1.state_dict()
torch.save(pretrained_state_dict, "pretrained_model_v1.pth")
#Loading these into v2.
model_v2 = PreTrainedModelV2()
try:
    model_v2.load_state_dict(torch.load("pretrained_model_v1.pth"))
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error during loading of pre-trained weights: {e}")

#Attempting to load only some compatible layers.
model_v2 = PreTrainedModelV2()
loaded_dict = torch.load("pretrained_model_v1.pth")
#Filter for keys that are present in both.
filtered_dict = {k: v for k, v in loaded_dict.items() if k in model_v2.state_dict()}
#Load only the filtered layers that match
model_v2.load_state_dict(filtered_dict, strict=False)

print("Successfully loaded compatible layers, ignored mismatches")
```
*Commentary:* This illustrates a common issue when dealing with pre-trained weights. Even though the model has the same layers, changes to the kernel size result in different shapes of the intermediate tensors, resulting in mismatched keys and a `RuntimeError`. When attempting to use pre-trained weights from a modified model, careful filtering must be done. In this case, loading with `strict=False` lets the process continue. It loads only the layers where the keys are matching and ignores the incompatible ones.

For further learning, I recommend exploring PyTorch's official documentation, specifically the sections regarding saving and loading models. Additionally, articles explaining state dictionary mechanics and handling distributed training intricacies are available on various research websites. Finally, the community forums dedicated to the PyTorch library are invaluable resources for specific use cases or troubleshooting issues that can occur while loading. Careful handling of model parameters is an essential aspect of working with neural networks, and understanding how PyTorch handles them is necessary.
