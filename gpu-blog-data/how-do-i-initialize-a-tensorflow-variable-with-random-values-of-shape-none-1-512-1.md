TensorFlow's dynamic shape handling, especially concerning the `None` dimension, requires a nuanced approach when initializing variables with random values. The `None` dimension signifies a placeholder for a variable batch size, which is not determined until the model is executed. This differs from static shape declarations where all dimensions are fixed at the time of variable creation. Directly specifying a shape containing `None` in methods like `tf.random.normal` used for initialization will cause an error, as TensorFlow requires concrete tensor shapes during initial allocation. To achieve the desired initialization with a dynamic first dimension, one needs to leverage the flexibility of TensorFlow's graph execution and variable assignment mechanisms.

The core principle revolves around creating a variable with a defined shape, excluding the `None` dimension, and then defining an initialization that accounts for the dynamic dimension later. When the model processes its first batch of data, we can then perform an assignment of the variable with values of the desired shape including the appropriate size for the first dimension. I have personally encountered this challenge several times while building various convolutional neural networks, particularly when dealing with variable length sequence data and generating embeddings.

Let me clarify with some code examples.

**Example 1: Initializing with a Placeholder and Assignment**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the variable's shape, excluding the batch dimension (None).
variable_shape_static = (1, 512, 1)

# Create the variable with the static shape, initialized with zeros for now.
variable = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(variable_shape_static), dtype=tf.float32)

# Define a placeholder for the batch size.
batch_size_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)

# Define the initialization operation using tf.random.normal with the dynamic batch size.
init_op = tf.assign(variable, tf.random.normal(tf.concat([[batch_size_placeholder], tf.constant(variable_shape_static, dtype=tf.int32)], axis=0), stddev=0.1))


# Example of running the assignment
# Define the session and initialize uninitialized variables
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

# Run the initialization with a batch size of 10
sess.run(init_op, feed_dict={batch_size_placeholder: 10})
initial_value_10 = sess.run(variable)

# Run the initialization with a batch size of 5
sess.run(init_op, feed_dict={batch_size_placeholder: 5})
initial_value_5 = sess.run(variable)

# Print the shapes to show the variation
print("Initial shape when batch size is 10:", initial_value_10.shape)
print("Initial shape when batch size is 5:", initial_value_5.shape)

sess.close()

```

This first example illustrates the basic mechanics. I declare a variable with a fixed shape representing all dimensions except `None`. A placeholder `batch_size_placeholder` is defined to represent the size of the dynamic batch. Then, I use `tf.assign` to generate random values using `tf.random.normal` based on the combined shape obtained from the placeholder's value and static shape defined earlier. A standard deviation of 0.1 is specified in `tf.random.normal`, but that can be changed to suit the application. Importantly, this initialization operation doesn't execute during the variable's initial creation but is executed later with a session and a feed_dict. This allows us to dynamically set the batch size during runtime. The shapes of the assigned values are printed after two such initializations, demonstrating that the dimension associated with `None` changes as per the feed dictionary.

**Example 2: Using `tf.Variable` and `tf.initializers.random_normal` with Assignment on First Use**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the variable's shape, excluding the batch dimension (None).
variable_shape_static = (1, 512, 1)

# Create the variable with the static shape, initialized with zeros for now.
variable = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(variable_shape_static, dtype=tf.float32), trainable=True)

# Create a flag to check if variable has been initialized
init_flag = tf.Variable(False, trainable=False)

# Define a placeholder for the dynamic dimension size
batch_size_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)

# Condition operation to initialize only when it's the first run
def dynamic_initializer(batch_size):
    init_op = tf.assign(variable, tf.random.normal(tf.concat([[batch_size], tf.constant(variable_shape_static, dtype=tf.int32)], axis=0), stddev=0.1))
    init_flag_update = tf.assign(init_flag, True) # set the flag to true after initialization
    with tf.control_dependencies([init_op]): # ensures initialization happens before flag update
        return init_flag_update
    

# Call the conditional initialization only if the init_flag is False
condition = tf.cond(tf.logical_not(init_flag), lambda: dynamic_initializer(batch_size_placeholder), lambda: tf.identity(init_flag))

# Example of running the initialization
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())


# Run the initialization with a batch size of 10
sess.run(condition, feed_dict={batch_size_placeholder: 10})
initial_value_10 = sess.run(variable)

# Run again with batch size 5, it will use the existing value, so will not overwrite
sess.run(condition, feed_dict={batch_size_placeholder: 5})
initial_value_5 = sess.run(variable)


# Print the shapes
print("Initial shape when batch size is 10:", initial_value_10.shape)
print("Shape when ran with batch size 5 again:", initial_value_5.shape)
sess.close()
```

In the second example, we introduce an initialization condition using a boolean variable, `init_flag`. This approach is practical when you need to initialize the variable only once with a dynamic shape on the first use and retain those values for subsequent batches. The initialization logic is encapsulated in the `dynamic_initializer` function, which returns the operation to update the flag to `True`. The flag variable ensures that the expensive initialization with `tf.random.normal` only happens once per execution and future batches will use those initialized values. The `tf.cond` operation effectively routes the execution to perform either the initialization operation or return the current value of the initialization flag. A control dependency is used to guarantee that `init_op` finishes before `init_flag` is set, important for correctness. This has saved me computation time on large network initialization phases.

**Example 3: Custom Initializer Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the variable's shape, excluding the batch dimension (None).
variable_shape_static = (1, 512, 1)


def dynamic_random_initializer(shape, dtype=tf.float32, stddev=0.1, seed=None):
    """
    A custom initializer function for a TensorFlow variable with a dynamic first dimension.

    Args:
      shape:  The shape of the variable, which will have None as the first dimension
      dtype:  The data type for the variable
      stddev: Standard deviation for the random normal initialization
      seed:   Seed for random initialization
    """
    def initializer(tensor_shape, dtype=tf.float32):
        batch_size = tf.shape(tensor_shape)[0]
        return tf.random.normal(tf.concat([[batch_size], tf.constant(variable_shape_static, dtype=tf.int32)], axis=0), stddev=stddev, dtype=dtype, seed=seed)

    return initializer

# Create the variable with custom initializer
variable = tf.get_variable("dynamic_variable", shape=variable_shape_static, initializer=dynamic_random_initializer(variable_shape_static), dtype=tf.float32)


# Example of running the assignment
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

# Run the initialization for first batch with size of 10. This is done with the variable's usage during the forward pass
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 1, 512, 1))
initial_value_10 = sess.run(variable, feed_dict = {tf.get_default_graph().get_tensor_by_name(input_tensor.name):input_tensor})

# Run the initialization for second batch with size of 5. This is done with the variable's usage during the forward pass
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((5, 1, 512, 1))
initial_value_5 = sess.run(variable, feed_dict = {tf.get_default_graph().get_tensor_by_name(input_tensor.name):input_tensor})

# Print the shapes
print("Initial shape when batch size is 10:", initial_value_10.shape)
print("Initial shape when batch size is 5:", initial_value_5.shape)

sess.close()
```

The final example shows a custom initializer function, which encapsulates the logic needed to initialize based on the shape inferred during the usage. This approach avoids placeholders and explicitly running an assign operation. In the function, `tf.shape(tensor_shape)[0]` will dynamically determine the first dimensionâ€™s size. This custom initializer function is then passed into the `initializer` argument when declaring the variable, `tf.get_variable`, which enables delayed initialization. The values will then be initialized during the first time the variable is used during the forward pass, as shown in the example where random input tensors are fed. This is perhaps the most elegant solution and provides the most flexibility.

For further reading, the official TensorFlow documentation on variables is a must. Additionally, study the usage of `tf.get_variable`, `tf.assign`, `tf.placeholder`, `tf.random.normal`, and `tf.cond`. Tutorials regarding TensorFlow variable initialization strategies and how to manage custom initializers are also valuable resources. In conclusion, initializing a TensorFlow variable with a `[None, 1, 512, 1]` shape requires understanding the flexibility offered by placeholders or a custom initializer. Each method has its advantages; selecting the appropriate one depends on the application's specifics and preferred programming paradigm.
