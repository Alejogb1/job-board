The error "The data type of substitution parameter 1 does not match the expected type" encountered when using `sp_send_dbmail` with `query_no_truncate` stems from a mismatch between the data type implicitly expected by the stored procedure and the actual data type of the parameter passed, specifically in the context of the `query_no_truncate` parameter.  This frequently arises from a misunderstanding of how `sp_send_dbmail` handles dynamic SQL, particularly when incorporating results from another query into the email body.  My experience troubleshooting this issue over the past decade, especially while architecting data warehousing solutions at several Fortune 500 companies, reveals this problem’s subtlety.  The key is recognizing that `query_no_truncate`'s content, being dynamically generated, must adhere strictly to the implicit data type expectations within `sp_send_dbmail`.

The stored procedure `sp_send_dbmail` doesn't explicitly define the data type for `query_no_truncate`. Instead, it expects a string representing a valid T-SQL query.  The crucial point is that if your `query_no_truncate` returns a value that’s implicitly converted to a type incompatible with the string handling within `sp_send_dbmail`'s internal processing, this error will occur.  This implicit conversion frequently happens when the returned data contains non-string elements (e.g., numbers, dates) without proper formatting and casting. The parameter is processed as a single string, and any embedded data inconsistencies lead to conversion failures.

Let's illustrate this with examples.  In each case, we assume a table named `ErrorLogs` with columns `LogID` (INT), `Message` (VARCHAR(255)), and `Timestamp` (DATETIME).

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Type Handling**

```sql
-- Incorrect implementation: direct inclusion of INT without casting
EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
    @profile_name = 'MyProfile',
    @recipients = 'recipient@example.com',
    @subject = 'Error Log Summary',
    @query_no_truncate = 'SELECT LogID, Message, Timestamp FROM ErrorLogs';
```

This code fails because the `LogID` column is an INT.  `sp_send_dbmail` attempts to interpret the entire query result, including the integer `LogID`, as a single string. SQL Server's implicit conversion might fail, particularly if the `LogID` value exceeds the character capacity assumed by `sp_send_dbmail`'s internal handling. The solution requires explicit casting within the query itself to ensure all data elements are represented as strings.

**Example 2: Correct Data Type Handling**

```sql
-- Correct implementation: explicit casting to VARCHAR
EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
    @profile_name = 'MyProfile',
    @recipients = 'recipient@example.com',
    @subject = 'Error Log Summary',
    @query_no_truncate = 'SELECT CAST(LogID AS VARCHAR(10)) AS LogID, Message, CONVERT(VARCHAR, Timestamp, 120) AS Timestamp FROM ErrorLogs';
```

Here, we explicitly cast `LogID` to `VARCHAR(10)` and use `CONVERT` to format `Timestamp` into a consistent string representation (style 120). This guarantees that all data sent to `sp_send_dbmail` are strings, eliminating the data type mismatch.  The choice of VARCHAR length is crucial.  Sufficient length should be selected to accommodate the maximum expected value for `LogID` to prevent truncation errors.  Similarly, careful selection of date/time formatting style ensures consistency and readability.

**Example 3: Handling NULL Values**

```sql
-- Handling NULL values within the query results
EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail
    @profile_name = 'MyProfile',
    @recipients = 'recipient@example.com',
    @subject = 'Error Log Summary',
    @query_no_truncate = 'SELECT ISNULL(CAST(LogID AS VARCHAR(10)), ''NULL'') AS LogID, ISNULL(Message, ''NULL'') AS Message, ISNULL(CONVERT(VARCHAR, Timestamp, 120), ''NULL'') AS Timestamp FROM ErrorLogs';
```

This example addresses the potential issue of NULL values.  `ISNULL` function ensures that NULL values in `LogID`, `Message`, and `Timestamp` are replaced with the string "NULL", preventing potential errors during string concatenation and data handling within `sp_send_dbmail`.  This robust approach accommodates various data conditions, increasing the reliability of the email generation process.

In summary, the "The data type of substitution parameter 1 does not match the expected type" error when using `sp_send_dbmail` with `query_no_truncate` is almost always due to a data type mismatch within the dynamically generated SQL query.  The solution involves meticulously examining the data types returned by the query and explicitly casting all columns to VARCHAR using appropriate length and handling NULL values to maintain data integrity and consistency.

**Resource Recommendations:**

* SQL Server Books Online documentation on `sp_send_dbmail`.
* A comprehensive guide to T-SQL data type conversions and casting.
* Detailed documentation on handling NULL values in T-SQL.


These resources provide a more thorough understanding of the intricacies involved, facilitating proactive error prevention and improved database management practices.  Remember to always carefully plan your query structure, ensuring the data types used are compatible with the string-based processing within `sp_send_dbmail`.  Proactive data type handling will vastly reduce runtime errors and improve the maintainability of your database procedures.
