BERT, despite being a transformer-based model with a fixed input length, achieves variable-length output primarily through its contextualized representations and downstream task-specific layers. I've worked extensively with BERT in various NLP projects, specifically around text summarization and question answering, and I’ve observed firsthand how this mechanism functions. The model itself doesn't "generate" variable-length sequences in the same way a recurrent neural network does; rather, it produces fixed-size vector representations for each token in the input, which are then interpreted differently depending on the target task.

The core of BERT's architecture lies in the Transformer encoder, which processes input tokens simultaneously. This differs significantly from recurrent models that process sequences token-by-token. Input tokens are initially embedded into numerical vectors, and these embeddings are augmented with positional encodings to retain information about their location within the sequence. These embeddings are then fed through a series of Transformer layers, each comprised of multi-headed self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks. The crucial point here is that each Transformer layer transforms *every* token representation based on its relationship with *all other* tokens within the input sequence. This is the mechanism that creates the contextualized nature of the resulting vector embeddings. The output from the last encoder layer results in a sequence of these contextualized embeddings, each with a fixed length, equal to the hidden size of BERT (e.g., 768 for the base model).

These fixed-size vector embeddings themselves do not constitute variable-length output. Instead, they become inputs for various task-specific output layers. Consider a sequence-to-sequence task like text summarization. While BERT provides token-level contextualized embeddings, a separate decoder component, often a different model (e.g., a Transformer decoder or an RNN), is responsible for generating the actual summary. BERT acts as a robust encoder providing a rich representation of the input text, which the decoder then uses. The decoder generates variable-length output conditioned on the fixed-size representations obtained from BERT. The output is not inherent to BERT itself but rather an interpretation of its encoded representations by the downstream task.

For classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis, typically only the embedding corresponding to the first special token, `[CLS]`, is used. The `[CLS]` token is designed for this precise purpose; its contextualized representation from the BERT encoder captures information about the entire input sequence, allowing a simple classification layer (a linear layer and a softmax activation function) to output a probability distribution over the classes. This represents a fixed-size output, despite BERT's capable handling of varied input lengths.

Let's examine a few concrete examples with code, using Python and the `transformers` library, which facilitates easy interaction with pre-trained BERT models. I am assuming you have `transformers` installed (`pip install transformers`).

**Example 1: Obtaining Token Embeddings**

This code demonstrates how to load a BERT model and retrieve contextualized embeddings for an input sequence. It illustrates the fixed-size output of BERT itself before task-specific adaptation.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

text = "This is a sample sentence for BERT."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt') # pt for pytorch
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state
print(embeddings.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([1, 8, 768])
# 1 is the batch size, 8 is the sequence length (including special tokens), and 768 is the hidden size.

print(embeddings) # Output: Tensor representing the embeddings. The output is a sequence of vector embeddings.
```

Here, the `embeddings` tensor is a 3D tensor. The first dimension represents the batch size (in this case, 1). The second dimension is the sequence length of the input, which is eight due to tokenization and the addition of special tokens like `[CLS]` and `[SEP]`. Importantly, every token, regardless of its position or content, is represented by a vector of the same length (768) in the third dimension. This is key to BERT's fixed output size at the encoder level. These embeddings then can be used to generate the task specific output.

**Example 2: Using BERT for Classification**

This illustrates how BERT's `[CLS]` token representation can be utilized for a classification task, resulting in a fixed-size output of the predicted probabilities for each class. We'll use a simple linear layer for this demonstration, not fine-tuning, simply demonstrating the mapping of the cls token to a label.

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
class SimpleClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_labels):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_labels)

    def forward(self, embeddings):
        cls_token_embedding = embeddings[:, 0, :]
        logits = self.linear(cls_token_embedding)
        probabilities = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
        return probabilities
num_labels = 3 # e.g. 3 sentiment classes

classifier = SimpleClassifier(768, num_labels)
probabilities = classifier(embeddings)
print(probabilities.shape) # Output: torch.Size([1, 3])
print(probabilities) # Output: Tensor represents the probabilties for each class
```
The `SimpleClassifier` class takes the output of the BERT model and uses the `[CLS]` token for classification by passing through the linear layer, converting the hidden state representation of size `768` into probabilities of a class (in this example we use 3 classes). The output shows that it is an tensor of shape (1,3), with each class having a probability.

**Example 3: Using BERT for Extraction Tasks (Simplified)**
This example shows a very basic demonstration of using the token level embeddings to perform sequence level extraction. In this scenario, the task is to extract a "target" word from a sentence. This example shows the mapping of the token embeddings to scores, and the "argmax" operation which will give us an indication of the extracted word.

```python
class SimpleExtractor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1) # Map to single score per token

    def forward(self, embeddings):
      token_scores = self.linear(embeddings).squeeze(-1) # remove the last dimension for scores
      return token_scores

extractor = SimpleExtractor(768)
scores = extractor(embeddings)
print(scores.shape) # Output: torch.Size([1, 8])
print(scores) # Output: Tensor representing token scores.

extracted_index = torch.argmax(scores, dim=1)
print(f"Extracted token index: {extracted_index}") # Output: Tensor with index of highest score

```

Here, `SimpleExtractor` outputs a single score for each token. While it still maps fixed-size embeddings, the task-specific interpretation and the use of `argmax` to find the highest score results in a variable-length outcome – here it's a single token index, but it could be multiple tokens in more complex scenarios.

In summary, BERT itself produces fixed-length vector representations for every token in an input sequence, irrespective of the sequence's length. These contextualized embeddings are then interpreted by task-specific layers to accomplish various goals. These output layers, not BERT's encoder itself, are what generate the variable-length outputs.

For further exploration and deeper understanding, I suggest consulting the original BERT paper, “BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding” published by Google AI Language. Additionally, I would recommend reviewing literature focused on fine-tuning BERT for specific tasks such as text summarization, question answering and named entity recognition. These sources cover the details of how specific downstream tasks use BERT embeddings to generate task specific outputs. The Hugging Face Transformers documentation is an invaluable practical guide and offers comprehensive details on model usage and implementation. These resources will provide a more thorough understanding of BERT and how it is employed in various NLP tasks, specifically detailing how the fixed-size intermediate representations are used to derive variable-length outcomes.
