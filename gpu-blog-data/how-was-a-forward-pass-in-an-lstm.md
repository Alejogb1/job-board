The core mechanism of learning during a forward pass in an LSTM network, as implemented using Keras, relies not on directly altering the forward pass itself, but on its role in the broader backpropagation algorithm. During the forward pass, the network processes sequential input data, calculates outputs, and, crucially, saves intermediate values for use in subsequent backpropagation. Keras abstracts much of the implementation detail, but understanding the underlying mathematical operations is essential to grasp the learning process.

LSTM networks, unlike standard recurrent neural networks (RNNs), mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by introducing memory cells and gate mechanisms: forget, input, and output gates. During the forward pass, each gate uses the current input and the previous hidden state to calculate a value between zero and one, representing how much information should be allowed to pass. The cell state, which can be thought of as long-term memory, is modified based on these gates, and the current hidden state is computed from both the cell state and the output gate.

The forward pass involves the following core computations at each timestep `t`:

1. **Forget Gate (f<sub>t</sub>):** This gate determines what information to discard from the cell state.
   `f<sub>t</sub> = σ(W<sub>f</sub> * [h<sub>t-1</sub>, x<sub>t</sub>] + b<sub>f</sub>)`
   where:
     - `σ` is the sigmoid activation function, producing values between 0 and 1.
     - `W<sub>f</sub>` is the weight matrix for the forget gate.
     - `h<sub>t-1</sub>` is the hidden state from the previous time step.
     - `x<sub>t</sub>` is the current input.
     - `b<sub>f</sub>` is the bias for the forget gate.

2. **Input Gate (i<sub>t</sub>):** This gate determines which new information to store in the cell state.
   `i<sub>t</sub> = σ(W<sub>i</sub> * [h<sub>t-1</sub>, x<sub>t</sub>] + b<sub>i</sub>)`
   A 'candidate' cell state `c̃<sub>t</sub>` is also calculated.
   `c̃<sub>t</sub> = tanh(W<sub>c</sub> * [h<sub>t-1</sub>, x<sub>t</sub>] + b<sub>c</sub>)`
    where `W<sub>i</sub>`, `W<sub>c</sub>` are the respective weight matrices, `b<sub>i</sub>`, `b<sub>c</sub>` are their respective biases.

3. **Cell State Update (C<sub>t</sub>):** The cell state is updated by combining information from the forget gate, the input gate, and the candidate cell state.
   `C<sub>t</sub> = f<sub>t</sub> * C<sub>t-1</sub> + i<sub>t</sub> * c̃<sub>t</sub>`

4. **Output Gate (o<sub>t</sub>):** This gate controls what parts of the cell state will be output as the hidden state.
   `o<sub>t</sub> = σ(W<sub>o</sub> * [h<sub>t-1</sub>, x<sub>t</sub>] + b<sub>o</sub>)`
   where `W<sub>o</sub>` is the weight matrix and `b<sub>o</sub>` is the bias for the output gate.

5. **Hidden State (h<sub>t</sub>):** The hidden state is calculated based on the output gate and the cell state.
   `h<sub>t</sub> = o<sub>t</sub> * tanh(C<sub>t</sub>)`

These computations, while seemingly complex, are fully deterministic during the forward pass, given specific weights and biases. It is the backpropagation step, utilizing the chain rule of calculus, that calculates gradients (partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases), and subsequent application of gradient descent (or other optimization algorithms) which adjusts the weights and biases in the direction that minimizes the loss. Crucially, the gradients computed during backpropagation are derived from all the intermediate values saved during the forward pass – the gate values, cell states, hidden states, and inputs. These stored values are the backbone for training.

Here are code examples illustrating how Keras handles the forward pass in LSTMs:

**Example 1: Basic LSTM Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

# Example input sequence
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 10, 10) # (batch_size, sequence_length, input_dim)

# Create a simple LSTM model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.LSTM(units=32, input_shape=(10, 10), return_sequences=True),
    layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu')
])

# Execute forward pass
output = model(input_data)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)
print("Model summary:\n", model.summary())
```
*Commentary*: This demonstrates a simple LSTM layer in a sequential model. The `input_shape=(10,10)` parameter specifies that the expected input is a sequence of length 10, where each input has 10 dimensions.  `return_sequences=True` causes it to output the full sequence of hidden states. The output shape from the LSTM is `(batch_size, sequence_length, units)` or `(1,10,32)`, reflecting the 32 internal units and preserving the sequence length. The final Dense layer projects this down to a shape of `(1, 10, 10)`.  The model summary helps understand how many parameters the LSTM layer holds.  The forward pass computes the hidden state for each time step, stores those states, and passes them on. This particular example does not train the network but is a forward pass demonstrating the flow of data through the LSTM layer.

**Example 2: Accessing Hidden States**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

input_data = np.random.rand(1, 10, 10)

lstm_layer = layers.LSTM(units=32, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
output, last_h, last_c = lstm_layer(input_data)

print("Output shape:", output.shape)
print("Last hidden state shape:", last_h.shape)
print("Last cell state shape:", last_c.shape)

# Alternatively, access the hidden state using an functional API
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(10,10))
lstm_out, hidden_state, cell_state = layers.LSTM(32, return_sequences=False, return_state=True)(input_tensor)
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=[lstm_out, hidden_state, cell_state])
out, last_h, last_c = model(input_data)
print("\nOutput shape:", out.shape)
print("Last hidden state shape:", last_h.shape)
print("Last cell state shape:", last_c.shape)
```
*Commentary*: Setting `return_state=True` in the LSTM layer's initialization allows access to the final hidden state (`last_h`) and final cell state (`last_c`) after the forward pass, in addition to the sequence of hidden states contained in `output`. These final states represent the "memory" of the LSTM cell after processing the entire input sequence. Note the `return_sequences=True` in first part is used to get hidden states of all timesteps. The second part utilizes the functional API with `return_sequences=False` to just access the final hidden and cell state. This is used when we are concerned with just the output of the sequence. Crucially, Keras implicitly manages the calculations for the gates, cell updates, and hidden states within this single forward call to the LSTM layer. You have access to the hidden states and cell states as outputs, but the core computations are internal to the layer.

**Example 3: Training a Basic LSTM**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data: a sequence to sequence task
input_sequence_length = 10
output_sequence_length = 5
input_dim = 10
output_dim = 5
num_samples = 100

X_train = np.random.rand(num_samples, input_sequence_length, input_dim)
Y_train = np.random.rand(num_samples, output_sequence_length, output_dim)

model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(input_sequence_length, input_dim), return_sequences=True),
    layers.TimeDistributed(layers.Dense(units=output_dim, activation='relu'))
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

model.fit(X_train, Y_train, epochs=10) # Perform the learning using backpropagation

output = model(X_train[:1])
print("Output shape during training:", output.shape)
```
*Commentary*: This example shows a model that can be trained.  We use a generated input data `X_train` as a sequence to sequence task, and `Y_train` as the target. Note that the model learns through gradient updates of the LSTM layers weights, done implicitly within `model.fit()`. The `TimeDistributed(Dense(...))` layer is used since our targets are a sequence and the LSTM layer is also outputting a sequence. `TimeDistributed` allows a dense layer to be applied to each time-step in the output sequence. This demonstrates the flow of data through the forward pass during training. The loss is calculated and gradients are computed, using the saved values of the forward pass, in the backpropagation phase, which are used to alter the weights in the LSTM and subsequent dense layer. The weights, therefore, are updated via the loss function and gradient descent optimization through the backpropagation phase which relies heavily on the results from the forward pass.

**Recommended Resources for Further Understanding:**

To deepen your understanding, I recommend exploring the following areas:
1. **Textbooks:**  Consult resources that detail Recurrent Neural Networks and Deep Learning.  Pay particular attention to sections describing backpropagation through time (BPTT), a specific variant of backpropagation for sequential data.
2. **Online Courses:** Search for courses which provide both theoretical foundations and practical implementations of RNNs and LSTMs. Many offer visual and interactive tools that can clarify the flow of information.
3. **Research Papers:**  Refer to foundational papers on LSTMs and BPTT. These papers often provide a detailed mathematical explanation of the algorithm, which helps further understand the nuances.  Focus on those papers that discuss practical aspects of implementation, such as handling longer sequences.
4. **Keras Documentation:** Thoroughly review the Keras API documentation for LSTM and recurrent layers. Understand every parameter they offer, since they can have significant effects on training outcomes. Study the functional API in particular for more granular control of the model.
5. **TensorFlow Documentation:** Explore the TensorFlow documentation to understand the underlying tensor operations and data flow graphs that form the basis for the Keras implementation. This will deepen understanding of how the code you write is ultimately executed by the framework.
By utilizing these sources, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of how a forward pass in an LSTM is learned in Keras through the subsequent backpropagation, and by extension all the mechanisms involved in the deep learning process.
