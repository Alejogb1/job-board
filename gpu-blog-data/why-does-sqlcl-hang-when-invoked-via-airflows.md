SQL*Plus, commonly executed through the `sqlcl` command-line interface, exhibits a peculiar behavior when launched via Apache Airflow's `subprocess.Popen` method: it can seemingly hang indefinitely, failing to return control to the calling Airflow task. This issue stems from a confluence of factors related to `sqlcl`'s interaction with terminal control, its buffering mechanisms, and how `popen` manages inter-process communication. Over several deployments, I've encountered this specifically within Airflow DAGs and have implemented strategies to address it.

Fundamentally, `sqlcl` expects a fully interactive terminal environment. When a command is issued directly in a shell, several things happen automatically: standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr) streams are all connected to the terminal. Crucially, the terminal provides the appropriate signals and control mechanisms that `sqlcl` relies on. However, `popen`, by default, does not fully emulate a terminal for the spawned process, which is `sqlcl` in our case. When `popen` captures stdout and stderr for logging purposes within Airflow, this default behavior causes `sqlcl` to enter a state where it awaits further interaction from what it perceives as the terminal – an interaction that never arrives. This leads to the perceived hang.

Specifically, `sqlcl` utilizes ANSI escape sequences to manage the command prompt, display messages, and handle user input. These escape sequences are not simply strings; they're instructions intended for a terminal emulator. Without a terminal, `sqlcl` will often get into a state where its output is buffered rather than immediately flushed and the commands, particularly those involving interactive prompts or lengthy output, are not processed correctly. The process then hangs indefinitely, awaiting the anticipated but non-existent terminal interaction. Moreover, certain signals sent during process termination in Airflow (like SIGTERM) may not be gracefully handled by `sqlcl` in a non-terminal environment, further contributing to the problem. We are then faced with a non-responsive subprocess that Airflow treats as still running.

Now, consider a basic scenario of running `sqlcl` through `popen`:

```python
import subprocess

def execute_sqlcl_bad(sql_command, oracle_user, oracle_password, oracle_connect_string):
    command = [
        'sqlcl',
        f'{oracle_user}/{oracle_password}@{oracle_connect_string}',
        '-s',
        f'set pagesize 0 feedback off; {sql_command}; exit;'
    ]

    process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    stdout, stderr = process.communicate()

    print(f"STDOUT: {stdout.decode()}")
    print(f"STDERR: {stderr.decode()}")

    return process.returncode
```

In this first example, which mirrors how many users would attempt to invoke `sqlcl` via Airflow, we use `subprocess.Popen` directly with `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` and `stderr=subprocess.PIPE`. The `-s` option attempts to suppress interactive prompts, but this is not sufficient when the process is not connected to a real terminal. While the SQL command might execute, the `process.communicate()` call will likely hang as `sqlcl` does not gracefully exit in this configuration, waiting for a phantom terminal interaction. The output buffers never flush.

The core solution involves forcing `popen` to simulate a terminal for `sqlcl`. This is typically achieved using the `pty` (pseudo-terminal) library. Here’s how this change appears in an updated code example:

```python
import subprocess
import pty
import os

def execute_sqlcl_good_pty(sql_command, oracle_user, oracle_password, oracle_connect_string):
     command = [
        'sqlcl',
        f'{oracle_user}/{oracle_password}@{oracle_connect_string}',
        '-s',
         f'set pagesize 0 feedback off; {sql_command}; exit;'
    ]

     pid, fd = pty.fork()

     if pid == 0:
       # child process
       os.execvp(command[0], command) # Execute sqlcl
     else:
       # parent process
       stdout = b""
       while True:
          try:
              output = os.read(fd, 1024)
              if not output:
                  break
              stdout += output
          except OSError:
            break
       os.close(fd)
       status = os.waitpid(pid, 0)[1]
       print(f"STDOUT: {stdout.decode()}")
       print(f"STATUS: {status}")

       return status
```

Here, we use `pty.fork()` to create a pseudo-terminal pair (a master and a slave). The child process, which executes `sqlcl` via `os.execvp()`, thinks it’s connected to a terminal. The parent process, however, can then read from the master end of the pty, effectively capturing what would have been sent to the terminal, without the hang. This approach properly simulates the expected terminal interaction for `sqlcl`. The loop reads all available output, handles the potential OSError (resulting from process termination), waits for child to finish using os.waitpid, and prints the output and status. It's crucial to handle the case where the pty has no more output to read from (indicated by empty string returned from `os.read`).

While the pty approach provides a more robust solution, it may introduce complexities with resource management (specifically dealing with the file descriptors), and is dependent on system level libraries like pty. A slightly different approach involves using the `subprocess.run` command with `check=True`. This method, while seemingly simple, can be effective if you can explicitly control the output buffer flushing by setting an environment variable, which in this instance is `SQLCL_DISABLE_BUFFERED_OUTPUT`. This eliminates the buffering problem.

```python
import subprocess
import os

def execute_sqlcl_good_run(sql_command, oracle_user, oracle_password, oracle_connect_string):
    command = [
        'sqlcl',
        f'{oracle_user}/{oracle_password}@{oracle_connect_string}',
        '-s',
        f'set pagesize 0 feedback off; {sql_command}; exit;'
    ]
    env = os.environ.copy()
    env['SQLCL_DISABLE_BUFFERED_OUTPUT'] = 'true'
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, check=True, env=env, text=True)

        print(f"STDOUT: {result.stdout}")
        print(f"STDERR: {result.stderr}")

        return result.returncode

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"STDERR: {e.stderr}")
        print(f"Return Code: {e.returncode}")
        return e.returncode
```

Here, using `subprocess.run` with the `check=True` argument ensures that an exception is raised if the process exits with a non-zero return code. The `capture_output=True` captures the stdout and stderr, and the `text=True` argument is used to force decoding the output to string. By setting `SQLCL_DISABLE_BUFFERED_OUTPUT = 'true'` through the `env` parameter, the buffering issue is addressed. This method works without complex pty handling making it much more accessible.

In choosing a method, `subprocess.run` offers a straightforward approach particularly when you have control over environment variables and do not need fine grained control over the execution. It simplifies error handling and is often sufficient for basic SQL execution. However, if you require direct control over the output stream or find this method is still susceptible to hangs, the `pty` solution is more robust. It’s also important to note that various versions of `sqlcl` behave slightly differently. I have personally found that newer versions are more robust, and the `SQLCL_DISABLE_BUFFERED_OUTPUT` environment variable is effective. When dealing with older installations, the `pty` method becomes more crucial.

Regarding additional resources, it would be advantageous to explore the official Python documentation for `subprocess`, particularly regarding the differences between `Popen` and `run`. Additionally, consult the documentation for `pty`, if this approach is chosen for implementation, to better understand the intricacies of pseudo-terminals. Lastly, review Oracle's official documentation for `sqlcl` to fully grasp the intended usage, as the version can affect the interaction with terminal emulators and buffering. These documents should offer in-depth explanations and best practices, supplementing the provided examples. While no single document directly explains why `sqlcl` hangs in Airflow with `popen`, understanding these core components of both technologies allows for more effective resolution of this persistent issue.
