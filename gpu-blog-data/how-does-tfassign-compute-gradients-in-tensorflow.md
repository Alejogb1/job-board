TensorFlow's `tf.assign` operation, while seemingly straightforward, presents a nuanced interaction with gradient computation depending on the context of its usage within the computational graph.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks for real-time applications has highlighted the crucial distinction between how `tf.assign` impacts gradients when used within a `tf.GradientTape` context versus its behavior outside of automatic differentiation.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

`tf.assign` is fundamentally a state-updating operation.  It modifies the value of a tensor in place.  Crucially, its effect on gradient calculation hinges on whether this modification occurs within a `tf.GradientTape` recording scope.  Outside of a `tf.GradientTape`, `tf.assign` acts purely as a side effect; it alters the tensor's value, but it does not contribute to the gradient computation.  The gradient with respect to the assigned value will be undefined.  This is because the operation is not part of the differentiable computation graph traced by the `tf.GradientTape`.

Within a `tf.GradientTape` context, the situation shifts. The `tf.assign` operation becomes part of the computation graph, and TensorFlow *can* compute gradients *if* the assigned tensor is itself a differentiable variable.  However, the gradient computation isn't straightforward.  The gradient is computed with respect to the *value* assigned, not the assignment operation itself.  This subtle distinction frequently leads to confusion.  You aren't calculating the gradient of the `tf.assign` function; you are calculating the gradient of the computation that *produced* the value being assigned.

If the assigned value originates from a differentiable computation (e.g., the result of a neural network layer), the gradient will flow backward through that computation to update the trainable variables in the network.  If the assigned value comes from a non-differentiable source (e.g., a constant or a manually set value), the gradient with respect to that assignment will still be zero. This behavior mirrors the broader rule in automatic differentiation: gradients only propagate through differentiable operations.

Consider scenarios where you might use `tf.assign`: initializing variables, updating running averages in batch normalization, or implementing custom optimization algorithms. In the latter two instances, understanding gradient propagation through `tf.assign` becomes particularly important.  Misunderstanding can lead to incorrect weight updates and training instability.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: No Gradient Propagation (Outside `tf.GradientTape`)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)
y = tf.constant(2.0)

tf.assign(x, y)  # Assigns y to x

print(x)  # Output: <tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    z = x * x
    
dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(dz_dx) #Output: None. Gradient is not defined because x is not part of the tape.
```
In this example,  `tf.assign` modifies `x`, but this modification occurs outside the `tf.GradientTape` context. Therefore,  `dz_dx` is `None`; TensorFlow cannot compute the gradient because it didn't track the assignment operation.



**Example 2: Gradient Propagation (Inside `tf.GradientTape`)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = x * x
    tf.assign(x, y) #Assigns y to x, part of the computation graph
    z = x * x

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(dz_dx) #Output: tf.Tensor(8.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
```

Here, `tf.assign` is within the `tf.GradientTape`'s scope. The gradient is successfully computed and propagates back to `x`.  The gradient `dz_dx` reflects the change in `z` with respect to the final value of `x` (which was updated by `tf.assign`).  Note the gradient is not calculated for the assignment itself, but for the computation that created the assigned value (`y = x * x`).


**Example 3: Conditional Assignment and Gradient Flow**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

x = tf.Variable(1.0)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y = x * 2
    if y > 2:
        tf.assign(x, y)
    z = x * x

dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
print(dz_dx) #Output: tf.Tensor(8.0, shape=(), dtype=float32) or None

```
This example demonstrates that the conditional nature of the assignment doesn't fundamentally alter the gradient computation mechanism.  If the condition `y > 2` evaluates to `True`, `x` is updated within the gradient tape context, leading to gradient flow and a non-`None` gradient. If false, x will remain 1, and dz_dx will be 2.0.  Crucially, the conditional statement itself does not impede gradient computation; it only influences whether the assignment (and thus the consequent change in `x`) impacts the gradient.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation thoroughly.  Pay particular attention to sections detailing automatic differentiation, `tf.GradientTape`, and the intricacies of variable assignment within the TensorFlow computational graph.  Reviewing examples showcasing custom training loops and optimization routines will further clarify this behavior.  Finally, examining the source code of established TensorFlow models and libraries can provide valuable insights into practical applications of `tf.assign` and its interaction with gradients.  Understanding the nuances of the TensorFlow API requires both theoretical understanding and practical application. Carefully studying and implementing code examples remains the best strategy for mastering the subject matter.
