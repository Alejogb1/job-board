The inherent parallelism of CUDA makes it particularly well-suited for tasks involving string manipulation, provided the problem can be effectively decomposed into independent, concurrently executable units.  My experience working on large-scale genomic sequence alignment projects revealed that directly applying CUDA to substring searching, while seemingly straightforward, often encounters performance bottlenecks unless careful consideration is given to memory access patterns and thread management.  The naive approach, simply assigning each thread to a substring comparison, frequently leads to significant underutilization of the GPU due to irregular workload distribution and excessive memory traffic.  Optimal solutions necessitate a more structured approach, typically involving a combination of efficient hashing techniques and parallel prefix sums.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Finding equal substrings within a large text corpus using CUDA involves several stages.  First, we must pre-process the input string to generate a set of candidate substrings.  This could involve partitioning the string into overlapping windows or using a sliding window technique.  The size of these windows directly impacts the search granularity and the computational load. Smaller windows lead to more comparisons but potentially faster identification of equal substrings.

Next, these candidate substrings need to be hashed.  A robust hash function, like MurmurHash3, is crucial for minimizing collisions and ensuring relatively uniform distribution of substrings across GPU threads.  The choice of hash function profoundly influences the algorithm's performance, as a poorly designed hash function can result in significant clustering of substrings, leading to load imbalance and reduced parallel efficiency.  After hashing, the substrings are sorted based on their hash values.  This sorting step is parallelizable and can be efficiently implemented using CUDA's parallel sorting algorithms, such as radix sort or merge sort.

Finally, the sorted substrings are compared. This comparison can be streamlined significantly because equal substrings will now be adjacent (or clustered closely) in the sorted list.  This reduces the search space significantly, thereby avoiding unnecessary comparisons.  This stage involves iterating through the sorted list, comparing adjacent substrings with a focus on optimized memory access.  The final output consists of the identified equal substrings and their respective indices within the original text.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate different aspects of this process. They are simplified representations and would require further optimization and error handling in a production environment. These examples leverage CUDA's thrust library for easier parallel operations.

**Example 1: Substring Generation and Hashing:**

```cpp
#include <thrust/host_vector.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <thrust/transform.h>
#include <string>
#include <murmurhash3.h> //Requires MurmurHash3 library

//Structure to hold substring and its hash
struct SubstringHash {
  std::string substring;
  unsigned long long hash;
};

//Function to generate substrings and calculate their hashes
struct SubstringHashGenerator {
  __host__ __device__ SubstringHash operator()(const std::string& text, int start, int len) const {
    SubstringHash sh;
    sh.substring = text.substr(start, len);
    uint64_t hash[2];
    MurmurHash3_x64_128(sh.substring.c_str(), sh.substring.length(), 0, hash); //Hash calculation
    sh.hash = hash[0];  //Use only the first 64 bits
    return sh;
  }
};


int main() {
  std::string text = "This is a test string with some repeated substrings.";
  int substringLength = 5;

  //Generate substrings in parallel
  thrust::host_vector<SubstringHash> h_substringHashes;
  for (int i = 0; i <= text.length() - substringLength; ++i) {
    h_substringHashes.push_back(SubstringHashGenerator()(text, i, substringLength));
  }

  //Copy to GPU
  thrust::device_vector<SubstringHash> d_substringHashes = h_substringHashes;

  //Further processing on GPU (sorting etc.) would follow here.

  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the generation of substrings of a specified length and their hashing using MurmurHash3.  The use of `thrust::transform` facilitates parallel computation of hashes across multiple GPU threads.

**Example 2: Parallel Sorting using Thrust:**

```cpp
#include <thrust/sort.h>
// ... (Includes and SubstringHash struct from Example 1) ...

int main(){
    // ... (SubstringHash generation from Example 1) ...

    //Sort based on the hash values
    thrust::sort_by_key(d_substringHashes.begin(), d_substringHashes.end(), thrust::make_transform_iterator(d_substringHashes.begin(),thrust::identity<SubstringHash>()));
    //Copy back to host if needed for further processing
    h_substringHashes = d_substringHashes;
    return 0;
}
```

This snippet utilizes `thrust::sort_by_key` for parallel sorting of the `d_substringHashes` vector based on the `hash` member of the `SubstringHash` structure.  Thrust handles the complexities of parallel sorting efficiently.


**Example 3:  Comparison of Adjacent Substrings:**

```cpp
#include <thrust/for_each.h>
// ... (Includes and SubstringHash struct from Example 1) ...

struct CompareAdjacentSubstrings {
  __host__ __device__ void operator()(const SubstringHash& sh1, const SubstringHash& sh2, std::vector<std::pair<std::string, int>>& equalSubstrings) const{
    if(sh1.substring == sh2.substring){
      equalSubstrings.push_back(std::make_pair(sh1.substring, 0)); //Index placeholder, needs refinement
    }
  }
};

int main(){
    // ... (Substring generation, hashing, and sorting from Examples 1 & 2) ...

    std::vector<std::pair<std::string, int>> equalSubstrings;
    thrust::host_vector<SubstringHash> h_substringHashesSorted = d_substringHashes; // Copy back to host

    for(size_t i = 0; i < h_substringHashesSorted.size() - 1; ++i){
        CompareAdjacentSubstrings()(h_substringHashesSorted[i], h_substringHashesSorted[i+1], equalSubstrings);
    }

    //Print or process equalSubstrings
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a sequential comparison of adjacent substrings after sorting.  While this comparison is currently sequential, more sophisticated parallel approaches could be implemented for even larger datasets, possibly involving parallel reduction techniques to aggregate results.
