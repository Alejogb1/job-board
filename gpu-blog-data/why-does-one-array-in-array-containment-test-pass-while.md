The discrepancy in array containment testing often stems from a subtle but crucial difference in how NumPy handles array broadcasting and comparison operations, specifically when dealing with arrays of differing shapes and data types. My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale scientific simulations highlights this point: seemingly identical containment checks can produce vastly different results depending on whether implicit broadcasting is involved or not. This behavior is rooted in NumPy's optimized array operations and the strictness of its comparison logic.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

NumPy's `in` operator, when used with arrays, does not perform a direct element-by-element comparison for multi-dimensional arrays in the same manner as Python's built-in `in` operator for lists. Instead, it relies heavily on broadcasting rules.  Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations between arrays of different shapes, by implicitly expanding the smaller array to match the dimensions of the larger array.  However, this expansion isn't always intuitive, particularly concerning boolean comparisons resulting from containment checks.

A `ValueError` typically arises when NumPy's broadcasting mechanism encounters an incompatibility between the shapes of the arrays involved in the comparison. This often happens when trying to compare a multi-dimensional array to a smaller array where broadcasting would lead to ambiguous or logically incorrect results. In such cases, NumPy explicitly raises a `ValueError` to prevent potential misinterpretations of the results. In contrast, a successful containment test without a `ValueError` usually indicates that the shapes of the arrays are compatible for broadcasting or that a simple element-wise comparison is possible due to the arrays having compatible shapes.  The key to understanding the difference is in recognizing whether broadcasting is implicitly applied and whether the resultant shapes align logically for the comparison.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Successful Containment Test**

```python
import numpy as np

array_a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
array_b = np.array([1, 2])

result = np.array_equal(array_b, array_a[0]) #Explicit element-wise comparison, no broadcasting needed.

if result:
    print("Array 'b' is contained in array 'a'")
else:
    print("Array 'b' is not contained in array 'a'")


#Output: Array 'b' is contained in array 'a'
```

This example works correctly because we are comparing `array_b` to a specific row of `array_a`.  `np.array_equal` performs an element-wise comparison between two arrays of the *same shape*, ensuring that each element in `array_b` matches the corresponding element in `array_a[0]`. No broadcasting is involved; the shapes are identical.


**Example 2: ValueError Due to Shape Mismatch**

```python
import numpy as np

array_c = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
array_d = np.array([5, 6, 7])

try:
    result = np.array_equal(array_d, array_c[0:2,:])  #Attempt to compare with broadcasting across rows, but incompatible dimensions
    print("Array 'd' is contained in array 'c'")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"ValueError encountered: {e}")

#Output: ValueError encountered: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (3,) (2,2)
```

This example fails because `array_d` (shape (3,)) cannot be directly compared to `array_c[0:2, :]` (shape (2,2)) using `np.array_equal`. While broadcasting *could* be used to try and compare `array_d` with each row of `array_c[0:2, :]` separately,  the resulting broadcasted shapes remain incompatible. This incompatibility triggers the `ValueError`, indicating that broadcasting alone cannot resolve the shape difference to allow a meaningful comparison.


**Example 3:  Successful Containment with Broadcasting (Careful Application)**

```python
import numpy as np

array_e = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 2], [3, 4]])
array_f = np.array([1, 2])

result = np.any(np.all(array_e == array_f, axis=1)) #Checking if any row is equal to array_f using broadcasting.

if result:
    print("Array 'f' is contained in array 'e'")
else:
    print("Array 'f' is not contained in array 'e'")

#Output: Array 'f' is contained in array 'e'
```

Here, we leverage broadcasting effectively.  `array_e == array_f` performs an element-wise comparison, implicitly broadcasting `array_f` across the rows of `array_e`. `np.all(..., axis=1)` checks if all elements are equal along each row; `np.any` then checks if this condition is true for any of the rows.  This approach is valid because broadcasting creates a meaningful comparison: a boolean array indicating whether each row in `array_e` matches `array_f`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

NumPy documentation, specifically the sections on array broadcasting and comparison operators.  A comprehensive linear algebra textbook covering vector and matrix operations.  The official Python documentation on the `in` operator and its behavior with various data types.   A well-structured tutorial on NumPy array manipulation techniques.


In conclusion, the success or failure of an array-in-array containment test in NumPy hinges on the compatibility of array shapes within the context of broadcasting rules.  Understanding broadcasting is key to predicting and avoiding `ValueError` exceptions.  The examples illustrate how careful consideration of array shapes and the appropriate use of NumPy functions such as `np.array_equal`, `np.all`, and `np.any` are crucial for reliable and efficient array containment checks within NumPy.  Always prioritize explicit shape management when dealing with multi-dimensional array comparisons. Ignoring shape discrepancies can lead to unpredictable and error-prone code.
