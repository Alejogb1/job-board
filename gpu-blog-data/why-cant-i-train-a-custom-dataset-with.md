TensorFlow 1.15 exhibits notable challenges when attempting to retrain SSDMobileNetV1, primarily due to its inherent architecture incompatibility with the modern object detection workflow envisioned by later TensorFlow versions. This difficulty arises from several intertwined factors, specifically how feature extraction, anchor box generation, and loss calculation are implemented within the framework and its pre-trained models available in 1.15. I recall countless hours wrestling with this exact issue while developing a prototype drone-based inspection system several years ago, a project ultimately migrated to a more current framework for successful deployment.

The core issue resides in the rigid design of the object detection pipeline prevalent in TensorFlow 1.x's object detection API. It operates on the assumption that a pre-trained model’s architecture is fixed. Directly adapting SSDMobileNetV1, which was predominantly trained on a limited set of object classes, to recognize new classes necessitates significant modifications that frequently result in compatibility failures. The checkpoint files provided for SSDMobileNetV1 are specific to the model's initial training configuration, containing weights and biases that are ill-suited to retraining on a custom dataset without deep adjustments to the overall computational graph.

Specifically, the output tensors of the SSDMobileNetV1 model, especially those associated with the detection heads, are designed to align with the pre-defined set of classes in the original training data. This includes the number of bounding box anchors, feature map sizes, and the final classification layers. When you introduce a new dataset with a different number of object categories, these tensors become mismatched, leading to various errors during training. Unlike modern TensorFlow implementations, which abstract some of these configurations, in TensorFlow 1.15 you are essentially required to manually dissect and reconstruct parts of the graph to properly align with your custom dataset. This often requires advanced knowledge of the underlying TensorFlow operations and the specifics of the SSD architecture.

Let me illustrate this through a practical example. Imagine a scenario where you're attempting to train SSDMobileNetV1 to recognize three distinct types of manufactured components. The original model, as provided by TensorFlow 1.15's object detection API, was trained on COCO, a dataset with 91 classes. The mismatch begins immediately at the output classification layer, where the model expects 91 output nodes but is confronted with a training process geared toward only 3 new classes.

The following is a conceptually illustrative (but non-executable directly on TensorFlow 1.15 without substantial modification) code representation of an attempt to adapt the model:

```python
# Conceptual representation, not directly runnable in TF 1.15 object detection API
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume a placeholder for feature maps from SSDMobileNetV1 backbone
feature_maps = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, None, None, 256])  # Example feature map

num_classes = 3  # Custom number of classes
num_anchors = 6  # Assuming a constant number of anchors per location

# Incorrectly trying to directly reshape output for 3 classes (TF 1.x approach)
# This leads to shape mismatches with the original model's output tensors
with tf.variable_scope("classification_head"):
    classification_output = tf.layers.conv2d(feature_maps, filters=num_classes*num_anchors,
                                             kernel_size=3, padding="same")
    classification_output = tf.reshape(classification_output, [-1, num_anchors, num_classes])

# Similarly incorrect bounding box regression example
with tf.variable_scope("regression_head"):
    regression_output = tf.layers.conv2d(feature_maps, filters=4*num_anchors,
                                             kernel_size=3, padding="same")
    regression_output = tf.reshape(regression_output, [-1, num_anchors, 4]) # 4 for box coordinates

# Loss calculation would further highlight the problems - not shown for brevity

# Errors would occur during training due to shape mismatches and incompatible checkpoint
# This example doesn't even handle loading of a pre-trained model, further complicating matters
```

This code segment, though simplified, demonstrates that directly modifying the convolutional layers at the head of the SSD network, as you might in a modern TF2 or PyTorch context, does not seamlessly work in TensorFlow 1.15. The layers are tightly coupled to the original training scenario. The incorrect reshaping operations will lead to errors related to mismatched shapes during training and, more critically, cannot load the pre-trained weights effectively from a checkpoint trained on the COCO dataset, as the new shapes would not match.

Furthermore, the TensorFlow 1.15 Object Detection API operates with a configuration file (usually a `.config` file) which defines model parameters. These configuration files are tightly integrated with the original models, making it difficult to introduce modifications required for a custom dataset. The pre-defined protobuf messages used by this API enforce specific shapes and sizes associated with the original model, further limiting flexibility.

Consider another example: you might attempt to fine-tune only certain layers by specifying which variables are trainable. This approach often fails due to inconsistencies between the stored variable names in the checkpoint and the new names resulting from even slight modifications to the model graph.

Here's a code illustration highlighting the challenges of variable scope manipulation within TF 1.15:

```python
# Conceptual illustration - incorrect variable scope manipulation

import tensorflow as tf

# Dummy variables representing layers from SSDMobileNetV1
backbone_variables = [tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([10, 10, 10, 10]), name='backbone_var1'),
                      tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([5,5,5,5]), name='backbone_var2')]
head_variables = [tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([3,3,3,3]), name='head_var1'),
                 tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([4,4,4,4]), name='head_var2')]

# A hypothetical attempt to freeze backbone layers and only fine-tune head
# This is a simplified representation of the complex scope/variable logic in TF 1.15 API

all_variables = backbone_variables + head_variables

#  Problematic: Direct name checking often fails, making specific layer freeze impossible
trainable_vars = [v for v in all_variables if not v.name.startswith('backbone')]

optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=0.001)
train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss, var_list = trainable_vars)

# In practice, matching variable names correctly is error-prone with complex graphs and checkpoints
```

The issue lies in how TensorFlow 1.15 assigns names and manages variable scopes. Direct string manipulation as shown in the example above to target specific layers for training becomes convoluted and unreliable, especially with complex pre-trained models like SSDMobileNetV1. The checkpoint file stores these variables using the original graph structure. Attempts to adapt it often fail to locate the correct variables for transfer learning.

Finally, the fixed anchor box generation logic in TF 1.15’s object detection framework poses another hurdle. The anchors' dimensions and aspect ratios are baked into the model configuration. Custom datasets, especially those with objects of drastically different sizes or proportions from COCO, will not be optimally detected. Attempts to manually alter the anchor generation pipeline in TF 1.15 usually demand extensive surgery within the C++ components of the API which is beyond the reach of most users.

Here's a simplified illustrative example of a fixed anchor generation logic (not directly from API):

```python
import numpy as np
# Simplified conceptual illustration of a static anchor system
feature_map_shape = [10,10] # Example
aspect_ratios = [0.5, 1, 2]
scales = [0.5, 1, 2]

anchors = []
for y in range(feature_map_shape[0]):
    for x in range(feature_map_shape[1]):
       for ar in aspect_ratios:
           for sc in scales:
               # Assume a basic anchor calculation using fixed values
               width = sc * ar
               height = sc
               center_x = x + 0.5
               center_y = y + 0.5
               anchors.append([center_x, center_y, width, height])

anchors_np = np.array(anchors)
# This shows the fix anchor boxes and how changing the data will cause problem during training

```
This last example depicts that the generated anchor boxes are fixed by design, not directly controlled for a new dataset or use-case.

In summary, the difficulties in training SSDMobileNetV1 with custom data in TensorFlow 1.15 are rooted in the inflexibility of its object detection API, the tight coupling of model architecture to the original training setup, complicated variable naming convention, and the static anchor box generation. For any reasonably complex custom dataset, migrating to a more flexible framework such as TensorFlow 2 or a contemporary PyTorch-based solution is highly advisable. Such frameworks provide more adaptable architectures, easier retraining workflows, and significantly improved tools for managing variable scopes and dataset-specific configurations. Consulting the TensorFlow documentation for object detection model training in versions later than 2.0 and numerous online tutorials focusing on these tools would be a good starting point for tackling the challenge.
