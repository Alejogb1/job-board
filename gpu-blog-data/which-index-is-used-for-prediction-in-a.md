The selection of an index for prediction in a multivariate LSTM Keras model isn't a simple matter of choosing a single index; rather, it depends fundamentally on how your data is structured and what you intend to predict.  In my experience developing time-series forecasting models for financial applications – specifically, predicting asset price movements based on multiple macroeconomic indicators –  I've found that a clear understanding of your target variable's placement within the input data is paramount.  The "index" isn't a pre-defined element but a consequence of your data preprocessing and model architecture.


**1. Data Structure and Target Variable Definition:**

The critical first step is defining your target variable and its position within your input sequences.  Assume you possess a dataset with `n` time steps, `m` features (multivariate), and one target variable. This target variable will be what your model is trained to predict.  Your data might be structured as a NumPy array of shape `(samples, timesteps, features)` where the features include your predictors and the target variable.  The key is *not* to treat the target variable as just another feature during model training, but to separate it for supervised learning.  You should organize your data such that the last timestep's value of the target variable is predicted using the preceding timesteps’ feature values.

Consider the following: if your target variable is the closing price of a stock, and you're using indicators like volume, moving averages, and interest rates as features, the prediction index is inherently tied to the temporal dimension.  You're not predicting an index within the feature space; you're predicting the value of a specific feature (the closing price) at a future time step, given the current and past values of all features. Therefore, there isn't a "prediction index" in the traditional sense. Instead, it's about choosing the correct output shape based on your intended prediction horizon.



**2. Model Architecture and Output Shaping:**

The multivariate LSTM model architecture directly impacts how the prediction is structured. The output layer's size and activation function determine the type of prediction.  For example, if you wish to predict a single future value (a single-step prediction), the output layer will have one neuron.  However, for multi-step prediction, you might design the output layer to have `k` neurons, where `k` is your prediction horizon (number of future time steps to predict).  This output is then the sequence of predicted values for the target variable.

It's crucial to remember that the model doesn't intrinsically "know" which index is for prediction. You explicitly define this through the target variable in your training data and the architecture of your output layer.

**3. Code Examples:**

Let’s illustrate with three examples, demonstrating different prediction scenarios.

**Example 1: Single-step prediction**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
data = np.random.rand(100, 20, 5) # 100 samples, 20 timesteps, 5 features (4 predictors, 1 target)
X = data[:, :-1, :-1] # Input features
y = data[:, -1, -1] # Target variable (last timestep, last feature)

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(X.shape[1], X.shape[2])))
model.add(Dense(1)) # Output layer for single-step prediction
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)

# Prediction (last timestep of features from a new sample)
new_sample = np.random.rand(1, 19, 4)
prediction = model.predict(new_sample)
print(prediction)
```
Here, the prediction is a scalar value representing the prediction for the target variable at the next time step. The "index" is implicitly the last timestep of the input sequence.


**Example 2: Multi-step prediction**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data (adjusted for multi-step prediction)
data = np.random.rand(100, 20, 5)
X = []
y = []
for i in range(len(data) - 5): # Predicting 5 future steps
    X.append(data[i:i+20, :-1, :-1])
    y.append(data[i+20:i+25, -1, -1])
X = np.array(X)
y = np.array(y)

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(X.shape[1], X.shape[2])))
model.add(Dense(5)) # Output layer for 5-step prediction
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)

# Prediction (last timestep of features from a new sample)
new_sample = np.random.rand(1, 20, 4)
prediction = model.predict(new_sample)
print(prediction)
```
Here, the prediction is a vector of 5 values, each representing a prediction for a future timestep. The index is implicitly defined by the sequence position in the output vector.


**Example 3:  Prediction of a specific feature within a multi-feature target**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Data with multiple target variables
data = np.random.rand(100, 20, 7) # 4 predictors, 3 target variables
X = data[:, :-1, :4]
y = data[:, -1, 4:] #Last timestep, features 4, 5, and 6 as targets

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(X.shape[1], X.shape[2])))
model.add(Dense(3)) #Output layer with 3 neurons for 3 target variables.
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)

new_sample = np.random.rand(1, 19, 4)
prediction = model.predict(new_sample)
print(prediction) #Predictions for all 3 target variables.

# Accessing prediction for a specific target variable:
prediction_for_feature5 = prediction[:, 1]
print(prediction_for_feature5)
```
This example demonstrates predicting multiple target variables simultaneously.  Selecting a specific prediction (e.g., `prediction_for_feature5`) requires knowing the index of that target variable within the output layer.

*   Relevant Keras documentation on LSTM layers and model building


In conclusion,  the "index" used for prediction in a multivariate LSTM Keras model is not a predefined index but rather a consequence of the model's architecture and the way you structure your input and output data.  Careful consideration of your data preprocessing, target variable definition, and output layer design is essential for achieving accurate and meaningful predictions. Remember that the position of your target variable within your data dictates the relationship between the input sequence and the prediction.  It is this carefully designed relationship that defines your 'prediction index'.
