The behavior of Keras' `model.summary()` not displaying all layers stems primarily from the handling of internal layers within custom layers or models used as components within a larger model.  In my experience building complex sequential and functional models for image recognition and natural language processing tasks, this issue often arises when layers are encapsulated within other layers or when using custom training loops that implicitly manage layers outside the main model structure. The `model.summary()` function, by design, presents a high-level overview of the model architecture, and it may not recursively traverse and detail every single internal layer unless explicitly instructed or structured correctly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Keras `model.summary()` method provides a concise representation of the model's architecture, including the layer types, output shapes, and parameter counts.  However, its depth of analysis is limited.  It primarily focuses on the layers directly added to the main sequential or functional model.  If a custom layer, for example, internally utilizes multiple layers (dense, convolutional, etc.), `model.summary()` will only show the custom layer itself, not its constituent parts.  Similarly, if you build a sub-model and then incorporate it into a larger model, the internal structure of that sub-model is generally not detailed in the top-level summary unless the sub-model's summary is explicitly printed. This behavior is not a bug; rather, it is a design choice intended to provide a manageable overview, preventing the output from becoming excessively verbose for large, complex models.  The focus is on the macro-architecture rather than a complete, layer-by-layer micro-architecture.

Furthermore, the use of certain Keras functionalities like `Lambda` layers or layers wrapped in custom training loops can also obscure layers from the summary.  `Lambda` layers, while extremely useful for applying custom functions, do not inherently provide information about their internal operations to the `model.summary()` function. Similarly, layers managed outside the core model building process, for example, layers used only in a custom training loop, will not be included. The summary reflects only the layers explicitly built into and managed by the Keras model object.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Custom Layer Hiding Internal Layers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(units, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(units, activation='relu')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    MyCustomLayer(64),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.summary()
```

In this example, `MyCustomLayer` contains two dense layers. The output of `model.summary()` will only show `MyCustomLayer` as a single layer; the internal `dense1` and `dense2` layers are hidden. This demonstrates how encapsulation within custom layers leads to incomplete summaries.


**Example 2: Sub-model Exclusion**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

sub_model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu')
])

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    sub_model,
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.summary()
```

Here, `sub_model` is a complete sequential model.  While it's incorporated into the main model,  `model.summary()` will present `sub_model` as a single layer, not detailing its internal dense layers. To see the details of the sub-model, you would need to call `sub_model.summary()` separately.

**Example 3: Lambda Layer Obscurity**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def my_activation(x):
    return tf.math.sin(x)

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64),
    keras.layers.Lambda(my_activation),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.summary()
```

The `Lambda` layer applies a custom activation function.  `model.summary()` will show the `Lambda` layer, but it won't describe the internal workings of the `my_activation` function.  The summary remains high-level, focusing on the input and output shapes rather than the specific operations within the lambda function.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation provides detailed information on model building and the interpretation of `model.summary()`.  Explore the sections on custom layers, functional API, and sequential API for a comprehensive understanding.  Furthermore, the TensorFlow documentation, which underpins Keras, offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of layer creation and model compilation.  Finally, numerous published research papers and tutorials on building deep learning models using Keras offer practical examples and troubleshooting strategies.  Reviewing these resources will enhance your understanding of model architecture and the limitations of `model.summary()`.  Carefully analyzing how layers are nested and structured within your model is crucial for predicting and interpreting the output of `model.summary()`.  Debugging through print statements of intermediate layer outputs can also aid in identifying potential issues.
