Building TensorFlow from source using Bazel on Ubuntu 18.04 can present several challenges, particularly concerning link errors stemming from the Ares library.  My experience troubleshooting these issues over the past five years, primarily within large-scale machine learning deployments, highlights the crucial role of proper dependency management and understanding Bazel's build graph.  The root cause of most Ares-related link errors typically revolves around inconsistent or missing dependencies, often related to the interplay between TensorFlow's internal build system and system-wide libraries.

**1. Explanation of Ares Link Errors in TensorFlow Builds**

The Ares library, while not explicitly part of TensorFlow's public API, is internally used within various TensorFlow components.  It's commonly associated with optimized operations, often involving linear algebra routines.  When building TensorFlow from source, Bazel meticulously constructs a dependency graph.  Errors during the linking stage (specifically, `ld` errors), often manifested as "undefined reference" errors involving Ares symbols, signify that the compiler cannot find the necessary object files or libraries containing the implementations of those symbols. This failure usually originates from one of the following scenarios:

* **Missing Ares Library:** The most straightforward cause is that the Ares library itself isn't properly installed or isn't accessible within Bazel's build environment.  This might stem from incorrect package management (using `apt-get` or similar) during system setup or a misconfiguration within Bazel's `WORKSPACE` file.

* **Dependency Conflicts:** In complex builds like TensorFlow, dependency conflicts are frequent.  Two different TensorFlow components might depend on different versions or incompatible versions of Ares, or perhaps a dependency on Ares is conflicting with other libraries.  Bazel might select the incorrect version, resulting in linking failures.

* **Incorrect Build Configuration:**  The Bazel build configuration, primarily through `.bazelrc` files and BUILD files, influences the compilation and linking process.  Missing flags, incorrect compiler options, or flawed build rules can prevent the linker from correctly resolving dependencies.

* **System Library Conflicts:**  Sometimes the issue lies in a mismatch between the system's installed libraries and TensorFlow's internal dependencies.  An outdated or incorrectly configured system library, even seemingly unrelated to Ares, can propagate through the build system and lead to these link errors.

* **Build Cache Issues:** A corrupted or incorrectly configured Bazel build cache can lead to inconsistent results, potentially causing link errors to reappear even after resolving underlying issues.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

To illustrate these scenarios, I present three hypothetical cases, demonstrating potential issues and solutions. These are simplified for clarity but represent real-world patterns I've encountered.


**Example 1: Missing Ares Library**

```bazel
# WORKSPACE file (excerpt)
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "ares",
    urls = ["<URL_TO_ARES_LIBRARY>"],  # Replace with actual URL.  This is critical.
    sha256 = "<SHA256_CHECKSUM>",       # Crucial for reproducibility.
)

# BUILD file (excerpt)
cc_library(
    name = "my_tf_lib",
    srcs = ["my_tf_lib.cc"],
    deps = [":ares"],  # Incorrectly referencing Ares directly, assuming it's in a BUILD file, which might be a bad practice in many cases. It's often handled through TensorFlow's own rules.
)
```

* **Commentary:** This example shows a naive attempt to include Ares directly.  In practice, TensorFlow's internal rules will handle Ares inclusion. The primary error would likely be that the correct Ares library isn't actually downloaded or referenced correctly. One should not directly manage Ares in this manner within a TensorFlow build; instead, it's a part of the TensorFlow build system and needs to be correctly integrated via the TensorFlow BUILD files.


**Example 2: Dependency Conflict**

```bazel
# BUILD file (excerpt)
cc_binary(
    name = "my_tf_program",
    srcs = ["my_program.cc"],
    deps = [":my_tf_lib", "@my_other_lib//:my_lib"], # Conflict with my_other_lib
)
```

* **Commentary:** This illustrates a dependency conflict.  `my_other_lib` might have its own, incompatible Ares dependency, leading to clashes during linking. The solution often involves carefully examining the dependency graph, possibly using Bazel's analysis tools, to identify the conflict and modify dependencies to resolve inconsistencies.  Using Bazel's dependency visualization features is extremely helpful here.  Consider dependency version locking.


**Example 3: Incorrect Build Configuration**

```bazel
# .bazelrc
build --copt=-march=native  # Could lead to incompatibility depending on the target architecture and Ares' compilation

# BUILD file (excerpt)
cc_library(
    name = "my_tf_lib",
    srcs = ["my_tf_lib.cc"],
    copts = ["-Ofast"], #Potentially overriding global compiler flags
    linkopts = ["-lm"], # Possibly missing other necessary libraries.
)
```

* **Commentary:** This shows potentially problematic compiler and linker flags.  `-march=native` can cause issues if the Ares library wasn't compiled for the same architecture.  Overriding compiler flags can result in mismatched optimization levels between Ares and other TensorFlow components.  The missing linker option `-lm` (for the math library) is an extremely simplified example of how a missing system library can cascade into an Ares-related error.  Carefully reviewing Bazel's documentation and TensorFlow's build instructions for the recommended flags is crucial.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

To effectively troubleshoot these issues, I strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections concerning building from source.  Furthermore, deeply understanding Bazel's build system, including its concepts of BUILD files, `WORKSPACE` files, and the dependency graph, is essential.  Familiarize yourself with Bazel's command-line tools for analyzing the build graph and identifying dependency conflicts.  Finally, detailed reading of the compiler and linker error messages is crucial; they frequently provide the precise reason for the failure.  Thorough examination of the build logs will reveal the sequence of events leading to the link error, often pointing directly to the problematic dependency.  Leveraging system package managers like `apt-get` (or its equivalents on other systems) requires caution.  Ensure your system's libraries are up-to-date and consistent with the requirements specified in TensorFlow's build instructions.  Incorrectly managed system libraries often lead to subtle, hard-to-diagnose linking issues.
