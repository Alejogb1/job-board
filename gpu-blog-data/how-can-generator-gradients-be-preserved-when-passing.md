The core challenge in preserving generator gradients when passing GAN output through a non-differentiable function stems from the fundamental requirement of backpropagation: the ability to compute gradients through the entire computational graph. This is critical for training the generator in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) because the generator’s updates rely on the discriminator’s feedback, which is communicated through gradients. Introducing a non-differentiable operation disrupts this gradient flow, effectively halting the learning process for the generator. I have personally encountered this issue in the development of an image generation pipeline, where a crucial post-processing step needed to enforce certain artistic constraints on the generated output. This post-processing, while vital for the final aesthetic, was inherently non-differentiable, rendering traditional backpropagation useless.

The typical training process for a GAN involves iteratively optimizing the generator and discriminator. The generator attempts to create samples that fool the discriminator, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated data. This optimization relies on calculating the loss function for both networks, computing gradients with respect to network parameters, and updating these parameters using an optimization algorithm, such as Adam. Backpropagation is the workhorse for calculating these gradients, and it assumes the differentiable nature of all operations in the computational graph. When a non-differentiable function is inserted between the generator and the discriminator, this process breaks down. Specifically, the gradient calculation cannot be propagated back through the non-differentiable element to the generator's output, which in turn impedes updating the generator’s weights.

To overcome this issue, several techniques can be implemented, but they predominantly revolve around the core concept of either approximating the non-differentiable operation with a differentiable counterpart or bypassing the non-differentiable operation for gradient calculation purposes. One common approach, which I have found to be fairly reliable, is using a differentiable surrogate function. This involves replacing the non-differentiable operation with a similar function that is differentiable, particularly in the regions of the input space that the generator outputs. The trick lies in selecting a surrogate that closely mimics the desired transformation without breaking the gradient propagation. Consider a quantization step as a non-differentiable operation. If this operation is simply rounding to the nearest integer, it is not differentiable. However, you could replace it with a smooth approximation, such as using the sigmoid or tanh function for approximating the rounding. The better the approximation, the more faithful the training of the generator.

A second strategy, applicable in specific situations, involves using a straight-through estimator. This technique preserves the non-differentiable operation for the forward pass but, during backpropagation, simply passes the gradient through as if the operation were an identity transformation. In other words, the gradient computed for the output of the non-differentiable operation is directly transferred to its input. This approach makes the assumption that the generator benefits from the approximated gradient updates, which works surprisingly well when used cautiously. For example, a step function, while non-differentiable, can, via a straight-through estimator, still allow a meaningful gradient to reach the generator and guide it to produce outputs closer to the step-function transition.

A third, slightly more complex tactic, involves using reinforcement learning methods. Instead of directly relying on gradients to update the generator, reinforcement learning can be employed to assess the discriminator's response to generated outputs, which can be used as a reward or penalty. This eliminates the need for backpropagation directly through the non-differentiable operation. The generator learns by attempting to maximize the expected reward or minimize the penalty, circumventing the discontinuity imposed by the non-differentiable element. Although this approach is more computationally intensive, it can be a powerful alternative, particularly when differentiable approximations are infeasible or unreliable.

Here are three code examples illustrating the described approaches. They are provided using Python with PyTorch as the deep-learning framework for clarity:

**Example 1: Differentiable Surrogate for Rounding**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class Generator(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Generator, self).__init__()
    self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 64)
    self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 10)

  def forward(self, x):
    x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
    x = torch.sigmoid(self.fc2(x)) # generator output in range [0,1]
    return x

class QuantizeLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(QuantizeLayer, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, x):
      # This approximates rounding using a sigmoid-based approach.
        return torch.round(x * 10) / 10 # approximate to 0.1 precision


class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Discriminator, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.fc2(x))
        return x

generator = Generator()
quantize_layer = QuantizeLayer()
discriminator = Discriminator()

# Dummy data and criterion
noise = torch.randn(1, 10)
real_data = torch.rand(1,10)
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer_g = torch.optim.Adam(generator.parameters(), lr=0.001)
optimizer_d = torch.optim.Adam(discriminator.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Generator forward pass
generated_data = generator(noise)
quantized_output = quantize_layer(generated_data) # surrogate for discrete values

# Discriminator forward pass and loss
fake_output = discriminator(quantized_output)
real_output = discriminator(real_data)

# Discriminator loss calculation and update
loss_d = criterion(fake_output, torch.zeros_like(fake_output)) + criterion(real_output, torch.ones_like(real_output))

optimizer_d.zero_grad()
loss_d.backward(retain_graph=True)
optimizer_d.step()


# Generator loss calculation and update
loss_g = criterion(fake_output, torch.ones_like(fake_output))
optimizer_g.zero_grad()
loss_g.backward()
optimizer_g.step()

print("Generator parameters updated despite the quantize operation")
```

This first example demonstrates the substitution of a rounding function with a surrogate that approximates its behavior, specifically to round to 0.1 decimal precision, allowing gradients to be calculated by backpropagation.

**Example 2: Straight-through Estimator**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class Generator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Generator, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.fc2(x))
        return x

class StepFunction(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x):
        output = (x > 0.5).float()
        return output

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        # Straight-through estimator: pass gradients unchanged
        return grad_output

step_func = StepFunction.apply

class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
      super(Discriminator, self).__init__()
      self.fc1 = nn.Linear(1, 64)
      self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
      x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
      x = torch.sigmoid(self.fc2(x))
      return x


generator = Generator()
discriminator = Discriminator()

# Dummy data and criterion
noise = torch.randn(1, 10)
real_data = torch.rand(1, 1)
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer_g = torch.optim.Adam(generator.parameters(), lr=0.001)
optimizer_d = torch.optim.Adam(discriminator.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Generator forward pass
generated_data = generator(noise)
stepped_output = step_func(generated_data)

# Discriminator forward pass and loss
fake_output = discriminator(stepped_output)
real_output = discriminator(real_data)

# Discriminator loss calculation and update
loss_d = criterion(fake_output, torch.zeros_like(fake_output)) + criterion(real_output, torch.ones_like(real_output))

optimizer_d.zero_grad()
loss_d.backward(retain_graph=True)
optimizer_d.step()

# Generator loss calculation and update
loss_g = criterion(fake_output, torch.ones_like(fake_output))

optimizer_g.zero_grad()
loss_g.backward()
optimizer_g.step()


print("Generator parameters updated via straight through estimator")

```
This example implements a step function as a non-differentiable layer, but the custom backward function effectively allows the gradients to flow without interruption.

**Example 3: Reinforcement Learning Approach (Simplified)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torch.optim as optim

class Generator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Generator, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.fc2(x))
        return x

class NonDifferentiableOperation:
    def __call__(self, x):
        # Dummy operation
        if x > 0.5:
          return 1
        else:
          return 0

class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Discriminator, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(1, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.fc2(x))
        return x

generator = Generator()
discriminator = Discriminator()
nondiff_op = NonDifferentiableOperation()

# Dummy data and criterion
noise = torch.randn(1, 10)
real_data = torch.rand(1, 1)
optimizer_g = optim.Adam(generator.parameters(), lr=0.001)


# Generator forward pass
generated_data = generator(noise)
# Convert to discrete through non diff operation
discrete_output = torch.tensor([nondiff_op(data_point) for data_point in generated_data.flatten()]).float().unsqueeze(0)

# Get the disc output, calculate a score and reward
disc_output = discriminator(discrete_output) # disc output represents the likelihood of fake sample
reward = disc_output

# Calculate loss by optimizing to maximize expected reward
loss_g = -reward
optimizer_g.zero_grad()
loss_g.backward()
optimizer_g.step()


print("Generator updated using Reinforcement learning")

```

This simplified example illustrates the concept of using a reward from the discriminator output to directly guide the generator update, avoiding backpropagation.

For further exploration of the described methods, research works on “straight-through estimators”, “gradient approximation techniques”, and “reinforcement learning for GAN training” will prove to be useful resources. Additionally, a deep dive into the documentation of your chosen deep learning framework regarding custom layers and autograd operations can greatly facilitate implementation. Publications in neural information processing systems and machine learning conferences provide detailed insights into these techniques. Understanding the limitations and appropriate application of each approach is vital to successfully train a GAN with non-differentiable post-processing. My experience shows that careful experimentation and analysis of the training process are needed to select and refine the best solution for a particular problem.
