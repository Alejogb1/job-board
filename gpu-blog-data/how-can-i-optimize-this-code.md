A common performance bottleneck I've encountered repeatedly in web service development centers around inefficient data retrieval and processing, specifically when handling large datasets from relational databases and subsequently transforming them for client consumption. The specific issue often manifests as excessive server-side CPU utilization and increased response times. Optimization requires a multifaceted approach targeting not only database queries but also post-processing operations.

My experience stems from maintaining a large-scale e-commerce platform where customer order data, comprising numerous joined tables (customers, orders, line items, products), was frequently retrieved for reporting and display purposes. Initial implementations, naively pulling entire datasets into memory and then performing filtering and aggregation in application code, proved inadequate as the volume of orders grew. The primary challenge was two-fold: minimizing the data transferred from the database and efficiently transforming the data into the desired format. Optimizing this process required understanding both the database query plan and how application logic could be adjusted to reduce overhead.

The first step involves critically examining the SQL queries themselves. A frequent mistake is the use of `SELECT *` which retrieves all columns, regardless of whether they are needed. This unnecessarily increases data transfer volume and memory consumption on both the database server and the application server. Instead, only the required columns should be explicitly specified. Furthermore, excessive use of joins without proper indexing can lead to inefficient query plans. It’s also crucial to filter data within the SQL query itself using `WHERE` clauses whenever possible, thereby minimizing the amount of data returned to the application.

The second critical area lies in the application’s data processing logic. After retrieving data from the database, many developers fall into the trap of iterating through collections and performing computations or transformations directly using languages like Python or Java. These iterative operations on large datasets can become extremely slow. Techniques like vectorization and functional programming paradigms, which leverage optimized built-in functions and avoid explicit looping, are significantly faster. The concept of lazy evaluation, where data transformations are performed only when the result is actually needed, also plays a crucial role in improving performance with complex data pipelines.

Here are some code examples illustrating these principles, drawn from my experience optimizing parts of the previously mentioned e-commerce platform. In the following code examples I will use Python for clarity but the principles are largely language agnostic.

**Example 1: Inefficient SQL query and in-memory filtering**

```python
import sqlite3

def get_all_orders_and_filter_by_user(user_id):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('orders.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Inefficient: Selects all columns and performs filtering in-memory
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM orders JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id")
    all_orders = cursor.fetchall()

    user_orders = [order for order in all_orders if order[5] == user_id] # Assuming user_id is in column 5 of joined result
    conn.close()
    return user_orders
```

This code has two major issues: firstly, it selects all columns from the `orders` and `customers` tables via `SELECT *` instead of specifying what is required. Secondly, it retrieves all order and customer data irrespective of the `user_id`. Then the required orders are filtered within the Python application itself by iterating through the large dataset in the `user_orders` assignment. This approach is particularly inefficient for datasets containing thousands or millions of orders. It is particularly problematic when there are hundreds of columns in the tables, leading to significant overhead.

**Example 2: Optimized SQL query and using generators.**

```python
import sqlite3

def get_orders_for_user(user_id):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('orders.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Efficient: Selects only required columns, filters in SQL, uses generator.
    cursor.execute("SELECT orders.order_id, orders.order_date, orders.total_amount "
                   "FROM orders JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id "
                   "WHERE customers.id = ?", (user_id,))
    
    while True:
        row = cursor.fetchone()
        if row is None:
            break
        yield row
    conn.close()
```

This refactored version demonstrates the efficiency gains achievable by specifying only the needed columns in the `SELECT` statement, filtering results by the provided `user_id` in the `WHERE` clause, and finally yielding the result rows instead of reading all rows at once in memory. The database now only returns the required data and this is streamed to the application through a generator resulting in significantly lower memory usage. The `while` loop provides lazy iteration. In the context of a web application, this approach allows the application to begin processing data as it becomes available rather than waiting for the entire dataset to be retrieved.

**Example 3:  Inefficient iteration and list comprehensions versus functional methods**

```python
def process_items_inefficient(items):
    processed_items = []
    for item in items:
        if item['price'] > 10:
            discounted_price = item['price'] * 0.9
            processed_items.append({'id': item['id'], 'discounted_price': discounted_price})
    return processed_items
```
This example uses a traditional loop to filter and transform items, which can be slow for large lists. The problem is explicit iteration, the code needs to read in each line and then performs an conditional check and a discount on each line.

```python
def process_items_efficient(items):
    filtered_items = filter(lambda item: item['price'] > 10, items)
    processed_items = map(lambda item: {'id': item['id'], 'discounted_price': item['price'] * 0.9}, filtered_items)
    return list(processed_items)
```

Here, I use the built-in Python `filter` and `map` functions to perform equivalent operations, offering a more compact and, more importantly, more performant approach. `filter` returns an iterator and `map` also return an iterator, this avoids creating temporary lists, the final `list()` conversion is the last step in the data pipeline. The functional style allows for more efficient internal processing in the Python interpreter and also has the benefit of being easy to parallelise if required using more advanced libraries. The underlying mechanism leverages vectorization to perform bulk operations efficiently, especially when using libraries like NumPy or Pandas.

In closing, resource recommendations would begin with materials on database query optimization practices. These should cover the usage of indexes, efficient joins, and proper filtering techniques. Database-specific documentation is critical for this learning, as each system has nuances. I also recommend focusing on books and articles outlining functional programming concepts and their application in various languages, as this paradigm offers significant performance enhancements when dealing with data transformations. Finally, resources detailing effective use of built-in language libraries such as vectorization utilities will provide practical guidance for optimizing code. My experience has shown that improving performance is not a single action but a combination of actions requiring a deep understanding of the complete stack from SQL to Python.
