The core reason a transformation may not apply to a custom PyTorch dataset stems from the incorrect application of the `transform` parameter within the `Dataset` class or the DataLoader. I have repeatedly encountered this issue while building deep learning models and datasets for image analysis projects. A custom dataset, unlike predefined datasets within `torchvision`, doesnâ€™t inherently implement transformation logic. Thus, it relies entirely on the user to incorporate these alterations correctly. This often involves misunderstanding how PyTorch handles data loading and preprocessing or placing the transformation call in the wrong location.

Specifically, the `__getitem__` method of the custom dataset class is where the sample is loaded and should be transformed. If this logic is absent, the dataset will yield raw, untransformed data. Conversely, if transformations are applied *outside* the dataset, typically during the iteration over the DataLoader, they might be ineffective as the data is already loaded into memory as a PyTorch tensor. This commonly occurs when users expect the DataLoader itself to handle the application of transforms in a manner similar to `torchvision.datasets`.

Let's illustrate this with a common use case: loading images from a directory. Consider a situation where we want to resize images and convert them to tensors.

**Example 1: Incorrect Transformation Application**

The following code demonstrates a frequent mistake: applying the transformation to individual samples *after* the dataset has already loaded them in its raw form.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from torchvision import transforms
from PIL import Image
import os

class MyImageDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, image_dir):
        self.image_paths = [os.path.join(image_dir, f) for f in os.listdir(image_dir) if f.endswith(('.png', '.jpg'))]
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.image_paths)
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        img_path = self.image_paths[idx]
        image = Image.open(img_path).convert('RGB')
        return image # Incorrect: Returns raw image

# Example usage:
image_directory = 'my_images' # Assumes a directory with image files
dataset = MyImageDataset(image_directory)
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((256, 256)),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)

for images in dataloader: # Here transformations should NOT be applied
  transformed_images = transform(images)
  print(transformed_images.shape) # Issue: Transformations don't work as expected
```

Here, the `MyImageDataset` loads raw PIL images. The `transform` is defined but then used *on* the raw images yielded by the DataLoader *outside* of the dataset class definition. The expected tensor transformation doesn't take effect as `images` contains PIL images, and the tensor operation will only work correctly after the images are batched. The intended outcome, a batch of resized and transformed tensors, is missed. Further, this results in a potential runtime error as `transform` is designed to operate on individual samples, not batches. The key error is in believing transformations can be applied *after* loading from the `DataLoader`, when they should be part of the `__getitem__` method.

**Example 2: Correct Implementation**

The following modified code demonstrates how to correctly apply a transformation within a custom dataset:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from torchvision import transforms
from PIL import Image
import os

class MyImageDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, image_dir, transform=None):
        self.image_paths = [os.path.join(image_dir, f) for f in os.listdir(image_dir) if f.endswith(('.png', '.jpg'))]
        self.transform = transform
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.image_paths)
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        img_path = self.image_paths[idx]
        image = Image.open(img_path).convert('RGB')
        if self.transform:
            image = self.transform(image)
        return image # Correctly returns transformed tensor

# Example usage:
image_directory = 'my_images' # Assumes a directory with image files
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((256, 256)),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])
dataset = MyImageDataset(image_directory, transform=transform) # Pass transform to dataset
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)

for images in dataloader:
  print(images.shape) # Correctly outputs: torch.Size([4, 3, 256, 256])
```

In this revised version, the `transform` is passed during the initialization of the dataset. Crucially, within the `__getitem__` method, we now conditionally apply the transformation to the loaded image *before* it is returned. As a result, the `DataLoader` now yields a batch of transformed images (tensors), as expected. This illustrates the critical point: applying transformation within the `Dataset.__getitem__` method, not externally.

**Example 3: Handling Multiple Transforms**

Often, one might need to apply different transformations to the training and validation sets. The following example demonstrates how to use different transformations in a split scenario:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader, random_split
from torchvision import transforms
from PIL import Image
import os

class MyImageDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, image_dir, transform=None):
        self.image_paths = [os.path.join(image_dir, f) for f in os.listdir(image_dir) if f.endswith(('.png', '.jpg'))]
        self.transform = transform
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.image_paths)
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        img_path = self.image_paths[idx]
        image = Image.open(img_path).convert('RGB')
        if self.transform:
           image = self.transform(image)
        return image

# Example usage:
image_directory = 'my_images' # Assumes a directory with image files
train_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((256, 256)),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])

val_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((256, 256)),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])

full_dataset = MyImageDataset(image_directory) # Creates dataset without transforms
train_size = int(0.8 * len(full_dataset))
val_size = len(full_dataset) - train_size
train_dataset, val_dataset = random_split(full_dataset, [train_size, val_size])

train_dataset.dataset.transform = train_transform # Apply train transformation
val_dataset.dataset.transform = val_transform  # Apply validation transform

train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)
val_dataloader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=False)

for images in train_dataloader:
    print("Training batch:",images.shape) # Has RandomHorizontalFlip
for images in val_dataloader:
    print("Validation batch:",images.shape) # No RandomHorizontalFlip
```

This shows a more sophisticated case. First, a dataset is created without a transform. Then, we split the data, and assign *different* transforms to `train_dataset.dataset.transform` and `val_dataset.dataset.transform`.  This is crucial because `random_split` returns a `Subset` object, not a dataset, and the `.dataset` property accesses the original `MyImageDataset`. This achieves separate pipelines for train and validation which is essential for model training and evaluation practices.

It's also important to note that if a `collate_fn` is being used with the `DataLoader`, any transformation that assumes batched tensors might interfere with the custom `collate_fn` logic and prevent it working as intended. Thus care must be taken when using custom `collate_fn`.

**Recommendations:**

For individuals struggling with similar issues, I recommend spending time understanding the interaction between the `Dataset` class and the `DataLoader`.  Specifically, focus on the `__getitem__` method within your custom dataset. Pay close attention to when the transformation is being applied. Study the official PyTorch documentation on custom datasets, understanding data loading with DataLoader, and the torchvision transform module are essential. Further exploration of `torch.utils.data.random_split` or similar classes can be helpful when working with train and validation datasets. Review example code for custom datasets and how the `transform` parameter is used for inspiration and a more granular view of implementation. A clear understanding of these concepts will lead to more successful data preprocessing and reduce the likelihood of this common error.
