Sparse tensors, by their nature, only store non-zero elements and their indices. This inherent structure significantly impacts how we select elements compared to dense tensors.  My experience working with large-scale graph neural networks, where sparse adjacency matrices are prevalent, has highlighted the critical need for efficient sparse tensor indexing.  Directly applying dense tensor indexing techniques often leads to unacceptable performance degradation.  Therefore, understanding the underlying data structures and utilizing specialized libraries is paramount.

The core principle for selecting elements in a sparse tensor revolves around leveraging the index information explicitly stored within the data structure.  Unlike dense tensors where accessing an element involves a simple calculation based on its position, sparse tensors require consulting the index arrays to determine the element's presence and value. This generally involves converting the desired selection criteria into a set of indices compatible with the sparse tensor's format.  The optimal approach depends on the specific sparse tensor library used and the nature of the selection criteria.

Many libraries represent sparse tensors using variations of the Coordinate (COO), Compressed Sparse Row (CSR), or Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) formats. COO stores values and their row and column indices separately; CSR and CSC optimize storage and access patterns for row-wise and column-wise operations, respectively.  Selecting elements efficiently often requires understanding which format your library employs and tailoring your approach accordingly.  Inefficient selection can dramatically increase computation time, especially for very large sparse tensors.

Let's illustrate this with examples using Python and three common scenarios.  I will assume familiarity with NumPy and SciPy, as these are my go-to libraries for efficient numerical computation. In these examples, `sparse_matrix` represents a pre-existing sparse tensor of any supported format, loaded from a file or created using library-specific functions.  For brevity, error handling and input validation are omitted, but these are crucial in production-level code.

**Example 1: Selecting rows based on index.**

This is straightforward if the library provides direct row access. Many libraries offer methods to extract rows.  This often proves faster than iterating over indices.

```python
import scipy.sparse as sparse

# Assume sparse_matrix is a pre-existing scipy sparse matrix (e.g., CSR format)
rows_to_select = [2, 5, 10] # Indices of rows to select

selected_rows = sparse_matrix[rows_to_select, :]

# selected_rows now contains a new sparse matrix with only the specified rows
print(selected_rows.toarray()) # Convert to dense array for easy display.  Avoid in production for large matrices.
```

This approach leverages library-specific optimizations for row extraction, avoiding manual index manipulation.  The `toarray()` method is used solely for demonstration; it's computationally expensive for large tensors and should be avoided in production code where the sparse format should be preserved.


**Example 2: Selecting elements based on value.**

Selecting elements based on their value requires a more iterative approach. We must iterate through the non-zero elements and check if they satisfy the specified condition.

```python
import scipy.sparse as sparse
import numpy as np

# Assume sparse_matrix is a pre-existing scipy sparse matrix (COO format for this example)
value_threshold = 5

row_indices = []
col_indices = []
values = []

for row, col, value in zip(sparse_matrix.row, sparse_matrix.col, sparse_matrix.data):
    if value > value_threshold:
        row_indices.append(row)
        col_indices.append(col)
        values.append(value)

selected_elements = sparse.coo_matrix((values, (row_indices, col_indices)), shape=sparse_matrix.shape)

# selected_elements now contains a new sparse matrix with elements above the threshold.
print(selected_elements.toarray())
```

This example utilizes the COO format's direct access to row, column, and value arrays.  This method is less efficient than optimized library functions for row or column selection but is necessary when selection criteria depend on the element values themselves.  Again, `toarray()` is for illustrative purposes only.


**Example 3:  Selecting elements within a specific range of row and column indices.**

This requires combining index selection with value checks, and is particularly relevant in scenarios such as sub-matrix extraction.

```python
import scipy.sparse as sparse
import numpy as np

# Assume sparse_matrix is a pre-existing scipy sparse matrix (CSR for this example)
row_start = 10
row_end = 20
col_start = 5
col_end = 15

row_indices = []
col_indices = []
values = []

for i in range(sparse_matrix.shape[0]):
    if row_start <= i < row_end:
        row_slice = sparse_matrix.getrow(i)
        for j in range(sparse_matrix.shape[1]):
            if col_start <= j < col_end and row_slice[0, j]!=0:
                row_indices.append(i)
                col_indices.append(j)
                values.append(row_slice[0, j])

selected_submatrix = sparse.coo_matrix((values, (row_indices, col_indices)), shape=(row_end - row_start, col_end - col_start))

print(selected_submatrix.toarray())
```

This example demonstrates a more complex selection involving ranges. The use of `getrow` is more efficient than direct access in CSR format.  The final `coo_matrix` construction ensures the resulting matrix is correctly shaped for the selected sub-region.  The conversion to a dense array at the end is for display purposes.  In a real-world application, you'd retain the sparse structure for performance reasons.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I would suggest consulting advanced linear algebra texts focusing on sparse matrix computations.  Furthermore, the documentation of your chosen sparse matrix library (e.g., SciPy's sparse module) should be your primary resource.  Finally, reviewing research papers on graph algorithms and large-scale data processing would provide valuable context on efficient sparse tensor manipulation techniques within specific applications. These resources will provide a more detailed understanding of the underlying algorithms and data structures involved in optimizing sparse tensor operations. Remember to always prioritize maintaining the sparse format throughout your operations unless absolutely necessary to avoid performance bottlenecks inherent in converting to dense representations.
