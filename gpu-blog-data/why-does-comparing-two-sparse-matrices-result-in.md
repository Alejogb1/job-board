The core reason comparing two sparse matrices using direct equality operators like `==` or `!=` in most numerical computing libraries results in a "NotImplemented" error stems from the fundamental design of sparse matrix representations and the computational cost associated with element-wise comparison of these structures.

Sparse matrices, unlike their dense counterparts, are explicitly designed to store only the non-zero elements along with their indices. This approach drastically reduces memory consumption and allows for efficient computations on matrices containing a large proportion of zeros. However, this design choice introduces complexities when comparing two sparse matrices for equality. A simple element-by-element comparison, as often used for dense matrices, is not a straightforward operation with sparse storage. Libraries often prioritize performance in matrix operations and avoid computationally expensive element-wise comparisons when an alternative is possible.

My experience in developing a custom finite element analysis solver required extensive manipulation of large sparse matrices. Initially, I assumed direct comparison would work similar to dense matrices. I quickly encountered "NotImplemented" errors and learned that the library’s design intentionally avoided this operation due to its computational inefficiency. The library expected the user to explicitly define how such a comparison should be performed because equality for sparse matrices isn't as simple as checking `a[i,j] == b[i,j]` for all `i` and `j` pairs. Instead, it requires a structural comparison of non-zero elements, their indices, and potentially even their storage order. The comparison method can significantly alter performance depending on the chosen algorithm and the nature of the sparse data.

Libraries prioritize performance, specifically for arithmetic operations, and defer comparison functionality to user definition. Consequently, directly comparing sparse matrices with `==` or `!=` throws a "NotImplemented" error, forcing a user to explicitly handle equality checks through explicit algorithmic methods. The library cannot assume which method to use when comparing sparse matrices, leading to the error. The responsibility shifts to the user to define the desired notion of equality in their specific application context.

Here are three examples illustrating how one might approach sparse matrix equality checks with commentary:

**Example 1: Basic Structural Comparison (NumPy/SciPy)**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix

def sparse_matrices_equal_structural(A, B):
    """
    Checks for equality by comparing data, indices and shapes.
    Assumes CSR format for both matrices.
    """
    if A.shape != B.shape:
        return False
    if not np.array_equal(A.data, B.data):
      return False
    if not np.array_equal(A.indices, B.indices):
      return False
    if not np.array_equal(A.indptr, B.indptr):
      return False
    return True

# Example Matrices
data1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
indices1 = np.array([0, 2, 2, 0, 1])
indptr1 = np.array([0, 2, 3, 5])
A = csr_matrix((data1, indices1, indptr1), shape=(3, 3))

data2 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
indices2 = np.array([0, 2, 2, 0, 1])
indptr2 = np.array([0, 2, 3, 5])
B = csr_matrix((data2, indices2, indptr2), shape=(3, 3))

data3 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 6])
indices3 = np.array([0, 2, 2, 0, 1])
indptr3 = np.array([0, 2, 3, 5])
C = csr_matrix((data3, indices3, indptr3), shape=(3, 3))

print(f"A == B? {sparse_matrices_equal_structural(A, B)}") # Output: A == B? True
print(f"A == C? {sparse_matrices_equal_structural(A, C)}") # Output: A == C? False
```

In this example, the `sparse_matrices_equal_structural` function explicitly compares the `data`, `indices`, and `indptr` attributes of two sparse matrices (assuming CSR format), alongside shape equality.  This method checks for structural equivalence, meaning that the matrices must have the same non-zero values in the same positions to be deemed equal.  Any difference in the storage arrays will result in a `False` comparison result.  This is a low-level approach directly interacting with the internal representations of the sparse matrices. It’s efficient for comparing sparse matrices with similar nonzero patterns but requires understanding the specific sparse format being used.

**Example 2: Element-Wise Comparison with Tolerance (SciPy)**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix

def sparse_matrices_equal_tolerance(A, B, tolerance=1e-8):
    """
    Checks for equality based on element-wise comparison with tolerance.
    Requires conversion to dense array which is slow for large matrices.
    """
    if A.shape != B.shape:
        return False
    dense_A = A.toarray()
    dense_B = B.toarray()
    return np.all(np.abs(dense_A - dense_B) <= tolerance)

# Example Matrices
data1 = np.array([1.00000001, 2, 3, 4, 5])
indices1 = np.array([0, 2, 2, 0, 1])
indptr1 = np.array([0, 2, 3, 5])
A = csr_matrix((data1, indices1, indptr1), shape=(3, 3))

data2 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
indices2 = np.array([0, 2, 2, 0, 1])
indptr2 = np.array([0, 2, 3, 5])
B = csr_matrix((data2, indices2, indptr2), shape=(3, 3))


print(f"A == B? {sparse_matrices_equal_tolerance(A, B)}") # Output: A == B? True
```

Here, `sparse_matrices_equal_tolerance` provides an element-wise comparison using a specified tolerance. This method converts both sparse matrices to dense arrays using `.toarray()` and then utilizes NumPy's `np.all` and `np.abs` functions to determine whether the absolute difference between the corresponding elements is within the specified tolerance. While this offers an intuitive notion of equality based on element values, converting to dense form before comparing defeats the purpose of sparse matrix representation and is highly inefficient for large matrices, leading to significant memory and performance costs. This approach is not ideal for large-scale computations involving very sparse matrices because it forces the creation of a full dense matrix which would use excessive amounts of memory.

**Example 3: Comparing Nonzero Elements Directly (SciPy)**
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix

def sparse_matrices_equal_nonzero(A, B):
    """
    Checks for equality by comparing only non-zero elements and their locations
    """
    if A.shape != B.shape:
        return False

    A_nonzero_coords = A.nonzero()
    B_nonzero_coords = B.nonzero()

    if len(A_nonzero_coords[0]) != len(B_nonzero_coords[0]):
      return False

    if not np.array_equal(A_nonzero_coords, B_nonzero_coords):
        return False

    for i in range(len(A_nonzero_coords[0])):
        if A[A_nonzero_coords[0][i], A_nonzero_coords[1][i]] != B[B_nonzero_coords[0][i], B_nonzero_coords[1][i]]:
            return False

    return True

# Example Matrices
data1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
indices1 = np.array([0, 2, 2, 0, 1])
indptr1 = np.array([0, 2, 3, 5])
A = csr_matrix((data1, indices1, indptr1), shape=(3, 3))

data2 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
indices2 = np.array([0, 2, 2, 0, 1])
indptr2 = np.array([0, 2, 3, 5])
B = csr_matrix((data2, indices2, indptr2), shape=(3, 3))


data3 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 6])
indices3 = np.array([0, 2, 2, 0, 1])
indptr3 = np.array([0, 2, 3, 5])
C = csr_matrix((data3, indices3, indptr3), shape=(3, 3))


print(f"A == B? {sparse_matrices_equal_nonzero(A, B)}") # Output: A == B? True
print(f"A == C? {sparse_matrices_equal_nonzero(A, C)}") # Output: A == C? False
```

`sparse_matrices_equal_nonzero` directly accesses the nonzero elements’ indices. It first checks if the nonzero coordinates match before then comparing corresponding nonzero values in matrices A and B. This technique is efficient because it avoids iteration over zero elements and doesn't involve expensive full matrix conversion. It offers a good balance between computational efficiency and the ability to assess the correctness of the matrices based on their stored values.

When selecting comparison methods, consider several factors: memory efficiency, acceptable tolerance, speed, and level of structural matching required. These depend on specific application needs.

**Resource Recommendations**

For those wishing to delve deeper, I recommend exploring advanced topics in linear algebra and numerical methods with focus on sparse matrices. Specific resources related to numerical libraries are vital, particularly the official documentation for libraries like NumPy and SciPy, often including specific information related to sparse matrix operations. Also, books covering sparse matrix algorithms can be very helpful in understanding the underlying mathematics and implementation details. Finally, practical resources such as scientific computing and engineering analysis textbooks often feature discussions on sparse matrix implementations.
