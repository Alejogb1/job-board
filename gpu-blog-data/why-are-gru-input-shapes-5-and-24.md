Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), like other recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, process sequential data. Their effectiveness relies heavily on consistent input shapes across time steps within a single sequence, and between different sequences within a batch. When we observe shape incompatibilities like (5,) and (24,), it signifies a mismatch in the expected size of the input vector for each time step and the size of the vector that is actually provided to the GRU layer. This incompatibility fundamentally disrupts the computation necessary for GRU cell operation.

The core issue stems from how a GRU processes input at each time step. A GRU cell receives an input vector ‘x_t’ and a hidden state ‘h_t-1’ from the previous time step. It then computes new gates and a new hidden state 'h_t' which is passed on to the next time step. The dimensions of the input vector ‘x_t’ must be fixed and consistent across all time steps within a batch of sequences. Consequently, a GRU layer expects a consistent input feature dimension, such as (5,) or (24,) in isolation, not a mix. Think of each number in these shapes as representing a different feature of the input sequence. Therefore, attempting to feed a sequence where some time steps have five features while others have 24 will not work. This discrepancy creates an issue in how the weights and biases for the GRU gates are structured and applied during the calculation.

Specifically, the GRU utilizes multiple weight matrices (Whz, Whr, Whn, Wxz, Wxr, Wxn) and bias vectors (bz, br, bn). These are crucial for performing the complex gating operations within the cell (update gate, reset gate and candidate activation). The shapes of these matrices and vectors are determined by two factors: the size of the hidden state vector and the size of the input vector. All input vectors must share the same dimensionality to be correctly multiplied with the appropriate weight matrices. This is why we encounter the error when an input vector like (5,) appears unexpectedly where a (24,) shaped vector was expected.

Let's consider a fictional scenario where I built a stock price prediction model using a GRU. My initial attempt fed the model daily price data with 5 features (open, high, low, close, volume), represented as shape (5,). Now, suppose I wanted to include daily news sentiment score, which comes in 24 different features representing various sentiments on news media articles, as additional information to improve my predictions. If I attempt to naively merge the two by assuming they are the same kind of vector I would have incompatible shapes for different parts of my sequence, I would run into error.

Here's what that code might look like using TensorFlow. Note, I'm not providing complete model building structure just the portion that directly generates the error.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate a sequence of 10 timesteps for stocks
stock_data = np.random.rand(10, 5)  # Shape: (10, 5)
stock_data = np.expand_dims(stock_data, axis=0).astype(np.float32)

# Generate a sequence of 10 timesteps for sentiment data
sentiment_data = np.random.rand(10, 24) # Shape: (10, 24)
sentiment_data = np.expand_dims(sentiment_data, axis=0).astype(np.float32)


# Attempt to concatenate along the feature dimension
# This will result in a shape of (1, 20, 29), which the model wouldn't expect.
combined_input = np.concatenate((stock_data, sentiment_data), axis=1) # incorrect use

# Creating a simple GRU layer.
gru_layer = tf.keras.layers.GRU(units=64, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(combined_input.shape[1], combined_input.shape[2]))

try:
    output = gru_layer(combined_input) # Passing the incorrectly shaped input here will cause an error
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}")

```
In this first example, the attempt to directly concatenate across the time axis is problematic. While combining the data is desired, it introduces variation in input feature size per timestep. The core error highlights that the input data does not conform to the specified input shape. The GRU layer does not have a mechanism to manage different numbers of input features at each time step.

Instead of concatenating the data, we can concatenate on the feature axis, combining (5) and (24) into one (29)-feature vector.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate a sequence of 10 timesteps for stocks
stock_data = np.random.rand(10, 5)  # Shape: (10, 5)
# Generate a sequence of 10 timesteps for sentiment data
sentiment_data = np.random.rand(10, 24) # Shape: (10, 24)

# Correctly combine feature data by concatenating on the feature axis (last axis)
combined_input = np.concatenate((stock_data, sentiment_data), axis=1) # Correct usage
combined_input = np.expand_dims(combined_input, axis=0).astype(np.float32)
print(f"Shape of combined input: {combined_input.shape}") # Check shape

# Creating a simple GRU layer with the new input feature dimension.
gru_layer = tf.keras.layers.GRU(units=64, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(combined_input.shape[1], combined_input.shape[2]))

output = gru_layer(combined_input)  # Now this will work as it receives the correct input shape.
print(f"Output shape from GRU layer: {output.shape}")


```

This revised example demonstrates how to correctly combine feature data by concatenating along the feature dimension instead of concatenating along the time dimension, thereby generating a shape of (10,29). When the GRU layer receives this input, which is appropriately formatted, the computations proceed normally, producing a correct output.

Alternatively, if the stock price features and sentiment scores are intended to be treated separately within the model, we would typically require two distinct inputs. One way of doing this is through the use of two separate GRU layers and then potentially merging their outputs.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate a sequence of 10 timesteps for stocks
stock_data = np.random.rand(10, 5)  # Shape: (10, 5)
stock_data = np.expand_dims(stock_data, axis=0).astype(np.float32)

# Generate a sequence of 10 timesteps for sentiment data
sentiment_data = np.random.rand(10, 24) # Shape: (10, 24)
sentiment_data = np.expand_dims(sentiment_data, axis=0).astype(np.float32)

# Create two separate GRU layers, one for each input.
gru_layer_stock = tf.keras.layers.GRU(units=64, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(stock_data.shape[1], stock_data.shape[2]))
gru_layer_sentiment = tf.keras.layers.GRU(units=64, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(sentiment_data.shape[1], sentiment_data.shape[2]))


# Process each input separately.
output_stock = gru_layer_stock(stock_data)
output_sentiment = gru_layer_sentiment(sentiment_data)

# Process outputs of GRU layers in another part of the network
print(f"Shape of output from GRU layer stock: {output_stock.shape}")
print(f"Shape of output from GRU layer sentiment: {output_sentiment.shape}")
```

This example showcases a different approach, where two distinct GRU layers handle separate input features, thereby avoiding any shape mismatch. This is more applicable if one intends to treat the stock price and sentiment data as belonging to entirely separate sequential signals. Each GRU receives a consistent input shape, and the outputs can be merged or processed further as required.

For deeper understanding, refer to documentation on sequence modeling, and the specific recurrent layers, particularly on input shapes. Texts covering recurrent neural networks and sequence processing in general offer valuable insights. In addition, tutorials focusing on time series forecasting often include detailed guidance on managing time-based data and input shape requirements for different layer types. Finally, reviewing the API specifications for any framework you are using, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch can help solidify the correct use of these layers. Understanding and correctly formatting the input data is critical for properly utilizing GRU layers and achieving the intended functionality within recurrent models.
