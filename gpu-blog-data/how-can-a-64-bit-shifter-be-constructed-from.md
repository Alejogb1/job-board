Constructing a 64-bit shifter from 32-bit shifters at the gate level necessitates a hierarchical approach leveraging the inherent structure of 64-bit data.  My experience designing high-performance processors for embedded systems has highlighted the efficiency of this decomposition.  The key insight lies in recognizing the 64-bit data as two concatenated 32-bit words, allowing parallel processing using two 32-bit shifters. This method, while seemingly straightforward, requires careful consideration of control signals and data routing to ensure correct functionality across all shift operations.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental strategy is to partition the 64-bit input into high-order (high32) and low-order (low32) 32-bit words.  Two 32-bit shifters, denoted as Shifter_High and Shifter_Low, handle these respective words. The shift operation, specified by a 6-bit shift amount (shift_amount[5:0]), is also divided into two parts.  The upper 2 bits (shift_amount[5:4]) control the shift count for the high-order shifter, while the lower 4 bits (shift_amount[3:0]) control the low-order shifter.

However, a direct application of the shift amount to both shifters is insufficient for all shift modes.  Consider a right shift by 36 bits.  The high32 word would shift by 4 bits (36 mod 32 = 4), and the low32 would shift by 4 bits. Then data needs to be combined. In a left shift, a similar split and subsequent combination apply.


For left shifts, the low-order 32 bits must receive data from the high-order 32 bits after their respective shifts. For right shifts, data from the high-order 32 bits must be appended to the low-order 32 bits.  Therefore, we need multiplexers to select the appropriate data sources.


Furthermore, the type of shift (logical or arithmetic) influences the output.  For an arithmetic right shift, the sign bit must be replicated across the vacated bits. This necessitates additional circuitry for the high-order shifter. A logical shift simply inserts zeros.  This choice necessitates selecting the correct type of 32-bit shifter and adapting the concatenation process accordingly.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following code examples use a simplified hardware description language (HDL) to illustrate the concept.  These examples omit the detailed gate-level implementation for brevity, focusing on the algorithmic structure.

**Example 1: Logical Right Shift**

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity shifter_64bit is
    port (
        clk : in std_logic;
        rst : in std_logic;
        data_in : in std_logic_vector(63 downto 0);
        shift_amount : in std_logic_vector(5 downto 0);
        data_out : out std_logic_vector(63 downto 0)
    );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of shifter_64bit is
    signal high32_in, high32_out, low32_in, low32_out : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
    signal shift_amount_high, shift_amount_low : std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);

begin
    -- Partition input
    high32_in <= data_in(63 downto 32);
    low32_in <= data_in(31 downto 0);

    --Shift amount partitioning for right shift.
    shift_amount_high <= shift_amount(5 downto 4);
    shift_amount_low <= shift_amount(3 downto 0);

    -- 32-bit shifters (replace with actual 32-bit shifter instantiation)
    Shifter_High: entity work.shifter_32bit port map (clk, rst, high32_in, shift_amount_high, high32_out);
    Shifter_Low: entity work.shifter_32bit port map (clk, rst, low32_in, shift_amount_low, low32_out);

    -- Concatenation for Right Logical Shift
    data_out <= high32_out & low32_out;

end architecture;
```

This example utilizes two instances of a fictional `shifter_32bit` entity, representing the 32-bit shifters.  The concatenation operation (`&`) combines the shifted outputs.  This implementation is specifically for a logical right shift.


**Example 2: Arithmetic Right Shift**

```vhdl
architecture behavioral_arithmetic of shifter_64bit is
    -- ... (Signal declarations as in Example 1) ...
    signal sign_bit : std_logic;
begin
    -- ... (Partitioning as in Example 1) ...

    --Sign bit extraction
    sign_bit <= high32_in(31);

    -- 32-bit shifters (replace with actual 32-bit arithmetic shifter instantiation)
    Shifter_High: entity work.arithmetic_shifter_32bit port map (clk, rst, high32_in, shift_amount_high, high32_out);
    Shifter_Low: entity work.arithmetic_shifter_32bit port map (clk, rst, low32_in, shift_amount_low, low32_out);

    -- Concatenation for Arithmetic Right Shift (sign extension)
    data_out <= high32_out & low32_out;

end architecture;
```

The key difference here is the use of an `arithmetic_shifter_32bit` entity and the explicit handling of the sign bit.  The sign bit is replicated to fill the vacated bits in the high32 output.

**Example 3: Left Shift**

```vhdl
architecture behavioral_left of shifter_64bit is
    -- ... (Signal declarations similar to Example 1) ...
    signal shifted_high_low : std_logic_vector(31 downto 0);
begin
    -- ... (Partitioning as in Example 1) ...

    -- 32-bit shifters (replace with actual 32-bit shifter instantiation)
    Shifter_High: entity work.shifter_32bit port map (clk, rst, high32_in, shift_amount_high, high32_out);
    Shifter_Low: entity work.shifter_32bit port map (clk, rst, low32_in, shift_amount_low, low32_out);

   --Shift and combine for left shift.  Note this requires a carefully calculated shift amount.
   shifted_high_low <= high32_out(31-shift_amount_low downto 0);

   --Concatenate for left shift, using multiplexing where appropriate.
   data_out <= high32_out & shifted_high_low;

end architecture;
```

This example focuses on the left shift operation.  The key complexity here lies in correctly handling the data flow between the two shifters.  The left shift requires careful consideration of the shift amount to prevent unintended data loss or corruption. Note that this is a simplified version and proper multiplexing logic might be needed for robustness depending on implementation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further study, I recommend consulting standard texts on digital design and computer architecture.  Focusing on chapters covering register transfer level (RTL) design and advanced combinational logic will be particularly beneficial.  A strong grasp of Boolean algebra and HDL syntax is paramount.  Finally, reviewing material on pipelining and high-speed arithmetic units will provide valuable context for optimizing such designs for performance.
