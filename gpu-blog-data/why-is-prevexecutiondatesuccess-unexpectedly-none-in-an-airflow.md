The `prev_execution_date_success` attribute in an Airflow DAG unexpectedly resolving to `None` typically stems from a lack of successful prior task instance runs, not necessarily a flaw in the DAG's definition.  My experience troubleshooting this, spanning several large-scale data pipelines, points consistently to this root cause.  While seemingly obvious, the nuances of task dependencies, retry mechanisms, and Airflow's internal scheduling logic often obfuscate the true reason.  Therefore, a systematic approach is required for effective diagnosis.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Airflow's `prev_execution_date_success` variable within a DAG's context provides the timestamp of the most recent successful execution of the entire DAG.  Crucially, it considers the *entire* DAG's execution status, not just individual task instances.  If any task within the DAG fails, even with retries enabled, the entire DAG run is considered unsuccessful, rendering `prev_execution_date_success` `None` for subsequent runs.  This behavior is intentional and reflects Airflow's emphasis on data integrity and pipeline reliability.  A single failed task implies potential data corruption or pipeline breakage downstream.  Therefore, Airflow's design prioritizes signaling this failure comprehensively.

Several factors can contribute to this seemingly unexpected `None` value. These include:

* **Task Failures:** The most common cause. Even if individual tasks have retries configured, a failure in *any* task instance during the previous run will lead to `prev_execution_date_success` being `None`.
* **DAG Runs that Never Started:**  If a scheduled DAG run simply didn't launch for any reason (scheduler issues, resource constraints, etc.), there's no previous successful execution to record.
* **Incorrectly configured `start_date`:** If the `start_date` in your DAG definition is set to a future date, there will be no prior successful runs.  This is a common oversight in development and testing environments.
* **External Dependencies:**  Failures in external systems or services that the DAG relies on can also result in task failures and ultimately a `None` value for `prev_execution_date_success`.
* **Airflow Scheduler Issues:** Although less frequent, problems with the Airflow scheduler itself can prevent DAG runs from executing or recording their status correctly.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**


**Example 1:  Illustrating a Simple DAG with Potential for `None` Result:**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
    dag_id='example_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    task1 = BashOperator(
        task_id='task1',
        bash_command='exit 0',  # Successful command
    )
    task2 = BashOperator(
        task_id='task2',
        bash_command='exit 1',  # Failing command
    )

    task1 >> task2

```

In this example, `task2` intentionally fails. Even if `task1` completes successfully, the entire DAG run will be marked as failed because `task2` failed, resulting in `prev_execution_date_success` being `None` in subsequent runs.  Note the use of `catchup=False` to prevent backfilling and focus on understanding the behavior of the current schedule.


**Example 2: Demonstrating Retry Mechanism and its Impact:**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime
from airflow.utils.retries import Retry

with DAG(
    dag_id='retry_example_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    retry_task = BashOperator(
        task_id='retry_task',
        bash_command='exit 1', # Fails initially.  Modify to 'exit 0' to test success.
        retries=3,
        retry_delay=60, #Seconds
        retry_exponential_backoff=False #Disable exponential backoff for simplicity
    )
```

This illustrates a task with retries.  If the `bash_command` consistently fails (returns a non-zero exit code), even with retries, the entire DAG run will fail, leading to `prev_execution_date_success` being `None`.  Adjusting the `bash_command` to `exit 0` allows testing the scenario where the task eventually succeeds.


**Example 3: Handling `prev_execution_date_success` in a DAG:**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def check_previous_run(**kwargs):
    prev_date = kwargs['dag_run'].conf.get('prev_execution_date_success')
    if prev_date:
        print(f"Previous successful execution date: {prev_date}")
    else:
        print("No previous successful execution found.")

with DAG(
    dag_id='handling_prev_date_dag',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval=None,
    catchup=False,
) as dag:
    check_previous = PythonOperator(
        task_id='check_previous',
        python_callable=check_previous_run,
    )

```

This example shows a PythonOperator that directly accesses the `prev_execution_date_success` value within the `dag_run` context.  Remember this value is only available *during* a DAG run; this operator explicitly handles both success and failure cases demonstrating how to appropriately respond. Note that this accesses the value through the context rather than implicitly assuming its existence outside a run.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further study and deeper understanding of Airflow's scheduling mechanism and DAG execution, I recommend consulting the official Airflow documentation.  Pay close attention to the sections on task dependencies, retry strategies, and the scheduler's behavior.  Exploring example DAGs within the Airflow documentation and the community-contributed examples will further solidify your comprehension. Understanding the Airflow task instance state transitions is critical. Finally, reviewing logging mechanisms within Airflow for both the scheduler and individual tasks will significantly assist in troubleshooting.
