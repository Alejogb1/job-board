The discrepancy between the shape of your mask and your indexed tensor stems fundamentally from a misunderstanding of broadcasting rules within the context of NumPy array manipulation and tensor indexing, particularly when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays and boolean indexing.  In my experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous image processing and machine learning projects, this often arises from implicit assumptions about array dimensions and their alignment during indexing operations.  The core problem usually lies in either the dimensions of the mask not aligning correctly with the dimensions of the tensor you're indexing, or an incorrect application of boolean indexing.

Let's clarify with a systematic breakdown.  First, ensure you have a clear understanding of your array shapes. The shape of a NumPy array or PyTorch tensor is represented as a tuple, where each element denotes the size of the corresponding dimension.  For example, `(3, 28, 28)` represents a tensor with three channels, each being a 28x28 matrix.  Inconsistencies in the number of dimensions or the size of specific dimensions are the most common cause of shape mismatch errors.


**1. Explanation of the Shape Mismatch:**

The shape mismatch problem originates from a fundamental rule: the mask must be broadcastable to the dimensions of the tensor it is applied to.  Broadcasting involves expanding the dimensions of a smaller array to match the dimensions of a larger array implicitly.  This occurs seamlessly in many cases, leading to unexpected errors when not carefully considered.  For example, if your tensor has a shape of (100, 32, 32), meaning 100 samples with 32x32 features, a mask with the shape (100,) *cannot* directly index it. It can only index along the first dimension, selecting entire 32x32 feature maps.  A mask to select individual pixels would need a shape of (100, 32, 32). This broadcasting rule is often the source of confusion, especially when working with multi-channel data (images) or tensors with batch dimensions.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Broadcasting**

```python
import numpy as np

tensor = np.random.rand(10, 3, 4)  # Shape: (10, 3, 4)
mask = np.array([True, False, True, False]) # Shape: (4,)

# Broadcasting happens here: mask is expanded to (10, 3, 4) implicitly
masked_tensor = tensor[mask] #Correct usage - note it selects along the last dimension here.

print("Tensor shape:", tensor.shape)
print("Mask shape:", mask.shape)
print("Masked tensor shape:", masked_tensor.shape)
```

This example demonstrates correct broadcasting along the last dimension. The `mask` with shape (4,) is implicitly expanded to match the last dimension of the tensor, resulting in a selection of elements along that dimension. However, notice that the output shape reflects only the remaining dimensions.

**Example 2: Incorrect Broadcasting Leading to Shape Mismatch**

```python
import numpy as np

tensor = np.random.rand(10, 3, 4)  # Shape: (10, 3, 4)
mask = np.array([[True, False, True], [False, True, False]]) # Shape: (2, 3)

try:
    masked_tensor = tensor[mask]
except IndexError as e:
    print("Error:", e) #Error is raised here due to the shape mismatch
    print("Tensor shape:", tensor.shape)
    print("Mask shape:", mask.shape)

```

This code illustrates an error caused by incorrect broadcasting.  The mask's shape (2, 3) cannot be broadcast to match the (10, 3, 4) shape of the tensor. The attempt results in an `IndexError`.


**Example 3: Correct Indexing with Multi-Dimensional Mask**

```python
import numpy as np

tensor = np.random.rand(2, 3, 4)  # Shape: (2, 3, 4)
mask = np.random.choice([True, False], size=(2, 3, 4)) # Shape: (2, 3, 4) -  a boolean mask of the same shape as the tensor.

masked_tensor = tensor[mask]
print("Tensor shape:", tensor.shape)
print("Mask shape:", mask.shape)
print("Masked tensor shape:", masked_tensor.shape) # This will be (N,) where N is the number of True values in the mask.
```

This example showcases correct use of a multi-dimensional boolean mask, where the mask shape exactly matches the tensor shape, allowing for element-wise selection.  Note that the resulting `masked_tensor` will be one-dimensional, containing only the elements where the mask is `True`.  This is because boolean indexing selects elements based on the boolean values of the mask.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official documentation for NumPy and any relevant deep learning framework you are using (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).  Pay close attention to sections covering array indexing, broadcasting, and boolean indexing. Carefully examine examples provided in the documentation to understand how broadcasting works in different scenarios.  Review tutorials and guides on multi-dimensional array manipulation techniques.  Focus particularly on understanding how to create and utilize boolean masks correctly for selecting specific elements within your arrays and tensors. Understanding these core concepts will eliminate a vast majority of shape mismatch problems. Mastering these concepts is critical for effective data manipulation and model building in various computational contexts.  Always verify your array shapes throughout your code to avoid these common pitfalls.
