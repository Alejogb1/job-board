GradientTape returning `None` for gradients within a recurrent neural network (RNN) in TensorFlow 2.0 typically points to a disconnection between the loss calculation and the trainable variables within the RNN’s context, specifically concerning how these variables are accessed and utilized during the forward pass inside the tape. This isn't an inherent flaw of `GradientTape` or RNNs, but rather a consequence of how TensorFlow tracks differentiable operations. I've encountered this issue multiple times when building custom RNN cells and found a systematic approach essential to resolve.

The core issue stems from the dynamic nature of RNN execution. While static graph computations, common in TensorFlow 1.x, implicitly establish a direct relationship between operations and variables, the eager execution environment of TensorFlow 2.0 necessitates explicit tracking through the `GradientTape`. Operations performed outside the tape’s context or on tensors not derived from tracked variables break this chain, effectively stopping the flow of gradients.

Specifically, the RNN's internal hidden state, which is passed between time steps and often initialized outside the tape’s context using `tf.zeros` or similar functions, can become detached. If, during the forward pass, the RNN cell interacts with an untracked hidden state in a way that isn't recorded by the `GradientTape`, the computational path to the RNN’s trainable weights gets lost, leading to `None` gradients for the RNN’s parameters. This detachment often manifests when the initial hidden state is not derived from `tf.Variable`, or when it’s improperly manipulated by operations outside the tape or that aren't differentiable. The tape watches operations on tensors; the `tf.Variable` is the tensor of the parameters. If there is a disconnect, the gradient isn’t propagated through the chain. The same can happen to input sequences if they are pre-processed, and those operations aren’t tracked in the `GradientTape`.

Furthermore, in many circumstances, RNN models may rely on `tf.data` pipelines for input data. While this can make data feeding significantly more efficient, data preprocessing transformations, if not performed within the tape’s context, can also disconnect the gradient flow. This typically happens when the input data is not a `tf.Variable` or not subject to a series of operations registered by the tape.

Let's examine this with concrete examples.

**Example 1: Incorrect Initialization of the Hidden State**

Consider a simplified custom RNN cell where the initial hidden state is initialized outside the `GradientTape` and treated as a non-variable:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleRNNCell(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(SimpleRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(2 * units, units), initializer='random_normal')

    def call(self, inputs, states):
      prev_output = states[0]
      concat_input = tf.concat([inputs, prev_output], axis=1)
      output = tf.tanh(tf.matmul(concat_input, self.kernel))
      return output, [output]

class MyRNN(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(MyRNN, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.cell = SimpleRNNCell(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
      batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[0]
      seq_length = tf.shape(inputs)[1]
      hidden_state = tf.zeros([batch_size, self.cell.units]) # Initialization outside the gradient tape
      
      outputs = tf.TensorArray(dtype=tf.float32, size=seq_length)

      for i in tf.range(seq_length):
        current_input = inputs[:, i, :]
        hidden_state, states = self.cell(current_input, [hidden_state])
        outputs = outputs.write(i, hidden_state)
      
      return tf.transpose(outputs.stack(), perm=[1, 0, 2])

# Dummy data and setup
model = MyRNN(units=64)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
inputs = tf.random.normal([32, 20, 128])
targets = tf.random.normal([32, 20, 64])

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  predictions = model(inputs)
  loss = loss_fn(targets, predictions)
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

for grad in gradients:
  if grad is None:
    print("Found a None gradient") #This will be printed

```

In this code, the hidden state is initialized with `tf.zeros` outside of the `GradientTape`. Consequently, the backward pass fails to establish the required links, and the tape cannot propagate the gradients to the model's weights.

**Example 2: Corrected Hidden State Initialization Using `tf.Variable`**

The solution is to introduce a trainable variable for the initial hidden state, allowing the tape to track its influence:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleRNNCell(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(SimpleRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(2 * units, units), initializer='random_normal')

    def call(self, inputs, states):
      prev_output = states[0]
      concat_input = tf.concat([inputs, prev_output], axis=1)
      output = tf.tanh(tf.matmul(concat_input, self.kernel))
      return output, [output]

class MyRNN(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(MyRNN, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.cell = SimpleRNNCell(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
      batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[0]
      seq_length = tf.shape(inputs)[1]
      self.initial_state = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, self.cell.units])) # Initialization with Variable
      hidden_state = tf.tile(self.initial_state, [batch_size, 1]) # Tile for the batch
      
      outputs = tf.TensorArray(dtype=tf.float32, size=seq_length)

      for i in tf.range(seq_length):
        current_input = inputs[:, i, :]
        hidden_state, states = self.cell(current_input, [hidden_state])
        outputs = outputs.write(i, hidden_state)
      
      return tf.transpose(outputs.stack(), perm=[1, 0, 2])

# Dummy data and setup
model = MyRNN(units=64)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
inputs = tf.random.normal([32, 20, 128])
targets = tf.random.normal([32, 20, 64])

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  predictions = model(inputs)
  loss = loss_fn(targets, predictions)
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

for grad in gradients:
  if grad is None:
    print("Found a None gradient") #This will not be printed
```

By declaring `self.initial_state` as a `tf.Variable`, and making sure it is utilized in the forward pass by creating a batch specific copy from it, the gradient can properly flow through the operations to the trainable parameters.  This allows the gradient tape to register the operations on the hidden state and propagate the gradients correctly during the backward pass.

**Example 3: Input Data Preprocessing within the Tape**

The same issue can arise with data preprocessing. If preprocessing operations are performed outside of the `GradientTape` context, gradients might not be computed correctly for earlier parts of the network if preprocessing also involves trainable parameters.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Dummy Data
inputs = tf.random.normal([32, 20, 128])
targets = tf.random.normal([32, 20, 64])

#Preprocessing outside tape
mean_input = tf.reduce_mean(inputs, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
normalized_inputs = (inputs - mean_input)

class SimpleRNNCell(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(SimpleRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(2 * units, units), initializer='random_normal')

    def call(self, inputs, states):
      prev_output = states[0]
      concat_input = tf.concat([inputs, prev_output], axis=1)
      output = tf.tanh(tf.matmul(concat_input, self.kernel))
      return output, [output]

class MyRNN(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(MyRNN, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.cell = SimpleRNNCell(units)

    def call(self, inputs):
      batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[0]
      seq_length = tf.shape(inputs)[1]
      self.initial_state = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, self.cell.units]))
      hidden_state = tf.tile(self.initial_state, [batch_size, 1])
      
      outputs = tf.TensorArray(dtype=tf.float32, size=seq_length)

      for i in tf.range(seq_length):
        current_input = inputs[:, i, :]
        hidden_state, states = self.cell(current_input, [hidden_state])
        outputs = outputs.write(i, hidden_state)
      
      return tf.transpose(outputs.stack(), perm=[1, 0, 2])


# Setup
model = MyRNN(units=64)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  # Preprocessing inside the tape this time, with the correct use of the inputs
    mean_input = tf.reduce_mean(inputs, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    normalized_inputs = (inputs - mean_input)
    predictions = model(normalized_inputs)
    loss = loss_fn(targets, predictions)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)


for grad in gradients:
  if grad is None:
     print("Found a None gradient") # This won't be printed in the corrected implementation

```

In this example, moving preprocessing operations into the gradient tape assures the gradients propagate correctly through this part of the network if needed. This ensures all relevant operations on the input and parameters are tracked by the tape, allowing the calculation of gradients for model weights. The use of inputs inside the `GradientTape` makes sure those operations are tracked.

In summary, `GradientTape` issues when utilizing RNNs stem from disconnections in the differentiable operations graph caused by how hidden states are initialized and treated, and how input data is preprocessed. It is crucial to ensure that all operations influencing trainable variables and the flow of information are tracked by the `GradientTape`. Always initialize internal states using `tf.Variable` or ensure operations on initial state and inputs are performed within the `GradientTape` context and if preprocessing transformations involve trainable parameters, those operations need to occur inside the tape. Doing so facilitates the proper propagation of gradients during backpropagation, ultimately resolving the `None` gradient issue. This requires meticulous understanding of how TensorFlow traces operations.

For further learning I would recommend carefully reviewing the TensorFlow documentation regarding `tf.GradientTape`, particularly the sections on Eager Execution and custom training loops.  Also, exploring the source code of pre-built RNN models within the `tf.keras` API will reveal how they approach state management, variable tracking, and data input transformations. Finally, implementing a variety of simple, custom RNN cells and models and observing how gradients behave will provide valuable insight and strengthen your skills.
