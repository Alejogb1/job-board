The core issue with `EOFException` during `DataInputStream` processing isn't solely about the last line; it's fundamentally about anticipating the end of the stream.  Treating the last line differently requires a shift from assuming continuous data to explicitly managing potential stream termination. My experience debugging embedded systems data logging revealed this clearly: robust handling necessitates a proactive approach, not reactive exception catching.  Failing to do so leads to unpredictable behavior, especially crucial in resource-constrained environments.  Directly catching the exception is brittle and prone to masking other, more serious, underlying issues.

The solution rests on predictive data parsing, verifying the availability of data before attempting to read it. This involves employing a mechanism to ascertain the stream's end before initiating read operations that depend on subsequent data.  The method I found most reliable leveraged the `available()` method of the `InputStream` class, although this needs careful consideration, as its return value is not necessarily a definitive indicator of the remaining bytes in a network stream.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `available()` method, inherited by `DataInputStream`, provides an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read *without blocking*.  Crucially, this *does not* guarantee the presence of a complete data unit.  A value greater than zero suggests data is readily available, but it doesn't guarantee a full line or record.  Before reading a line from a `DataInputStream`, check `available()`. If it's zero or less,  the stream is likely exhausted, avoiding the `EOFException`.

This approach fundamentally changes how you process the data.  Instead of iterating until an exception is caught,  you iterate *while* data is available, using `available()` as the loop condition. This allows for controlled termination and cleaner error handling.  After the loop, you've processed all available data and don't encounter the unexpected `EOFException` at the file's end because you haven't attempted a read operation when no data exists.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Robust Line-by-Line Reading:**

```java
import java.io.*;

public class DataInputStreamHandler {

    public static void processData(String filePath) {
        try (DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream(filePath))) {
            while (dis.available() > 0) {
                try {
                    String line = dis.readLine();
                    // Process the line
                    System.out.println("Processed line: " + line);
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    // Handle specific IO exceptions other than EOF, e.g., corrupted data.
                    System.err.println("IO Error: " + e.getMessage());
                    // Implement appropriate recovery strategy or termination
                    break; // Or use other methods to handle the failure.
                }
            }
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.err.println("File not found: " + e.getMessage());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error opening or closing stream: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        processData("data.txt");
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates safe processing. The `while` loop continues only as long as data is available, removing the need for explicit `EOFException` handling. The `try-catch` block within the loop manages other potential `IOException` instances. The outer `try-with-resources` ensures proper stream closure.


**Example 2:  Handling Fixed-Length Records:**

```java
import java.io.*;

public class FixedLengthRecords {

    public static void processFixedLengthRecords(String filePath, int recordLength) {
        try (DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream(filePath))) {
            while (dis.available() >= recordLength) {
                byte[] record = new byte[recordLength];
                dis.readFully(record);
                String recordString = new String(record, "UTF-8"); //Adjust encoding as needed
                //Process the record.
                System.out.println("Processed record: " + recordString);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        processFixedLengthRecords("fixed_length.dat", 10);
    }
}
```

This example is tailored for fixed-length records, ensuring that a complete record is read before processing. The `readFully()` method requires a sufficient number of bytes, failing gracefully when not enough data is available.


**Example 3:  Reading with a Custom Delimiter:**

```java
import java.io.*;

public class DelimitedData {

    public static void processDelimitedData(String filePath, String delimiter) {
        try (DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream(filePath))) {
            StringBuilder currentRecord = new StringBuilder();
            int availableBytes;
            while ((availableBytes = dis.available()) > 0) {
                byte[] buffer = new byte[Math.min(availableBytes, 1024)]; // Read in chunks
                int bytesRead = dis.read(buffer);
                String chunk = new String(buffer, 0, bytesRead, "UTF-8"); //Adjust encoding as needed
                currentRecord.append(chunk);

                int delimiterIndex = currentRecord.indexOf(delimiter);
                while (delimiterIndex != -1) {
                    String record = currentRecord.substring(0, delimiterIndex);
                    // Process the record.
                    System.out.println("Processed record: " + record);
                    currentRecord.delete(0, delimiterIndex + delimiter.length());
                    delimiterIndex = currentRecord.indexOf(delimiter);
                }
            }
            if (currentRecord.length() > 0) {
                //Handle the last record without delimiter if any.
                System.out.println("Processed last record: "+ currentRecord.toString());
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        processDelimitedData("data_delim.txt", "|");
    }
}
```

This example utilizes a custom delimiter, reading data in chunks to avoid excessive memory usage. It handles both complete records and the potential for a trailing record without a delimiter.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch, "Java Concurrency in Practice" by Brian Goetz et al.,  "Java I/O" by Elliotte Rusty Harold.  These provide comprehensive knowledge of Java's I/O and exception-handling mechanisms, fostering robust and efficient coding practices.  Understanding streams and proper resource management is paramount in preventing issues related to `EOFException` and other I/O related issues.  Furthermore, consulting the official Java documentation remains essential for detailed information on class methods and their behavior.
