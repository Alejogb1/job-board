The core challenge in feeding multivariate data to a PyTorch linear layer lies in understanding the expected input tensor shape.  A linear layer, at its heart, performs a matrix multiplication of the input and its weights, followed by an addition of a bias vector.  This inherently necessitates a specific tensor structure: the input must be a two-dimensional tensor where the first dimension represents the batch size, and the second dimension corresponds to the number of features.  Failure to adhere to this structure results in shape mismatches and runtime errors.  My experience debugging numerous deep learning models has underscored this point repeatedly.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's `nn.Linear` layer expects an input tensor of shape `(batch_size, input_features)`.  Let's break this down:

* **`batch_size`**: This represents the number of independent samples in your input. For example, if you're processing 100 images, `batch_size` would be 100.
* **`input_features`**: This represents the dimensionality of a single sample.  In multivariate data, this is the number of features or variables per sample.  If each sample is a vector with 5 features (e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, precipitation), then `input_features` would be 5.

Critically, the data should *not* be presented as a three-dimensional or higher-order tensor unless specific operations like reshaping are performed beforehand.  Attempting to directly feed a tensor of shape `(batch_size, time_steps, input_features)` (common in time series data) without appropriate pre-processing will lead to an error.  Similarly, a single sample represented as a one-dimensional array (`(input_features,)`) is also incompatible.

The linear layer itself is defined by its weight matrix (shape `(input_features, output_features)`) and a bias vector (shape `(output_features,)`). The matrix multiplication between the input tensor and the weight matrix ensures each feature contributes to the output. The bias vector adds an offset to the output for each output feature.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Multivariate Data**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Sample data: 10 samples, each with 3 features
data = torch.randn(10, 3)

# Linear layer with 3 input features and 2 output features
linear_layer = nn.Linear(3, 2)

# Forward pass
output = linear_layer(data)
print(output.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([10, 2])
```

This example showcases the straightforward case where the data is already in the correct format.  The `torch.randn(10, 3)` generates 10 random samples, each with 3 features.  The linear layer is initialized with 3 input features to match the data, and it produces an output tensor with 2 features. The output shape `(10, 2)` confirms the successful processing of the multivariate data.

**Example 2: Reshaping Data from a List of Lists**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Sample data: List of lists representing 5 samples with 4 features each
data_list = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16], [17, 18, 19, 20]]

# Convert list of lists to a PyTorch tensor
data_tensor = torch.tensor(data_list, dtype=torch.float32)

# Reshape to (batch_size, input_features) if necessary
data_tensor = data_tensor.view(-1, 4)

# Linear layer with 4 input features and 1 output feature
linear_layer = nn.Linear(4, 1)

# Forward pass
output = linear_layer(data_tensor)
print(output.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([5, 1])
```

This example demonstrates how to handle data initially stored as a list of lists. The `torch.tensor()` function converts the list into a tensor. The crucial step is the `view(-1, 4)` function, which reshapes the tensor into the required format.  `-1` automatically calculates the batch size based on the total number of elements and the specified number of features (4).


**Example 3: Handling Time Series Data**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Sample time series data: 2 samples, 5 time steps, 2 features
data = torch.randn(2, 5, 2)

# Reshape for linear layer
data_reshaped = data.view(-1, 2) # Flattens time steps into batch

# Linear layer
linear_layer = nn.Linear(2, 1)

# Forward pass
output = linear_layer(data_reshaped)
print(output.shape) # Output: torch.Size([10, 1])
```

This example deals with a common scenario in time series analysis. The initial data has three dimensions (batch, time steps, features).  A simple linear layer cannot directly handle this.  The key is to reshape the tensor using `.view(-1, 2)` before passing it to the linear layer. This effectively flattens the time dimension into the batch dimension, treating each time step as a separate sample. This is suitable if each time step is treated as an independent observation.  Note that this approach loses temporal information.  Recurrent neural networks are more appropriate for handling temporal dependencies.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I strongly recommend thoroughly reviewing the official PyTorch documentation on the `nn.Linear` module and tensor manipulation functions.  Pay particular attention to the sections on tensor shapes and reshaping operations.  Furthermore, studying introductory materials on linear algebra will solidify your understanding of matrix multiplication and its role within the linear layer.  Exploring resources on multivariate statistical analysis can provide context on the nature and treatment of multivariate datasets.  Finally, working through several tutorials and examples focusing on implementing linear models in PyTorch is invaluable for practical application and problem-solving.
