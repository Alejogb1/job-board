The core distinction between `tf.FixedLenFeature`, `tf.VarLenFeature`, and `tf.FixedLenSequenceFeature` in TensorFlow 1.10 lies in how they handle the shape and length of the features within a `tf.Example` protocol buffer.  This directly impacts how you parse and process data, particularly when dealing with variable-length sequences.  My experience working on large-scale NLP projects, specifically named entity recognition and sentiment analysis, underscored the importance of choosing the correct feature type for optimal performance and data integrity.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

These three functions are all used within `tf.parse_single_example` or `tf.parse_example` to define how features are extracted from a `tf.Example` proto.  The crucial difference centers on the expected dimensionality and length of the feature values:

* **`tf.FixedLenFeature(shape, dtype, default_value)`:**  This expects a feature with a *fixed* shape and length.  `shape` defines the expected dimensions (e.g., `[5]` for a 5-element vector, `[3, 4]` for a 3x4 matrix). `dtype` specifies the data type (e.g., `tf.int64`, `tf.float32`, `tf.string`). `default_value` provides a fallback value if the feature is missing in the `tf.Example`.  Crucially, if the feature exists but doesn't match the specified shape, an error will occur.  This is ideal for features with consistently structured data, such as pre-defined numerical feature vectors.

* **`tf.VarLenFeature(dtype)`:** This handles features with *variable* lengths.  Instead of a fixed shape, it accepts sequences of varying lengths.  `dtype` specifies the data type of the elements within the sequence.  The parser returns a `SparseTensor`, which efficiently stores the values, indices, and dense shape of the variable-length feature. This is essential for text processing where sentences or sequences have varying lengths. The absence of a shape parameter makes it suitable for irregularly shaped input data.

* **`tf.FixedLenSequenceFeature(shape, dtype, allow_missing=False, default_value=None)`:** This represents a sequence of fixed-length vectors. Each element in the sequence has the same fixed shape defined by `shape`.  `dtype` specifies the data type. The `allow_missing` parameter determines whether missing sequences are allowed; if `False` (the default) and a sequence is absent, an error is raised. `default_value` provides a fallback value when a feature is missing.  Unlike `tf.FixedLenFeature`, which defines the overall shape, `tf.FixedLenSequenceFeature` defines the shape of each element *within* the sequence.  This is useful for scenarios involving sequences of fixed-length vectors, such as time series data or image sequences.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: `tf.FixedLenFeature`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example tf.Example proto
example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={
    'feature1': tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])),
    'feature2': tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]))
}))

# Define feature description
feature_description = {
    'feature1': tf.FixedLenFeature([5], tf.int64),
    'feature2': tf.FixedLenFeature([3], tf.float32)
}

# Parse the example
parsed_example = tf.parse_single_example(example.SerializeToString(), feature_description)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(parsed_example)
    print(result) # Output: {'feature1': array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), 'feature2': array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], dtype=float32)}

```
This example shows how `tf.FixedLenFeature` parses features with predefined shapes.  An error would occur if `feature1` had fewer or more than 5 elements or if `feature2` had anything other than 3 floating-point values.


**Example 2: `tf.VarLenFeature`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={
    'words': tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[1, 2, 3, 4]))
}))

feature_description = {
    'words': tf.VarLenFeature(tf.int64)
}

parsed_example = tf.parse_single_example(example.SerializeToString(), feature_description)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(parsed_example)
    print(result) # Output: {'words': <tensorflow.python.framework.sparse_tensor.SparseTensor object at 0x...>}

# Accessing SparseTensor values
indices = result['words'].indices
values = result['words'].values
dense_shape = result['words'].dense_shape

print("Indices:", indices) #e.g., [[0 0], [0 1], [0 2], [0 3]]
print("Values:", values) #e.g., [1 2 3 4]
print("Dense Shape:", dense_shape) #e.g., [1 4]

```
This demonstrates the use of `tf.VarLenFeature` for a variable-length sequence of integers. The output is a `SparseTensor`, which needs to be handled accordingly using its `indices`, `values`, and `dense_shape` attributes.


**Example 3: `tf.FixedLenSequenceFeature`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={
    'sequences': tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]))
}))

feature_description = {
    'sequences': tf.FixedLenSequenceFeature([2], tf.float32, allow_missing=False)
}


parsed_example = tf.parse_single_example(example.SerializeToString(), feature_description)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(parsed_example)
    print(result) # Output: {'sequences': array([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.8], [0.9, 1. ]], dtype=float32)}
```

This illustrates the parsing of a sequence of fixed-length vectors using `tf.FixedLenSequenceFeature`. Each element in the `sequences` feature is a 2-element vector.  If the input did not have a length divisible by 2, or if the `allow_missing` parameter were `False` and the feature were missing, an error would have resulted.  The `allow_missing` parameter is important in cases where features might be missing in certain examples.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation (specifically the sections on `tf.Example` and data input pipelines).  Furthermore, I found the TensorFlow guide on input pipelines exceptionally helpful in developing efficient data loading strategies.  A thorough understanding of the `SparseTensor` data structure is also critical when working with variable-length features.  Finally, reviewing examples from established TensorFlow projects that handle variable-length sequences is invaluable.  This practical experience helped solidify my understanding of these feature types.
