Calculating partial derivatives within PyTorch leverages the library's automatic differentiation capabilities, eliminating the need for manual derivation.  My experience working on large-scale neural network optimization projects heavily relied on this feature; understanding its nuances is crucial for efficient gradient-based training.  The core functionality hinges on the `torch.autograd` package and its ability to track computational graphs.  Let's explore this in detail.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's automatic differentiation operates through a computational graph. Each tensor involved in a calculation is implicitly tracked, forming nodes in this graph.  Edges represent the operations performed on these tensors.  When `requires_grad=True` is set for a tensor, PyTorch begins tracking its operations. This allows for the efficient computation of gradients using backpropagation.  The `backward()` method initiates this process, calculating gradients with respect to all tensors with `requires_grad=True`.  The gradients are then accumulated in the `.grad` attribute of each such tensor.

Importantly, PyTorch uses a reverse-mode automatic differentiation approach.  This means the gradients are computed by traversing the computational graph backward, starting from the final output and propagating gradients through each operation according to the chain rule.  This approach is particularly efficient for functions with many inputs and a smaller number of outputs, a common scenario in machine learning.  The computational graph is dynamically constructed and discarded after gradient calculation, optimizing memory usage.  However, for complex models or specific optimization scenarios, understanding the nuances of graph construction and the impact of in-place operations is essential to avoid unexpected behavior.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Scalar Function:**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor(3.0, requires_grad=True)

z = x**2 + y**3

z.backward()

print(f"dz/dx: {x.grad}")  # Output: dz/dx: 4.0
print(f"dz/dy: {y.grad}")  # Output: dz/dy: 27.0
```

This example demonstrates the basic application. We define two tensors, `x` and `y`, with `requires_grad=True`.  The function `z = x**2 + y**3` is then computed.  Calling `z.backward()` automatically computes the partial derivatives ∂z/∂x and ∂z/∂y, which are stored in `x.grad` and `y.grad` respectively.  The results accurately reflect the application of the power rule of differentiation.


**Example 2: Vector-valued Function:**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([1.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)

z = torch.sum(x * y) # Dot product

z.backward()

print(f"dz/dx: {x.grad}")  # Output: dz/dx: tensor([1., 4.])
print(f"dz/dy: {y.grad}")  # Output: dz/dy: tensor([2., 3.])
```

This illustrates partial derivatives with respect to vector inputs.  The dot product of `x` and `y` is calculated.  `z.backward()` computes the gradient of `z` with respect to each element of `x` and `y`.  The result correctly shows the partial derivatives representing the components of the gradient vector.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Outputs and Jacobian:**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([1.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)

z1 = x * y
z2 = x + y

gradients = torch.autograd.grad(outputs=[z1, z2], inputs=[x, y], create_graph=True)

print(f"Jacobian (dz1/dx, dz1/dy, dz2/dx, dz2/dy): {gradients}")


```

Here, we deal with a multi-output scenario. `z1` and `z2` represent two different functions of `x` and `y`.   `torch.autograd.grad` is used explicitly to compute the gradients.  `create_graph=True` is set if further differentiation (higher-order derivatives) is needed.  The output shows a tuple of gradients, effectively representing the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian expresses how small changes in input variables affect the output variables.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* PyTorch Documentation: The official documentation is comprehensive and covers all aspects of automatic differentiation in detail. It offers numerous examples and explanations tailored to various use cases.

*  Deep Learning Textbooks:  Several excellent deep learning textbooks delve deeply into the theoretical underpinnings of automatic differentiation and its applications in training neural networks.  These provide a strong foundation to build upon.

*  Advanced PyTorch Tutorials: Many online resources offer in-depth tutorials on advanced topics within PyTorch, including custom gradient implementations, optimization techniques, and memory management strategies for large-scale applications.



In summary, PyTorch provides a highly efficient and streamlined method for computing partial derivatives through its automatic differentiation framework.  By leveraging `requires_grad=True`, `backward()`, and understanding the underlying computational graph, one can easily compute gradients for a wide range of functions, even complex, multi-variable scenarios.  Careful attention to in-place operations and the `create_graph` parameter is critical for avoiding pitfalls and optimizing performance, especially in more advanced applications. My years of experience reinforce the importance of a solid theoretical understanding combined with the practical application of these tools for effective development and troubleshooting in deep learning projects.
