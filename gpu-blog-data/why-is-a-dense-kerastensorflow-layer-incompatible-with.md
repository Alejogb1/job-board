A fundamental misunderstanding of tensor dimensions often leads to incompatibility issues between Keras dense layers and input shapes, particularly when encountering an input size like 64. Specifically, the core issue isn't the number 64 itself, but rather the rank of the input tensor implicitly expected by a dense layer and how that contrasts with an input tensor of rank one when an input size of 64 is presented directly.

A Keras `Dense` layer, at its heart, performs an affine transformation: a matrix multiplication followed by the addition of a bias vector. This operation is designed for inputs that are, at a minimum, rank-2 tensors; think of it as batches of input vectors. The `Dense` layer implicitly operates on the last dimension of the input tensor, considering all preceding dimensions to represent the batch size. When a user feeds in an input shape of 64 (implicitly as a one-dimensional tensor), the dense layer fails because it expects the final dimension to have the length of 64 when no batch dimension is provided, not the entire input to be a 64-long vector. Therefore, we are facing a rank mismatch.

Let me clarify this with an experience. Several years ago, while building a protein sequence classifier, I encountered this very error. I had extracted 64 features from each protein and tried feeding that directly into a `Dense` layer, thinking it would handle the single input vector. However, Keras threw shape mismatch exceptions because it was expecting a batch dimension. I had implicitly created a 1D tensor as my input, where the dense layer expected a 2D tensor, at a minimum. The error arose because my model assumed my input was a single batch element and used the 64 length for multiplication in the matrix operation.

To understand this more concretely, consider how a `Dense` layer computes the output. If an input of shape `(batch_size, input_dim)` is provided and the `Dense` layer has `units` output dimensions, then, without activation functions for brevity, the operation performed is mathematically represented as:

`output = input * kernel + bias`

Here, `input` is a matrix of shape `(batch_size, input_dim)`, `kernel` is a matrix of shape `(input_dim, units)`, and `bias` is a vector of shape `(units)`. The matrix multiplication requires compatibility: the inner dimensions must match. Consequently, the output will have a shape of `(batch_size, units)`. The fundamental requirement is the presence of a rank 2 (or higher) input to properly form the matrix multiplication.

Letâ€™s consider examples demonstrating this concept.

**Example 1: The Error Scenario**

In this initial snippet, we directly feed a 1-dimensional input to a `Dense` layer, mimicking the error scenario.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Incorrect input shape: (64)
input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(64,))

# Create a Dense layer with 10 output units
dense_layer = keras.layers.Dense(units=10)

try:
  # Attempt to apply the dense layer - will cause error
  output = dense_layer(input_data)
  print("Output Shape:", output.shape) #This line will not execute
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
  print("Error:", e)
```

Here, `input_data` is a 1D tensor. The `Dense` layer expects a 2D tensor (or a higher rank tensor where the last dimension corresponds to the input features). Running this results in a `InvalidArgumentError` due to the rank mismatch. TensorFlow essentially recognizes that it can not perform an affine transformation due to the mismatch of dimensions in the dot product.

**Example 2: The Correct Approach with Batch Dimension**

To rectify the situation, we need to add the appropriate batch dimension. This means we will modify the input data into a 2D tensor by using a rank 2 structure where the first dimension is batch and the second dimension is the input features.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Correct input shape: (1, 64) - Adds a batch dimension
input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 64))

# Create a Dense layer with 10 output units
dense_layer = keras.layers.Dense(units=10)

# Apply the dense layer
output = dense_layer(input_data)
print("Output Shape:", output.shape)
```
In this example, we have modified `input_data` into a rank two tensor where its shape is `(1, 64)`. The first dimension, with a value of one, now represents the batch size, and the second dimension, which has length 64, represents the feature vector. Now, the dense layer can now correctly apply the affine transformation.  The resulting `output` will be a 2D tensor with shape `(1, 10)`, where `10` corresponds to the number of units (output features) in the `Dense` layer. The kernel will have a shape of `(64, 10)`.

**Example 3: Handling Multiple Batches**

The batch size does not have to be one. The `Dense` layer can handle multiple batches without any issues, as long as the input is a minimum of 2 dimensions, and the last dimension is compatible.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Input shape: (32, 64) - 32 batches of 64-dimensional vectors
input_data = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 64))

# Create a Dense layer with 10 output units
dense_layer = keras.layers.Dense(units=10)

# Apply the dense layer
output = dense_layer(input_data)
print("Output Shape:", output.shape)
```

In this case, the input data is a 2D tensor with shape `(32, 64)`.  The first dimension is the batch size, set to 32, and the second dimension is the feature vector of length 64, matching what we've previously demonstrated.  After passing it through the Dense layer, the output will have the shape `(32, 10)`. The `Dense` layer performed a separate matrix transformation on every input vector within the 32-element batch.

In summary, the fundamental issue is not with the size 64, but with the dimensionality of the input tensors. The `Dense` layer expects at least a rank 2 tensor, while a single shape of 64 results in a rank 1 tensor. By explicitly adding a batch dimension, one can satisfy the `Dense` layer's requirements and eliminate shape-related errors.

For further understanding, I recommend researching the following concepts: the concept of tensor rank and shape, how matrix multiplication works and its requirements, batch processing, and the basic architecture of fully connected neural networks. A strong foundational knowledge of linear algebra and tensor operations will prove useful in troubleshooting similar issues within neural networks. Resources focusing on the Keras documentation for `Dense` layers, combined with fundamental explanations of how matrix transformations are utilized in neural networks, will also prove invaluable.
