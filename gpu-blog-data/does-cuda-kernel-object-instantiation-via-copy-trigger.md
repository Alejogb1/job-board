The instantiation of CUDA kernel objects via copy, specifically using `cudaMemcpy` to duplicate a kernel's binary image into device memory, does not inherently trigger premature memory release of the original kernel.  However, the interplay between kernel lifetime management, memory allocation strategies, and potential driver optimizations can lead to seemingly premature release behaviors, often masked by the asynchronous nature of CUDA execution.  My experience debugging performance issues in high-throughput image processing applications has revealed this subtlety.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

CUDA kernel execution hinges on loading the kernel's binary into device memory.  While a direct copy of the kernel image using `cudaMemcpy` might seem redundant given the implicit loading during compilation and execution, it's crucial to understand that the underlying mechanisms differ.  The CUDA driver handles kernel compilation and loading, optimizing this process for various factors including the device architecture and available memory.  This initial loading populates the kernel image in a driver-managed area, not necessarily directly accessible via CUDA APIs.  A `cudaMemcpy` operation creates a *new* copy, explicitly placed within a user-specified location in device memory.  This new copy is under direct control of the application.

Premature release isn't directly caused by the copy itself.  Instead, it's often an indirect consequence.  If the original kernel image (the driver-managed copy) is deemed no longer necessary by the driver after the `cudaMemcpy` operation, and if the driver's memory management aggressively reclaims space,  the original might be released earlier than expected, even before the copied kernel finishes execution.  This is largely contingent on the driver's internal heuristics, which prioritize efficiency.  Additionally, the user's explicit deallocation of memory associated with the copied kernel using `cudaFree` *will not* affect the driver-managed copy.  The driver retains responsibility for the original until it deems it unnecessary.


Crucially,  observing seemingly premature release usually stems from misinterpretations regarding kernel lifetime and memory ownership.  One might assume that the copied kernel will persist as long as the user-allocated memory block it occupies does.  This is an oversimplification.  The kernel's executable, even the copied one, remains subject to the driver's memory management policies.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate with three examples demonstrating different scenarios.  These examples are simplified for clarity but represent core principles I've encountered during development.

**Example 1: Basic Copy and Execution**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void myKernel(int *data) {
    *data = 10;
}

int main() {
    int *h_data = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
    *h_data = 0;
    int *d_data;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, sizeof(int));

    // Kernel compilation and initial loading (by the driver)
    myKernel<<<1,1>>>(d_data); //Initial execution

    size_t kernelSize;
    cudaGetKernelSize(&kernelSize); //Get initial kernel size
    void* h_kernel;
    cudaMallocHost(&h_kernel, kernelSize);
    cudaMemcpyFromSymbol(h_kernel, myKernel, kernelSize, 0, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    void* d_kernel;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_kernel, kernelSize);
    cudaMemcpy(d_kernel, h_kernel, kernelSize, 0, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);


    // Execute the copied kernel
    void* config[] = {&d_kernel, d_data};
    cudaLaunchKernel((void *)((char *)d_kernel), 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, config, 0);

    cudaMemcpy(h_data, d_data, sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    printf("Data: %d\n", *h_data);

    cudaFree(d_data);
    cudaFreeHost(h_kernel);
    cudaFree(d_kernel);
    free(h_data);
    return 0;
}

```

This example demonstrates a direct copy using `cudaMemcpyFromSymbol` and `cudaMemcpy`. The driver still manages the original;  the copied kernel's fate depends on the driver's memory management and when it decides to release the initial kernel image from its internal cache.


**Example 2:  Multiple Copies and Execution**

```cpp
// ... (includes and myKernel from Example 1) ...

int main() {
    // ... (data allocation from Example 1) ...

    void* d_kernel1;
    void* d_kernel2;
    // ... (kernel copy to d_kernel1 and d_kernel2) ...

    // Execute both copies
    // ... (launch kernels using d_kernel1 and d_kernel2) ...

    // ... (free memory) ...
}
```

This highlights a scenario where the driver might decide to release the original kernel image after both copies have been successfully made and executed, regardless of when the copied kernel memory is freed.  The driver's optimization strategies would play a crucial role in determining when the release occurs.

**Example 3: Context Switching and Release**

```cpp
// ... (includes and myKernel from Example 1) ...

int main() {
    // ... (data allocation, kernel copy, initial launch as in Example 1) ...

    cudaStream_t stream;
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream); // Create a new stream

    // Launch copied kernel on separate stream.
    void* config[] = {&d_kernel, d_data};
    cudaLaunchKernel((void *)((char *)d_kernel), 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, stream, 0, config, 0);

    cudaStreamDestroy(stream);  // Destroying the stream may influence when the driver decides to release
    cudaFree(d_data);
    cudaFree(d_kernel);
    // ... (other frees) ...
}
```

This example demonstrates the influence of CUDA streams on memory management.  The specific timing of the release of the original kernel image will now significantly be related to stream synchronization and completion events.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The CUDA Programming Guide, the CUDA Best Practices Guide, and the CUDA C++ Best Practices Guide provide invaluable information on CUDA memory management and kernel lifecycle. Examining the CUDA runtime API documentation, specifically the functions related to memory allocation, copy, and deallocation, is also crucial for understanding the nuances of the driver's behavior.  Focusing on memory profiling tools included within the NVIDIA Nsight suite would aid in pinpointing memory release timings and memory usage patterns to further enhance understanding of how the CUDA driver handles the kernel objects.  Thorough understanding of CUDA's asynchronous execution model is absolutely vital for troubleshooting.
