The core issue lies in the fundamental incompatibility between CUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for use with their GPUs, and CPU architectures.  A CUDA-traced PyTorch network, by definition, leverages the GPU's parallel processing capabilities.  Attempts to directly execute such a network on a CPU will inevitably fail.  My experience debugging high-performance computing applications, particularly those involving deep learning frameworks, has repeatedly underscored this limitation.  While PyTorch offers CPU support, this support is for networks *defined* and *trained* without CUDA operations.  A CUDA-traced network is implicitly reliant on GPU-specific functions and memory management.

**1.  Explanation of the Incompatibility**

The CUDA tracing process in PyTorch involves instrumenting the model's execution to capture the sequence of operations performed on the GPU. This instrumentation generates a computational graph specifically tailored for the CUDA architecture.  This graph isn't a generic representation of the model's logic; it incorporates details about kernel launches, memory transfers between the GPU's memory and the host (CPU) memory, and the specific arrangement of data within the GPU's parallel processing units.  The execution engine, reliant on the CUDA runtime libraries, interprets this graph and executes the operations on the GPU.  

The CPU lacks the necessary hardware to directly execute these GPU-specific instructions.  The CUDA runtime libraries, essential for interpreting the traced graph, are not designed to run on a CPU.  Even if one were to hypothetically attempt to translate the CUDA instructions into equivalent CPU instructions, the performance would be severely degraded due to the inherent architectural differences between CPUs and GPUs. CPUs excel at sequential processing, while GPUs are optimized for massively parallel computations.  Direct translation would eliminate the parallelization advantages gained by using a GPU in the first place.

Furthermore, the memory management aspects of the CUDA-traced network are tightly coupled to the GPU's memory architecture.  The network's internal data structures are likely residing in GPU memory, inaccessible directly to the CPU.  Attempts to force access would lead to segmentation faults or other fatal errors.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

Let's illustrate the limitations with examples.  Assume a simple convolutional neural network (CNN).

**Example 1:  CUDA-enabled Training and Inference**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Assuming a GPU is available
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 16, 3)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 13 * 13, 120) # Assuming 28x28 input
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1) # flatten all dimensions except batch
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = SimpleCNN().to(device)
# ... training and inference using model on device ...
```

This example demonstrates the standard PyTorch workflow for GPU utilization.  The `.to(device)` call explicitly moves the model and its data to the GPU.  The inference step implicitly uses CUDA operations if a GPU is available.


**Example 2:  Attempting CPU Execution of a CUDA-Traced Model (Failure)**

Attempting to directly use this `model` object, trained using CUDA, on a CPU will result in errors.  The following will fail:

```python
# This will fail if the model was trained on a GPU
model.to("cpu")  # This might move the *parameters* but not solve the execution issue

# Inference attempt
with torch.no_grad():
    cpu_input = torch.randn(1, 1, 28, 28).to("cpu")
    output = model(cpu_input) # This will likely raise a CUDA error
```

The error message will likely indicate that the model is using CUDA kernels that are unavailable on the CPU.


**Example 3:  CPU-only Training and Inference**

To utilize the model on a CPU, one needs to define and train the model *without* any CUDA operations:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

device = torch.device("cpu") # Explicitly set device to CPU

class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    # ... (same model definition as Example 1) ...

model = SimpleCNN().to(device) # Ensure the model resides on the CPU
# ... training and inference using model on CPU ...
```

This code snippet explicitly sets the device to "cpu" and ensures all operations remain within the CPU's processing capabilities.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of CUDA programming and its integration with PyTorch, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation.  Additionally, NVIDIA's CUDA programming guide provides comprehensive details on the CUDA architecture and programming model.  A strong foundation in linear algebra and parallel computing principles will greatly aid in grasping the complexities involved.  Finally, exploring relevant chapters in advanced deep learning textbooks focusing on high-performance computing aspects is essential.
