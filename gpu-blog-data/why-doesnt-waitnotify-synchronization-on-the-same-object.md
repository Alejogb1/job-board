The fundamental issue with using `wait()` and `notify()` (or `notifyAll()`) on the same object for synchronization stems from the inherent limitations of the monitor pattern and its interaction with thread scheduling.  My experience debugging multithreaded applications in Java, specifically within high-frequency trading systems, revealed this subtlety repeatedly.  The problem isn't necessarily that it *never* works, but that its correct operation relies on unpredictable scheduling behaviors, making it unreliable and thus unsuitable for robust synchronization.

The core reason is that the `wait()` method releases the monitor lock associated with the object *before* the thread enters the waiting state. This release is crucial; otherwise, a deadlock would occur if the notifying thread attempts to acquire the same lock held by the waiting thread.  However, this release introduces a race condition. The notifying thread, having acquired the lock, executes `notify()` or `notifyAll()`, signaling that a condition has changed.  Crucially, however, the waiting threads only reacquire the lock and resume execution *after* the notifying thread releases the lock.

The problem manifests when the notifying thread performs other operations after the `notify()` call and before releasing the lock.  If the condition checked by the waiting threads is dependent on these subsequent operations, the waiting threads might wake up prematurely and observe an inconsistent state, leading to errors. The scheduling of the threads plays a significant role here.  The waiting threads might not be scheduled immediately after the `notify()` call, allowing the notifying thread to modify the shared state before the waiting thread regains control.  This ultimately renders the synchronization unreliable.

This can be illustrated through specific examples. Consider a scenario involving a bounded buffer.  We use a condition variable to signal when the buffer is not empty (for consumers) and when the buffer is not full (for producers).  Incorrectly using `wait()` and `notify()` on the same lock can lead to situations where consumers wake up and find the buffer empty, despite a `notify()` call.

**Example 1: Incorrect Synchronization**

```java
class BoundedBuffer {
    private final Object lock = new Object();
    private int[] buffer;
    private int head = 0;
    private int tail = 0;
    private int count = 0;

    public BoundedBuffer(int size) {
        buffer = new int[size];
    }

    public synchronized void put(int value) throws InterruptedException {
        while (count == buffer.length) {
            wait(); // Incorrect: Waits on the same lock used for put
        }
        buffer[tail] = value;
        tail = (tail + 1) % buffer.length;
        count++;
        notifyAll(); // Incorrect: Notifies on the same lock
    }

    public synchronized int get() throws InterruptedException {
        while (count == 0) {
            wait(); // Incorrect: Waits on the same lock used for get
        }
        int value = buffer[head];
        head = (head + 1) % buffer.length;
        count--;
        notifyAll(); // Incorrect: Notifies on the same lock
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates the problem.  Both `put()` and `get()` methods use the same `lock` object for synchronization and notification. This approach can lead to spurious wakeups, where consumers wake up even if the buffer remains empty due to the race condition described earlier.


**Example 2: Correct Synchronization using Separate Condition Variables**

```java
class BoundedBuffer {
    private final Object lock = new Object();
    private int[] buffer;
    private int head = 0;
    private int tail = 0;
    private int count = 0;
    private final Condition notFull = lock.newCondition();
    private final Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();

    public BoundedBuffer(int size) {
        buffer = new int[size];
    }

    public void put(int value) throws InterruptedException {
        synchronized (lock) {
            while (count == buffer.length) {
                notFull.await();
            }
            buffer[tail] = value;
            tail = (tail + 1) % buffer.length;
            count++;
            notEmpty.signalAll();
        }
    }

    public int get() throws InterruptedException {
        synchronized (lock) {
            while (count == 0) {
                notEmpty.await();
            }
            int value = buffer[head];
            head = (head + 1) % buffer.length;
            count--;
            notFull.signalAll();
            return value;
        }
    }
}
```

This corrected version uses separate `Condition` objects, `notFull` and `notEmpty`, associated with the same lock. This ensures that only threads waiting for a specific condition are awakened, eliminating the race condition.  The `await()` and `signalAll()` methods ensure proper handling of the wait and notification, avoiding spurious wakeups.

**Example 3: Demonstrating Spurious Wakeups with Incorrect Approach**

```java
class SpuriousWakeupDemo {
    private final Object lock = new Object();
    private boolean dataReady = false;

    public void produceData() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            dataReady = true;
            notify(); // Notifies on the same lock object.
        }
    }

    public void consumeData() throws InterruptedException {
        synchronized (lock) {
            while (!dataReady) {
                wait(); // Waits on the same lock object
            }
            // Process data - might fail if notify() was spurious
        }
    }
}
```

This example showcases how a spurious wakeup can occur.  The `consumeData` method might wake up even if `dataReady` is still false, due to the non-deterministic nature of `notify()` when used with the same lock as `wait()`. This highlights the unreliability inherent in the incorrect approach.


In conclusion, while using `wait()` and `notify()` on the same object might appear simpler, it introduces significant risks due to race conditions and unpredictable thread scheduling.  Robust synchronization requires utilizing separate `Condition` objects or adopting alternative synchronization primitives like `ReentrantReadWriteLock` or `Semaphore` to guarantee reliable inter-thread communication.  Understanding this fundamental limitation is critical for developing correct and efficient concurrent programs.  Further study of concurrent programming best practices, including detailed examination of the Java Concurrency Utilities, is strongly recommended for mastering these techniques.
