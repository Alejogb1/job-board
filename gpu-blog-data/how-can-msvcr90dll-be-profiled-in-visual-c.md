The core challenge in profiling `MSVCR90.dll` within a Visual C++ application lies not in the DLL itself, but in the inherent difficulties of instrumenting a runtime library that's often deeply integrated into the application's execution flow.  My experience debugging performance issues in large-scale financial trading applications, often reliant on legacy codebases leveraging this specific runtime, has highlighted this crucial point.  Directly profiling the DLL's internal functions is rarely practical; instead, the focus shifts to profiling the application's interaction with it. This approach yields more meaningful results concerning performance bottlenecks.

**1.  Understanding the Context:**

`MSVCR90.dll` is a Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Runtime Library. Attempting to directly profile its internal functions using standard profiling tools often proves unproductive. The library's functions are highly optimized and tightly coupled with the application's code. The overhead introduced by instrumentation might significantly alter the execution behavior, rendering the profiling data unreliable. Furthermore, the sheer volume of functions within `MSVCR90.dll` would produce overwhelming and largely unhelpful profile data.

The strategy, therefore, should center on identifying the application code segments heavily reliant on `MSVCR90.dll` functionalities. This involves identifying hotspots within the application’s own code where significant time is spent calling into the runtime library.  These hotspots reveal the specific areas requiring optimization, rather than attempting to optimize the runtime library itself.

**2. Profiling Strategies:**

The most effective approaches leverage Visual Studio's built-in profiling tools in conjunction with careful code analysis.  This involves using a combination of instrumentation profiling and sampling profiling techniques.

**2.1. Instrumentation Profiling:**

Instrumentation profiling inserts probes into the code to measure the execution time of specific functions.  This is effective for pinpointing the exact execution time of specific application functions heavily relying on `MSVCR90.dll` operations.  However, excessive instrumentation can lead to significant performance overhead.

**Code Example 1:  Instrumentation with Visual Studio's Profiler**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // For std::sort, using MSVCR90 functions

int main() {
    std::vector<int> data(1000000);
    // ... populate data ...
    std::sort(data.begin(), data.end()); // This line uses MSVCR90.dll functions

    // ... rest of the application ...
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `std::sort` function relies heavily on `MSVCR90.dll`. By profiling this application using Visual Studio's Performance Profiler (selecting "Instrumentation" as the profiling method), we can precisely measure the execution time of the `main` function, thereby indirectly profiling the application's interaction with the sorting algorithms within the runtime library.  The profiler's detailed call stacks can then pinpoint where the majority of the time is consumed within the sorting process.

**2.2. Sampling Profiling:**

Sampling profiling periodically samples the call stack to identify which functions are currently executing.  This method introduces less overhead than instrumentation profiling, making it suitable for larger and more complex applications.  It provides a statistical overview of execution time distribution across different functions.  While it doesn't offer the same precision as instrumentation profiling for individual function calls, it effectively identifies hotspots.

**Code Example 2:  Sampling Profile of String Manipulation**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string largeString(1000000, 'a'); // Large string, potential for MSVCR90.dll involvement
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        largeString += "b"; // String concatenation, potentially leveraging MSVCR90.dll
    }
    std::cout << largeString.length() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates intensive string manipulation.  A sampling profiler (selected within Visual Studio’s Performance Profiler) would help identify the time spent within string operations, hinting at potential areas where `MSVCR90.dll` functions related to memory management and string manipulation are impacting performance.  The sample data would highlight the percentage of time spent within these operations.


**2.3.  Analyzing the Call Stack:**

Regardless of whether instrumentation or sampling is used, analyzing the call stack is crucial.  The call stack reveals the sequence of function calls leading to the observed performance issue.  While it might not directly show `MSVCR90.dll` function names, it will often pinpoint application functions that subsequently call into the runtime library.  This enables focusing optimization efforts on the application code.

**Code Example 3:  Illustrative Call Stack Analysis (Conceptual)**

Let's assume the profiler identifies a bottleneck in a function named `processTransaction`. The call stack might look like this:

`processTransaction` -> `calculateRisk` -> `std::vector::push_back` -> `MSVCR90.dll` (Internal function)

This reveals that the performance issue is related to the use of `std::vector::push_back` within `calculateRisk`, which itself is called by `processTransaction`.  Optimizing the `std::vector` usage within `calculateRisk` (e.g., using a pre-allocated vector or a more efficient data structure) would likely resolve the performance problem indirectly related to `MSVCR90.dll`.  The profiler isn't directly showing bottlenecks *within* `MSVCR90.dll`, but it is showing the *application-level* interactions contributing to slowdowns.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Visual Studio documentation on performance profiling.  Advanced debugging techniques within Visual Studio.  Books covering advanced C++ performance optimization.  Articles on efficient use of standard template library (STL) containers.


In conclusion,  direct profiling of `MSVCR90.dll` is generally unproductive.  The effective approach centers on identifying and optimizing the application code segments that interact most heavily with this runtime library. By using a combination of instrumentation and sampling profiling within Visual Studio, coupled with careful call stack analysis, developers can effectively pinpoint performance bottlenecks and apply targeted optimizations without directly tackling the complexities of the runtime library itself.  This method has proven consistently reliable in my experience resolving performance-critical issues in large-scale applications.
