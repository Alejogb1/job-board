TensorFlow’s type system is stricter than standard Python when working with its computational graph, particularly concerning operations that expect tensors as input, such as those converting values to a floating-point representation. The core issue is that when a generator is directly passed to a TensorFlow function requiring a float or a tensor, it attempts to process the generator object itself, rather than the sequence of yielded values. This mismatch between the expected and received type leads to a `TypeError`.

The problem stems from TensorFlow's need to construct a static computational graph before actual execution. This graph requires concrete tensor shapes and data types. Generators, being iterators that produce values on demand, don't immediately provide this necessary information. They represent a sequence of values but aren't a single, readily usable structure for TensorFlow’s graph construction. The `float()` function in Python, in its standard usage, attempts to convert a single, specific value to a floating-point number. When it receives a generator, it encounters an object it doesn't recognize as a single, directly convertible value, causing it to throw an error. TensorFlow functions that implicitly call `float()` or otherwise require numerical tensors face a similar type mismatch when presented with a generator.

To understand this better, consider that TensorFlow's graph operations are often executed in an optimized, deferred manner. When a tensor is provided to a TensorFlow function, it becomes a node in the computational graph. Each node represents an operation to be performed on tensors. Providing a generator throws off the expected behavior of the graph. TensorFlow cannot directly operate on an abstract construct like a generator during graph construction and deferred execution. Instead, it requires tensors, which have well-defined shapes and types.

I encountered this issue during a project involving processing sequential data for a time-series model. I attempted to use a generator to feed data directly to a TensorFlow layer. The problem, as I quickly learned, wasn’t just that generators aren’t tensors; it was that generators don't have shape information accessible in the context TensorFlow needs to build its execution graph. My initial (erroneous) code looked like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def my_generator():
    for i in range(10):
        yield np.random.rand(1) # Returns numpy arrays

try:
    float_tensor = tf.constant(float(my_generator())) #Attempting to convert generator to a float
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"TypeError encountered: {e}")

```
In the snippet above, the `tf.constant` function, which expects a tensor-like input, receives the output of the `float` function. The `float` function itself is trying to convert the generator to float type value, resulting in the `TypeError`.  The intention was to treat the generator as a sequence of values to be converted individually to a `float` tensor, which failed since it’s processing the generator object itself. The traceback clearly shows the problem arises when Python's `float()` attempts to convert the generator directly, not during the creation of a TensorFlow op.

The corrected approach involves either generating the data beforehand (converting it into a NumPy array which can then be converted to a TensorFlow tensor) or using `tf.data` API, which supports the creation of TensorFlow datasets from generators, applying proper type and shape information.

Here’s an example of converting the data upfront into a NumPy array, which is then converted into a TensorFlow constant.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def my_generator():
    for i in range(10):
        yield np.random.rand(1).item() # yield numpy scalars

data_list = list(my_generator()) # convert to list
np_array = np.array(data_list, dtype=np.float32)
tensor_from_array = tf.constant(np_array)

print(f"Tensor from NumPy array: {tensor_from_array}")
```

In this revised code, `my_generator` now yields scalar values, not numpy arrays, and these are collected into a Python list. Then it's converted into a NumPy array with explicit data type. Then `tf.constant` creates a TensorFlow constant using a numeric array. This approach creates all data upfront. Note the use of the `item()` method to extract a single scalar value from the numpy array returned by np.random.rand(1) as required by `list()`.

The most efficient method for incorporating generators into a TensorFlow pipeline is via `tf.data`.  The `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` function takes a generator and its desired output types and shapes, and creates a TensorFlow dataset suitable for training. This mechanism allows for lazy loading of data as required by the TensorFlow graph. Here's an example using the generator within a `tf.data` pipeline:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def my_generator():
    for i in range(10):
        yield np.random.rand(1).item()

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(
    my_generator,
    output_signature=tf.TensorSpec(shape=(), dtype=tf.float32)
)

for value in dataset.take(5):
  print(f"Tensor from generator via tf.data: {value}")
```
Here, I’ve specified the shape and datatype through `output_signature`, making it suitable for TensorFlow operations. `tf.data` allows the generator to be utilized in a streaming manner within the TensorFlow framework, avoiding the need to generate all data upfront.  The generator, therefore, generates data on-demand, in batches when utilized within an iterative structure. The `take` function here allows us to fetch the first five values from the dataset.

Based on my experience, a few resources helped solidify my understanding of these concepts. For in-depth information regarding Tensorflow’s type system, especially with its interactions with numpy data and Python native types I’d suggest exploring the official TensorFlow documentation. Specific pages focusing on tensor types and the `tf.data` API are particularly valuable. Furthermore, tutorials on using `tf.data` for various data input pipelines, especially with custom generator functions, helped me implement efficient, streaming data loading approaches. Finally, delving into the nuances of computational graph construction within TensorFlow elucidated why strict typing is necessary for the graph’s operation and deferred evaluation.
