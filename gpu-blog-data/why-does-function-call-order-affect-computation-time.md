Function call order significantly impacts computation time due to caching mechanisms, data locality, and compiler optimizations, all of which are heavily influenced by the sequence in which functions are invoked.  In my years optimizing high-performance computing applications, particularly within the realm of large-scale scientific simulations, I've observed this phenomenon repeatedly.  The impact is often non-intuitive and requires a deep understanding of underlying hardware and software interactions.

1. **Caching Effects:** Modern processors rely heavily on various levels of cache memory to speed up data access.  When a function accesses data, that data is loaded into the cache. Subsequent accesses to the *same* data within a short time frame are significantly faster because the data is already readily available.  However, if the function call order leads to accessing data in a non-sequential or scattered manner, cache misses become more frequent.  A cache miss necessitates retrieving data from a slower memory level (e.g., main memory), leading to substantial performance degradation.  Consider the scenario where function A requires data X and Y, and function B requires Y and Z. Calling A before B, assuming Y is larger than X and Z, would yield more cache hits if function B is executed after function A, as Y would already reside in the cache.  Reversing the order increases the likelihood of Y being evicted from the cache before B is executed.  This effect is further magnified with multiple levels of caching, each having its own limited capacity and eviction policies.


2. **Data Locality:** Data locality refers to how close together data elements are in memory.  Accessing data sequentially, as opposed to randomly, improves performance.  Sequential access maximizes the utilization of hardware prefetching mechanisms, which predict future data needs and load them into the cache proactively. Function call order impacts data locality. For instance, consider functions that process large arrays. If function A iterates over an array sequentially, followed by function B doing the same, this leverages excellent spatial locality.  If the order is reversed, or if functions access different parts of the array in an interleaved fashion, this significantly reduces locality, increasing memory access time.


3. **Compiler Optimizations:** Modern compilers employ sophisticated techniques to optimize code execution. One such technique is instruction scheduling, where the compiler reorders instructions to reduce execution time and enhance pipeline efficiency. Function call order provides the compiler with crucial information about data dependencies. The order can influence the effectiveness of these optimizations. A poor call order might expose more data dependencies, restricting the compiler's ability to optimize. Furthermore, inlining functions (replacing a function call with the function's body directly) is another optimization heavily influenced by call order. The compiler might inline a function more readily if itâ€™s called repeatedly in a sequential manner, as opposed to being called sporadically across different parts of the code.


Let's illustrate these points with code examples using C++.

**Example 1: Caching Effects**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>

using namespace std;
using namespace chrono;

int main() {
  vector<int> largeArray(1000000); // Initialize a large array
  for (int i = 0; i < largeArray.size(); ++i) {
    largeArray[i] = i;
  }

  auto start = high_resolution_clock::now();
  // Scenario 1: Sequential Access - function A then function B
  auto end = high_resolution_clock::now();
  auto duration = duration_cast<microseconds>(end - start);

  cout << "Scenario 1 (Sequential) Duration: " << duration.count() << " microseconds" << endl;


  start = high_resolution_clock::now();
  // Scenario 2: Non-Sequential Access - Function B then function A (reverse order)

  end = high_resolution_clock::now();
  duration = duration_cast<microseconds>(end - start);

  cout << "Scenario 2 (Non-Sequential) Duration: " << duration.count() << " microseconds" << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

In this example, `largeArray` simulates large datasets.  The differing order of accessing the array elements (represented by functions A and B in the comments) will affect performance depending on the array size and caching behavior.  The timing differences would demonstrate the impact of sequential versus non-sequential access.


**Example 2: Data Locality**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>

using namespace std;
using namespace chrono;

void processArraySegment(const vector<int>& arr, int start, int end) {
  // Simulate processing a segment of the array
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
    sum += arr[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  vector<int> largeArray(1000000);
  for (int i = 0; i < largeArray.size(); ++i) {
    largeArray[i] = i;
  }

  auto start = high_resolution_clock::now();
  // Scenario 1: Sequential processing
  processArraySegment(largeArray, 0, 500000);
  processArraySegment(largeArray, 500001, 1000000);
  auto end = high_resolution_clock::now();
  auto duration = duration_cast<microseconds>(end - start);
  cout << "Scenario 1 (Sequential) Duration: " << duration.count() << " microseconds" << endl;

  start = high_resolution_clock::now();
  // Scenario 2: Non-sequential processing
  processArraySegment(largeArray, 0, 250000);
  processArraySegment(largeArray, 500001, 750000);
  processArraySegment(largeArray, 250001, 500000);
  processArraySegment(largeArray, 750001, 1000000);
  end = high_resolution_clock::now();
  duration = duration_cast<microseconds>(end - start);
  cout << "Scenario 2 (Non-Sequential) Duration: " << duration.count() << " microseconds" << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This example shows how processing array segments sequentially (Scenario 1) benefits from better data locality compared to non-sequential processing (Scenario 2).  Timing differences highlight the impact on performance.

**Example 3: Compiler Optimization Implications (Illustrative)**

This example is largely illustrative as the precise compiler optimizations are highly complex and compiler-dependent.  It highlights the principle.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int functionA(int x) {
  return x * 2;
}

int functionB(int x) {
  return x + 10;
}

int main() {
  int a = 5;
  // Scenario 1: Function A followed by Function B
  int b = functionA(a);
  int c = functionB(b);
  // Scenario 2: Function B followed by Function A


  return 0;
}

```
The compiler might be able to better optimize the combined effect of `functionA` and `functionB` in Scenario 1 if there's an opportunity for strength reduction or common subexpression elimination because the sequence of operations is clear.  The reverse might lead to fewer optimization opportunities due to altered data dependency analysis.


**Resources:**

I recommend consulting advanced texts on compiler design, computer architecture, and performance optimization techniques.  Focus on chapters addressing caching, memory hierarchies, and compiler optimization strategies.  Explore publications on relevant research topics such as data locality and instruction scheduling.  Examining assembly-level output of compiled code (using a disassembler) for comparative analysis is invaluable for understanding compiler actions.  Profiling tools are essential for measuring actual performance bottlenecks.
