Evaluating a transformed multivariate normal probability density function (PDF) within the TensorFlow framework requires careful consideration of the transformation's Jacobian determinant.  My experience working on high-dimensional Bayesian inference problems highlighted the critical role of numerical stability in these computations, particularly when dealing with complex transformations.  Directly applying the standard multivariate normal PDF formula after a transformation is inaccurate; the transformation distorts the probability space, necessitating a Jacobian adjustment.

The core principle is that the probability mass must be conserved.  A transformation alters the volume element, and the Jacobian determinant quantifies this change.  Consequently, the transformed PDF incorporates this Jacobian correction factor.  Specifically, if we have a transformation  `y = g(x)`, where `x` follows a multivariate normal distribution with mean `μ` and covariance matrix `Σ`, and `g` is a differentiable, invertible function, the PDF of `y`, denoted `p(y)`, is given by:

`p(y) = p(x) |det(J)|⁻¹`

where `p(x)` is the multivariate normal PDF of `x`, and `J` is the Jacobian matrix of the transformation `g⁻¹(y)`, i.e., the inverse transformation expressed as a function of `y`.  The absolute value of the determinant of the Jacobian ensures the PDF remains positive.


The challenge lies in efficiently computing the determinant of the Jacobian, especially for high-dimensional transformations.  Numerical instability can easily arise, leading to inaccurate or undefined results. TensorFlow provides tools to address this, leveraging automatic differentiation and optimized linear algebra routines.  However, a naïve implementation can be computationally expensive and prone to errors.

**1.  Simple Linear Transformation:**

Consider a simple linear transformation: `y = Ax + b`, where `A` is an invertible matrix and `b` is a vector.  The Jacobian matrix is simply `A`, and its determinant is readily computed.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define parameters
mu = tf.constant([0.0, 0.0], dtype=tf.float64)
sigma = tf.constant([[1.0, 0.5], [0.5, 1.0]], dtype=tf.float64)
A = tf.constant([[2.0, 0.0], [0.0, 3.0]], dtype=tf.float64)
b = tf.constant([1.0, -1.0], dtype=tf.float64)

# Define the multivariate normal PDF
def multivariate_normal_pdf(x, mu, sigma):
  return tf.exp(-0.5 * tf.matmul(tf.transpose(x - mu), tf.linalg.solve(sigma, x - mu))) / tf.sqrt(tf.linalg.det(2 * np.pi * sigma))

# Transformation
def transform(x):
  return tf.matmul(A, x) + b

# Inverse transformation
def inverse_transform(y):
  return tf.linalg.solve(A, y - b)

# Evaluate the transformed PDF
y = tf.constant([3.0, 2.0], dtype=tf.float64)
x = inverse_transform(y)
jacobian_det = tf.abs(tf.linalg.det(A))
transformed_pdf = multivariate_normal_pdf(x, mu, sigma) / jacobian_det

print(f"Transformed PDF at y = [3.0, 2.0]: {transformed_pdf.numpy()}")

```

This example demonstrates a straightforward application of the formula. The Jacobian is constant, simplifying the computation.  The use of `tf.linalg.solve` is crucial for efficiency when dealing with covariance matrices.  Note the use of `tf.float64` for enhanced numerical precision, particularly beneficial in higher dimensions.


**2.  Nonlinear Transformation with Automatic Differentiation:**

For nonlinear transformations, calculating the Jacobian directly can be challenging. TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities provide an elegant solution.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a nonlinear transformation
def g(x):
  return tf.stack([tf.sin(x[0]), tf.cos(x[1])])

# Define the inverse transformation (this might require numerical methods for complex functions)
def g_inv(y): # Placeholder - requires a numerical solver in practice
  return tf.constant([0.0, 0.0], dtype=tf.float64) # Replace with actual inverse


# Use automatic differentiation to compute the Jacobian
with tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as tape:
  tape.watch(x)
  y = g(x)

jacobian = tape.jacobian(y, x)
jacobian_det = tf.abs(tf.linalg.det(jacobian))

# ...rest of the PDF calculation as in the linear transformation example.

```

This code snippet utilizes `tf.GradientTape` to compute the Jacobian.  The `persistent=True` argument allows reuse of the tape for multiple Jacobian calculations.  Note that finding the inverse transformation `g_inv`  might require numerical methods such as Newton-Raphson, which I've omitted for brevity but are critical for practical application.  This approach's accuracy depends heavily on the numerical solver used for the inverse transformation.


**3.  Handling High-Dimensional Transformations:**

For high-dimensional transformations, computational efficiency becomes paramount.  Exploiting the structure of the transformation, if any, is vital.  For instance, if the transformation is block-diagonal, the Jacobian determinant calculation simplifies considerably.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume a block-diagonal Jacobian (example)
dimension = 10
block_size = 5

# Sample Jacobian
jacobian = tf.zeros((dimension, dimension), dtype=tf.float64)
block1 = tf.random.normal((block_size, block_size), dtype=tf.float64)
block2 = tf.random.normal((block_size, block_size), dtype=tf.float64)
jacobian = tf.linalg.set_diag(jacobian, tf.concat([tf.linalg.diag_part(block1), tf.linalg.diag_part(block2)], axis=0))
jacobian = jacobian + tf.eye(dimension, dtype=tf.float64) #Ensure invertibility

jacobian_det = tf.abs(tf.linalg.det(jacobian))

#.. rest of pdf evaluation code similar to previous examples

```

This example showcases a scenario where the Jacobian is block-diagonal, allowing for a more efficient determinant calculation.  This is achieved by calculating the determinant of the individual blocks separately and then multiplying the results. This strategy significantly reduces the computational burden compared to directly computing the determinant of a large, dense matrix.  Appropriate strategies, such as Cholesky decomposition, can be integrated within this approach for further performance gains.


**Resource Recommendations:**

*  TensorFlow documentation on automatic differentiation and linear algebra operations.
*  Publications on numerical methods for solving nonlinear equations and computing Jacobian determinants.


This response details the core methodology and practical considerations for evaluating transformed multivariate normal PDFs in TensorFlow. Remember that the choice of approach depends heavily on the nature of the transformation involved, particularly regarding its complexity and dimensionality. Robust numerical methods and careful attention to numerical stability are indispensable for reliable results, especially in high-dimensional settings.  My past experience demonstrates that neglecting these factors can lead to significant inaccuracies and computational inefficiencies.
