The inherent limitation of `mailx`'s `-s` (subject) option, which only accepts a single line of text, necessitates a workaround for redirecting multiline output to the email body.  My experience debugging complex shell scripts for large-scale data processing workflows has frequently encountered this challenge.  The core solution involves leveraging command substitution and a mechanism to introduce newline characters appropriately within the email content.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`mailx` lacks a direct mechanism to handle multiline subject lines or bodies passed via standard output redirection.  Standard output redirection (`>` or `>>`) appends the output as a single block of text, irrespective of newline characters present in the original output. Therefore, to send a multiline email body, the multiline output must first be captured, typically using command substitution (e.g., `$(command)`), and then properly formatted for email transmission.  This formatting involves carefully managing newline characters.  A simple concatenation of lines with line breaks might not work consistently across different mail clients or systems due to potential variations in how newline characters are interpreted.  Thus, a robust solution requires a method that ensures consistent newline handling, such as using `echo` with the `-e` option or constructing the email body using `printf`.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `echo` with `-e` for newline control:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Generate multiline output
multiline_output=$(echo -e "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3")

# Send email with multiline body
mailx -s "Multiline Email Subject" user@example.com <<< "$multiline_output"
```

This example uses `echo -e` to interpret backslash escapes, specifically `\n` for newline characters, within the string assigned to `multiline_output`.  The `<<<` operator provides the string as standard input to `mailx`, avoiding the complexities of temporary files. This approach is concise and often sufficient for straightforward scenarios.  However, it becomes less manageable when the multiline output is generated by a more complex command.


**Example 2:  Using `printf` for formatted output:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Generate multiline output (assuming a command named 'my_command' generates the output)
multiline_output=$(my_command)

# Format the output for email (handle potential leading/trailing whitespace)
formatted_output=$(printf "%s\n" "$multiline_output")

# Send email
mailx -s "Formatted Multiline Email" user@example.com <<< "$formatted_output"
```

This demonstrates a more robust approach, particularly useful when the source of the multiline data is external (like the output of a complex program).  `printf "%s\n"` iterates through each line of `multiline_output`, explicitly adding a newline character (`\n`) after each line.  This ensures consistent newline representation regardless of the original output's formatting.  It effectively handles potential inconsistencies in newline characters produced by the source command. This method enhances portability and prevents potential formatting issues on the recipient's end.


**Example 3:  Handling complex output with `awk` for pre-processing:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Assume 'complex_command' produces output needing specific formatting
multiline_output=$(complex_command)

# Use awk to clean and format the output (example: remove extra whitespace)
formatted_output=$(echo "$multiline_output" | awk '{gsub(/[[:space:]]+$/, ""); print}')

# Add a header and footer for better readability.
email_body=$(echo "Email Body:\n" "$formatted_output" "\nSincerely,\nThe Script")

# Send the email
mailx -s "Complex Output Email" user@example.com <<< "$email_body"
```

This example addresses scenarios involving complex output that might contain extraneous whitespace or require specific formatting before being sent as an email.  `awk` provides powerful text processing capabilities to refine the output. In this case, `gsub(/[[:space:]]+$/, "")` removes trailing whitespace from each line.  Further `awk` commands could be implemented to handle more sophisticated formatting needs like removing empty lines, replacing specific characters, or rearranging data.  Finally, a header and footer are added for improved readability. This approach offers the flexibility to adapt to a wide range of input formats.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The `mailx` man page;  a comprehensive shell scripting tutorial;  a text processing guide focused on `awk` and `sed`;  a guide on using `printf`.  These resources provide detailed information on the functionalities and best practices for each of the tools used in the examples.  Careful examination of these materials is crucial to understand the nuances of each technique and to select the most appropriate solution for a given context.  This thorough understanding is paramount for avoiding common pitfalls like incorrect newline handling and inconsistent output formatting.
