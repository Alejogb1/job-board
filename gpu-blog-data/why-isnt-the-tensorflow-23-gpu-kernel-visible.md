The core issue underlying the invisibility of the TensorFlow 2.3 GPU kernel in SageMaker environments often stems from a mismatch between the container's CUDA driver version, the TensorFlow build, and the underlying instance type's GPU hardware. In my experience, primarily troubleshooting deep learning deployments, these compatibility discrepancies are the most frequent culprits, and resolving them requires a careful examination of the software and hardware stack.

Let's break down the specific reasons. SageMaker utilizes Docker containers to provide consistent execution environments. These containers, in turn, rely on NVIDIA drivers installed on the EC2 instance hosting the training or inference workload to access the GPU. The TensorFlow package itself is also compiled against specific CUDA and cuDNN libraries. If the CUDA toolkit or the driver version on the underlying instance does not meet the minimum requirements for the TensorFlow build present in the SageMaker container, TensorFlow will simply default to the CPU, silently, or throw an error deeper in the execution stack depending on configuration.

Specifically for TensorFlow 2.3, which you mentioned, it was typically compiled with specific versions of CUDA and cuDNN, historically targeting CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN 7.6. Given the rapid pace of updates, the specific SageMaker container you are employing might have either newer or older drivers installed than those TensorFlow is expecting. If the instance has an older driver than that required by the Tensorflow build, then Tensorflow will revert to CPU. Likewise, newer driver versions that are not forward-compatible can fail to expose the GPU as a viable device to Tensorflow as well. This creates a situation where, even though a GPU exists and is functional at the system level, it’s not discoverable by the TensorFlow runtime within the container.

Furthermore, the EC2 instance type also contributes to the visibility issue. Different GPU-enabled instances (e.g., `p2`, `p3`, `g4`) use distinct GPU architectures with specific driver dependencies. If the container is not correctly built for the underlying instance or if the drivers themselves aren't correctly configured for those architectures, Tensorflow will not see the GPU. For instance, using a container built for `p2` instances on a `p3` instance, or vice-versa, can result in such issues. Additionally, the container might not even have the necessary GPU drivers included.

To diagnose this, I begin with a series of checks from within the SageMaker notebook or training container. These checks are aimed at identifying the precise issue. Here are three example cases with commentary and code snippets in a Python environment within the container:

**Example 1: Inspecting TensorFlow Device Placement**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check if any GPUs are visible to TensorFlow
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# Print details about each device if any GPUs are detected
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        for gpu in gpus:
            print("GPU Details:")
            print(gpu)
            print(f"Name:{tf.config.experimental.get_device_details(gpu).get('device_name')}")
            print(f"Device Type:{tf.config.experimental.get_device_details(gpu).get('device_type')}")
            print(f"Mem Limit:{tf.config.experimental.get_device_details(gpu).get('memory_limit_bytes')}")
    except:
        print("Failed to get device details")


# Attempt to execute a simple operation on GPU if available
try:
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3],dtype=tf.float32)
        b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2],dtype=tf.float32)
        c = tf.matmul(a,b)
        print("GPU calculation successfull, Tensor value:")
        print(c)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"GPU calculation failed, error: {e}")

```
*Commentary:* This code directly queries TensorFlow about the visible GPU devices. It prints the number of detected GPUs, and if any are present, it outputs their details including name, type, and available memory. It attempts a simple matrix multiplication operation on the first detected GPU (`/GPU:0`). If no GPUs are detected or if the operation fails, the exception provides clues. If the device list is empty, it means the issue is deeper than a runtime error; it means Tensorflow did not recognize any GPU at all. If a `RuntimeError` is thrown during the calculation on the GPU, it often hints to an issue with driver versions and Tensorflow build. This snippet serves as a basic sanity check for TensorFlow's awareness of the GPU.

**Example 2: Inspecting System-level CUDA Information**

```python
import subprocess

# Function to execute shell commands and return output
def run_command(command):
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
        return result.stdout.strip()
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"Error: {e.stderr.strip()}"

# Check NVIDIA driver version and CUDA installation
nvidia_smi_output = run_command("nvidia-smi")
print("nvidia-smi Output:\n", nvidia_smi_output)

nvcc_version_output = run_command("nvcc --version")
print("\nnvcc --version Output:\n", nvcc_version_output)

#Checking environment variables
print("\nCUDA_HOME env var:", run_command("printenv CUDA_HOME"))
print("\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH env var:", run_command("printenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH"))
```

*Commentary:* This example uses `nvidia-smi` and `nvcc --version`, two command-line tools that display information about NVIDIA drivers and CUDA installation respectively. The `nvidia-smi` output reveals the driver version, GPU model, and current GPU utilization. `nvcc --version` indicates the installed CUDA compiler version. These values should be consistent with the TensorFlow requirements. Further, this code snippet checks the `CUDA_HOME` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables, which should be configured correctly and pointing to the correct libraries. If `nvidia-smi` fails, this would indicate that the driver is not installed, improperly installed, or the instance does not have a GPU. A mismatch between reported CUDA versions and what Tensorflow requires or a failure of `nvidia-smi` is a good indicator of the underlying cause of the issue.

**Example 3: Checking Tensorflow Compilation Details**
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import sys
import os
#Getting Tensorflow build info
print(f"Tensorflow Version: {tf.__version__}")

print(f"Tensorflow compilation details: {tf.sysconfig.get_build_info()}")

try:
   from tensorflow.python.platform import build_info as build
   print(f"Tensorflow build_info: CUDA Version:{build.get_build_info()['cuda_version']}")
   print(f"Tensorflow build_info: cuDNN Version:{build.get_build_info()['cudnn_version']}")
except:
   print("Unable to retrieve Tensorflow CUDA information")

print(f"System Python Version: {sys.version}")

print(f"Environment variables:\n {os.environ}")
```

*Commentary:* This code aims to extract Tensorflow’s built-in compilation details using `tf.sysconfig.get_build_info()` and the old `build_info`. This reveals the precise CUDA and cuDNN versions against which the TensorFlow library was compiled. This information is critical for cross-referencing against the versions reported by `nvidia-smi` and `nvcc` in Example 2. Discrepancies here often explain why TensorFlow is unable to access the GPU. It also prints other useful debugging information such as the Python version being used and the available environment variables.

Based on my experience, the most common resolution involves ensuring the following. First, select a SageMaker container image that's explicitly compatible with both your TensorFlow version and your desired instance type. This typically requires referencing the official documentation. Secondly, if necessary, configure custom containers that incorporate the exact CUDA/cuDNN versions matched against TensorFlow. Third, when using custom containers, confirm the `CUDA_HOME` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables within the container are pointing to the correct libraries. Finally, if using managed SageMaker services, double check that the chosen instance type has a GPU.

**Resource Recommendations**

For those new to this, I recommend the following resources to deepen understanding and facilitate debugging.

First, the official TensorFlow documentation provides details about supported hardware and software configurations. This should be your go-to reference for TensorFlow version-specific requirements.

Second, NVIDIA provides extensive documentation related to CUDA toolkit, driver compatibility, and hardware architecture. Understanding the specifics of NVIDIA drivers is crucial.

Finally, AWS documentation for SageMaker containers provides lists of supported instances, software versions, and pre-built container images. Careful selection of an appropriate container is the initial and most important step in achieving GPU visibility.
Troubleshooting GPU visibility in SageMaker requires meticulous attention to version details, configuration, and an understanding of the underlying GPU architecture, as a mismatch at any point of this hardware/software stack will lead to the scenario described in the original question.
