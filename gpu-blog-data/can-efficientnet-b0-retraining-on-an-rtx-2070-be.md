EfficientNet-B0 retraining on an RTX 2070, while feasible, necessitates careful consideration of memory management strategies.  My experience optimizing deep learning models for resource-constrained hardware leads me to believe that out-of-memory (OOM) errors during training are largely preventable, not inherent to the task.  The key lies in a coordinated approach involving data loading, batch size adjustment, and precision considerations.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The RTX 2070, while a capable GPU, possesses a limited VRAM capacity (typically 8GB). EfficientNet-B0, though a relatively efficient architecture compared to its larger counterparts, still requires substantial memory for model weights, activations, gradients, and optimizer states during training.  An OOM error arises when the GPU's VRAM is exceeded by the combined memory demands of these components.  Therefore, the challenge isn't inherent to the model's size but rather a mismatch between its memory footprint and available resources.

Several factors contribute to memory consumption during training:

* **Batch Size:** Larger batch sizes lead to higher memory consumption as more data needs to be processed simultaneously.  Smaller batch sizes reduce memory usage but can negatively affect training efficiency and generalization performance.  An optimal balance must be struck.

* **Image Resolution:** Higher-resolution input images require significantly more memory.  Reducing image resolution during preprocessing is an effective way to decrease memory consumption.

* **Data Augmentation:**  Some data augmentation techniques (e.g., those involving multiple image copies or transformations) inflate memory usage.  Careful selection and implementation of augmentation strategies are crucial.

* **Precision:** Training with lower precision (e.g., FP16 instead of FP32) reduces memory usage by half, albeit potentially at the cost of some training accuracy.  Mixed precision training (using both FP16 and FP32) can offer a good compromise.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate strategies for mitigating OOM errors during EfficientNet-B0 retraining using TensorFlow/Keras.  I have personally used these approaches in various projects involving limited GPU resources.

**Example 1: Reducing Batch Size and Image Resolution:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import EfficientNetB0
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Reduce image size for lower memory consumption
img_height, img_width = 128, 128  # Reduced from default 224x224

# Reduce batch size to fit within VRAM
batch_size = 16  # Experiment to find optimal value

# Data augmentation with limited memory impact
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255,
                             rotation_range=20,
                             width_shift_range=0.2,
                             height_shift_range=0.2,
                             horizontal_flip=True)

train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'train_data',
    target_size=(img_height, img_width),
    batch_size=batch_size,
    class_mode='categorical')

# Load pre-trained EfficientNetB0 and adjust for new image size
base_model = EfficientNetB0(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(img_height, img_width, 3))
base_model.trainable = False # Consider fine-tuning later

# ... rest of the model building and training code ...
```

This example demonstrates how reducing `img_height`, `img_width`, and `batch_size` directly impacts memory usage.  Experimentation with these parameters is essential to find the optimal balance between training speed and memory consumption.  Limited data augmentation minimizes additional memory overhead.

**Example 2: Utilizing Mixed Precision Training:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Enable mixed precision training
mixed_precision = tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')
tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy(mixed_precision)

# ... rest of the model building code (same as Example 1, but with potential modifications for dtype) ...

# Compile the model with appropriate optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-3) # Or other suitable optimizer
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... training code ...
```
This snippet shows how to enable mixed precision training using TensorFlow's `mixed_precision` API.  This drastically reduces memory usage by employing FP16 for most operations.  The learning rate might need adjustment depending on the precision used.  Monitor for potential accuracy degradation.


**Example 3:  Utilizing TensorFlow Datasets for Efficient Data Loading:**

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

# Load the dataset using tfds for efficient data loading and preprocessing
dataset, info = tfds.load('your_dataset', with_info=True, as_supervised=True)

# Apply data augmentation and preprocessing within the dataset pipeline
def preprocess(image, label):
    image = tf.image.resize(image, (img_height, img_width))
    image = tf.cast(image, tf.float32) / 255.0  # Normalization
    return image, label

dataset = dataset.map(preprocess).batch(batch_size).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

# ... rest of the model building and training code (using dataset as input instead of ImageDataGenerator) ...
```

This example leverages TensorFlow Datasets (`tfds`), which offers efficient data loading and preprocessing capabilities.  Using `tfds` and performing preprocessing within the dataset pipeline reduces memory overhead compared to loading and processing the entire dataset in memory at once.  `prefetch` improves training speed by pre-loading batches.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further optimization, consult the official documentation for TensorFlow and Keras regarding memory management.  Explore techniques like gradient accumulation (simulating larger batch sizes with smaller ones) and model checkpointing (saving model weights periodically to prevent loss in case of interruptions).   A thorough understanding of your dataset's characteristics and preprocessing techniques is critical. Experimentation and profiling are invaluable to identify memory bottlenecks.  Finally, review literature on efficient training strategies for deep learning models on resource-constrained hardware.  This will provide broader context for effective memory management beyond the scope of the examples presented.
