The core issue with suppressing newlines in `RAISERROR` statements stems from its inherent design to format error messages for readability in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and other client applications.  The `RAISERROR` function, by default, interprets newline characters (`\n` or `CHAR(10)`) within its message string, rendering them as line breaks in the output.  Therefore, direct newline suppression requires manipulating the message string to remove these characters or employing alternative methods to control the output formatting. Over the years, I've wrestled with this in various database projects, especially when integrating error handling into stored procedures intended for programmatic access.  My solutions have involved careful string manipulation, leveraging the `REPLACE` function, and, in certain cases, utilizing alternative error handling mechanisms like `THROW`.


**1. Explanation: Controlling Message String Formatting**

The primary approach involves pre-processing the error message string to remove any newline characters before passing it to `RAISERROR`.  This is crucial because `RAISERROR`'s behavior is to interpret the input string literally, respecting the embedded formatting characters.  The `REPLACE` function provides a straightforward solution for eliminating these characters.  Additional string manipulation might be necessary to handle carriage return characters (`\r` or `CHAR(13)`) that frequently accompany newlines, depending on the origin of your error message string (e.g., concatenation of strings from different sources).  It's important to consider the potential impact on message readability in contexts where the error details are intended for human consumption, though.

Furthermore, the `RAISERROR` severity level impacts the error's handling. Lower severity levels might be caught and handled within the application logic, while higher levels (above 18) will terminate the execution.  Careful consideration of the severity level should accompany newline suppression to ensure appropriate application behavior. Finally, the `STATE` parameter of `RAISERROR` offers a means to further categorize the error, useful for differentiated error handling.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Newline Suppression**

```sql
-- Example 1: Simple newline removal
DECLARE @ErrorMessage VARCHAR(255) = 'This is a single line error message.\nNo newlines here.';

SET @ErrorMessage = REPLACE(@ErrorMessage, CHAR(10), '');  --Remove newline character
SET @ErrorMessage = REPLACE(@ErrorMessage, CHAR(13), ''); --Remove carriage return character

RAISERROR(@ErrorMessage, 16, 1);
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental technique of removing newline and carriage return characters using the `REPLACE` function before passing the processed message to `RAISERROR`.  The severity level is set to 16, which generally indicates a non-critical error, allowing for application-level handling. The `STATE` parameter is set to 1, offering a simple identifier for this specific error condition.

**Example 2:  Handling Concatenated Strings**

```sql
-- Example 2:  Handling concatenated strings with potential newlines
DECLARE @ErrorPart1 VARCHAR(100) = 'Error occurred during ';
DECLARE @ErrorPart2 VARCHAR(100) = 'processing.\nMore details below.';
DECLARE @ErrorMessage VARCHAR(255);

SET @ErrorMessage = @ErrorPart1 + @ErrorPart2;
SET @ErrorMessage = REPLACE(@ErrorMessage, CHAR(10), '');
SET @ErrorMessage = REPLACE(@ErrorMessage, CHAR(13), '');

RAISERROR(@ErrorMessage, 11, 1);

```

This example showcases the importance of newline removal when concatenating strings that might originate from different sources.   The potential for newline characters within `@ErrorPart2` necessitates pre-processing before concatenation to prevent unexpected line breaks.


**Example 3: Utilizing `THROW` for Structured Exception Handling**

```sql
-- Example 3: Utilizing THROW for structured exception handling
BEGIN TRY
    -- Some code that might raise an error
    -- ...
    SELECT 1/0;  --Simulate a division by zero error
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    DECLARE @ErrorSeverity INT = ERROR_SEVERITY();
    DECLARE @ErrorState INT = ERROR_STATE();
    DECLARE @ErrorMessage NVARCHAR(MAX) = ERROR_MESSAGE();
    DECLARE @ErrorLine INT = ERROR_LINE();
    DECLARE @ErrorProcedure NVARCHAR(128) = ERROR_PROCEDURE();

    SET @ErrorMessage = REPLACE(@ErrorMessage, CHAR(10), '');
    SET @ErrorMessage = REPLACE(@ErrorMessage, CHAR(13), '');

    THROW; -- Re-throws the exception with the modified error message.
END CATCH
```

This example utilizes the `TRY...CATCH` block and `THROW` statement for more structured exception handling. While `RAISERROR` is still used (implicitly within the `THROW` statement), the focus is on capturing and modifying the error message before re-throwing. This allows for cleaner error handling and simplifies logging.  The original error severity and state are maintained ensuring consistent behavior.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

* SQL Server Books Online: The official documentation provides comprehensive details on `RAISERROR` and exception handling.
* SQL Server error handling tutorials: Numerous online resources offer step-by-step guides and examples.
* Advanced SQL Server programming books: Several books provide in-depth coverage of error handling and advanced T-SQL techniques.  Consult the indices for specific topics on `RAISERROR` and exception handling.


My experience shows that consistent error handling is crucial for building robust applications.  While directly suppressing newlines within `RAISERROR` is achievable through string manipulation, a more comprehensive strategy often involves employing structured exception handling with `TRY...CATCH` and potentially a custom error logging mechanism.  Always prioritize clarity and maintainability, as overly terse error messages can hinder debugging efforts. Remember to consider the context â€“ human-readable logging often benefits from the natural formatting provided by newlines, while programmatic error handling often requires their removal.  Choosing the right technique depends on your application's specific needs.
