Model accuracy plotting hinges on understanding the specific type of accuracy metric being used and the nature of the model's output.  My experience working on large-scale image classification and natural language processing projects has shown that a one-size-fits-all approach is rarely effective.  Instead, the choice of plotting technique is intimately tied to the model’s architecture, the dataset characteristics, and the ultimate goal of the visualization.  Effective visualization requires careful consideration of the audience and intended message.

**1. Clear Explanation of Accuracy Plotting Techniques**

The most straightforward approach involves plotting the accuracy metric directly against a relevant independent variable. This variable could be the number of training epochs, a hyperparameter value, or a measure of model complexity.  For instance, in a machine learning project involving image classification, I once tracked accuracy across different numbers of training epochs to identify the point of diminishing returns. A simple line graph proved highly effective in illustrating this relationship.  The y-axis would represent the accuracy (e.g., percentage correct classifications), and the x-axis would represent the epochs.

However, accuracy, as a single scalar value, can be misleading.  It doesn’t reveal the nuances of the model's performance.  More comprehensive approaches involve analyzing the model’s performance across different classes or data subsets.  Consider a scenario with imbalanced classes:  high overall accuracy might mask poor performance on a minority class.  In such cases, plotting precision-recall curves or ROC curves provides a much richer understanding of the model's behavior.  These curves illustrate the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate (ROC curve) or precision and recall (precision-recall curve) at different classification thresholds.

Further, when dealing with complex models, such as deep neural networks, visualizing the accuracy across different layers or components of the network can be insightful.  This can help diagnose bottlenecks or identify areas needing improvement. This often involves plotting intermediate activation functions or feature maps, but this falls beyond the scope of simply plotting 'model accuracy'.

For regression models, the concept of accuracy changes; we often use metrics like R-squared or Mean Squared Error (MSE).  Plotting these metrics against the same independent variables as mentioned earlier remains a valid approach.  Additionally, scatter plots comparing predicted values against actual values can be highly informative, providing a visual assessment of the model’s predictive capability and revealing potential patterns of systematic errors.  Residual plots (the difference between predicted and actual values) can be crucial in identifying heteroscedasticity or other violations of model assumptions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different approaches to plotting model accuracy.  These examples use Python with `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn`.  Note that appropriate data preprocessing and model training are assumed to have been performed prior to these plotting steps.

**Example 1: Plotting Accuracy over Epochs**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume 'history' is a dictionary returned by model.fit() containing training history
history = {'accuracy': [0.7, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.92, 0.93, 0.935, 0.938],
           'val_accuracy': [0.65, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.88, 0.89, 0.9, 0.9]}
epochs = range(1, len(history['accuracy']) + 1)

plt.plot(epochs, history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(epochs, history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.title('Training and Validation Accuracy over Epochs')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This code snippet plots training and validation accuracy over a set of epochs. The difference between training and validation accuracy can highlight overfitting. The use of `matplotlib` provides a straightforward approach to visualization, allowing for easy customization of labels and titles.


**Example 2: Precision-Recall Curve**

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve, auc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume 'y_true' and 'y_score' are the true and predicted labels (probabilities)
y_true = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
y_score = [0.1, 0.8, 0.9, 0.2, 0.7, 0.3, 0.4, 0.95]

precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_score)
pr_auc = auc(recall, precision)

plt.plot(recall, precision, label=f'Precision-Recall Curve (AUC = {pr_auc:.2f})')
plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.title('Precision-Recall Curve')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This example demonstrates the plotting of a precision-recall curve, which is crucial when dealing with imbalanced datasets.  `scikit-learn` provides the necessary functions to calculate the precision-recall curve and the area under the curve (AUC).  The AUC value serves as a single metric summarizing the overall performance.

**Example 3:  Scatter Plot of Predicted vs. Actual Values (Regression)**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume 'y_true' and 'y_pred' are arrays of true and predicted values
y_true = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
y_pred = [12, 18, 32, 38, 53]

plt.scatter(y_true, y_pred)
plt.plot([min(y_true), max(y_true)], [min(y_true), max(y_true)], linestyle='--', color='red') # Line of perfect prediction
plt.xlabel('Actual Values')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Values')
plt.title('Predicted vs. Actual Values')
plt.show()
```

This code generates a scatter plot to visually assess the model's performance for a regression problem.  The diagonal line represents perfect prediction; points deviating significantly from this line indicate prediction errors. This visualization quickly reveals the model's overall fit and any potential biases.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further exploration, I recommend studying statistical textbooks focused on data visualization and machine learning evaluation metrics.  Exploring the documentation for `matplotlib` and `scikit-learn` will prove invaluable.  Consult relevant machine learning publications on model evaluation methodologies and visualization techniques for specific domains like image classification or natural language processing.  Finally, working through tutorials and examples found in various online machine learning courses can significantly improve your understanding and practical skills.  These resources offer detailed explanations and numerous examples applicable to diverse contexts.
