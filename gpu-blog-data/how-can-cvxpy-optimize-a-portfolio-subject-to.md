The cardinal constraint of limiting the number of assets in a portfolio optimization problem significantly complicates the otherwise convex nature of the problem.  My experience working on algorithmic trading strategies at a high-frequency firm underscored this fact repeatedly.  While mean-variance optimization provides a straightforward framework, the addition of a cardinality constraint renders it non-convex, requiring specialized techniques for effective solution. This response will detail approaches to address this challenge within the CVXPY framework.

**1.  Understanding the Problem's Non-Convexity**

Standard mean-variance portfolio optimization aims to minimize risk (variance) for a given level of expected return.  This is readily formulated as a quadratic program, easily solvable by CVXPY. The objective function typically involves the covariance matrix of asset returns and a vector of weights representing the proportion of capital allocated to each asset.  The constraint set often includes a budget constraint (sum of weights equals one) and potentially non-negativity constraints (no short selling).

Introducing a cardinality constraint, limiting the number of assets to *k*, transforms the problem.  We need to ensure that at most *k* assets have non-zero weights.  This constraint is non-convex because it involves the number of non-zero elements in a vector, a discontinuous function.  This prevents the direct application of standard convex optimization techniques.  Various methods exist to approximate or solve this non-convex problem.


**2.  Approximation Techniques and CVXPY Implementation**

Three primary approaches utilize CVXPY to handle the cardinality constraint, each with trade-offs regarding computational complexity and solution quality:

**a)  Approximation via a Penalty Function:** This method adds a penalty term to the objective function that discourages having many non-zero weights.  The penalty is typically a function of the L1-norm of the weight vector, which counts the number of non-zero elements implicitly.

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

# Problem data (replace with your actual data)
n_assets = 10  # Number of assets
k = 3         # Maximum number of assets
mu = np.random.rand(n_assets)  # Expected returns
Sigma = np.random.rand(n_assets, n_assets) # Covariance matrix; ensure it's positive semi-definite
Sigma = Sigma @ Sigma.T #Ensure positive semi-definiteness

# CVXPY model
w = cp.Variable(n_assets)
objective = cp.Minimize(cp.quad_form(w, Sigma)) #Minimize risk
constraints = [cp.sum(w) == 1, w >= 0, cp.sum(cp.abs(w)) <= k] #Budget constraint, Non-negativity, Cardinality penalty

problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
problem.solve()

print("Optimal weights:", w.value)
print("Number of assets:", np.sum(w.value > 1e-6))
```

The penalty term `cp.sum(cp.abs(w)) <= k` approximates the cardinality constraint.  The choice of the penalty parameter (here implicitly 1 through the constraint) influences the trade-off between the number of assets and portfolio risk.  A larger penalty will result in a sparser portfolio (fewer assets), potentially at the cost of higher risk.  Experimentation is crucial to find an appropriate value.  Note that this approach doesn't guarantee exactly *k* assets.


**b)  Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP):** This approach directly incorporates the cardinality constraint using binary variables.  Each asset is assigned a binary variable indicating whether it's included in the portfolio.  This leads to a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP), a class of NP-hard problems.

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

# Problem data (same as before)

# CVXPY model with binary variables
w = cp.Variable(n_assets)
z = cp.Variable(n_assets, boolean=True)
objective = cp.Minimize(cp.quad_form(w, Sigma))
constraints = [cp.sum(w) == 1, w >= 0, w <= z, cp.sum(z) == k]

problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
problem.solve(solver=cp.ECOS_BB) #ECOS_BB or other MIQP solver

print("Optimal weights:", w.value)
print("Number of assets:", np.sum(w.value > 1e-6))
```

Here, `z` represents the binary variables. The constraint `w <= z` ensures that if `z_i` is zero, then `w_i` must also be zero. The constraint `cp.sum(z) == k` enforces the cardinality constraint precisely.  However, solving MIQPs can be computationally expensive, especially for a large number of assets.  The `cp.ECOS_BB` solver (or a similar MIQP-capable solver) is necessary.


**c)  Branch and Bound with CVXPY:** This leverages the capabilities of a solver like SCIP or other branch-and-bound MIQP solvers  to efficiently explore the solution space of the MIQP formulation described above.  While the underlying principle remains the same as in the MIP approach, the branch and bound methodology provides sophisticated mechanisms for pruning the search tree and improving computational performance, especially valuable for large-scale problems. The implementation remains fundamentally similar to the MIP example above, the core change lies in solver selection and potential solver-specific parameters adjustments to optimize the branch-and-bound process.

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

# Problem data (same as before)

# CVXPY model (identical to MIP example)
w = cp.Variable(n_assets)
z = cp.Variable(n_assets, boolean=True)
objective = cp.Minimize(cp.quad_form(w, Sigma))
constraints = [cp.sum(w) == 1, w >= 0, w <= z, cp.sum(z) == k]

problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
problem.solve(solver=cp.SCIP) #SCIP or other suitable solver

print("Optimal weights:", w.value)
print("Number of assets:", np.sum(w.value > 1e-6))
```

This approach requires a solver that supports branch and bound techniques for mixed-integer programs.  SCIP is a powerful open-source solver known for its efficiency in this context.


**3.  Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of portfolio optimization, I strongly recommend "Portfolio Construction and Asset Allocation" by David G. Luenberger.  For a more practical and computational perspective on convex optimization, "Convex Optimization" by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe is invaluable.  Finally, the CVXPY documentation itself offers numerous examples and detailed explanations of solver capabilities.  Thorough understanding of these resources will equip you to address more complex portfolio optimization scenarios.  Careful consideration of the trade-offs between solution quality, computational complexity, and the specific characteristics of your asset data is paramount for successful implementation.
