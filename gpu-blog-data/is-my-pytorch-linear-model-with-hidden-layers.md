The efficacy of a PyTorch linear model, even with hidden layers, hinges critically on the interplay between model architecture, data preprocessing, and the chosen optimization strategy.  My experience debugging numerous neural networks, particularly in the context of time series forecasting and image classification projects, has taught me that seemingly minor adjustments can dramatically impact performance.  Simply stating that a model is "adequate" is insufficient; a rigorous evaluation using multiple metrics is paramount.

**1. A Clear Explanation of Evaluation Criteria:**

Determining adequacy necessitates a multifaceted assessment. Relying solely on a single metric, such as training loss, is misleading.  Overfitting, for instance, can lead to excellent training performance while yielding poor generalization to unseen data.  Therefore, I typically employ a combination of evaluation techniques:

* **Training and Validation Loss Curves:**  Plotting these curves provides insights into model learning dynamics.  A consistently decreasing training loss coupled with a validation loss that plateaus or increases indicates overfitting. Conversely, a stagnating training loss suggests insufficient training or potential issues with the learning rate.  Careful examination reveals whether the model is learning effectively and generalizing well.

* **Performance Metrics:** The choice of metric is task-dependent. For regression tasks, common metrics include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. For classification, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) are frequently used.  The selection should align with the problem's specific goals.  For instance, in a medical diagnosis scenario, high recall (minimizing false negatives) is paramount, even at the cost of some precision.

* **Confusion Matrix (for Classification):**  This matrix provides a granular view of the model's predictions, revealing specific areas of strength and weakness.  High numbers of false positives or false negatives highlight misclassifications and point towards potential areas for improvement, such as data augmentation or feature engineering.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  A model's performance is highly sensitive to hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and the number and size of hidden layers. Systematic hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or randomized search is essential. Early stopping based on validation loss can prevent overfitting.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate key aspects of evaluating a linear model in PyTorch.  Remember that these are simplified examples and should be adapted to your specific data and task.

**Example 1: Basic Model Training and Evaluation:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Define the model
class LinearModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(LinearModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Hyperparameters
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 50
output_size = 1
learning_rate = 0.001
epochs = 100

# Data loading (replace with your data loading)
X_train = torch.randn(100, input_size)
y_train = torch.randn(100, output_size)
X_val = torch.randn(50, input_size)
y_val = torch.randn(50, output_size)

# Model, loss, optimizer
model = LinearModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(X_train)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y_train)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    # Add validation loss calculation here.

# Evaluation
predictions = model(X_val)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_val.detach().numpy(), predictions.detach().numpy())
print(f"MSE: {mse}")
```

This example showcases a basic training loop and MSE calculation.  Crucially, validation loss needs to be included within the training loop to monitor generalization performance.

**Example 2: Plotting Loss Curves:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ... (previous code) ...

train_losses = []
val_losses = []

# Training loop (modified)
for epoch in range(epochs):
    # ... (training steps) ...
    train_losses.append(loss.item())
    with torch.no_grad():
        val_outputs = model(X_val)
        val_loss = criterion(val_outputs, y_val)
        val_losses.append(val_loss.item())

plt.plot(train_losses, label="Train Loss")
plt.plot(val_losses, label="Validation Loss")
plt.xlabel("Epoch")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

This extends the previous example to plot the training and validation loss curves, visually assessing overfitting or underfitting.


**Example 3: Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid Search:**

```python
import itertools

# ... (Model definition) ...

hyperparameters = {
    'learning_rate': [0.001, 0.01, 0.1],
    'hidden_size': [20, 50, 100]
}

best_mse = float('inf')
best_hyperparams = {}

for combination in itertools.product(*hyperparameters.values()):
    lr, hs = combination
    model = LinearModel(input_size, hs, output_size)
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=lr)
    # ... (Training loop with validation loss calculation) ...
    # ... (Evaluate on validation set and update best_mse and best_hyperparams) ...

print(f"Best Hyperparameters: {best_hyperparams}, MSE: {best_mse}")

```

This example demonstrates a rudimentary grid search.  More sophisticated methods like randomized search or Bayesian optimization are preferable for higher-dimensional hyperparameter spaces.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **"Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann:** This book provides a comprehensive introduction to PyTorch and deep learning.
* **PyTorch documentation:**  The official PyTorch documentation is an invaluable resource for understanding functionalities and troubleshooting.
* **"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron:** This book offers a broad perspective on machine learning techniques, many of which are applicable to PyTorch models.  It provides a strong foundation for evaluating model performance.


In conclusion, assessing the adequacy of a PyTorch linear model demands a holistic approach.  Careful monitoring of loss curves, employing relevant performance metrics, visualizing results with confusion matrices (where applicable), and performing thorough hyperparameter tuning are essential steps in building and evaluating effective models.  Ignoring any of these can lead to misinterpretations and ultimately, suboptimal performance.
