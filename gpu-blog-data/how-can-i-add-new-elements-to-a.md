Directly appending elements to a PyTorch tensor, unlike Python lists, isn't a supported operation.  PyTorch tensors are designed for efficient numerical computation on a fixed-size array;  dynamic resizing necessitates creating a new tensor. This is crucial for performance reasons;  frequent resizing would disrupt the underlying memory management and parallelization strategies. My experience optimizing large-scale neural network training has underscored this limitation repeatedly. The optimal approach depends heavily on the contextâ€”specifically, the location and nature of the elements being added.

**1. Concatenation:** This is the most common method for adding elements along an existing dimension.  If you have a new tensor containing the elements you wish to append, `torch.cat()` offers a straightforward solution.  The crucial parameter is `dim`, specifying the dimension along which concatenation occurs.

```python
import torch

# Existing tensor
tensor_a = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# New elements to add
tensor_b = torch.tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Concatenate along dimension 0 (rows)
concatenated_tensor_rows = torch.cat((tensor_a, tensor_b), dim=0)
print(f"Concatenated along rows:\n{concatenated_tensor_rows}")

# Concatenate along dimension 1 (columns)
concatenated_tensor_cols = torch.cat((tensor_a, tensor_b), dim=1)
print(f"Concatenated along columns:\n{concatenated_tensor_cols}")

#Error handling for mismatched dimensions:
try:
  mismatched_tensor = torch.cat((tensor_a, torch.tensor([1,2,3])), dim=0)
except RuntimeError as e:
  print(f"Caught expected RuntimeError: {e}")

```

This example demonstrates the flexibility of `torch.cat()`.  The `RuntimeError` block showcases the importance of ensuring tensors have compatible dimensions along the concatenation axis.  During my work on a video processing pipeline,  I utilized `torch.cat()` extensively to combine feature maps generated from different layers of a convolutional neural network. Mismatched dimensions frequently led to errors, highlighting the need for meticulous dimension checking before concatenation.


**2. Stacking:** If you're adding elements to create a new dimension, `torch.stack()` is preferable to `torch.cat()`.  This function stacks tensors along a new dimension, increasing the tensor's rank.

```python
import torch

# Existing tensor
tensor_a = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])

# New tensors to stack
tensor_b = torch.tensor([4, 5, 6])
tensor_c = torch.tensor([7, 8, 9])

# Stack along a new dimension (dim=0)
stacked_tensor = torch.stack((tensor_a, tensor_b, tensor_c), dim=0)
print(f"Stacked tensor:\n{stacked_tensor}")

# Demonstrating dim parameter flexibility:
stacked_tensor_dim1 = torch.stack((tensor_a,tensor_b,tensor_c), dim=1)
print(f"Stacked tensor along dim 1:\n{stacked_tensor_dim1}")

# Handling potential errors, such as inconsistent tensor shapes within stack:
try:
  inconsistent_stack = torch.stack((tensor_a, tensor_b, torch.tensor([1,2])), dim=0)
except RuntimeError as e:
  print(f"Caught expected RuntimeError due to inconsistent shapes: {e}")
```

In my experience developing a reinforcement learning algorithm,  I used `torch.stack()` to combine observations from different time steps into a single tensor.  The `dim` parameter provided fine-grained control over the resulting tensor's shape, allowing me to efficiently process sequential data.  Note the error handling;  `torch.stack()` requires tensors of identical shape, and failure to comply leads to a `RuntimeError`.


**3.  Reshaping and `torch.nn.functional.pad()`:** For scenarios requiring the addition of single elements or padding, reshaping combined with padding is necessary. This isn't directly appending, but effectively achieves a similar outcome.  `torch.nn.functional.pad()` offers controlled padding.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Existing tensor
tensor_a = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Pad with zeros to add elements
padded_tensor = F.pad(tensor_a, (0, 1, 0, 1), "constant", 0) # pad right, bottom with 1 element each
print(f"Padded tensor:\n{padded_tensor}")

# Reshape to add elements in a specific location
reshaped_tensor = torch.reshape(tensor_a,(1,4)) # flattens then reshapes to add an additional element
reshaped_and_padded = F.pad(reshaped_tensor, (0,1,0,0), "constant", 0)
print(f"Reshaped and padded tensor:\n{reshaped_and_padded}")

# Example of adding padding to a higher-dimensional tensor:
tensor_3d = torch.randn(2,3,4)
padded_3d = F.pad(tensor_3d, (1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0), "constant", 0) #Example adding to height, width.
print(f"Padded 3D tensor shape: {padded_3d.shape}")

# Handling edge cases like negative padding values (raises error):
try:
    incorrect_pad = F.pad(tensor_a, (-1, 1, 0, 1), "constant", 0)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Caught expected ValueError due to invalid padding: {e}")
```

This approach, while indirect, proves useful for specific insertion points.  I've employed this extensively in image processing tasks, adding padding around images to maintain consistent input dimensions for convolutional layers.  The `padding` argument in `F.pad()` specifies the amount of padding for each dimension (left, right, top, bottom).  Remember that incorrect padding values will trigger a `ValueError`.  Understanding the order and sign convention of these values is crucial for successful padding.


**Resource Recommendations:**

* PyTorch documentation.  Thoroughly cover the tensor manipulation section.
*  A comprehensive PyTorch textbook. Pay attention to chapters on tensor operations and memory management.
*  Relevant online tutorials focusing on advanced tensor manipulations.


The key takeaway remains: directly appending to a PyTorch tensor isn't feasible.  Instead, utilize `torch.cat()`, `torch.stack()`, and techniques like reshaping and padding, selecting the most appropriate based on the desired outcome and the structure of your data.  Always prioritize error handling to prevent unexpected behavior stemming from incompatible tensor shapes.  Careful consideration of these methods will ensure efficient and correct tensor manipulation within your PyTorch projects.
