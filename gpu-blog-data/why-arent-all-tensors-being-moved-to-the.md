The incomplete device transfer when using `.to(device)` in PyTorch, especially within complex models or custom training loops, often stems from subtle interactions between tensor creation, module parameter management, and the inherent behavior of Python's object references. A primary cause I’ve encountered repeatedly involves tensors implicitly created or copied within a PyTorch model’s forward pass or through intermediate function calls that bypass the intended device transfer. This is amplified when working with nested structures like lists or dictionaries containing tensors which may require recursive application of the `.to(device)` operation.

The `.to(device)` method in PyTorch is designed to return a *new* tensor on the specified device, rather than modifying the tensor in-place. This key aspect means that simply calling `my_tensor.to(device)` does not alter `my_tensor`’s location; instead, it returns a new tensor object. If you neglect to assign this new tensor back to the original variable or to use it in place of the original, downstream operations may inadvertently use the original tensor which will remain on the initial device. This is not an error in PyTorch; it's a designed behavior that ensures flexibility and avoids unintended side effects. When we consider the context of an entire model, often parameterized tensors (model weights and biases) are also involved and must be explicitly moved to the device.  A failure to move these parameters results in calculations being performed with at least some values on the wrong device, leading to unexpected errors, warnings, or incorrect results.

Further complications can arise from how PyTorch manages device placement when dealing with submodules. A naive approach of calling `.to(device)` on a parent module *does not recursively* transfer all submodules' parameters. If custom layers or functions are constructed that introduce new tensors or parameter-like objects these may not be automatically moved when the parent `.to(device)` is invoked. This lack of recursion must be accounted for by either manually calling `.to(device)` on each submodule or using methods that explicitly handle recursive moves. In-place modifications during operations within a training loop can also contribute to this problem. For example, if one modifies a tensor after transferring it to a device, but a reference to the original tensor was retained, subsequent operations on that original tensor may still execute on the wrong device. The problem is less about `.to(device)` not working and more about the programmer’s handling of the returned tensors, and ensuring appropriate assignment and consistency within complex structures.

To illustrate the issue, consider a simplified scenario with a custom linear layer.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super().__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_features, in_features))
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_features))

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.matmul(x, self.weight.T) + self.bias # Inefficient but illustrative

# Initialize the module
model = CustomLinear(10, 5)
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Move to the device, which is critical but potentially insufficient
model.to(device)

# Dummy Input
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
# No explicit to(device) on the input - potential error

output = model(input_tensor)

print(f"Output Device: {output.device}")  # Likely CPU even with model on CUDA
print(f"Weight Device: {model.weight.device}") # Correctly on CUDA
```

In the above code, the `CustomLinear` model’s parameters (weight and bias) are correctly moved to the specified device by invoking `model.to(device)`. However, the `input_tensor` is initialized by default on the CPU and *never explicitly transferred*. The output tensor will, as a result of operations performed on a mixture of CPU and CUDA tensors, typically be returned on the CPU (or throw errors depending on specific CUDA configurations) , even if the model is on the CUDA device. This demonstrates that individual input data as well as parameter tensors need to be moved to the appropriate device for cohesive operation.

A revised version of the code below would address the issue.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomLinear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super().__init__()
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_features, in_features))
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_features))

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.matmul(x, self.weight.T) + self.bias

# Initialize the module
model = CustomLinear(10, 5)
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Move to the device, which is critical but potentially insufficient
model.to(device)

# Dummy Input
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Now explicitly move input
input_tensor = input_tensor.to(device)

output = model(input_tensor)

print(f"Output Device: {output.device}") # Now correctly on CUDA
print(f"Weight Device: {model.weight.device}") # Correctly on CUDA
```

In this modified example, before passing the input data through the model, we explicitly move the `input_tensor` to the same device using `input_tensor = input_tensor.to(device)`. This ensures the entire computation is performed on the desired device, and that the output is also correctly created on the correct device. The importance of moving all tensors cannot be overstated.  This includes ensuring intermediary tensors are also calculated on the target device, for this reason functions are a key point of consideration.

Further complicating the situation, consider a scenario where a custom function or a library function returns a tuple or list of tensors.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class ExampleModel(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)

  def forward(self, x):
    intermediate = F.relu(self.linear(x))
    return torch.split(intermediate, 2, dim=1) # returns a tuple of tensors

model = ExampleModel()
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
input_tensor = input_tensor.to(device)
outputs = model(input_tensor)

for tensor in outputs:
   print(f"Sub tensor device {tensor.device}") # Will correctly print device, CUDA or CPU

```

In the example above, the `torch.split` function returns a tuple of tensors. Each of these tensors is correctly on the device specified by the original tensors they were generated from. This is an implicit behaviour that many tensor methods posses. However, it must be checked in practice to prevent device mismatches. When working with functions returning data structures, one must still be mindful to verify the tensor’s device on a case-by-case basis when developing custom functions. To handle recursive data structures like nested lists or dictionaries, a utility function is extremely useful.

```python
def recursive_to_device(data, device):
  if isinstance(data, torch.Tensor):
      return data.to(device)
  elif isinstance(data, list):
      return [recursive_to_device(item, device) for item in data]
  elif isinstance(data, dict):
      return {key: recursive_to_device(value, device) for key, value in data.items()}
  else:
      return data

# Within the training loop one can utilise the utility
training_data = [torch.randn(10,10), torch.randn(10,10)]
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
training_data = recursive_to_device(training_data, device)
```

This recursive function, `recursive_to_device`, handles tensors, lists, and dictionaries, ensuring all tensors within these structures are moved to the correct device recursively. Such functions help in maintaining consistent device placement during training.

For further study on these topics, I suggest reviewing the PyTorch documentation which extensively covers the details of tensor creation and device management. Additionally, researching best practices for model training loops will often reveal patterns and strategies that directly address tensor device handling. Lastly, examining open source training implementations, especially in areas using complex models, can provide many practical examples of how tensors are moved and managed.  Understanding that the `.to()` method creates copies rather than applying in place and that it is the responsibility of the programmer to manage these copies is fundamental to solving device issues. It is less about the `.to()` method not working, and more about the need to explicitly and consistently manage tensor placement.
