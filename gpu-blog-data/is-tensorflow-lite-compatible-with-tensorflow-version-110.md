TensorFlow Lite's compatibility with TensorFlow 1.1.0 is not directly supported; there's no straightforward, officially sanctioned conversion path.  My experience developing embedded machine learning solutions over the past five years has consistently highlighted this limitation.  TensorFlow Lite's evolution prioritized newer TensorFlow versions, focusing on improved performance and features that weren't present in the 1.x branch.  Attempting a direct conversion will invariably lead to errors and require extensive workarounds.

**1. Explanation of Incompatibility:**

TensorFlow 1.1.0 predates many key architectural changes implemented in later TensorFlow versions, including the introduction of eager execution and the significant refactoring of the core APIs.  TensorFlow Lite, as a mobile-optimized framework, is built upon these later architectural advancements. Its converter relies heavily on the structure and functionality implemented in TensorFlow 2 and beyond.  Specifically, the `tf.compat.v1` module, designed for backward compatibility, does not offer a complete bridge for all operations available in 1.1.0.  Many op implementations have been rewritten or optimized differently, leading to incompatibilities during the conversion process.  Furthermore, the conversion process itself relies on more recent TensorFlow versions to parse and transform the graph.  Simply put, the tooling required to translate a 1.1.0 model doesn't exist within the TensorFlow Lite ecosystem.

The core issue stems from the fundamental differences in graph representation and execution. TensorFlow 1.x heavily relied on static computation graphs, requiring the entire graph to be defined before execution.  TensorFlow 2 and later versions embraced eager execution, allowing for more dynamic and interactive graph building.  TensorFlow Lite's converter expects models built under this later paradigm, making direct conversion from 1.1.0 models problematic.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the challenges and potential pitfalls.  Remember, these examples are simplified for illustrative purposes and would require modifications depending on the specific model architecture from 1.1.0.

**Example 1:  Attempting Direct Conversion (Failure):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf # Assuming TensorFlow 2 or later is installed

# Load the TensorFlow 1.1.0 model (hypothetical loading)
try:
    model_1_1_0 = tf.compat.v1.saved_model.load("path/to/my/1.1.0/model")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
    exit(1)

# Attempt to convert using TensorFlow Lite Converter (This will likely fail)
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model("path/to/my/1.1.0/model")
tflite_model = converter.convert()

# Save the TensorFlow Lite model (This step is unlikely to be reached)
with open("converted_model.tflite", "wb") as f:
  f.write(tflite_model)
```

This example highlights the most direct (and failing) approach.  The `tf.compat.v1` module attempts to bridge the gap, but the converter may encounter unsupported operations or graph structures, leading to errors during conversion.

**Example 2:  Illustrative Model Modification (Partial Solution):**

This example demonstrates the substantial changes needed to a 1.1.0 model before conversion might be considered.

```python
import tensorflow as tf # Assuming TensorFlow 2 or later

# Create a simple TensorFlow 2 model (Replacement Model)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Train the model (Using TensorFlow 2 training mechanisms)
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Convert this modified model to TensorFlow Lite
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()

# Save the TensorFlow Lite model
with open("converted_model.tflite", "wb") as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)

```

This example shows building a functional equivalent in a compatible TensorFlow version.  This requires rewriting the original 1.1.0 model's architecture and training process within a newer TensorFlow environment.  It is not a conversion, but a recreation.


**Example 3: Using a Keras Model and SavedModel (Improved Approach):**

This example utilizes Keras, which offered better compatibility across TensorFlow versions, at least to a greater extent than the raw TensorFlow API in 1.1.0. Note that even with Keras, complete compatibility isn't guaranteed without modifications.

```python
import tensorflow as tf # TensorFlow 2 or later

# Assume a Keras model exists, even if originally created in TensorFlow 1.1.0 (Hypothetical Situation)
# This requires significant restructuring to work reliably.
# It would likely involve using Keras's functional or sequential API.
# Assuming its been appropriately rewritten for TensorFlow 2

# Save the model as a SavedModel (TensorFlow 2 Compatible format)
tf.saved_model.save(model, "keras_model")

# Convert the SavedModel using TFLiteConverter
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model("keras_model")
tflite_model = converter.convert()
with open("converted_model.tflite", "wb") as f:
  f.write(tflite_model)
```

This approach attempts to leverage the more stable Keras interface, but the underlying operations still need to be compatible with TensorFlow Lite. The conversion might still fail if operations used in the original 1.1.0 model were not supported in later TensorFlow versions.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on TensorFlow Lite and model conversion, should be your primary resource.  Furthermore, studying TensorFlow 2's API changes compared to 1.x will be crucial for understanding the incompatibilities. Consult the official TensorFlow Lite guides on model optimization and quantization techniques for improving performance on resource-constrained devices.  Finally, exploring examples and tutorials focused on converting Keras models to TensorFlow Lite will be highly beneficial.


In conclusion, direct conversion of a TensorFlow 1.1.0 model to TensorFlow Lite is not feasible.  The significant architectural differences between TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2, upon which TensorFlow Lite is built, necessitate substantial model rewriting and adaptation.  The process is not simply a matter of using a conversion tool; it requires a deep understanding of TensorFlow's evolution and the capabilities of TensorFlow Lite.
