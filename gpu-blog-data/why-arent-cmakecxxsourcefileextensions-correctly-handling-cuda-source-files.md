The core issue stems from CMake's default `CMAKE_CXX_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS` variable not including file extensions commonly used for CUDA code involving Thrust libraries, specifically `.cu` files when these files also implicitly rely on C++ features. CMake, by default, primarily looks for file extensions like `.cpp`, `.cc`, and `.cxx` to identify C++ source files. Thrust, being a header-only library designed to operate on GPU resources using CUDA, often leads to the creation of `.cu` files that contain both CUDA-specific kernels and standard C++ code. This combination isn't automatically recognized by CMake for standard compilation.

The consequence is that when compiling a project using CMake, and when `.cu` files are present that leverage Thrust, these files might not be correctly identified as C++ source files for which the C++ compiler should be invoked. This often results in compilation errors or build failures, as the CUDA compiler, `nvcc`, is not directly called on them by CMake within its standard C++ compilation routine. CMake, unless explicitly configured, doesn't treat `.cu` files as requiring C++ compilation, nor does it know that `.cu` files utilizing Thrust require an invocation that passes the `.cu` file to the CUDA compiler. The misunderstanding arises from the fact that these files aren't solely CUDA or C++ but a hybrid, requiring specific build directives. I've encountered this situation in multiple projects, most notably during a large-scale simulation environment where we were integrating heterogeneous computing with CUDA and C++17. Standard CMake setups consistently overlooked these mixed `.cu` files, resulting in linker errors from undefined symbols originating from the C++ side of the Thrust calls.

To illustrate, if you have a file named `my_thrust_kernel.cu` which includes Thrust headers and contains both a CUDA kernel and some standard C++ logic (such as a `std::vector` allocation and population before being passed to the kernel), a default CMake configuration, without explicit customization, will not correctly process this. It will see the file, but will likely ignore it entirely or, if CMake has been configured to understand `.cu` as CUDA, will not pass it correctly to the C++ compiler as well. CMake must be told to use `nvcc` as a C++ compiler for these kinds of `.cu` files.

Let's look at a few code examples with commentary.

**Example 1: Basic CMakeLists.txt Without CUDA Awareness**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(thrust_example)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

add_executable(my_app my_thrust_kernel.cu main.cpp)
```

In this example, the `CMakeLists.txt` is basic and assumes that `my_thrust_kernel.cu` is a generic C++ source file. CMake will attempt to compile it using the standard C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` or `clang++`), which will result in compilation failure because the CUDA code is not understandable by a C++ compiler. Compilation will either halt immediately or report a multitude of errors due to the unrecognized CUDA syntax and the usage of Thrust-specific types. It will also not appropriately pass necessary CUDA compiler flags. `main.cpp`, assumed to exist, may compile but will ultimately fail at link time.

**Example 2: Improved CMakeLists.txt with CUDA but Still Incorrect**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(thrust_example)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_app my_thrust_kernel.cu main.cpp)
set_source_files_properties(my_thrust_kernel.cu PROPERTIES CUDA_SOURCE_PROPERTY TRUE)
```
Here, weâ€™ve added `find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)` which initializes CUDA build support. We also added `set_source_files_properties(... CUDA_SOURCE_PROPERTY TRUE)`. While this correctly identifies that `my_thrust_kernel.cu` is a CUDA source file that needs to be processed by nvcc, the problem is that CMake's handling of CUDA source files, by default, does not explicitly invoke nvcc in such a way that the resulting code is treated as both C++ and CUDA. The file is flagged as CUDA, and is processed by `nvcc`, but may not be passed to the C++ compiler, which means code in the `.cu` file that isn't CUDA will be omitted. Again, we would still likely encounter errors at compile and link times, as some C++ code would be present in the `.cu` file that is required by the main program, and will not have been compiled as C++. The main program will also not be aware of the CUDA code generated by `nvcc`.

**Example 3: Corrected CMakeLists.txt using `CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE`**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(thrust_example)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE(my_app my_thrust_kernel.cu main.cpp)
```

This is the correct approach. Using the `CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE` function handles `.cu` files correctly by calling `nvcc`, and it also arranges the correct linking between standard C++ code and the code generated by the CUDA compiler. The function automatically recognizes that both CUDA and C++ compilation are necessary for the compilation unit, and passes the `.cu` files to nvcc and handles the result so they are correctly linked. This approach ensures that the required code generated by both C++ and the CUDA compiler is available and linked into the final executable. The `CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE` function intelligently combines the C++ and CUDA compilation steps.

In conclusion, the lack of awareness regarding mixed CUDA and C++ in `.cu` files that use Thrust, especially with CMake's default settings, is a common pitfall. The fundamental issue stems from a mismatch between CMake's default C++ source file extension recognition and the reality of Thrust-based CUDA programming. The solution involves moving beyond standard C++ compilation commands when dealing with `.cu` files containing a mixture of CUDA and C++ code, ensuring the `.cu` file is compiled by both a C++ compiler and `nvcc`, and that the resulting object files are correctly linked.

For resources, the CMake documentation on CUDA, especially the descriptions of `find_package(CUDA)`, and `CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE`/`CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY` are indispensable. Reading the documentation for CUDA and particularly Thrust itself, also provides insight into project structuring when working with GPU acceleration. Reviewing CMake examples that involve CUDA compilation beyond basic cases also proves highly useful. Finally, the NVIDIA developer documentation provides a detailed explanation of `nvcc` command-line options and how they relate to both C++ and CUDA compilation is very beneficial.
