Accessing neural network weights at specific epoch intervals during training is crucial for various tasks, including model analysis, visualization, and implementing complex training strategies. Often, the default training loop focuses solely on minimizing loss, obscuring the evolution of the model’s learned parameters. I've frequently needed this functionality in my previous work on dynamic network architectures and found that using callbacks, a common feature in many deep learning frameworks, provides the most flexible and efficient approach.

The core issue lies in the fact that training is typically a continuous process that updates weights after each batch or epoch. To obtain weights at designated intervals, we need a mechanism to intercept the training loop and extract the weights at the desired points. Callbacks provide such a mechanism. They are functions that are called at various stages of the training process, such as the beginning of an epoch, the end of an epoch, the beginning of a batch, the end of a batch, etc. By implementing a custom callback, we can hook into the end of an epoch and retrieve the weights. This approach avoids modifying the core training loop and allows for modular, reusable code.

Furthermore, the method of weight extraction can vary depending on the deep learning library being used. In Keras and TensorFlow, weights are typically accessed through the model object’s `get_weights()` method. PyTorch uses a different approach, accessing the weight tensors via the model’s parameters using the `named_parameters()` method. Understanding these library-specific differences is essential to correctly extracting weights. Additionally, the extracted weights need a proper storage mechanism; a simple list, dictionary, or dedicated data store depending on the use case. Finally, it's important to consider the memory implications of storing weight matrices for each epoch. For very large models and extended training periods, an alternate strategy, like writing to disk, might be necessary.

Here are three code examples, demonstrating callback usage for weight extraction across these libraries:

**Example 1: Keras/TensorFlow**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np

class WeightExtractionCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, epochs_to_track, weight_store):
        super(WeightExtractionCallback, self).__init__()
        self.epochs_to_track = epochs_to_track # List of epochs
        self.weight_store = weight_store

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        if epoch in self.epochs_to_track:
            weights = self.model.get_weights()
            self.weight_store[epoch] = weights
            print(f'Weights saved at epoch: {epoch}')


# Create a simple model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Generate dummy data
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Setup the tracking epochs and storage
epochs_to_track = [5, 10, 15]
weight_store = {}

# Instantiate callback and start training
weight_extraction_callback = WeightExtractionCallback(epochs_to_track, weight_store)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=20, callbacks=[weight_extraction_callback], verbose=0)

# Access weights for epoch 10
weights_at_epoch_10 = weight_store.get(10)
if weights_at_epoch_10:
    print(f'Extracted weights at epoch 10, number of arrays:{len(weights_at_epoch_10)}')
else:
    print('Weights at epoch 10 not available')
```

In this example, I define `WeightExtractionCallback` as a class that inherits from `tf.keras.callbacks.Callback`. The `on_epoch_end` method intercepts the training loop after each epoch finishes. It checks if the current epoch is present in the list of epochs (`epochs_to_track`). If the condition is true, it uses the model's `get_weights()` method to retrieve the weights and saves them into a provided dictionary (`weight_store`). The subsequent training process then uses the callback via the `callbacks` argument in the `fit()` method. After training, you can access the stored weights using the `weight_store` dictionary.

**Example 2: PyTorch**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader
import numpy as np


class WeightExtractionCallback():
    def __init__(self, epochs_to_track, weight_store):
        self.epochs_to_track = epochs_to_track # List of epochs
        self.weight_store = weight_store

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, model):
        if epoch in self.epochs_to_track:
            weights = {name: param.data.clone() for name, param in model.named_parameters()}
            self.weight_store[epoch] = weights
            print(f'Weights saved at epoch: {epoch}')


# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 10)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.sigmoid(self.fc2(x))
        return x

# Initialize model, loss, and optimizer
model = SimpleModel()
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())

# Generate dummy data
x_train = torch.randn(100, 10)
y_train = torch.randint(0, 2, (100, 1)).float()
train_dataset = TensorDataset(x_train, y_train)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32)

# Setup the tracking epochs and storage
epochs_to_track = [5, 10, 15]
weight_store = {}
weight_extraction_callback = WeightExtractionCallback(epochs_to_track, weight_store)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(20):
    for inputs, labels in train_loader:
      optimizer.zero_grad()
      outputs = model(inputs)
      loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
      loss.backward()
      optimizer.step()

    weight_extraction_callback.on_epoch_end(epoch, model)

# Access the weights of epoch 10
weights_at_epoch_10 = weight_store.get(10)
if weights_at_epoch_10:
    print(f'Extracted weights at epoch 10, number of param tensors:{len(weights_at_epoch_10)}')
else:
    print('Weights at epoch 10 not available')
```

In PyTorch, the weights are accessed differently. There is no `get_weights()` method. Instead, the `named_parameters()` method of the model provides an iterator that yields the name and parameter (weight) tensor for each trainable parameter. I’ve changed the callback to accept the model as a parameter and to extract and store the weights by looping over the `named_parameters()`. This demonstrates the adaptability of callbacks across different libraries. The weights are stored as a dictionary with named keys. The training loop is manually written for simplicity, and the callback `on_epoch_end` method is invoked explicitly.

**Example 3: Handling Large Weights with Disk Storage**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np
import os
import h5py

class WeightExtractionCallbackDisk(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, epochs_to_track, output_dir):
        super(WeightExtractionCallbackDisk, self).__init__()
        self.epochs_to_track = epochs_to_track
        self.output_dir = output_dir
        os.makedirs(self.output_dir, exist_ok=True)

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        if epoch in self.epochs_to_track:
            weights = self.model.get_weights()
            file_path = os.path.join(self.output_dir, f'weights_epoch_{epoch}.h5')
            with h5py.File(file_path, 'w') as hf:
                for i, weight_array in enumerate(weights):
                    hf.create_dataset(f'weight_{i}', data=weight_array)
            print(f'Weights saved at epoch: {epoch} to {file_path}')

# Create a simple model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(500, activation='relu', input_shape=(1000,)),
    layers.Dense(500, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Generate dummy data
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 1000)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Setup tracking epochs and directory
epochs_to_track = [5, 10, 15]
output_dir = 'weight_checkpoints'

# Instantiate callback and train
weight_extraction_callback = WeightExtractionCallbackDisk(epochs_to_track, output_dir)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=20, callbacks=[weight_extraction_callback], verbose=0)


# Load weights from epoch 10
epoch_to_load = 10
file_path = os.path.join(output_dir, f'weights_epoch_{epoch_to_load}.h5')
loaded_weights = []

if os.path.exists(file_path):
    with h5py.File(file_path, 'r') as hf:
        for key in hf.keys():
            loaded_weights.append(hf[key][:])
    print(f'Loaded weights from {file_path}, number of arrays: {len(loaded_weights)}')
else:
    print(f'Weight file not found for epoch: {epoch_to_load}')
```

This example shows how to store weights to disk using `h5py` to address potential memory issues with large models or extended training. The `WeightExtractionCallbackDisk` saves weights to hdf5 files which can be subsequently loaded. The weights are saved and accessed using the same method as before, but the data is streamed to and from the disk.

For further study, I suggest exploring the documentation provided by the specific deep learning library you are using. Additionally, research on the concepts of callbacks and model serialization can provide a deeper understanding. Furthermore, understanding data structures for managing weight storage based on model scale and desired retrieval efficiency is vital. Consider examining advanced data storage methods if your project requires it.
