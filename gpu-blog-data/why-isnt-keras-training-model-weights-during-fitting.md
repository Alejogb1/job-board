In my experience debugging numerous Keras-based neural networks, a common pitfall arises when the model appears to train without modifying its weights—a situation where the loss function plateaus or even fluctuates randomly, and accuracy remains stubbornly static. The primary cause, barring outright coding errors such as not defining trainable layers, nearly always stems from a misalignment between the input data format and the model’s expected input structure or an improperly configured optimizer. This often manifests subtly, leading to a frustrating debugging process unless one understands the underlying mechanics. The optimizer, specifically, plays a crucial role in updating the model weights based on the calculated gradients. If these gradients are not correctly computed or applied, the weights will not change.

To unpack this, I need to address the most common scenarios. First, consider input data issues. Deep learning models, particularly those built with Keras, are sensitive to the shape and type of input data they receive. It is imperative to ensure the data fed to the model during training matches the input layer's expected shape. A mismatch can inadvertently create situations where the model processes zero or near-zero data, effectively preventing updates to the weights. For example, if a convolutional neural network (CNN) expects a 3D tensor representing images, but receives only 1D vectors, the model will likely fail to compute appropriate gradients. Second, consider the configuration of the optimizer. An optimizer with a learning rate that is set too low will result in extremely minor adjustments to the model’s weights in each epoch, causing the loss function to plateau prematurely. In contrast, a learning rate that is set too high might cause the loss to fluctuate wildly, preventing the model from converging on a suitable set of weights. Also, the choice of a specific optimizer might not be appropriate for a given problem space.

Let’s illustrate these issues with code examples.

**Code Example 1: Input Data Shape Mismatch**

This example showcases a scenario where a model designed for image data receives input in an incorrect format, hindering weight updates. Here I’ll intentionally create a simplistic model meant to accept image data (specifically a grayscale image) but feed it a flat vector.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define a simple convolutional model expecting (28, 28, 1) input
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Create a dummy 1D input
dummy_input_1d = np.random.rand(100, 784) # 100 samples of size 784

# Create dummy 1D labels
dummy_labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100) # 100 integer labels

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Attempt to train the model - THIS WILL FAIL
model.fit(dummy_input_1d, dummy_labels, epochs=10) #Note how the input shape doesn't match expectations
```

*Commentary:* In this example, the `Conv2D` layer is configured to expect a 3D input tensor of shape `(28, 28, 1)`, representing grayscale images. However, the `dummy_input_1d` is a 2D tensor of shape `(100, 784)`. This dimensional mismatch prevents TensorFlow from performing the necessary operations required to update the model’s weights during training, as the gradient calculations fail within the convolutional layers due to the improper input shape. The training process will seemingly execute, but there will be no updates to the weights as the inputs are not shaped correctly, rendering the gradients invalid. The model's loss and accuracy would remain relatively constant.

**Code Example 2: Ineffective Optimizer Learning Rate**

This example demonstrates the effect of an exceedingly low learning rate, which practically stalls any adjustments to the model’s weights. I’m building a basic dense neural network.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define a simple Dense model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])


# Create a dummy input (10 features)
dummy_input_2d = np.random.rand(100, 10) #100 examples, 10 features

# Create dummy integer labels
dummy_labels = np.random.randint(0,10,100)

# Compile the model with a VERY low learning rate
optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.000001)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer,
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(dummy_input_2d, dummy_labels, epochs=10)
```
*Commentary:* Here, the Adam optimizer is configured with an extremely low learning rate of `0.000001`. The extremely small weight updates applied during each iteration will cause the model to learn very slowly, potentially leading to the appearance that no learning is taking place. The gradients might be calculated correctly, but their effects are insignificant at this learning rate. As a result, the loss will decrease imperceptibly slowly and the accuracy will remain effectively unchanged across epochs. This is akin to adjusting a steering wheel by a hair's breadth repeatedly – progress is negligible.

**Code Example 3: Unsuitable Optimizer**

This example illustrates an instance of using an optimizer that is unsuitable for a given task. While the learning rate may be appropriate, the selected algorithm itself might not provide the best results. I will again demonstrate this using a basic model, but this time, I'll use Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum as the optimizer, although Adam is almost always the preferred first choice.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Define a simple Dense model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Create a dummy input
dummy_input_2d = np.random.rand(100, 10) #100 examples with 10 features

# Create dummy integer labels
dummy_labels = np.random.randint(0,10,100)

# Compile the model with SGD with momentum
optimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.001, momentum=0.9)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer,
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(dummy_input_2d, dummy_labels, epochs=10)

```
*Commentary:* In this example, SGD with momentum is used as the optimizer. While SGD with momentum is a valid optimizer, it often requires significantly more careful tuning of the learning rate than Adam. This can result in a situation where SGD does not converge, and the model will not update weights effectively. In many cases, Adam provides better results "out of the box", and can serve as a diagnostic tool, by which to assess whether there is a genuine training issue or just one due to an unsuitable optimizer.

These examples illustrate just a few of the possible issues one might face when training deep learning models in Keras. In most situations where no weights appear to be updated, the cause lies in incorrect data shaping, an inadequate optimizer configuration, or an inappropriate choice of optimizer itself. Correctly matching the input data to the model's expectations, selecting a suitable optimizer, and tuning the learning rate are critical steps to ensure the model learns appropriately. The model must receive training data in the correct format to allow it to learn from the inputs.

To further investigate these types of issues, several resources can be beneficial. Firstly, the Keras documentation is an indispensable resource for understanding the expectations and proper usage of each layer and optimizer. The official TensorFlow documentation provides further in-depth details concerning each of the layers, activation functions, and optimizers used in the Keras interface. The wealth of online discussions, questions and answers, such as StackOverflow, can offer additional perspectives and solutions specific to various edge cases. Reading research papers on optimizer algorithms and their tuning can also provide a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind weight updates. Thoroughly examining these areas and systematically addressing any potential conflicts between inputs and model design will almost always yield the necessary information to resolve most of these problems.
