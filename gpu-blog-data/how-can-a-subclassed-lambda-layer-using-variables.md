Subclassing lambda layers in Keras (or TensorFlow) introduces a unique challenge when the lambda function relies on trainable variables. The default behavior of lambda layers doesn't automatically track these variables, preventing backpropagation and effective training. The key lies in explicitly defining the trainable parameters within the subclass, essentially transforming the lambda functionality into a fully recognized layer by Keras.

When I first encountered this problem, it was within a complex NLP project involving attention mechanisms. I had initially used a lambda layer to perform a custom weighted sum of embeddings, using a separate, learnable weight vector. Despite defining the weights as `tf.Variable`, training stalled. It became apparent that Keras wasn't recognizing those variables as belonging to the layer's computational graph.

The solution resides in overriding the `build` and `call` methods of `tf.keras.layers.Layer` when subclassing it, effectively moving away from the lambda function's limited context. In essence, we’re not just wrapping a function; we’re building a custom, trainable Keras layer. We need to explicitly define our trainable variables within the `build` method, and then utilize them inside the `call` method, where the layer’s computation actually occurs.

Here’s a breakdown of why this approach works and how to implement it:

The `build` method is invoked automatically when the layer is first used, and it receives the shape of the input tensor. This allows us to dynamically define the shape and initialize the trainable variables based on the input characteristics. By calling `self.add_weight` in the `build` method, we inform Keras that these variables are integral parts of the layer and should participate in training.

The `call` method, on the other hand, is where the actual computation happens. Here, we can use our initialized trainable weights to perform the transformation of the input tensor, effectively implementing our desired functionality. Critically, since we have declared the weights within the `build` method using `self.add_weight`, Keras now understands their role in the computation and ensures they are part of the backpropagation during training. The lambda function becomes a functional part of our model's network, rather than a black box with unknown parameters.

Here are three code examples that illustrate the solution:

**Example 1: A Simple Weighted Sum**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class WeightedSumLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(WeightedSumLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.weight = None

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.weight = self.add_weight(name='weight',
                                     shape=(input_shape[-1],),
                                     initializer='ones',
                                     trainable=True)
        super(WeightedSumLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.reduce_sum(inputs * self.weight, axis=-1, keepdims=True)

# Example usage
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
weighted_sum = WeightedSumLayer()(input_tensor)
print(weighted_sum)
```

This example showcases the basic structure. The `build` method creates a weight vector with the same dimensionality as the last dimension of the input. We use an initializer of 'ones' for simplicity but other initializers can be used. The `call` method multiplies the input by this learned weight and then sums across the last axis, effectively performing a weighted sum operation. During training, the ‘weight’ variable will be adjusted by backpropagation.

**Example 2: A Learnable Shift**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class LearnableShiftLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(LearnableShiftLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.bias = None

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.bias = self.add_weight(name='bias',
                                    shape=(1,),
                                    initializer='zeros',
                                    trainable=True)
        super(LearnableShiftLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return inputs + self.bias

# Example usage
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
shifted_tensor = LearnableShiftLayer()(input_tensor)
print(shifted_tensor)
```

This example shows a learnable bias. The `build` method creates a scalar trainable `bias`, initialized to zero. The `call` method adds this bias to every element of the input. This is essentially a trainable shift operation. The crucial element is that this bias will be learned in backpropagation.

**Example 3: More Complex Weight Application**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class ComplexWeightLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, output_dim, **kwargs):
        super(ComplexWeightLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.output_dim = output_dim
        self.kernel = None

    def build(self, input_shape):
        input_dim = input_shape[-1]
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(name='kernel',
                                       shape=(input_dim, self.output_dim),
                                       initializer='glorot_uniform',
                                       trainable=True)
        super(ComplexWeightLayer, self).build(input_shape)


    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel)

# Example usage
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
weighted_tensor = ComplexWeightLayer(output_dim=3)(input_tensor)
print(weighted_tensor)
```

This example introduces a more complex scenario where a matrix multiplication with a learnable kernel is performed. Here, the `build` method creates a `kernel` matrix of appropriate dimensions for the matrix multiplication. The `call` method performs the matrix multiplication. This is very similar to the computations done by a Dense layer, but the principle shows the flexibility of explicitly defining the computation within our custom layers.

The fundamental concept across these examples is the explicit declaration of trainable parameters using `self.add_weight` within the layer's `build` method and then using these parameters within its `call` method. This process ensures that Keras recognizes these variables and incorporates them into the training process through backpropagation.

When working with subclassed layers like these, proper initialization of trainable parameters and ensuring the compatibility of tensor shapes is critical. Input shape mismatch during a call will likely cause exceptions. In my experience, debugging layers often involves very careful consideration of shapes within the `build` and `call` methods and thorough testing of the backpropagation.

For continued learning on this topic, I recommend exploring the official TensorFlow documentation on custom layers, specifically the sections detailing layer building and call methods. I also suggest studying the Keras example codebases that use subclassing extensively. Additionally, books dedicated to advanced deep learning concepts often contain chapters on custom layers and how they fit in the larger context of complex network architectures, with a specific focus on trainable parameters within these custom layers.
