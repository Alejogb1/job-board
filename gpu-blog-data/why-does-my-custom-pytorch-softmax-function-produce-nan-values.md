The primary reason a custom PyTorch softmax function outputs NaN values, especially when working with neural networks, often stems from numerical instability issues when calculating exponentials within the function. Specifically, the exponential of large positive numbers can result in overflow, which then propagates into division operations leading to NaN. I have personally encountered this during the development of a deep learning model for image segmentation, where intermediate feature maps with large values caused this exact problem with a custom softmax I had initially implemented.

The standard softmax function takes a vector of scores (logits) as input and converts them into a probability distribution. Mathematically, for a vector *x* with *n* elements, the softmax of the *i*-th element is defined as:

softmax(x_i) = exp(x_i) / Σ exp(x_j) for j = 1 to n

Directly implementing this formula can be problematic. When elements *x_i* are large, exp(x_i) becomes extremely large, approaching infinity. This can lead to overflows in the floating-point representation, generating `inf` values. Subsequently, dividing one `inf` by another can result in `NaN`. Conversely, if the numbers are very small, close to zero, underflows can cause similar numerical issues. These effects are exacerbated in deep networks where intermediate activations can reach these extreme values.

A common solution to address this is to subtract the maximum value in the input vector from each element before exponentiation. This operation does not change the final probability distribution since we are scaling the input values by a constant that is applied to both the numerator and denominator of the softmax equation, and does not modify the ratios between the exponentiated values. The new calculation becomes:

softmax(x_i) = exp(x_i - max(x)) / Σ exp(x_j - max(x)) for j = 1 to n

This shift keeps values to exponentiate closer to 0, avoiding the numerical instability described earlier. The implementation should also consider using numerically stable log-softmax calculation when this operation is needed in conjunction with a loss function like NLLLoss (Negative Log Likelihood Loss), which is a common practice in PyTorch. In my past projects, using the combination of log-softmax with NLLLoss significantly improved the stability of my models compared to using softmax and log functions separately.

Here are three code examples illustrating the issue and its solution:

**Example 1: Naive Implementation (Produces NaN)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

def naive_softmax(x):
    exp_x = torch.exp(x)
    return exp_x / torch.sum(exp_x, dim=-1, keepdim=True)

# Generating large values to trigger the problem
x = torch.tensor([[1000.0, 2000.0, 3000.0],
                  [4000.0, 5000.0, 6000.0]])

try:
  result = naive_softmax(x)
  print("Naive Softmax:", result)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during naive softmax calculation: {e}")

# Demonstrating that PyTorch native version doesn't have this issue
softmax_native = nn.Softmax(dim=-1)
result_native = softmax_native(x)
print("PyTorch Softmax:", result_native)


```

This first code block demonstrates the problematic behavior of a naive softmax implementation when given large input values. The `naive_softmax` function, implemented directly from the formula, leads to the `RuntimeWarning` and results in NaN output. This illustrates the overflow issue mentioned above. Simultaneously, the native PyTorch `nn.Softmax` function, which includes the numerical stability optimization, handles these values without issues and returns valid probability distributions. The error handling is included to capture and display any exceptions during calculation.

**Example 2: Stable Softmax Implementation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn


def stable_softmax(x):
    x_max = torch.max(x, dim=-1, keepdim=True).values
    exp_x = torch.exp(x - x_max)
    return exp_x / torch.sum(exp_x, dim=-1, keepdim=True)

# Generating large values that caused problems with the naive function
x = torch.tensor([[1000.0, 2000.0, 3000.0],
                  [4000.0, 5000.0, 6000.0]])

result = stable_softmax(x)
print("Stable Softmax:", result)
```

This code block introduces the stable version of the softmax function. Here, the `stable_softmax` function calculates the maximum of the input along the specified dimension (`dim=-1`), then subtracts this maximum from the original input before exponentiation. This step significantly improves the numerical stability of the calculation and results in accurate probabilities even with large input numbers. The output here, which previously resulted in `NaN`, now produces valid output.

**Example 3: Log-Softmax with NLLLoss**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Example Usage, this function is to be used with NLLLoss to improve training stability.
def log_softmax(x):
  x_max = torch.max(x, dim=-1, keepdim=True).values
  return x - x_max - torch.log(torch.sum(torch.exp(x-x_max),dim=-1, keepdim=True))


# Generate sample logits
logits = torch.randn(4, 3) * 50  # Scale logits to simulate high values
target = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2, 0])  # Sample target values

# Calculate Log-Softmax
log_probs = log_softmax(logits)
# Define NLLLoss
nll_loss = nn.NLLLoss()

# Compute loss
loss = nll_loss(log_probs, target)
print("Loss with Log-Softmax & NLLLoss:", loss.item())

# Native PyTorch equivalent.
log_softmax_native = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=-1)
nll_loss_native = nn.NLLLoss()

log_probs_native = log_softmax_native(logits)
loss_native = nll_loss_native(log_probs_native, target)
print("Native Loss:", loss_native.item())
```

This final example showcases the recommended use of log-softmax together with `nn.NLLLoss`. The custom `log_softmax` function computes the logarithm of the softmax function directly for better numeric precision, and works better in conjuntion with the loss function. When combined with `nn.NLLLoss`, this approach provides the same functional result as directly applying softmax to calculate loss, but provides better numerical stability to the training pipeline. The output of this loss, in practice, is typically much more stable when used in deep learning models. It's compared with the `nn.LogSoftmax` + `nn.NLLLoss` PyTorch native implementation, and it can be seen that both achieve very similar loss. This is the standard way that the output layer should be implemented for classification tasks.

For further learning and debugging related numerical issues in deep learning, I suggest exploring the PyTorch documentation on the `nn.Softmax` and `nn.LogSoftmax` functions; it goes into further depth regarding numerical stability. The documentation for `nn.NLLLoss` and other loss functions is also useful to understand their properties and when to use certain functions. Also, reading research papers, online articles, and blog posts discussing techniques for improving numerical stability in deep learning would be beneficial. Furthermore, engaging in the PyTorch community forums, or reviewing other questions on StackOverflow regarding softmax and NaN issues can help provide additional perspectives and solutions. Understanding underlying mathematical principles and implementing the techniques presented, such as shifting the input for exponential calculation or the use of log-softmax, is essential for reliable and stable deep learning model development.
