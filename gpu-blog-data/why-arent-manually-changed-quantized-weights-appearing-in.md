The issue of manually altered quantized weights not reflecting in the `state_dict()` stems fundamentally from the way PyTorch handles quantization and the lifecycle of tensors within a model.  My experience debugging similar problems in large-scale deployment projects for image recognition models has highlighted this critical point:  PyTorch's quantization modules often create detached copies of tensors rather than modifying the underlying parameters in place.  This behavior, while seemingly counterintuitive, is a deliberate design choice aimed at maintaining numerical stability and compatibility with various optimization techniques.  Understanding this distinction is key to resolving the observed discrepancy.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

When you quantize a model, particularly using techniques like post-training quantization or quantization-aware training, PyTorch utilizes specialized modules (e.g., `torch.quantization.QuantStub`, `torch.nn.quantized.Linear`) that manage the quantization process. These modules typically don't directly overwrite the original weight tensors within the model's `state_dict()`. Instead, they create quantized representations stored internally within the quantized modules.  These representations are used during the forward pass for inference, enabling efficient computation with reduced precision.  However, the original, unquantized weights often remain untouched, persisting within the model's `state_dict()`, unaffected by the manual modifications you've made to the quantized versions.

The consequence is that the `state_dict()` will reflect the state *before* quantization, or any subsequent manual adjustments to the quantized tensors. To observe the effects of manual changes, you must access the quantized weights directly through the quantized module instances, not via the `state_dict()`.  Attempting to alter quantized weights and then expecting the `state_dict()` to be updated is a misconception stemming from an incomplete understanding of how PyTorch's quantization functionality is implemented. This is especially critical when dealing with dynamic quantization, where the quantization parameters themselves can evolve during the training process.  In my experience, neglecting this crucial detail resulted in hours of debugging and ultimately, model deployment failures.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Post-Training Quantization with Manual Weight Modification (Incorrect Approach)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.quantization

model = nn.Linear(10, 5)
model.qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')
torch.quantization.prepare(model, inplace=True)

# Simulate training or some weight initialization
model.weight.data.fill_(1.0)

# Quantize the model
torch.quantization.convert(model, inplace=True)

# Incorrect attempt to modify quantized weights
model.weight.data.fill_(2.0)  # This does NOT affect the quantized weights

print("Original state dict:", model.state_dict()['weight'])  # Shows original weights
print("Quantized weight from model:", model.weight)  # Shows quantized weights
```

In this example, modifying `model.weight.data` *after* quantization has no effect on the actual quantized weights used during inference. The `state_dict()` remains unchanged as well.


**Example 2: Accessing Quantized Weights (Correct Approach)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.quantization

model = nn.Linear(10, 5)
model.qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')
torch.quantization.prepare(model, inplace=True)

model.weight.data.fill_(1.0)
torch.quantization.convert(model, inplace=True)

# Correct way to access and potentially modify quantized weights (though generally discouraged post-quantization)
quantized_weights = model.weight
# Example manipulation (avoid modifying after conversion, this is for demonstration)
quantized_weights.scale = quantized_weights.scale * 2

print("Quantized weight scale:", quantized_weights.scale)

#  Accessing the state_dict will still show the original non-quantized weights
print("Original state dict (unchanged):", model.state_dict()['weight'])
```

This demonstrates the correct way to access the quantized weights, using the model's attributes, not the `state_dict()`. Note that directly modifying `quantized_weights` after conversion is generally not recommended and may lead to unexpected behavior.


**Example 3:  Quantization-Aware Training and Weight Updates**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.quantization

model = nn.Linear(10, 5)
model.qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig('fbgemm')
model_prepared = torch.quantization.prepare_qat(model, inplace=True)

optimizer = optim.SGD(model_prepared.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop (simplified)
for epoch in range(10):
    # ... training steps ...
    optimizer.step()

torch.quantization.convert(model_prepared, inplace=True)

#  Even with QAT, the state_dict will mostly reflect pre-quantization weights.
#  Directly accessing the quantized parameters of the converted model is necessary.
print("Original state dict:", model_prepared.state_dict()['weight'])
print("Quantized weight from model:", model_prepared.weight)

```

In quantization-aware training (QAT), weights are updated during the training process, but the `state_dict()` primarily reflects the pre-quantization weights.  Accessing quantized parameters post-conversion remains necessary for analyzing the true quantized values.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I'd recommend revisiting the official PyTorch documentation on quantization.  Specifically, delve into the sections describing post-training quantization, quantization-aware training, and the specifics of the various quantization modules.  Understanding the internal representation of quantized tensors and how they interact with the model's parameters is crucial for avoiding these pitfalls.  Additionally, exploring examples demonstrating the correct ways to access and utilize quantized weights within a model is highly beneficial.  Carefully examining the source code of some of the quantization modules themselves can illuminate the implementation details.  Finally, consulting research papers on quantization techniques can provide broader context and theoretical understanding.


In summary, the core issue arises from the decoupling between the model's original parameters and the quantized representations generated by PyTorch's quantization modules.  Directly accessing the quantized weights through the quantized module is necessary; relying solely on the `state_dict()` is insufficient for understanding or manipulating the quantized model's parameters after the quantization process.  A deep understanding of PyTorch's quantization mechanisms is paramount to avoid the aforementioned issues.
