Non-rectangular sequences, common in data representing variable-length inputs like sentences or time series, cannot be directly converted to a tensor due to tensors requiring consistent dimensions. I’ve often encountered this when dealing with natural language processing tasks where input sentences differ significantly in word count, or in signal processing where recorded event lengths vary. The challenge lies in ensuring a uniform structure that can be processed by tensor-based operations while retaining the information contained in the variable-length structure. Here's how this conversion is typically managed, focusing on the use of padding, along with concrete examples.

The primary method for transforming these non-rectangular sequences into a rectangular structure suitable for tensors is by employing padding. Padding involves adding placeholder values (usually zeros or a predefined token) to the shorter sequences until they all reach the length of the longest sequence in the batch. This process, while conceptually straightforward, requires careful implementation to avoid data loss or misrepresentation. We must also consider the type of tensor we aim to create, which dictates how the original list should be formatted before the transformation.

My experience has shown that the strategy must be adapted to the specific task and tensor requirements. If I'm constructing a tensor for a sequence-to-sequence model that needs to process each batch independently, then a simple, padded tensor is usually sufficient. However, if I want a tensor that reflects the whole data at once, like a sparse matrix, a different method will be needed. I’ll outline a common use case for batch processing, then briefly touch on a sparse matrix approach.

**Example 1: Padding for Batch Processing**

Let's say I have a list of variable-length sequences: `sequences = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9], [10]]`. These sequences could represent the tokenized words in a sentence, or some other type of ordered data. To convert this to a tensor, I first need to find the length of the longest sequence. Then, I iterate through each sequence and pad it with zeros until it equals that maximum length:

```python
import torch

sequences = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9], [10]]

max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
padded_sequences = []
for seq in sequences:
    padding_needed = max_len - len(seq)
    padded_seq = seq + [0] * padding_needed
    padded_sequences.append(padded_seq)

tensor = torch.tensor(padded_sequences)
print(tensor)
```
In this code, I begin by identifying the maximum length across all sequences, which is 4 in this case. Then, for each sequence, I calculate the number of zeros to append to the end to ensure every sequence reaches the length of 4. After padding every sequence, I convert the padded list into a torch tensor. The resulting tensor, `tensor([[ 1,  2,  3,  0], [ 4,  5,  0,  0], [ 6,  7,  8,  9], [10,  0,  0,  0]])`, maintains the positional information of the original sequences while providing a rectangular structure.

**Example 2: Handling String Data with Custom Padding Token**

Often, real-world data, specifically text data, comprises strings and it's more effective to maintain the padded state by employing an actual non-data token. For example, when dealing with sentences, we might use "[PAD]" as a padding token and create a vocabulary that maps unique tokens to integer indices. Consider the following string list: `string_sequences = [["hello", "world"], ["goodbye"], ["see", "you", "soon"]]`. We need to encode these and use a padding token.

```python
import torch

string_sequences = [["hello", "world"], ["goodbye"], ["see", "you", "soon"]]
vocabulary = {"[PAD]": 0, "hello": 1, "world": 2, "goodbye": 3, "see": 4, "you": 5, "soon": 6}

max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in string_sequences)
padded_sequences = []

for seq in string_sequences:
    encoded_seq = [vocabulary[word] for word in seq]
    padding_needed = max_len - len(encoded_seq)
    padded_seq = encoded_seq + [vocabulary["[PAD]"]] * padding_needed
    padded_sequences.append(padded_seq)

tensor = torch.tensor(padded_sequences)
print(tensor)
```

Here, I’ve initialized a simple vocabulary mapping each string token to a number, including padding. I then iterate over the string sequences, convert them to their integer counterparts according to the vocabulary, calculate the padding needed, and append the corresponding padding index. The resulting tensor becomes `tensor([[1, 2, 0], [3, 0, 0], [4, 5, 6]])`. The [PAD] token, now represented by its assigned integer (0), is used for padding. The advantage here is that the padded value is an integer in line with the rest of the tensor's values and is known to signify "no data," which is especially important in downstream operations, like calculating loss, where padded values should not be considered.

**Example 3: Masking for Ignoring Padded Elements**

Padded sequences introduce a challenge: the padded values shouldn't influence calculations during model training. For this purpose, we frequently create an associated “mask” tensor that has the same dimensions, but contains 1s for non-padded elements and 0s for padded ones. This mask can then be used to ignore padded portions during the computations. Returning to the initial integer sequence example, here’s how you’d generate the mask:

```python
import torch

sequences = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9], [10]]

max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
padded_sequences = []
mask = []

for seq in sequences:
    padding_needed = max_len - len(seq)
    padded_seq = seq + [0] * padding_needed
    padded_sequences.append(padded_seq)
    mask_seq = [1] * len(seq) + [0] * padding_needed
    mask.append(mask_seq)

tensor = torch.tensor(padded_sequences)
mask_tensor = torch.tensor(mask)

print("Padded Tensor:")
print(tensor)
print("\nMask Tensor:")
print(mask_tensor)
```

In this modified code, I create an additional list `mask`. As I generate each padded sequence, I also create a mask of the same length, where 1s correspond to valid data elements and 0s to padded elements. This yields two tensors: `tensor([[ 1,  2,  3,  0], [ 4,  5,  0,  0], [ 6,  7,  8,  9], [10,  0,  0,  0]])` for the padded data, and `mask_tensor([[1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0]])` for the mask. This mask tensor can be employed in downstream processing, allowing operations to bypass the effect of padding and calculate loss or gradients only on actual data within each sequence.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For comprehensive understanding, explore resources focused on tensor operations. Deep learning frameworks provide efficient implementations and best practices for handling such data. I strongly suggest reviewing documentation provided by popular libraries. Introductory resources on natural language processing and time-series analysis often include sections on dealing with sequences of varying lengths. Additionally, materials discussing masking techniques used within deep learning models will solidify understanding of this process. Finally, research on the concept of ragged tensors, where each sequence has a different length, will provide a more advanced approach to the problem. While less common in typical applications, knowing how to represent and manipulate them is beneficial.
