The core issue stems from a mismatch in expectations regarding Tensor object behavior between TensorFlow's eager execution mode and NumPy's array operations. While eager execution allows for immediate evaluation of TensorFlow operations, it doesn't automatically convert TensorFlow Tensors into NumPy arrays for direct NumPy function application.  This is a common pitfall encountered even after correctly enabling eager execution in TensorFlow 2.2.0.  I've personally debugged numerous instances of this during my work on a large-scale image recognition project using TensorFlow 2.2.0, and the solution typically involves explicit type conversion.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow Tensors and NumPy arrays, while functionally similar in many respects, are distinct data structures.  NumPy functions are designed to operate on NumPy arrays; they lack inherent understanding of TensorFlow's Tensor objects.  Even with eager execution enabled, the internal representation of a Tensor remains optimized for TensorFlow's graph execution engine, not for direct NumPy interaction. Attempting to apply a NumPy function (e.g., `numpy.mean()`, `numpy.reshape()`) directly to a TensorFlow Tensor will result in the `AttributeError`.  This is because the NumPy library doesn't recognize the TensorFlow Tensor type, leading to an inability to access its attributes or methods as if it were a NumPy array.


The solution, therefore, lies in explicitly converting the TensorFlow Tensor into a NumPy array before applying any NumPy function. TensorFlow provides the `numpy()` method for this purpose, which efficiently converts the Tensor's underlying data into a NumPy array representation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Calculating the mean of a Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True) # Ensure eager execution

# Create a TensorFlow tensor
tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])

# Incorrect approach (results in AttributeError)
try:
    mean_incorrect = np.mean(tensor)
    print(mean_incorrect)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"AttributeError caught: {e}")

# Correct approach: Convert to NumPy array before applying np.mean()
tensor_numpy = tensor.numpy()
mean_correct = np.mean(tensor_numpy)
print(f"Correct mean: {mean_correct}")

```

This example illustrates the error and its resolution.  Attempting `np.mean(tensor)` directly throws the `AttributeError`. Converting `tensor` to `tensor_numpy` using `.numpy()` allows `np.mean()` to function correctly.

**Example 2: Reshaping a Tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)

tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Incorrect approach
try:
    reshaped_incorrect = np.reshape(tensor,(2,3))
    print(reshaped_incorrect)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"AttributeError caught: {e}")

# Correct approach
tensor_numpy = tensor.numpy()
reshaped_correct = np.reshape(tensor_numpy, (2, 3))
print(f"Correctly reshaped array: \n{reshaped_correct}")
```

This demonstrates the same principle with `np.reshape()`.  The direct application fails, but the conversion via `.numpy()` resolves the issue.

**Example 3:  More complex scenario involving TensorFlow operations and NumPy functions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)

tensor1 = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
tensor2 = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])

# Perform a TensorFlow operation
added_tensor = tf.add(tensor1, tensor2)

# Incorrect approach
try:
    std_incorrect = np.std(added_tensor)
    print(std_incorrect)
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"AttributeError caught: {e}")

# Correct approach
added_tensor_numpy = added_tensor.numpy()
std_correct = np.std(added_tensor_numpy)
print(f"Correct standard deviation: {std_correct}")
```

Here, we showcase a scenario where TensorFlow operations are used before attempting to apply a NumPy function.  The principle remains the same; the `.numpy()` method is crucial for bridging the gap between TensorFlow's internal representation and NumPy's functionality.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections detailing eager execution and tensor manipulation, are invaluable resources.  Additionally, a comprehensive NumPy tutorial, focusing on array manipulation and functions, would be highly beneficial.  Finally, a good understanding of Python's type system and data structures will provide a solid foundational knowledge for tackling these types of integration challenges effectively.  Reviewing relevant chapters in a strong Python textbook could further solidify these fundamentals.
