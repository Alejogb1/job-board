The revised simplex method, while generally robust, can enter an infinite loop due to a phenomenon known as cycling. This occurs when the algorithm repeatedly visits the same sequence of basic feasible solutions without ever reaching optimality. Having encountered this issue several times during my years optimizing resource allocation systems, I’ve found that understanding the mechanics of degeneracy and pivoting rules is crucial for effective debugging and resolution.

The core issue stems from the presence of *degenerate basic feasible solutions*. In linear programming, a basic feasible solution corresponds to a vertex of the feasible region. Degeneracy occurs when, at such a vertex, more than *n* variables are zero (where *n* is the number of decision variables). This implies that a basic variable, which should ideally be strictly positive, takes on a value of zero. When the algorithm chooses a variable to enter the basis and one to leave, the change in the objective function can become zero, leading to a situation where the next iteration merely shifts which variable is at zero without altering the solution.

The standard simplex method, and therefore also the revised simplex version, relies on a *pivoting rule* to determine which variable should enter the basis and which should leave. Common pivoting rules include the steepest edge rule and Bland's rule (the smallest index rule). If a poor pivoting rule is employed in the presence of degeneracy, the method may move to another degenerate vertex with the same objective value. Then, under the same rule, the algorithm may return to the prior vertex, and so on, creating a cycle. This is not an error in implementation, but rather a flaw in the logic of choosing which variable to pivot, given the specific problem instance.

Let’s consider a simplified example to illustrate this. Suppose we have a problem where we are trying to maximize a function *z* under a set of constraints. During one iteration we reach a basic feasible solution:

x1 = 0, x2 = 5, x3 = 0, x4 = 2

Here, we have two variables at a value of 0, while only one would be expected under non-degeneracy. If our pivoting rule is not careful, we might move to a new basis:

x1 = 0, x2 = 0, x3 = 5, x4 = 2

Again, two variables are at zero, and the objective function hasn’t changed. A poor pivoting rule might then take us back to the first solution. In practice, this cycling can involve several steps before it becomes apparent.

To illustrate this further, let’s use some example code. The following examples are in Python using NumPy for the numerical calculations, mirroring the common tools I’ve used in my optimization work. The code snippets, while not complete solvers, will highlight the key operations where cycling can occur.

**Example 1: The Core Pivot Operation**

This example demonstrates a basic pivot operation, which is central to the simplex method.

```python
import numpy as np

def pivot(tableau, pivot_row, pivot_col):
    pivot_value = tableau[pivot_row, pivot_col]
    tableau[pivot_row, :] /= pivot_value
    for i in range(len(tableau)):
        if i != pivot_row:
            factor = tableau[i, pivot_col]
            tableau[i, :] -= factor * tableau[pivot_row, :]
    return tableau

# Example usage:
tableau = np.array([[2, 1, 0, 0, 10],
                    [1, 3, 1, 0, 15],
                    [-3, -2, 0, 1, 0]], dtype=float)

# In a real solver, the choice of pivot_row and pivot_col
# is governed by the pivoting rule. Here we pick one to illustrate
# the operation. We'll use row 1, column 0
pivot_row = 0
pivot_col = 0
updated_tableau = pivot(tableau.copy(), pivot_row, pivot_col)
print(updated_tableau)

```

This snippet demonstrates how the tableau, the representation of the constraints, changes during pivoting. The critical point, where cycling occurs, is not in the arithmetic of this function itself but rather in the algorithm that chooses the `pivot_row` and `pivot_col`. A poor choice repeatedly can lead to cycling without any change to the solution vector. The `tableau.copy()` prevents the original from being changed during calculation.

**Example 2: Bland's Rule for Pivot Selection**

This code example incorporates Bland’s rule (smallest index rule) for pivot selection which is known to prevent cycling in the simplex method.

```python
import numpy as np

def bland_pivot_selection(tableau, basic_variables):
    # Identify entering variable
    reduced_cost = tableau[-1, :-1] # Cost of non-basic variables
    entering_variable = np.argmax(reduced_cost > 0) # Select first column with positive cost
    
    # Identify leaving variable
    rhs = tableau[:-1, -1]
    column = tableau[:-1, entering_variable]
    
    ratios = np.array([rhs[i] / column[i] if column[i] > 0 else np.inf for i in range(len(rhs))])

    leaving_variable = np.argmin(ratios)
    
    return leaving_variable, entering_variable


#Example usage
tableau = np.array([[2, 1, 0, 0, 10],
                    [1, 3, 1, 0, 15],
                    [-3, -2, 0, 1, 0]], dtype=float)

basic_variables = [2, 3] #Initially slack variables

leaving_var, entering_var = bland_pivot_selection(tableau, basic_variables)
print(f"Leaving: Variable {leaving_var}, Entering: Variable {entering_var}")
```

Here we see a specific rule implemented for choosing the pivot element. Bland's rule looks for the first positive entry in the reduced cost vector to determine the entering variable and then the first variable that reaches zero to determine the leaving variable. This strategy, though simple, effectively prevents cycling by ensuring a consistent choice. It is, however, not the most efficient rule and other methods may converge faster. In my projects, selecting the correct pivot rule is crucial for convergence.

**Example 3: Simulating a potential cycling scenario with a flawed pivot rule**

In a real-world system, I encountered a case where my initial code was entering an infinite loop. To better simulate how this could happen we can show a less careful approach to pivot selection and a scenario that may lead to cycling.

```python
import numpy as np

def flawed_pivot_selection(tableau):
    reduced_cost = tableau[-1, :-1]
    entering_variable = np.argmax(reduced_cost) # Select column with largest cost (may lead to cycling)
    
    rhs = tableau[:-1, -1]
    column = tableau[:-1, entering_variable]
    
    ratios = np.array([rhs[i] / column[i] if column[i] > 0 else np.inf for i in range(len(rhs))])

    leaving_variable = np.argmin(ratios) # Select variable first to hit zero

    return leaving_variable, entering_variable

tableau = np.array([[0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
                    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
                    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=float)


for _ in range(10):
    leaving_var, entering_var = flawed_pivot_selection(tableau)
    tableau = pivot(tableau, leaving_var, entering_var)
    print(tableau)
    # This example will be stuck because every pivot does not improve the function. In reality this would also involve more complex pivots.
```

This example demonstrates a rule that, in the presence of degeneracy, can lead to cycling. The pivot selection logic doesn’t take into account the smallest index or any other mechanism that would ensure that at least the smallest index rule will prevent returning to previous vertices, so the algorithm is likely to move between the same solutions, repeating steps without ever finding the optimal result.

To avoid cycling when implementing the revised simplex method, it is crucial to choose an appropriate pivoting rule. Bland’s rule, as shown above, is a straightforward method that guarantees termination, though it may not always be the most computationally efficient. In my experience, a more sophisticated approach, incorporating more complex pivoting strategies or perturbation methods, might be warranted for larger, more complex problems.

In summary, cycling in the revised simplex method is not due to a coding error directly, but rather an interaction between degeneracy, inherent in some problem formulations, and an inadequate pivoting rule. When encountering this issue, thorough debugging, and, if needed, switching to a proven pivot selection method will often bring the solver to convergence.

For more detailed resources on this subject, I recommend reviewing texts on linear programming and optimization, such as those that include detailed explanations of the simplex method, degeneracy, and pivoting rules. Additionally, research papers focusing on computational linear programming methods offer insights into advanced pivoting techniques, providing a solid theoretical and practical base for effectively solving such issues.
