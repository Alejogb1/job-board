The PyTorch DataLoader's ability to reduce the number of data samples processed isn't inherent in its core functionality; it's achieved through strategic dataset construction and parameter configuration.  My experience optimizing large-scale training pipelines frequently involved managing dataset size, and I found that directly manipulating the dataset itself, rather than relying on DataLoader features intended for batching or shuffling, was the most efficient and straightforward method.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `DataLoader` itself doesn't have a built-in mechanism to *reduce* the number of samples.  Its primary role is to efficiently load and manage batches of data for model training.  Reducing the number of samples requires pre-processing the dataset to select a subset before passing it to the `DataLoader`. This subset selection can be accomplished in several ways depending on the nature of the data and the desired reduction strategy.  For instance, one might randomly sample a fraction of the data, select a contiguous subset, or apply more sophisticated sampling techniques like stratified sampling to maintain class distribution.  This pre-processing step is crucial; feeding the entire dataset to the `DataLoader` and then attempting to discard samples within the `DataLoader` itself is inefficient and defeats the purpose of optimized data loading.

The common misconception arises from confusing the `DataLoader`'s batch size parameter (`batch_size`) with sample reduction.  While `batch_size` controls the size of the mini-batches used in training, it doesn't influence the total number of samples processed.  A `batch_size` of 32 will still iterate through all available samples, just in 32-sample chunks.  To truly reduce the number of samples, the dataset itself must be modified prior to DataLoader instantiation.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate three distinct methods for creating a reduced dataset, which are subsequently loaded by the `DataLoader`.  Assume we have a dataset `my_dataset`, which is a PyTorch `Dataset` object or a similar structure that provides sample access via indexing.

**Example 1: Random Subsampling**

This approach randomly selects a specified fraction of the total data samples.  It's suitable when there's no particular need for preserving the original data order or class distribution.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, SubsetRandomSampler, random_split

# Assume my_dataset is a PyTorch Dataset object.
dataset_size = len(my_dataset)
fraction = 0.2  # Reduce to 20% of the original size.
reduced_size = int(dataset_size * fraction)

# Randomly split the dataset into two parts: reduced and discarded
train_size = int(0.8 * dataset_size)
test_size = dataset_size - train_size
train_dataset, test_dataset = random_split(my_dataset, [train_size, test_size])

# Create a DataLoader for the reduced dataset
reduced_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

#Alternatively using SubsetRandomSampler
indices = torch.randperm(dataset_size)[:reduced_size]
sampler = SubsetRandomSampler(indices)
reduced_loader = DataLoader(my_dataset, batch_size=32, sampler=sampler)

```

**Commentary:** This example leverages `random_split` for a clean division of the dataset and showcases the use of `SubsetRandomSampler` for more granular control over sample selection. Using `random_split` offers a cleaner approach for simple splitting whereas `SubsetRandomSampler` gives more control for advanced sampling strategies. Both create a `DataLoader` that iterates over the reduced dataset.

**Example 2: Selecting a Contiguous Subset**

This method selects a consecutive portion of the dataset.  It might be useful when focusing on a specific range of data, for instance, early stages of a time series or a particular region in image data.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Assume my_dataset is a PyTorch Dataset object.
dataset_size = len(my_dataset)
start_index = 0
num_samples = 1000  # Select the first 1000 samples

reduced_dataset = torch.utils.data.Subset(my_dataset, range(start_index, start_index + num_samples))

reduced_loader = DataLoader(reduced_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
```

**Commentary:**  This example utilizes `torch.utils.data.Subset` to efficiently create a new dataset containing only the desired contiguous samples. Direct slicing is avoided to maintain compatibility with various dataset types.

**Example 3: Stratified Sampling**

This technique ensures that the reduced dataset maintains the class distribution of the original dataset.  It's crucial when working with class-imbalanced data and prevents bias during training.  This requires knowing the class labels for each sample within `my_dataset`.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, SubsetRandomSampler
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit

# Assume my_dataset is a PyTorch Dataset object and you have labels associated with it.  This requires adjustment based on how your labels are stored.
dataset_size = len(my_dataset)
labels = [sample[1] for sample in my_dataset] # Assuming labels are the second element in each sample

sss = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, test_size=0.8, random_state=42) #split 80% to 20%
for train_index, test_index in sss.split(range(len(my_dataset)), labels):
    train_dataset = torch.utils.data.Subset(my_dataset, train_index) # Select reduced dataset here
    test_dataset = torch.utils.data.Subset(my_dataset, test_index)

reduced_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
```

**Commentary:**  This example uses scikit-learn's `StratifiedShuffleSplit` to perform stratified sampling, ensuring proportional representation of classes in the reduced dataset.  The code assumes you have a way to access the labels associated with each data sample in your dataset. Adapting this section will depend heavily on the structure of `my_dataset`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation on datasets and `DataLoader`s.  A comprehensive textbook on machine learning covering data preprocessing and sampling techniques.  A practical guide to building deep learning models with PyTorch.  Understanding the nuances of sampling techniques and their implications for model performance is critical.


In conclusion, reducing the number of samples processed by a PyTorch `DataLoader` is achieved through proper dataset manipulation before passing it to the `DataLoader`.  The `DataLoader` itself only manages the batching and loading of data already provided.  Choosing the appropriate sampling technique depends on the specifics of the dataset and the goals of the training process.  Careful consideration of these factors will lead to efficient and effective training pipelines.
