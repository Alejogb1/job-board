The "Key global_step not found" error during TensorFlow Estimator model export stems from an inconsistency between the checkpoint's structure and the export function's expectations.  Specifically, the checkpoint file, used to restore the model's weights, lacks the `global_step` tensor, a crucial variable tracking the training progress.  This often indicates a problem with the checkpoint's creation or the export method itself.  Having encountered this issue numerous times during my work on large-scale image classification projects, I can pinpoint the common causes and provide effective solutions.

**1. Explanation:**

The `global_step` tensor is a fundamental component in TensorFlow's training process. It maintains a count of the training steps executed, allowing for precise monitoring and checkpointing.  During training, TensorFlow automatically updates this counter. However, issues arise when this variable isn't properly saved within the checkpoint. This can manifest in several ways:

* **Incorrect Checkpoint Saving:** If the training loop doesn't explicitly save the `global_step` variable along with the model's weights, the checkpoint will be incomplete, resulting in the error. This often happens when using custom training loops or modifying the standard TensorFlow `tf.estimator.Estimator` behavior significantly.

* **Inconsistent Variable Names:** A less frequent cause involves a naming discrepancy.  The export function might be searching for a `global_step` variable under a different name (e.g., due to a naming convention change during development).

* **Incorrect Export Function:** The export function itself might not be correctly configured to handle the checkpoint structure, potentially overlooking the `global_step` tensor even if present.

Addressing this error necessitates verifying the checkpoint's contents, ensuring the `global_step` variable is included, and confirming the export function correctly retrieves it.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Correct Checkpoint Saving and Export**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
    # ... model definition ...

    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
        optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=params['learning_rate'])
        train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss, global_step=tf.compat.v1.train.get_or_create_global_step())
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, loss=loss, train_op=train_op)
    # ... other modes ...


estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=my_model_fn, params={'learning_rate': 0.001})

# Training loop (simplified)
for _ in range(1000):
    estimator.train(input_fn=train_input_fn, steps=100)
    estimator.export_saved_model(export_dir_base="my_exported_model", serving_input_receiver_fn=serving_input_receiver_fn)


def serving_input_receiver_fn():
  # ... defines serving input receiver
  pass

```

This example explicitly uses `tf.compat.v1.train.get_or_create_global_step()` within the `optimizer.minimize` call. This ensures the `global_step` is correctly managed and included in the checkpoint during training.  The `export_saved_model` function then accesses this variable implicitly.


**Example 2: Handling Custom Global Step**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

global_step_tensor = tf.Variable(0, name="my_global_step", trainable=False)

# ... model definition ...

def my_model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
    # ... model definition ...

    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
        optimizer = tf.compat.v1.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=params['learning_rate'])
        train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss, global_step=global_step_tensor)
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, loss=loss, train_op=train_op)
    # ... other modes ...


estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=my_model_fn, params={'learning_rate': 0.001})


#Exporting with explicit global step
def serving_input_receiver_fn():
    # ... serving function ...
    pass

estimator.export_saved_model(export_dir_base='my_exported_model', serving_input_receiver_fn=serving_input_receiver_fn,
                             variables_to_save={"global_step": global_step_tensor})
```

Here, a custom `global_step_tensor` is defined and explicitly used.  The crucial part is the `variables_to_save` argument in `export_saved_model`, which ensures the custom `global_step` is included in the exported model.

**Example 3:  Debugging with Checkpoint Inspection**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... training code ...

#Inspecting the checkpoint after training
checkpoint = tf.train.latest_checkpoint("./my_checkpoints")
reader = tf.train.load_checkpoint(checkpoint)
print(reader.get_variable_to_shape_map()) # Print all the variables in checkpoint to confirm global_step presence

# If global_step is missing, modify your training loop to include it correctly
# (Refer to Example 1 or 2)

# Then re-train and export
```

This example demonstrates how to inspect the checkpoint using TensorFlow's checkpoint utilities. This allows for verifying whether the `global_step` is present within the saved weights.  If it's missing, it highlights the need to adjust the training loop as shown in the previous examples.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on Estimators, the `tf.train` module (specifically for checkpoint management), and the `tf.saved_model` module are invaluable resources.  Additionally,  referencing examples in the TensorFlow tutorials focusing on model saving and exporting will provide practical demonstrations.  Thorough understanding of variable scopes within TensorFlow is highly beneficial for managing variables correctly, preventing naming conflicts.  Finally,  a comprehensive guide on debugging TensorFlow programs will prove helpful in systematically addressing issues arising during training and export.
