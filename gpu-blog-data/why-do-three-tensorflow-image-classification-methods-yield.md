Discrepancies in classification results across seemingly identical TensorFlow workflows, even when using the same model and test data, often stem from subtle differences in data preprocessing, model loading, and prediction execution pathways.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues in large-scale image classification projects has shown that inconsistencies frequently arise from variations in how input tensors are handled.

**1. Explanation of Discrepancies**

The core issue lies in the interplay between TensorFlow's eager execution mode and graph mode, combined with potential variations in data normalization, data type conversions, and the handling of batching.  While the model's architecture remains constant, discrepancies emerge from how that model interacts with the input data.  In eager execution, operations are evaluated immediately, allowing for more direct control but potentially introducing inconsistencies related to the order of operations or subtle numerical differences.  Conversely, graph mode compiles a computation graph beforehand, leading to optimizations that might deviate slightly from the eager execution's behavior.  These differences become amplified when dealing with image data, which is inherently high-dimensional and susceptible to minor numerical variations.

Furthermore, inconsistencies in preprocessing steps are a common culprit. Even minor differences in normalization, resizing, or data type conversions (e.g., float32 vs. float64) can alter the input tensor sufficiently to result in varied predictions.  Similarly, the way batches are handled—the size of the batch, the padding strategy, and the potential for differing ordering within batches—can all influence the final output. Finally, issues can arise from the method used to load pre-trained weights. Inconsistent loading practices can lead to slightly different internal model states, leading to different predictions.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate potential sources of inconsistencies, focusing on preprocessing, model loading, and prediction using three distinct approaches:

**Example 1:  Direct Prediction with Eager Execution and Manual Preprocessing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# Load the model (assuming it's already saved)
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')

# Preprocess a single image
img = Image.open('test_image.jpg').resize((224, 224))
img_array = np.array(img) / 255.0  # Normalize to [0, 1]
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0) # Add batch dimension
img_array = img_array.astype(np.float32) #Ensure correct data type

# Make prediction in eager execution
predictions = model.predict(img_array)
predicted_class = np.argmax(predictions)
print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}")
```

This example explicitly controls preprocessing and uses eager execution. Note the normalization to [0, 1] and explicit type casting to `np.float32`.  Any deviation from this precise preprocessing pipeline will likely lead to different predictions.  The lack of batching (single image prediction) further isolates potential batch-related inconsistencies.


**Example 2:  Prediction with Graph Mode and Dataset Pipeline**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

#Load the model (assuming it's already saved)
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution() #Enable graph mode

# Create a tf.data.Dataset for batch processing
def preprocess_image(image):
  image = tf.image.resize(image, [224, 224])
  image = tf.cast(image, tf.float32) / 255.0
  return image

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.list_files('test_images/*.jpg') \
  .map(lambda x: tf.io.read_file(x)) \
  .map(lambda x: tf.image.decode_jpeg(x, channels=3)) \
  .map(preprocess_image) \
  .batch(32)

# Make prediction in graph mode
for batch in dataset:
  predictions = model.predict(batch)
  #Process predictions
```

This example uses graph mode and a `tf.data.Dataset` for efficient batch processing. The preprocessing is now integrated into the data pipeline, which might lead to different optimization strategies compared to eager execution.  The batch size of 32 introduces another potential source of variation if the batching order impacts the model's internal state.  Note the use of `tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()` which explicitly disables eager execution, forcing graph mode.

**Example 3: Using `tf.function` for Graph Compilation in Eager Execution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

#Load the model (assuming it's already saved)
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')

@tf.function
def predict_image(image):
  image = tf.image.resize(image, [224,224])
  image = tf.cast(image, tf.float32) / 255.0
  image = tf.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
  return model(image)

#Preprocess a single image
img = Image.open('test_image.jpg')
img_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(np.array(img), dtype=tf.uint8)

predictions = predict_image(img_tensor)
predicted_class = np.argmax(predictions.numpy())
print(f"Predicted Class: {predicted_class}")
```

This approach uses eager execution but leverages `tf.function` to compile the prediction function into a graph. This allows for some optimization benefits while retaining the flexibility of eager execution. However, subtle differences in graph compilation compared to Example 2 might still lead to minor inconsistencies.  The use of `tf.convert_to_tensor` is crucial for ensuring consistent data type handling within the `tf.function`.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's execution modes, I recommend carefully reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on eager execution versus graph mode.  Furthermore, examining the documentation on `tf.data.Dataset` and its various data manipulation functions is essential for understanding the intricacies of building efficient data pipelines.  Finally, thoroughly understanding the nuances of `tf.function` and its optimization capabilities is vital for leveraging the power of graph-based execution while retaining the flexibility of the eager execution environment.  These resources will provide the necessary context for troubleshooting and understanding the impact of these choices on the consistency of your model's output.
