The `.pt` file extension in PyTorch is a generic indicator for a serialized model, encompassing diverse internal structures.  Whether a `.pt` model loads successfully on a CPU hinges not on the extension itself, but on the model's architecture and the presence of CUDA-specific components during its initial saving.  My experience working on large-scale image classification and natural language processing projects has shown that this distinction is frequently overlooked, leading to deployment challenges.  A model trained exclusively on a CPU will readily load on a CPU. However, a model leveraging GPU acceleration during training may contain tensors and modules incompatible with a CPU-only environment.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The PyTorch framework supports both CPU and GPU computation.  During training, utilizing a GPU significantly accelerates the process.  However, leveraging GPU capabilities often incorporates CUDA tensors and operations into the model's structure.  CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model, exclusively available on NVIDIA GPUs.  When saving a model using `torch.save()`, the serialized file includes all components of the model's state, including those specific to the device used during training. If the model was trained with CUDA, the saved `.pt` file will contain CUDA tensors.  Attempting to load this model on a CPU will trigger a `RuntimeError` because the CPU lacks the necessary CUDA runtime libraries and hardware to process CUDA tensors.  Conversely, models trained solely on a CPU, using only `torch.FloatTensor` or equivalent CPU-based tensors, will load without issue on a CPU.

The key lies in the model's configuration at the time of saving. Explicitly mapping tensors to CPU using `.to('cpu')` before saving ensures compatibility with CPU-only environments. Ignoring this crucial step may render a model unusable without access to a GPU, despite the seemingly simple `.pt` file extension.  This is a frequent source of errors in deployment scenarios, especially when moving models trained on powerful research clusters to resource-constrained production environments. I've personally encountered this issue when transitioning a complex NLP model from a multi-GPU server to a smaller cloud instance with limited resources.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: CPU-only Model Training and Saving**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Instantiate model on CPU
model = SimpleModel().cpu()

#Dummy input for training and demonstrating usage on CPU.
input_tensor = torch.randn(1,10).cpu()
output = model(input_tensor)

# Save the model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'cpu_model.pt')

#Load model -  Should load successfully on CPU.
loaded_model = SimpleModel().cpu()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('cpu_model.pt'))
print(loaded_model)
```

This example showcases training and saving a model explicitly on the CPU. The `.cpu()` method ensures all tensors remain on the CPU, guaranteeing compatibility during loading.  The use of `model.state_dict()` saves only the model's parameters and not the entire model architecture.  This is often a more efficient approach, especially for large models.  The model architecture should be redefined before loading the state dictionary.

**Example 2: GPU Model Training and Attempted CPU Loading**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume CUDA availability
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device('cuda')
else:
    device = torch.device('cpu')

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Instantiate model on GPU (if available)
model = SimpleModel().to(device)

#Dummy input for training and demonstrating usage on GPU.
input_tensor = torch.randn(1,10).to(device)
output = model(input_tensor)

# Save the model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'gpu_model.pt')


try:
    #Attempt to load model on CPU. Will raise RuntimeError if CUDA tensors present
    loaded_model = SimpleModel().cpu()
    loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('gpu_model.pt'))
    print(loaded_model)
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
```

This example illustrates the potential problem.  If a GPU is available, the model is trained and saved utilizing the GPU.  Attempting to load this model on a CPU using `torch.load()` will likely result in a `RuntimeError` because of the presence of CUDA tensors. The `try-except` block gracefully handles this situation.


**Example 3: GPU Model Training and CPU-Compatible Saving**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume CUDA availability
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device('cuda')
else:
    device = torch.device('cpu')

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Instantiate model on GPU (if available)
model = SimpleModel().to(device)

#Dummy input for training and demonstrating usage on GPU.
input_tensor = torch.randn(1,10).to(device)
output = model(input_tensor)

#Save the model to CPU.
model.cpu()
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'gpu_trained_cpu_saved_model.pt')


#Load model on CPU - Should work without error.
loaded_model = SimpleModel().cpu()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('gpu_trained_cpu_saved_model.pt'))
print(loaded_model)
```

This example demonstrates the correct approach. Even if the model was initially trained on a GPU, explicitly moving it to the CPU using `.cpu()` before saving ensures that only CPU-compatible tensors are stored in the `.pt` file.  This resolves the incompatibility issue and enables successful loading on a CPU-only system.  This methodology is crucial for reproducible research and streamlined deployment.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation, particularly sections on saving and loading models and tensor manipulation, are invaluable resources.  Further, exploring the PyTorch tutorials focusing on deploying models to various environments will offer practical guidance.  Finally, a deep understanding of CUDA and its relationship to PyTorch is essential for advanced users working with GPU acceleration.
