Implementing a bare-metal RISC-V system on the Nexys-A7-100T FPGA necessitates a deep understanding of hardware description languages (HDLs), RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA), and FPGA design flow.  My experience working on similar projects, including a custom RISC-V processor for a space-constrained application, highlights the critical role of efficient resource utilization and careful clock domain crossing management.  The Nexys-A7-100T's limited resources necessitate optimization at every stage.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves several key stages:  First, a RISC-V core, either a soft core implemented in HDL or a pre-built IP core, needs to be selected.  Given the Nexys-A7-100T's limitations, a smaller, simpler core like Rocket Chip's smaller configurations or a custom minimal core is preferred over larger, more complex designs.  Second, the necessary peripherals (memory controller, UART, potentially timers and GPIO) need to be designed or sourced as IP cores and integrated with the chosen RISC-V core.  Third, the memory map needs to be carefully defined, allocating addresses to the various peripherals and memory regions.  Fourth, the firmware (bootloader and application code) needs to be written in assembly language or C, compiled to machine code suitable for the chosen RISC-V core, and loaded into the FPGA's memory.  Finally, the entire design needs to be synthesized, implemented, and programmed onto the Nexys-A7-100T.

Careful consideration of clock speeds is crucial.  The Nexys-A7-100T's clock speed capabilities will directly impact the performance of the system.  Overly ambitious clock frequencies may lead to timing closure issues during synthesis and implementation.  Furthermore, efficient memory management is paramount.  Given the limited on-chip memory available on the Nexys-A7-100T, memory optimization techniques, such as data compression and careful memory allocation, are essential.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  A simple RISC-V assembly bootloader (fragment):**

```assembly
.global _start

_start:
  # Initialize UART
  li x5, 0x80000000  # UART base address
  li x6, 0x00000001  # Set baud rate register

  sb x6, 0(x5)

  # Print "Hello, world!" to UART
  la x7, hello_world_msg
  jal ra, print_string

  # Infinite loop
  j _start


hello_world_msg:
  .asciz "Hello, world!\n"

print_string:
  # ... (UART transmission subroutine) ...
  ret
```

This code fragment demonstrates a minimal bootloader.  It initializes the UART and prints a message.  The `_start` label designates the entry point of the program.  The addresses for the UART and the message string would need to correspond to the memory map.  The `print_string` subroutine, not shown in detail here, would handle the actual UART transmission. This exemplifies the direct interaction needed with peripherals at the hardware level.


**Example 2:  Verilog module for a simple UART (fragment):**

```verilog
module uart_transmitter (
  input clk,
  input rst,
  input tx_enable,
  input [7:0] data,
  output reg tx_data
);

  reg [7:0] shift_reg;
  reg [3:0] bit_counter;

  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (rst) begin
      shift_reg <= 8'b0;
      bit_counter <= 4'b0;
      tx_data <= 1'b1; // Idle high
    end else if (tx_enable) begin
      if (bit_counter == 4'b1000) begin
        tx_data <= 1'b1; // Idle high
      end else begin
        tx_data <= shift_reg[7];
        shift_reg <= {shift_reg[6:0], 1'b0};
        bit_counter <= bit_counter + 1;
      end
    end
  end

endmodule
```

This Verilog code represents a simplified UART transmitter.  It takes data, transmits it bit by bit, and manages the clock synchronization.  The design emphasizes a clear separation between the data and control signals, crucial for a successful integration with the RISC-V core.


**Example 3:  C code for a simple application (fragment):**

```c
#include <stdint.h>

// Define memory mapped addresses for peripherals (replace with actual addresses)
#define UART_BASE 0x80000000

int main() {
  uint32_t *uart_reg = (uint32_t *)UART_BASE;

  // Write data to the UART data register
  *uart_reg = 0x48656c6c; // "Hell" in ASCII

  return 0;
}
```

This C code fragment illustrates a simple application writing to the UART.  It directly manipulates the memory-mapped address of the UART. The inclusion of `stdint.h` guarantees correct integer sizes, crucial for portability and predictable behavior across different architectures.  This highlights how software interacts with hardware in bare-metal systems.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For HDL design and simulation, I'd recommend using ModelSim or Icarus Verilog.  For RISC-V ISA specifications and core generators, the official RISC-V website provides invaluable information.  A good understanding of digital logic design principles, along with familiarity with tools like Vivado for FPGA synthesis and implementation, is indispensable.  Lastly, consult relevant FPGA documentation, specifically for the Nexys-A7-100T board, for precise constraints and resource limitations.  Understanding timing analysis reports during FPGA implementation is also crucial for achieving timing closure.  A systematic approach, emphasizing modularity and clear documentation, is critical in managing the complexity of this endeavor.
