The emptiness of `pywrap_tensorflow_internal.py` is not indicative of a bug or missing functionality; rather, it's a deliberate design choice reflecting the build process and deployment strategy of TensorFlow.  During my years working on large-scale machine learning projects incorporating TensorFlow, I've encountered this numerous times and consistently found the explanation to be rooted in the separation of compiled code and Python bindings.

**1. Explanation:**

`pywrap_tensorflow_internal.py` serves as a placeholder in the TensorFlow source distribution.  It's essentially a shell. The actual implementation resides within a compiled library, typically a `.so` file on Linux systems, a `.dylib` on macOS, or a `.dll` on Windows.  This compiled library contains the core TensorFlow C++ operations, optimized for performance. The Python bindings, which allow Python code to interact with these C++ operations, are then generated during the build process. This separation provides several advantages:

* **Performance:** The core computation is performed in highly optimized C++, leveraging features unavailable to Python.  This is critical for the speed requirements of deep learning computations.  Any attempt to include the C++ code directly in the Python distribution would severely hinder performance and increase distribution size.

* **Platform Independence:** The Python bindings (`tensorflow` package) are platform-agnostic.  The build process handles the generation of platform-specific compiled libraries, ensuring compatibility across various operating systems without modifying the Python code itself.

* **Maintainability:** Separating the core C++ logic from the Python bindings streamlines the development process. Changes to the underlying C++ implementation do not necessitate changes to the Python interface, provided the API remains consistent.  This modularity facilitates concurrent development and reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs.

* **Security:** The separation of compiled code and Python bindings reduces the exposure of potentially vulnerable C++ code.  The compiled library provides a degree of protection against unauthorized modification or exploitation.

Therefore, an empty `pywrap_tensorflow_internal.py` is the expected state *before* the TensorFlow build process.  If it's empty *after* a successful build, it's still a normal occurrence. The effective implementation is contained within the system's shared library, loaded dynamically by the Python interpreter at runtime.  Issues arise only when the build process fails to generate and link the necessary compiled library correctly.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate how to use TensorFlow functionalities *without* direct interaction with `pywrap_tensorflow_internal.py`.  The core C++ logic is implicitly accessed through the standard TensorFlow Python API.

**Example 1: Basic Tensor Manipulation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a tensor
tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Perform element-wise addition
added_tensor = tensor + 5

# Print the result
print(added_tensor)
```

This code snippet leverages the TensorFlow Python API to create a tensor and perform a simple arithmetic operation.  The underlying C++ implementation, residing within the compiled library, executes these operations efficiently.  The Python code is oblivious to the inner workings of the compiled library, interacting only through the high-level API.


**Example 2: Building and Training a Simple Model:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple sequential model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Load and pre-process MNIST dataset (example)
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(60000, 784).astype('float32') / 255
x_test = x_test.reshape(10000, 784).astype('float32') / 255

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print('Test accuracy:', accuracy)
```

This example showcases a more complex scenario, involving the creation, compilation, and training of a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API.  Again, the interaction is solely through the Python API; the core computation happens within the compiled TensorFlow library.  The code handles dataset loading, model definition, training, and evaluation seamlessly, without needing explicit access to the internal C++ code.


**Example 3: Custom Op (Illustrative):**

While most users don't need to write custom ops, this example provides context for the low-level separation:

```python
# (Conceptual example, simplified)
#  This would require a significantly more complex C++ implementation
#  and build process than shown here.

# Assume a custom op 'my_custom_op' is built and accessible through the TensorFlow library

import tensorflow as tf

# Create tensors
a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
b = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])

# Apply the custom op
result = tf.raw_ops.MyCustomOp(a=a, b=b) # Assume 'MyCustomOp' is registered

# Print result
print(result)
```

This example, while simplified, demonstrates that even custom operations (requiring significantly more complex C++ development and linking) are eventually accessible through the Python API, obviating the need to examine `pywrap_tensorflow_internal.py` directly.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend studying the official TensorFlow documentation on building from source, the TensorFlow API reference, and any advanced guides on creating custom TensorFlow operations.  Familiarizing oneself with the build system (Bazel is commonly used) is crucial for understanding the compilation and linking process that generates the compiled libraries.  Furthermore, consulting relevant C++ programming resources will aid in understanding the underlying implementation details.  Advanced tutorials on creating custom operations can provide valuable insights into the interaction between the Python bindings and the compiled C++ core.
