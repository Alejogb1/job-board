The concept of an "average layer" in a multi-input deep learning model lacks precise definition.  There isn't a universally agreed-upon metric for averaging layers across different input streams.  Instead, the appropriate approach depends heavily on the model architecture and the intended application. My experience designing and optimizing multi-modal models for natural language processing and computer vision has shown that focusing on layer *equivalence* and *interaction* is far more beneficial than attempting a direct average.

This response will clarify this point and illustrate different strategies for handling multi-input architectures. I'll avoid the simplistic notion of averaging layer depths and instead present methods for managing parallel and concatenated input streams within a deep learning model.


**1. Understanding Multi-Input Architectures**

Multi-input models typically handle multiple data sources – images, text, sensor readings, etc. – by employing one of two primary strategies:

* **Parallel Processing:** Each input stream undergoes independent processing through its own dedicated branch of the network. These branches often have varying depths and structures, tailored to the specific nature of the input data.  Later, these branches converge, often through concatenation or element-wise operations.

* **Concatenation:**  After initial, potentially independent processing, the feature representations from different input streams are concatenated along a specific dimension (usually the channel dimension). This combined representation then feeds into subsequent layers.


Attempting to calculate an "average layer" across these disparate branches is problematic.  A deep convolutional neural network processing images might have far more layers than a recurrent neural network processing textual data. Directly averaging the layer counts would be meaningless, obscuring the architectural differences critical to the model's functionality.


**2.  Strategies for Managing Multi-Input Architectures**

Instead of aiming for an average, focus on these strategies:

* **Layer Equivalence:**  Determine if layers in different branches perform analogous functions.  For instance, in a model processing images and text for visual question answering, the initial convolutional layers in the image branch might be considered equivalent in function to the embedding layers in the text branch.  These layers, despite their different architectures, perform a similar task: extracting low-level features from the input data.  This functional equivalence is more relevant than a simple layer count.

* **Interaction Layer Depth:**  Pay close attention to the depth of the layers *after* the input streams converge. This section of the network is responsible for integrating information from multiple sources.  The depth of these interaction layers reflects the complexity of the multi-modal feature integration.  This is a more meaningful metric than an average of the individual branch depths.

* **Feature Dimensionality Analysis:** Analyze the dimensionality of the feature maps at various points in the model.  A sudden and significant increase or decrease in dimensionality at the interaction layers indicates potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies, regardless of the raw layer count.

**3. Code Examples**

The following code examples illustrate different approaches to handling multi-input architectures in Python using Keras/TensorFlow.


**Example 1: Parallel Processing with Early Convergence**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Input layers for image and text data
image_input = keras.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3), name='image_input')
text_input = keras.Input(shape=(100,), name='text_input')

# Image branch (CNN)
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(image_input)
x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = keras.layers.Flatten()(x)
image_features = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)

# Text branch (RNN)
y = keras.layers.Embedding(10000, 128)(text_input)
y = keras.layers.LSTM(128)(y)
text_features = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(y)

# Concatenation and output layer
merged = keras.layers.concatenate([image_features, text_features])
output = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged)

model = keras.Model(inputs=[image_input, text_input], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
```

This model processes images and text in parallel and then concatenates the features before a final output layer.  There's no average layer; the focus is on the functional equivalence of the feature extraction layers and the depth of the post-concatenation layers.


**Example 2: Parallel Processing with Late Convergence**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Input layers
image_input = keras.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3), name='image_input')
text_input = keras.Input(shape=(100,), name='text_input')

# Independent branches with more depth
image_branch = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    keras.layers.Conv2D(128, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')
])

text_branch = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Embedding(10000, 128),
    keras.layers.LSTM(256),
    keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')
])

# Process inputs through branches
image_features = image_branch(image_input)
text_features = text_branch(text_input)

# Late concatenation and output
merged = keras.layers.concatenate([image_features, text_features])
output = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged)

model = keras.Model(inputs=[image_input, text_input], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
```

Here, both branches have greater depth before converging. The "average" is irrelevant; the focus shifts to the interaction layer's depth after the late-stage concatenation.

**Example 3:  Feature-Level Fusion**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Inputs
image_input = keras.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3), name='image_input')
text_input = keras.Input(shape=(100,), name='text_input')

# Feature extraction (simplified)
image_features = keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(image_input)
text_features = keras.layers.Embedding(10000, 64)(text_input)

# Element-wise multiplication for feature fusion
fused_features = keras.layers.Multiply()([image_features, tf.expand_dims(text_features, axis=1)])

# Further processing
x = keras.layers.Flatten()(fused_features)
output = keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)

model = keras.Model(inputs=[image_input, text_input], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
```

This example showcases feature-level fusion, where the inputs interact at an early stage, and averaging layer counts is even less applicable.



**4. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of multi-input deep learning architectures, I recommend reviewing advanced deep learning textbooks and research papers on multi-modal learning.  Pay particular attention to publications focusing on architectures for specific multi-modal tasks, such as visual question answering, machine translation, or sentiment analysis.  Exploring the source code of established multi-modal models on platforms such as TensorFlow Hub or PyTorch Hub can provide practical insights into the design choices made by experienced practitioners.  Finally, focusing on the theory and practice of feature extraction and representation learning will be invaluable for effectively designing and analyzing these complex models.
