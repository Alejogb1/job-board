The observed behavior of an Anaconda TensorFlow environment consuming 95% of system memory and exhibiting sluggish performance typically stems from a combination of resource contention, suboptimal configuration within TensorFlow, and potentially inefficient data handling practices. From my experience managing numerous machine learning development environments, this situation usually does not represent an inherent flaw in Anaconda or TensorFlow themselves, but rather a consequence of their flexible configuration and user-defined workflows.

Specifically, TensorFlow, while powerful, is not automatically memory-aware. It will readily allocate the resources it *thinks* it needs, and sometimes more, particularly when configured to use the entire available GPU memory for a large model. This eagerness to allocate, coupled with Python's inherent memory management characteristics, and a default reliance on CPU for certain operations, often culminates in the reported high memory utilization and corresponding performance degradation. Furthermore, the default TensorFlow setup often does not consider the overhead of additional processes running within an Anaconda environment, like Jupyter notebooks or IDEs. Therefore, optimizing the interaction between these layers is crucial.

Let us examine three common scenarios that exacerbate this issue, and their practical mitigation strategies:

**1. Insufficient or Uncontrolled GPU Memory Management:**

TensorFlow, by default, attempts to grab all available GPU memory, believing that it can use it efficiently throughout its lifespan, especially if GPUs are available. This is a reasonable assumption in isolation, but it does not account for other simultaneous processes running on the same hardware. This greedy allocation effectively starves other applications, leading to system slowdown. Furthermore, TensorFlow might hold on to cached memory even after tensors are no longer needed, resulting in a constant consumption of available memory.

To address this, one must constrain the amount of memory TensorFlow can allocate. Below is an example demonstrating this controlled allocation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Configure GPU memory usage.
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    try:
        # Restrict TensorFlow to utilize only 5GB memory from each GPU
        for gpu in gpus:
            tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration(
                gpu,
                [tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=5120)] # Memory limit in MB
            )
        logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
        print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
    except RuntimeError as e:
    # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
        print(e)

# Model definition and training to follow here...
# ...
```

*Commentary:* This code snippet first retrieves all available GPUs. Then, for each GPU found, it restricts TensorFlow to use only a predefined amount of memory (5GB or 5120 MB in the example). This is implemented via setting logical devices using `tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration`. Setting this limit on initialization prevents TensorFlow from consuming the entirety of available memory at the outset. The `try...except` block also handles potential errors when setting the logical configuration after GPU initialization.  This approach allows other system processes to function without memory starvation and leads to more balanced resource allocation. This memory restriction may necessitate adjustments to batch size or other training parameters.

**2. Inefficient CPU-bound operations and Data Pipeline Bottlenecks:**

While TensorFlow excels in GPU-accelerated computations, certain operations, particularly data loading, preprocessing, and non-tensor related operations, default to the CPU. If these operations are not optimized, the CPU can become a bottleneck, especially when handling large datasets or complex preprocessing routines.  Furthermore, if the data pipeline is not configured to effectively utilize available CPU cores, it can slow down data ingestion, leading to idle GPU time and overall slow training. This may present itself as high CPU usage, but often relates to the memory consumption that results from these pipeline delays as data buffers up.

Here is an illustrative example of how to enhance the data loading using TensorFlow's built-in features:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

# Function to map data pre-processing
def map_function(image, label):
    image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, dtype=tf.float32)
    image = tf.image.resize(image, (224, 224))
    return image, label

# Load a dataset from tensorflow_datasets
dataset = tfds.load('cifar10', split='train', as_supervised=True)

# Apply the pre-processing mapping, cache for performance improvement, shuffle and batch data
dataset = dataset.map(map_function, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE).cache().shuffle(1000).batch(64).prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

# Model training code continues here...
# ...
```

*Commentary:* The `tf.data.Dataset` API is leveraged to perform efficient data loading and processing. By utilizing `num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE` in the map function, the data transformations are parallelized across available CPU cores. The `.cache()` method allows keeping the transformed data in memory (or on disk), avoiding redundant operations.  The `.shuffle()` function ensures data randomization and `.batch()` creates batches of training examples. Finally,  `.prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE)` overlaps the data preparation and training execution, increasing overall pipeline efficiency.  These strategies significantly reduce data loading bottlenecks and thus the potential for memory build-up due to delayed data ingestion.

**3. Unoptimized Memory Handling in Python and TensorFlow:**

Python's automatic garbage collection, while convenient, is not always efficient with large numerical arrays and TensorFlow tensors. TensorFlow may hold on to resources that are no longer needed if not explicitly released. For example, repeatedly creating large tensors within loops and not deleting them can lead to memory leaks, contributing to the 95% utilization problem.

The following snippet demonstrates the explicit use of the garbage collector to free unused memory and the advantages of using Tensor slices instead of creating copies.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import gc
import numpy as np

def memory_intensive_task(size):

    for _ in range(10):
        # Create a very large numpy array
        large_array = np.random.rand(size,size)
        tensor_from_array = tf.constant(large_array)
        # Perform a computation
        result = tf.matmul(tensor_from_array,tf.transpose(tensor_from_array))
        # Explicitly delete the tensor
        del tensor_from_array
        del result
        # Run garbage collection
        gc.collect()

    print('Finished memory-intensive loop')


def efficient_tensor_handling(size):

    #create large tensor once
    large_tensor = tf.random.normal((size, size), dtype=tf.float32)

    for _ in range(10):
        # Use slice views for efficient computation
        slice_tensor = large_tensor[0:size//2,0:size//2]
        result = tf.matmul(slice_tensor,tf.transpose(slice_tensor))
        # No need to delete tensors created with slice, as the are only views
        del result
        gc.collect()

    print('Finished efficient tensor loop')

memory_intensive_task(200)
efficient_tensor_handling(200)
```

*Commentary:* The first function demonstrates a naive way of creating and deleting large tensors within a loop, which can cause memory fragmentation if garbage collection is not invoked. The use of `del` removes references to the tensors, and the `gc.collect()` triggers a forced garbage collection cycle. In the second function, only one large tensor is created, and subsequent operations are performed on slices of that tensor; these slices are views and do not lead to the creation of new copies and thus avoid memory overhead. The explicit `del` and garbage collector call provide explicit control over memory release. This approach avoids the accumulation of unused memory, thereby promoting more efficient memory use. The `tf.function` decorator can be used to further improve performance but it's not demonstrated here because memory usage is the core of the discussion.

In conclusion, the high memory utilization and slowness of an Anaconda TensorFlow environment are often due to suboptimal configurations rather than intrinsic problems. By controlling GPU memory allocation, optimizing data pipelines, and explicitly managing memory usage, one can alleviate these performance issues.  Additional investigations should include, when the models use significant memory, a closer examination of the batch sizes, model architecture, and specific operations being performed.

For further learning on this topic, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation (specifically the sections on GPU configuration and data loading) along with resources on Python memory management. Books and online courses covering practical aspects of machine learning system design and optimization are also highly beneficial. Reading and studying relevant sections of Python and TensorFlow code repositories could also prove useful for understanding specific implementation details.
