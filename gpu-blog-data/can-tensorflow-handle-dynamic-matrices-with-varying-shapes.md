TensorFlow's ability to manage dynamic matrices hinges on its flexible tensor handling capabilities and the strategic use of specific TensorFlow operations.  In my experience optimizing large-scale deep learning models for medical image analysis, encountering irregularly sized input data—a common scenario—highlighted the crucial role of  `tf.ragged` and `tf.while_loop` for efficient processing of dynamic matrices.  Static shape declaration isn't a limitation; rather, it's a starting point that necessitates tailored approaches for scenarios involving variable dimensions.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow fundamentally operates on tensors, multi-dimensional arrays.  While statically shaped tensors are convenient and optimized for performance, the framework explicitly supports dynamic shapes.  However, this support isn't implicit; the programmer must explicitly manage the dynamism.  The key is understanding that TensorFlow executes a computational graph.  This graph is defined *before* execution, but its execution can accommodate variable inputs.  The illusion of "dynamic" shapes is achieved by strategically utilizing placeholders or creating the computational graph in a shape-agnostic manner.

Static shapes are declared when you create a tensor, like `tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])`.  This tensor will *always* have a shape of (2, 2).  Dynamic shapes, on the other hand, require a strategy to handle the variability.  This generally involves either:

* **Using `tf.RaggedTensor`:** This is ideal for cases where the number of elements along one or more dimensions varies.  `tf.RaggedTensor` explicitly stores the varying lengths of rows (or other dimensions).  This is particularly effective for sequences of variable length, like sentences in natural language processing or time-series data with missing values.

* **Employing `tf.while_loop` or other control flow operations:**  For scenarios where the shape changes based on computed values within the graph, `tf.while_loop` offers fine-grained control.  This allows creating iterative computations where the tensor shape evolves during execution, based on intermediate results.  Note that excessive use of `tf.while_loop` can impact performance, requiring careful consideration of computational graph optimization techniques.

* **Utilizing `tf.placeholder` (deprecated, but illustrative):** Although `tf.placeholder` is deprecated in favor of `tf.function` and eager execution, understanding its role is instructive.  `tf.placeholder` would allow you to create a tensor with a shape defined only at runtime, essentially creating a "shape placeholder".  This is less efficient than `tf.RaggedTensor` or `tf.while_loop` for most modern applications.

Failure to correctly handle dynamic shapes often leads to shape mismatches during graph execution, resulting in runtime errors.  Careful planning and the appropriate use of TensorFlow's dynamic shape handling mechanisms are key to successful implementation.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Ragged Tensors for Variable-Length Sequences**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

ragged_tensor = tf.ragged.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6]])
print(ragged_tensor)
# Output: <tf.RaggedTensor [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6]]>

# Perform operations on the RaggedTensor.  Many TensorFlow operations natively support them.
summed_tensor = tf.reduce_sum(ragged_tensor, axis=1)
print(summed_tensor)
# Output: <tf.RaggedTensor [[ 3], [12], [ 6]]>

#Convert to a dense tensor, padding with zeros if necessary.
dense_tensor = ragged_tensor.to_tensor(default_value=0)
print(dense_tensor)

```
This illustrates using `tf.RaggedTensor` to handle a list of lists with varying lengths. The `tf.reduce_sum` function works directly on the ragged tensor, demonstrating its seamless integration within TensorFlow's computational graph.  The final conversion to a dense tensor demonstrates how to deal with ragged tensors in situations needing statically-shaped inputs.


**Example 2: `tf.while_loop` for Iterative Shape Modification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def dynamic_shape_processing(initial_tensor):
  i = tf.constant(0)
  tensor_accumulator = initial_tensor

  def condition(i, tensor_accumulator):
    return tf.less(i, 5)

  def body(i, tensor_accumulator):
    tensor_accumulator = tf.concat([tensor_accumulator, tf.expand_dims(tf.constant(i+10), axis=0)], axis=0) #Appending value
    return tf.add(i, 1), tensor_accumulator

  _, final_tensor = tf.while_loop(condition, body, loop_vars=[i, tensor_accumulator])
  return final_tensor

initial_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
final_tensor = dynamic_shape_processing(initial_tensor)
print(final_tensor)
# Output will vary slightly due to the dynamic nature, example [1, 2], [3, 4], [10], [11], [12]...

```

Here, `tf.while_loop` dynamically modifies the shape of a tensor.  The loop continues until a condition is met, gradually building the final tensor.  The shape of `final_tensor` is determined during execution, making it inherently dynamic.  The `tf.concat` operation demonstrates how to append data in a shape-aware manner; handling shapes requires care and awareness of TensorFlow's broadcasting rules.


**Example 3: Handling Unknown Dimensions with `None` in Shape Specification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Define a placeholder with one dimension set to None.
input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(None, 3))

# Define a simple layer. The None dimension won't be a problem since it's a dynamic tensor
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=5)(input_tensor)

# Create a model
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=dense_layer)

#Example Input
input_data = tf.constant([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9]]])

#Inference
output = model(input_data)
print(output)

```
This example uses Keras, a high-level API built on TensorFlow. Defining the input layer with `(None, 3)` signifies that the first dimension can be of any length, while the second must always be 3. The `Dense` layer handles the varying input sequences gracefully.  This illustrates a common practical scenario where one must accommodate variable-length sequences in a Keras model.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, including its guides on ragged tensors and control flow, provides comprehensive information.  The TensorFlow API reference is crucial for understanding the specifics of each function.  Books on deep learning with TensorFlow will cover practical applications. Consider exploring resources focusing on TensorFlow's graph execution model to deeply understand how dynamic shapes are managed within the computational framework. Advanced texts on distributed TensorFlow and performance optimization will address techniques for handling extremely large-scale, dynamically-shaped data.
