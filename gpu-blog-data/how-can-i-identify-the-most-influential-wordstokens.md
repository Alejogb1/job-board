The critical challenge in understanding PyTorch text classification model predictions lies not merely in achieving high accuracy, but in interpreting the model's reasoning.  Simply knowing the overall prediction is insufficient; we require granular insight into which input tokens most heavily influenced the final classification.  My experience working on sentiment analysis for financial news articles revealed the need for robust methods beyond simple feature importance scores, as those often fail to account for complex interactions within the model's architecture. This necessitates techniques capable of probing the model's internal representations.

The most effective approach leverages gradient-based methods to quantify the influence of each input token.  We can perform this by calculating the gradient of the model's output with respect to the input embedding vector.  This gradient indicates the sensitivity of the model's prediction to changes in each token's embedding.  A larger gradient magnitude signifies a more influential token.  However, direct gradient interpretation can be misleading due to the non-linearity of the model and potential scaling issues across different tokens. Therefore, a normalized gradient approach is preferred.

This explanation will outline three methods to identify influential tokens, each offering a unique perspective and addressing potential limitations.  These methods assume you possess a pre-trained PyTorch text classification model and its corresponding input embeddings.

**Method 1: Gradient-based Saliency Maps (Integrated Gradients)**

This approach calculates the integrated gradients, which provides a more robust estimate of feature importance than simple gradient calculation. Integrated gradients address the issue of the gradient's sensitivity to the starting point by averaging gradients along a path from a baseline input (e.g., all-zero vector) to the actual input.  I've found this particularly useful when dealing with models exhibiting highly non-linear behaviour,  reducing the tendency toward sharp gradient spikes which skew results.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def integrated_gradients(model, input_ids, target_class):
    # input_ids: input token IDs (tensor)
    # target_class: target class index (int)

    baseline = torch.zeros_like(input_ids, requires_grad=True)
    steps = 20
    alphas = torch.linspace(0, 1, steps).to(input_ids.device)

    gradients = []
    for alpha in alphas:
        interpolated_input = baseline + alpha * (input_ids - baseline)
        interpolated_input.requires_grad_(True) # crucial for gradient calculation

        output = model(interpolated_input)
        loss = F.cross_entropy(output, torch.tensor([target_class]))
        loss.backward()
        gradients.append(interpolated_input.grad.detach().clone())

    integrated_gradients = torch.mean(torch.stack(gradients), dim=0)

    #Post-process gradients (e.g. L1 norm) to obtain saliency scores for each token
    saliency_scores = torch.abs(integrated_gradients).sum(dim=-1) #L1 norm
    return saliency_scores

# Example usage (assuming 'model' is your loaded PyTorch model):
input_ids = torch.randint(0, 1000, (1, 50))  #Example input
saliency_scores = integrated_gradients(model, input_ids, 1) # target class is 1
top_k_indices = torch.topk(saliency_scores, k=10).indices #Get indices of top 10 influential words
```

**Method 2: Attention Mechanism Inspection**

If your model incorporates an attention mechanism (like Transformers), directly examining the attention weights provides a clear insight into which tokens the model considered most relevant during the classification process.  During my work on financial news, I observed that attention weights frequently highlighted specific keywords and phrases directly related to the predicted sentiment.  This approach is simpler to implement than gradient-based methods.

```python
import torch

def get_attention_weights(model, input_ids, layer_index= -1, head_index = 0):
    # layer_index: select which layer's attention to analyze, -1 for the last layer
    # head_index: select which attention head, 0 for the first head

    model.eval() #important to switch model to evaluation mode
    with torch.no_grad():
      output = model(input_ids)
      attention_weights = model.encoder.layers[layer_index].self_attn.attention_weights[head_index] # Example access, adapt to your model's architecture

    return attention_weights


# Example Usage (Assuming 'model' is your PyTorch Transformer model):
input_ids = torch.randint(0, 1000, (1, 50)) #Example input
attention_weights = get_attention_weights(model, input_ids)
#attention_weights.shape should be (batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, seq_len)
average_attention = attention_weights.mean(dim=1) # average across heads
top_k_indices = torch.topk(average_attention[0].sum(dim=0), k=10).indices #sum across rows to get influence per token

```

**Method 3: Perturbation-based Methods**

Perturbation methods involve systematically altering the input tokens and observing the impact on the model's prediction.  This allows for direct measurement of token influence.  I found this method particularly useful for models where attention weights or gradients were not readily accessible or interpretable.  The process requires iteratively masking or replacing tokens and evaluating the prediction change.

```python
import torch
import copy

def perturbation_method(model, input_ids, target_class):
    original_prediction = model(input_ids)
    original_prob = original_prediction[0][target_class].item()
    influence_scores = []

    for i in range(input_ids.shape[1]):
        perturbed_input = copy.deepcopy(input_ids)
        perturbed_input[0, i] = 0 # mask the token

        perturbed_prediction = model(perturbed_input)
        perturbed_prob = perturbed_prediction[0][target_class].item()

        influence = abs(original_prob - perturbed_prob) # difference in prediction probabilities
        influence_scores.append(influence)

    influence_scores = torch.tensor(influence_scores)
    top_k_indices = torch.topk(influence_scores, k=10).indices
    return top_k_indices

# Example Usage
input_ids = torch.randint(0, 1000, (1, 50)) #Example input
top_k_indices = perturbation_method(model, input_ids, 1) # Target class is 1
```

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of gradient-based explanation methods, I would recommend exploring literature on Integrated Gradients and its variants.  A thorough understanding of attention mechanisms within Transformers is crucial when utilizing the second method. Finally, a comprehensive grasp of perturbation-based methods for model interpretability will prove beneficial.  Remember to adapt these code examples to your specific model architecture and tokenization scheme.  Consider using techniques like L2 normalization of gradient or attention weight vectors for improved stability.  Always rigorously evaluate these methods against suitable baselines and ensure their results align with your overall model understanding.
