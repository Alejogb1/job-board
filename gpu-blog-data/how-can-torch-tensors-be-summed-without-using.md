Torch tensors, representing multidimensional arrays, are foundational to PyTorch's deep learning framework. Efficient numerical computation is crucial; therefore, leveraging vectorized operations instead of iterative loops significantly improves performance, especially with larger datasets. I've frequently encountered situations, during both model training and data preprocessing routines, where needing to sum elements across specified tensor dimensions arises. I've found that the `torch.sum()` function is my go-to method for avoiding explicit looping in these circumstances.

**Explanation of `torch.sum()`**

The `torch.sum()` function in PyTorch is designed to compute the sum of tensor elements. Its power lies in its ability to perform summation along specific dimensions of a tensor, or across all elements in the case of no dimension specified. This process is highly optimized, exploiting underlying libraries capable of parallelized computation, unlike explicit looping which is inherently sequential. Consequently, `torch.sum()` achieves far superior speeds, particularly when operating on large tensors which are typical in deep learning workflows.

The flexibility of `torch.sum()` extends to accepting an optional `dim` parameter. This parameter specifies the dimension(s) across which the summation occurs. If `dim` is an integer, the summation is done along that single dimension, producing a resulting tensor with one fewer dimension. If `dim` is a tuple of integers, the summation is performed across all the specified dimensions, again collapsing dimensions. The `keepdim` parameter, also optional, controls whether the output tensor maintains the same number of dimensions as the input. If `keepdim=True`, dimensions along which the summation is done are not removed, but are retained with a size of 1.

**Code Example 1: Summing all elements in a tensor**

This example demonstrates the simplest use case of `torch.sum()`, where the goal is to compute the sum of all the elements of a tensor regardless of its shape. No `dim` parameter is specified, and hence `torch.sum()` defaults to summing across all elements.

```python
import torch

# Create a 2x3 tensor
tensor_a = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=torch.float32)

# Sum all elements
sum_all = torch.sum(tensor_a)

print(f"Original Tensor:\n{tensor_a}")
print(f"Sum of all elements: {sum_all}")
```

**Commentary:**

The output of this code will show the original 2x3 tensor alongside the scalar sum which is `21`. The simplicity of this example underscores how easily all tensor elements can be aggregated, an often-required preprocessing step, without needing any for-loops.

**Code Example 2: Summing elements along a specified dimension**

This example focuses on the use of the `dim` parameter to sum tensor elements across a particular dimension. This can be thought of as 'collapsing' the specified dimension, summing all elements within it. In practical scenarios, I have used this when aggregating features along a temporal dimension in recurrent networks, for instance.

```python
import torch

# Create a 3x4 tensor
tensor_b = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                         [5, 6, 7, 8],
                         [9, 10, 11, 12]], dtype=torch.float32)

# Sum elements along dimension 0 (rows)
sum_dim0 = torch.sum(tensor_b, dim=0)

# Sum elements along dimension 1 (columns)
sum_dim1 = torch.sum(tensor_b, dim=1)


print(f"Original Tensor:\n{tensor_b}")
print(f"Sum along dimension 0:\n{sum_dim0}")
print(f"Sum along dimension 1:\n{sum_dim1}")
```

**Commentary:**

The output displays the initial 3x4 tensor. Then, `sum_dim0` will yield a 1x4 tensor (`[15., 18., 21., 24.]`), which is the sum of each column. `sum_dim1` will yield a 1x3 tensor (`[10., 26., 42.]`), representing the sum of each row. These tensor sums are generated without any explicit iterative looping.

**Code Example 3: Summing elements along specified dimensions and retaining dimensions**

This example uses both the `dim` and `keepdim` parameters. The `keepdim` parameter ensures the output tensor maintains the same number of dimensions as the original by adding a unit dimension where summation occurred. I have found this especially useful when preparing data for broadcasting operations, where matching tensor dimensions are required.

```python
import torch

# Create a 2x3x2 tensor
tensor_c = torch.tensor([[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]],
                         [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]], dtype=torch.float32)

# Sum along dimension 1, keeping the dimension
sum_dim1_keepdim = torch.sum(tensor_c, dim=1, keepdim=True)

print(f"Original Tensor:\n{tensor_c}")
print(f"Sum along dimension 1, keeping dimensions:\n{sum_dim1_keepdim}")
print(f"Shape of the summed tensor: {sum_dim1_keepdim.shape}")
```

**Commentary:**

The output shows the original 2x3x2 tensor and then `sum_dim1_keepdim`. The summation happens across dimension 1 (the 'middle' dimension), collapsing it while also maintaining it via `keepdim=True`. This result, thus, has shape 2x1x2, instead of simply 2x2, had `keepdim=False`. This can be invaluable when maintaining compatibility for operations that require consistent dimensionality.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of PyTorch tensor operations, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation. It offers a comprehensive breakdown of functions, parameters, and usage patterns. There are also numerous online courses and tutorials dedicated to PyTorch, which provide practical examples and more extended coverage of its functionality. I have also found it valuable to consult academic publications and research papers focusing on deep learning, where the application of tensor operations like summation is frequently illustrated within practical contexts. Specifically, pay close attention to the examples provided in those publications, as they will give you more perspective on how these functions are used in a real context. Finally, actively engaging in coding challenges and Kaggle competitions can offer hands-on experience working with torch tensors and further solidify your understanding of vectorized operations.
