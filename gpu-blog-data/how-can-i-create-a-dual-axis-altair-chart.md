Creating dual-axis charts in Altair, especially when dealing with temporal data, requires careful consideration of data transformations and layering techniques. I've encountered this frequently in my work analyzing time-series datasets, particularly when needing to visualize two distinct measurements with varying scales against the same date range. The key is understanding how to independently encode the two series and then merge them within the same visualization space.

The fundamental principle is to first prepare the data appropriately, ensuring that the date field is formatted consistently and that each series to be plotted is structured in a way that aligns with Altair's encoding requirements. Subsequently, two separate chart specifications must be constructed - one for the bar chart and one for the line chart - each with their respective axes and scales. These separate specifications are then layered using `alt.layer`, which allows for charts to be overlaid on top of each other. Importantly, the axis scales for the secondary axis must be defined within its respective chart spec before layering.

Consider an example where I am monitoring website traffic (visits) and server load (CPU percentage) over time. These two metrics operate on different scales and require separate visual representations. Here's how I approach this using Altair:

First, let's define a sample dataset. This will be a pandas DataFrame, a data structure that Altair directly accepts.

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

data = {
    'date': pd.to_datetime(['2024-01-01', '2024-01-02', '2024-01-03', '2024-01-04', '2024-01-05']),
    'visits': [1200, 1500, 1300, 1800, 2000],
    'cpu_percentage': [30, 35, 40, 38, 45]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

```

In this initial code block, we import the necessary libraries and define a sample dataset using a Python dictionary, converting the date column to datetime objects. This ensures Altair can properly interpret the temporal data.  I've used a `pd.to_datetime` method to enforce this type within the pandas dataframe, which is a habit from long experience with temporal dataset analysis.

Next, let's construct the bar chart representing the website visits. We will encode the 'date' on the x-axis and 'visits' on the y-axis using a quantitative scale.

```python
bar_chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_bar().encode(
    x=alt.X('date:T', title='Date'),
    y=alt.Y('visits:Q', title='Website Visits')
).properties(
    title='Website Traffic and Server Load'
)
```

Here, a bar chart specification is created. I've explicitly typed the date column using the `:T` shorthand for temporal and the `visits` using `:Q` for quantitative. The title parameter clarifies the overall intent of the visualization.  Note how the scale for the y-axis is implicitly determined by the 'visits' column.

Now we construct the line chart representing the server load. This is where the secondary y-axis is created. We must specify the y-axis scale explicitly to position it appropriately on the right side of the chart.

```python
line_chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_line(color='red').encode(
    x=alt.X('date:T', title='Date'),
    y=alt.Y('cpu_percentage:Q', title='CPU Percentage', scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),
).properties()

```

The line chart is constructed in a similar manner, with the addition of a color parameter. The critical part is the `scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)` argument in the y encoding. This specifies that the CPU percentage axis should not start from zero and will be on the right side when layered later, creating our dual axis effect. Itâ€™s crucial to use this scaling technique to prevent data distortion.  Without `zero=False`, the y-axis will extend down to zero, potentially obscuring the trend for the cpu percentage. In my past work, I have seen many visualizations improperly communicate trends by forcing the secondary scale to extend to zero.

Finally, we layer these two charts and add a configuration that disables the padding between layered charts. This minimizes white space and ensures an optimal alignment of axes.

```python
combined_chart = alt.layer(bar_chart, line_chart).resolve_scale(
    y = 'independent'
).configure_view(
    strokeWidth=0
)
combined_chart.display()
```

The `alt.layer` function combines the two charts and the `resolve_scale(y='independent')` specifies that the y axes should be rendered using their individual encodings. Finally, `configure_view(strokeWidth=0)` eliminates the border from the layered chart, making it visually more streamlined. This avoids redundant borders and improves visual appeal of the output.

A further important consideration for dual-axis charts with dates is the handling of time zones. Depending on your source data, the dates might be represented in different time zones. If the source is inconsistent, it will be imperative to normalize the date column to a common time zone, either through pandas manipulation or by specifying the time zone directly in Altair's encoding using a timeunit parameter. For example,  `alt.X('date:T', timeUnit='utc', title='Date UTC')`  could be used if you wanted to convert all dates to UTC. This normalization will ensure temporal alignment. Ignoring this often results in misaligned data, especially when data spanning multiple days are analyzed. This is something I've become very aware of while working on global dataset comparisons.

In summary, the construction of dual-axis charts in Altair requires careful preparation of the data and a nuanced understanding of layering with encoding parameters. Key considerations include:

*   Explicitly defining date and number types within the encoding using `:T` and `:Q`.
*   Using `alt.layer` for combining multiple charts.
*   Specifying `y` scale independence using the `resolve_scale` operation for dual y-axes
*   Setting `zero=False` to create appropriate scales for the secondary axis
*   Time zone consistency
*   Disabling stroke borders when layering.

For additional resources, consult the official Altair documentation which provides in-depth coverage of layering and encodings. Also, explore visualization best-practices books, which often discuss the limitations and appropriate use cases for dual-axis charts. Technical journals on data visualization often provide valuable insights into effective communication through various charting types. Finally, community forums and Q&A sites often present various specific use cases and solutions, useful for broadening your toolkit. These have all been invaluable in my journey with data visualization and Altair specifically.
