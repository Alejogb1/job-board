The persistent zero signal in VHDL simulations often stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of signal assignment, specifically the difference between signal updates and the delta cycle.  My experience debugging complex FPGA designs, particularly those involving asynchronous interfaces and complex state machines, has shown this to be a recurring issue.  The problem rarely lies in a single, obvious error, but rather in a subtle interplay of concurrent signal assignments and the inherent timing model of VHDL.

**1. Explanation:**

VHDL, unlike many procedural languages, employs a concurrent execution model.  Signal assignments are not immediate; they are scheduled for update at the end of a simulation delta cycle.  A delta cycle represents the smallest unit of time in the VHDL simulation, during which all scheduled signal assignments are processed. This delayed assignment is crucial for understanding why a signal might remain at zero, even though an assignment seemingly takes place.  If a signal is assigned a value within a process, that assignment doesn't take effect until the next delta cycle.  If other processes or concurrent statements overwrite that assignment before the delta cycle completes, the intended value will be lost, and the signal will retain its previous value â€“ often zero, the default value for most signal types.

Another common cause relates to incomplete signal initialization.  While default values exist, they may not be sufficient for the desired functionality.  If a signal's value is dependent on another signal that itself is not properly initialized or updated consistently, the dependent signal will reflect that lack of proper initialization.  This cascade of uninitialized signals can lead to unexpectedly zero values propagating through the design.

Furthermore, issues with sensitivity lists within processes can create similar problems.  If a process is not sensitive to the signals it uses in its assignment statements, the process will not trigger its execution even when those signals change.  This results in the signal assigned within the process never changing from its default value. Finally, incorrect use of `wait` statements can inadvertently prevent signals from being updated at the appropriate times.  An improperly placed or constructed `wait` statement might freeze a process indefinitely, rendering subsequent signal assignments ineffectual.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Signal Assignment Order:**

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity zero_signal is
  port (
    clk : in std_logic;
    data_in : in std_logic;
    data_out : out std_logic
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of zero_signal is
  signal internal_data : std_logic;
begin
  process (clk)
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      internal_data <= data_in;  -- Assignment 1
      data_out <= internal_data; -- Assignment 2
    end if;
  end process;

  --Overwriting the assignment
  data_out <= '0'; -- Assignment 3
end architecture;
```

In this example, `data_out` is assigned '0' concurrently, overriding the assignment within the process.  The signal will remain '0' unless the concurrent assignment is removed or modified.  The intended behavior requires removing the concurrent assignment of `data_out <= '0';`.

**Example 2: Missing Sensitivity:**

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity sensitivity_issue is
  port (
    a : in std_logic;
    b : out std_logic
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of sensitivity_issue is
begin
  process (a) -- Missing sensitivity to 'c'
  begin
    signal c : std_logic := '0';
    c <= a;
    b <= c;
  end process;
end architecture;
```

Here, the process is only sensitive to `a`.  The internal signal `c` will correctly update; however, the assignment to `b` will only occur if the process is triggered.  Since the process isn't sensitive to `c`, a change in `a` that affects `c` won't automatically cause `b` to update.  The solution is to add `c` to the sensitivity list: `process (a, c)`.

**Example 3: Improper Wait Statement:**

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;

entity wait_problem is
  port (
    start : in std_logic;
    result : out std_logic
  );
end entity;

architecture behavioral of wait_problem is
begin
  process (start)
  begin
    wait until start = '1';
    wait; -- indefinite wait
    result <= '1';
  end process;
end architecture;
```

The `wait;` statement creates an indefinite wait, preventing the process from ever reaching the assignment `result <= '1'`.  The `result` signal will remain at its default value (0).  Removing or modifying the indefinite `wait` statement to a conditional wait is necessary.  For instance, replacing it with `wait until start = '0';` will allow the process to complete.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of VHDL concurrency and signal assignment, I recommend consulting the VHDL Language Reference Manual, a comprehensive textbook on VHDL design and simulation, and relevant application notes from FPGA vendors focusing on simulation best practices.  Furthermore,  carefully examining simulation waveforms, utilizing debugging tools provided by your simulation environment, and engaging in code reviews are crucial steps in identifying and resolving such issues. My years spent debugging designs, often involving multiple engineers, emphasizes the importance of methodical debugging and a thorough understanding of the VHDL language's nuances.  The key is systematic analysis, tracing signal values across multiple delta cycles and scrutinizing process behavior to locate the root cause of the problematic zero signal.
