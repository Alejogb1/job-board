Given a sequence of integer data and a set of variable-length ranges within that sequence, efficiently determining the maximum value for each range without employing a built-in rolling window function like `rolling().max()` requires a tailored approach.  My experience optimizing data analysis pipelines has shown that naive iterative methods can lead to significant performance bottlenecks, especially with large datasets. The core issue revolves around redundant computations when range windows overlap.  We need a strategy that minimizes recalculations.

The most effective solution, in my experience, is to leverage a sparse table preprocessing technique, often referred to as a Range Maximum Query (RMQ) data structure built with a sparse table.  This method involves precomputing maximum values for all sub-ranges of sizes that are powers of 2, which allows for quickly determining the maximum within any arbitrary range by combining results from precomputed sub-ranges. The fundamental principle is to utilize overlapping precomputed intervals of sizes 2^k to represent any arbitrary range length. Preprocessing takes O(N log N) time, but the subsequent query for the maximum element in an arbitrary range can be achieved in O(1) time, greatly improving performance for many queries over the same dataset.

First, I'll illustrate the preprocessing stage.  We create a table `sparse_table` with dimensions `[N][log2(N) + 1]` where `N` is the length of the input data. `sparse_table[i][j]` stores the maximum value for the range starting at index `i` with a length of 2^j.  The table is built incrementally, starting with ranges of length 1 (2^0), using previously computed values in the table.

```python
import math

def build_sparse_table(data):
    n = len(data)
    log_n = int(math.log2(n)) + 1
    sparse_table = [[0 for _ in range(log_n)] for _ in range(n)]

    # Initialize the first column of the sparse table with the original data
    for i in range(n):
        sparse_table[i][0] = data[i]

    # Populate the rest of the sparse table
    for j in range(1, log_n):
        for i in range(n):
            if i + (1 << j) <= n:
                sparse_table[i][j] = max(sparse_table[i][j-1], sparse_table[i + (1 << (j-1))][j-1])
    return sparse_table
```

This function, `build_sparse_table`, accepts the input `data` list and constructs the `sparse_table`. The first loop initializes the base cases for ranges of size 1. The nested loops then compute maximum values for ranges of successively larger powers of 2, relying on already calculated sub-ranges.  The expression `(1 << j)` calculates 2^j.

Now, to query the maximum value for an arbitrary range `[left, right]`, we can use this precomputed table. We find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the range length (`right - left + 1`), and determine the maximum by comparing two precomputed ranges that encompass the query range.

```python
def query_max_sparse_table(sparse_table, left, right):
    j = int(math.log2(right - left + 1))
    return max(sparse_table[left][j], sparse_table[right - (1 << j) + 1][j])
```
The `query_max_sparse_table` function determines the correct precomputed values using the logarithm. It obtains the largest power of 2 that fits within the requested range `[left, right]`. The returned maximum is then the maximum of two potentially overlapping sub-ranges, guaranteeing complete coverage of the query range. This is the essence of the efficiency of the sparse table method.

Finally, consider a complete usage example. Given input data and a series of ranges, we first precompute the sparse table and then utilize the query function to efficiently obtain the maximum values for each range.

```python
data = [3, 7, 2, 9, 1, 5, 8, 4, 6]
ranges = [(1, 4), (2, 7), (0, 2), (6, 8)] # Example ranges, inclusive indices
sparse_table = build_sparse_table(data)

for left, right in ranges:
    max_val = query_max_sparse_table(sparse_table, left, right)
    print(f"Maximum value in range [{left}, {right}]: {max_val}")
```

In this example, `build_sparse_table` is called once at the beginning.  Subsequently, `query_max_sparse_table` provides the maximum within any given interval in O(1) time per query. This demonstrates the power of precomputation for multiple queries over the same dataset.

For those seeking deeper understanding, research the "Range Maximum Query" problem and variations like "Range Minimum Query."  Texts on algorithmic design, such as "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen et al., discuss sparse tables and similar data structures in depth.  Another valuable resource is material on segment trees, which offer a similar functionality with different trade-offs.  These resources should provide a thorough understanding of the underlying concepts and alternative approaches to efficient range queries. While this response focuses on the sparse table technique due to its constant-time query performance, understanding the strengths and limitations of these data structures will equip you to select the optimal approach for specific requirements.  Experimenting with these implementations using various datasets and range sets is crucial to grasp their performance characteristics fully.
