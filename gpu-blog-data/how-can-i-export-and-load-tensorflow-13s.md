TensorFlow 1.3's `tf.contrib.estimator` is deprecated, and its direct export for prediction outside of TensorFlow Serving presents challenges due to the reliance on internal TensorFlow structures.  My experience working on large-scale deployment projects involving legacy TensorFlow models highlighted the need for careful handling of these estimators.  Direct serialization of the estimator object itself isn't feasible; instead, we must focus on exporting the underlying model graph and weights. This process requires understanding the estimator's internals and manually reconstructing the prediction pipeline.

**1. Explanation:**

The `tf.contrib.estimator` API provided a higher-level interface built upon the lower-level TensorFlow APIs.  It abstracted away many details of graph construction and session management.  However, this abstraction prevents simple serialization.  We can't simply pickle or save the estimator object and load it later for prediction. The estimator relies on internal TensorFlow mechanisms that are not designed for persistence outside the TensorFlow runtime environment.  The solution lies in exporting the model's graph definition and associated weights separately. These components, combined with carefully crafted code to recreate the prediction logic, provide a functional solution for deploying the model without TensorFlow Serving.

The process involves several steps:

* **Building the Estimator:**  This step remains largely unchanged. You define your model function, input function, and create your estimator instance as you would normally.

* **Exporting the SavedModel:**  Instead of relying on the `export_savedmodel` functionality directly from the `tf.contrib.estimator`, we use the lower-level `tf.saved_model.simple_save` function to explicitly control what is saved.  This grants us the precision needed to capture only the essential components for prediction.

* **Loading the SavedModel:**  On the deployment side, we load the saved model using `tf.saved_model.load`.

* **Reconstructing the Prediction Pipeline:** We need to manually create the necessary input pipeline and logic to feed data to the loaded graph and extract predictions.  This involves recreating the pre-processing steps used during training.

**2. Code Examples:**


**Example 1: Exporting a simple linear regression model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define model function
def model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
    W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name="weight")
    b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name="bias")
    predictions = tf.add(tf.multiply(features['x'], W), b)

    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(predictions - labels))

    optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01)
    train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss, global_step=tf.train.get_global_step())

    return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, predictions=predictions, loss=loss, train_op=train_op)

# Create Estimator (Note:  tf.contrib.estimator is not used directly here for clarity, but the principle applies)
estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=model_fn)

# Sample data for demonstration
x_data = [[1.], [2.], [3.], [4.]]
y_data = [[2.], [4.], [5.], [4.]]
input_fn = tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs.numpy_input_fn(x={'x': x_data}, y=y_data, batch_size=4, num_epochs=None, shuffle=True)

# Train (simplified for brevity)
estimator.train(input_fn=input_fn, steps=1000)


# Export the SavedModel
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    tf.saved_model.simple_save(
        sess,
        'saved_model',
        inputs={'x': tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[None,1])},
        outputs={'predictions': tf.identity(estimator.predict(input_fn)['predictions'])},
        legacy_init_op=tf.group(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer(), tf.compat.v1.tables_initializer())
    )
```

This example demonstrates exporting a simple linear regression model.  Note the use of `tf.saved_model.simple_save` which explicitly defines the inputs and outputs of the model.

**Example 2: Loading the SavedModel and making predictions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the SavedModel
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load('saved_model')

# Input data for prediction
input_data = [[5.], [6.]]

# Make Predictions
predictor = loaded_model.signatures['serving_default']
predictions = predictor(tf.constant(input_data, dtype=tf.float32))['predictions'].numpy()

print(predictions)
```

This code demonstrates loading the saved model and using the loaded graph for prediction.  The `serving_default` signature is assumed, which is the standard for SavedModels exported with `simple_save`.


**Example 3: Handling more complex model architectures (Illustrative)**

For more complex models involving custom layers or operations, you'll need to carefully map the model's architecture in your loading script.  This might require reconstructing layers, activations, and other components manually.  This is often architecture-specific, but the general principles remain.  For instance,  if your model used a convolutional layer, you would need to recreate the equivalent layer using TensorFlow's `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D` (or the corresponding TensorFlow 1.x equivalent) during the loading process.  This careful reconstruction is crucial to guarantee functional equivalence between the exported and loaded model.


```python
# ... (Model definition and export similar to Example 1, but for a more complex model) ...

# Load the SavedModel (as in Example 2)

#  Reconstruct prediction pipeline, if necessary
# Example: Recreate a custom layer if the model used one.
# custom_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu') #Example using Keras layers
# ... (integrate custom_layer into loading and prediction process) ...

# Make predictions (as in Example 2)
```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation (especially the sections on SavedModel and graph manipulation).  A comprehensive book on TensorFlow (covering versions 1.x) would be valuable.  Understanding the fundamentals of computational graphs in TensorFlow is essential.  Familiarization with the TensorFlow 1.x APIs, particularly those related to graph construction and session management is paramount for working with legacy models.  Reviewing examples of custom SavedModel creation and loading is recommended for handling complex architectures.
