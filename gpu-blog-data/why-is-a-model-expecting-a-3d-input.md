The discrepancy between a model's expected input shape and the shape it was trained on stems fundamentally from a mismatch in the model's internal weight structure and the dimensions of the data fed to it during inference. This is not a matter of the model "forgetting" its training; rather, it's a consequence of how the model architecture processes data, and this is often revealed by inspecting the model's layers and their respective weight matrices.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on large-scale image classification projects, particularly when dealing with model serialization and transfer learning.

The core issue arises from the model's weight matrices.  During training, these matrices adapt to the dimensions of the input data. A model trained on 2D input (e.g., a grayscale image represented as a height x width matrix) will have weight matrices shaped accordingly.  If the model subsequently encounters a 3D input (e.g., a color image represented as height x width x channels), the dimensionality mismatch prevents the correct matrix multiplications from occurring within the neural network layers. The model essentially tries to perform operations on arrays that are incompatible in their number of dimensions.  This incompatibility manifests as a `ValueError` or a similar exception, specifically pointing to a dimension mismatch in the input tensor.

To illustrate, let's consider three scenarios.  Assume we're working with a simple convolutional neural network (CNN).  While a fully connected network would exhibit similar issues, CNNs provide clearer visual representation of the dimensional transformations.

**Example 1: Correct 2D Input**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple CNN model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)), # Input shape specified for 28x28 grayscale image
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Generate sample 2D input data (grayscale image)
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1) # Batch size of 1

# Perform prediction
prediction = model.predict(input_data)
print(prediction.shape) # Output: (1, 10) - 10 classes
```

This example showcases the correct handling of a 2D input. The `input_shape` parameter in the first `Conv2D` layer explicitly defines the expected input dimensions. The model correctly predicts the output without raising exceptions.  The key is the specification of the input shape, aligning the model's expectations with the data.

**Example 2: Incorrect 3D Input without Reshaping**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Same model definition as Example 1) ...

# Generate sample 3D input data (color image)
input_data_3d = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 3) # Batch size of 1, 3 color channels

# Attempt prediction - This will likely raise a ValueError
try:
    prediction = model.predict(input_data_3d)
    print(prediction.shape)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # This will print an error message related to dimension mismatch.
```

This example demonstrates the error. The model, designed for grayscale images (single channel), is fed a color image (three channels).  The `ValueError` arises because the model's first convolutional layer's filters are not compatible with the three-channel input. This highlights the importance of matching the input data's dimensionality to the model's definition.

**Example 3: Correct 3D Input with Preprocessing**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Same model definition as Example 1, but let's assume we intend it for grayscale) ...

# Generate sample 3D input data (color image, simulating a potential real-world scenario)
input_data_3d = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 3)

# Preprocess: Convert to grayscale -  This is crucial.
input_data_grayscale = np.dot(input_data_3d[...,:3], [0.2989, 0.5870, 0.1140])
input_data_grayscale = np.expand_dims(input_data_grayscale, axis=-1)

# Perform prediction on preprocessed data
prediction = model.predict(input_data_grayscale)
print(prediction.shape) # Output: (1, 10) - correct prediction now
```

This demonstrates a solution:  pre-processing the input data. Here, we convert a color image into a grayscale image before feeding it into the model.  This aligns the input dimensions with the model's expectations.  Note that this solution is only appropriate if the model was indeed trained on grayscale data and the intention is to use it with grayscale images, even if the initial input might be color.

In summary, the "3D input expected" error signals a fundamental mismatch between the model's internal architecture, specifically the shapes of its weight matrices, and the dimensions of the input tensor during inference. Resolving this requires careful inspection of the model's definition (particularly the `input_shape` parameter) and ensuring the input data aligns with this definition either through preprocessing or retraining the model on the appropriate input dimensions.
