The `AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'contrib'` encountered during `model_builder_test.py` execution within the TensorFlow Object Detection API stems from the deprecation of the `contrib` module in TensorFlow 2.x and later versions.  My experience troubleshooting this in a large-scale object detection project for a self-driving car simulation involved migrating legacy code relying on `contrib` functionalities to their TensorFlow 2.x equivalents.  This required a deep understanding of both the deprecated API and the revised architecture.  The solution necessitates a refactor, not a simple patch.

**1.  Explanation of the Problem and Solution:**

The TensorFlow `contrib` module served as a repository for experimental and community-contributed features.  However, these features lacked the stability and consistent API design of core TensorFlow.  To improve the framework's maintainability and stability, Google deprecated the entire `contrib` module.  Consequently, code that relied on components within this module, like those often used in older Object Detection API versions, will fail with the aforementioned error.

The primary resolution hinges on identifying the specific `contrib` components used within `model_builder_test.py` and replacing them with their corresponding TensorFlow 2.x counterparts. This often involves substituting legacy functions with newly-structured classes and methods within the updated API.  The challenge lies not only in locating the equivalent functionality but also adapting the supporting code to accommodate the altered API design.  For instance, if the code utilizes a `contrib`-based model builder, the migration might necessitate utilizing the streamlined model building functionalities introduced in TensorFlow 2.x's `tf.keras.Sequential` or `tf.keras.Model`.

Further complicating the matter is the fact that `model_builder_test.py` is a test file. This implies a need to thoroughly re-evaluate the test cases to ensure their compatibility with the updated TensorFlow version and the refactored code.  Simply changing the imports will not suffice; the tests themselves need a structural revision.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's consider three hypothetical scenarios found during my own refactoring efforts, focusing on common `contrib` usages within the Object Detection API.

**Example 1: Replacing `contrib.slim`:**

```python
# Deprecated code using contrib.slim
import tensorflow.contrib.slim as slim

# ... some code utilizing slim functions ...

net = slim.conv2d(inputs, 64, [3, 3], scope='conv1')

# Refactored code using tf.keras
import tensorflow as tf

# ... adapted code using tf.keras.layers ...

net = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), name='conv1')(inputs)
```

This example showcases the migration from TensorFlow's `contrib.slim` module, which provided high-level functions for building neural networks, to the functionally equivalent `tf.keras.layers` API.  The `slim.conv2d` function is directly replaced by the `tf.keras.layers.Conv2D` layer, along with necessary adjustments to the input and output handling to match the Keras API.

**Example 2: Handling `contrib.losses`:**

```python
# Deprecated code using contrib.losses
import tensorflow.contrib.losses as losses

loss = losses.mean_squared_error(labels, predictions)

# Refactored code using tf.keras.losses
import tensorflow as tf

loss = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()(labels, predictions)
```

Here, the `contrib.losses` module, offering various loss functions, is replaced by the `tf.keras.losses` module.  The code adapts from a direct function call to utilizing the object-oriented interface of the `tf.keras.losses` module.

**Example 3:  Addressing `contrib.layers` (more complex example):**

The `contrib.layers` module offered a broader range of functionalities. Let's consider a scenario involving batch normalization:

```python
# Deprecated code using contrib.layers.batch_norm
import tensorflow.contrib.layers as layers

net = layers.batch_norm(net, is_training=is_training, scope='batchnorm')

# Refactored code using tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization
import tensorflow as tf

net = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(training=is_training, name='batchnorm')(net)
```

This example demonstrates migrating batch normalization.  Note the change from a function call within `contrib.layers` to a layer instantiation within `tf.keras.layers`.  The `is_training` parameter's adaptation highlights the need for careful attention to subtle differences in API design between versions.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the guides related to TensorFlow 2.x and the Object Detection API, is crucial.  Pay close attention to the migration guides outlining the changes from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x.  Reviewing the source code of updated TensorFlow models and examples can provide valuable insight into the structural changes and API replacements.  Consult the API documentation for both TensorFlow 1.x (for understanding the deprecated code) and TensorFlow 2.x (for finding replacements). Finally, explore example repositories for updated object detection models and their associated tests within the community.  Thorough investigation of these resources, combined with a systematic approach to code refactoring, is critical to successfully resolve the `AttributeError`.
