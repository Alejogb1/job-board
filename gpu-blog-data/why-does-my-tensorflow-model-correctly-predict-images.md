The discrepancy you're observing between accurate image prediction and inaccurate video frame prediction within your TensorFlow model often stems from inconsistencies in data preprocessing and handling between the two input modalities.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues in production-level object detection systems points to several key areas requiring rigorous examination.  The static nature of image files allows for thorough preprocessing tailored to the model's specific input requirements, a luxury unavailable during real-time video stream processing where efficiency and latency are paramount.

**1. Preprocessing Discrepancies:**

The most common culprit is inconsistent image preprocessing. Your image predictions likely leverage a carefully designed pipeline encompassing resizing, normalization, and potentially data augmentation (e.g., random cropping, flipping). Replicating this precisely for each video frame within the constrained timeframe of a real-time application is crucial but often overlooked.  Variations in frame size, aspect ratio, or even subtle lighting shifts can significantly impact the model's performance. The model was trained on a specific input distribution, and deviations from this distribution during inference lead to decreased accuracy.

For example, if your model expects a 224x224 RGB image with pixel values normalized to the range [0, 1],  processing a raw video frame directly might introduce errors. Video frames might arrive with different resolutions, color spaces (e.g., YUV), or pixel value ranges.  Failing to standardize these aspects before feeding them to your model creates a mismatch between training and inference data, leading to poor predictions.


**2.  Batching and Memory Management:**

During training, you likely used batch processing to accelerate computation.  Handling video frames requires a different approach. Processing each frame individually is computationally expensive and introduces unnecessary latency.  Batching is still possible but needs careful consideration.  You need to balance batch size with available memory and the desired processing speed. Larger batches offer computational efficiency but demand more RAM.  Insufficient memory can lead to out-of-memory errors or significant performance degradation. The memory management strategies employed during training may not be directly transferable to real-time video processing.

**3. Temporal Dependencies and Model Architecture:**

The nature of your model architecture also plays a role.  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), while excellent at image classification and object detection, typically treat each image independently.  If your video data involves temporal dependencies (actions, movements), a CNN alone might be insufficient.  You might need to incorporate Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTMs or GRUs to capture sequential information across multiple frames.  If your model was trained only on individual images, it might lack the ability to integrate information from consecutive frames to improve prediction accuracy in the video context.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Correct Image Preprocessing:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import cv2

def preprocess_image(image_path):
  img = tf.io.read_file(image_path)
  img = tf.image.decode_jpeg(img, channels=3) #Assumes JPEG; adjust as needed
  img = tf.image.resize(img, [224, 224])
  img = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(img, dtype=tf.float32) #Normalize to [0,1]
  return img

#Example usage
image = preprocess_image("path/to/image.jpg")
predictions = model.predict(tf.expand_dims(image, axis=0))
```

This code demonstrates a robust image preprocessing pipeline that ensures consistency in input data.  Note the explicit handling of image decoding, resizing, and data type conversion.


**Example 2:  Inefficient Video Frame Preprocessing:**

```python
import cv2
import tensorflow as tf

video = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/video.mp4")
while True:
  ret, frame = video.read()
  if not ret:
    break
  frame = cv2.resize(frame, (224,224)) # Simple resizing, no normalization
  frame = tf.convert_to_tensor(frame, dtype=tf.float32) #Basic conversion
  predictions = model.predict(tf.expand_dims(frame, axis=0))
  #...process predictions...
video.release()
```

This code lacks crucial normalization steps and might suffer from performance issues due to individual frame processing.  The missing normalization step is a significant cause of potential inaccuracies.

**Example 3:  Improved Video Frame Processing with Batching:**

```python
import cv2
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

video = cv2.VideoCapture("path/to/video.mp4")
batch_size = 32
frames = []
while True:
  ret, frame = video.read()
  if not ret:
    break
  frame = cv2.resize(frame,(224,224))
  frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame,cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
  frame = frame.astype(np.float32) / 255.0 #Normalize to [0,1]
  frames.append(frame)
  if len(frames) == batch_size:
    batch = np.array(frames)
    predictions = model.predict(batch)
    frames = []
    #...process predictions...
video.release()
```
This example incorporates batch processing for efficiency.  Note the addition of color space conversion and proper normalization. This is a substantial improvement compared to Example 2.



**Resource Recommendations:**

I would strongly suggest reviewing relevant chapters on image preprocessing in introductory computer vision textbooks.  Consult the official TensorFlow documentation on data preprocessing and efficient batching techniques for your specific model architecture.  Finally, familiarizing yourself with optimization techniques for real-time video processing using libraries like OpenCV is also beneficial.  Exploring the capabilities of hardware acceleration through GPUs or specialized inference engines can significantly improve performance.  Thorough analysis of your model's training data and distribution relative to your video data will also lead to valuable insights.  Investigating the latency introduced by your video capture and processing pipeline will further aid in identifying bottlenecks.
