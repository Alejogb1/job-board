The absence of decreasing loss in a PyTorch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) during training is a frequent indicator of underlying issues rather than an intrinsic property of the network. From my experience debugging numerous computer vision pipelines, a stalled loss almost always points to one, or a combination, of specific causes: inadequate data preprocessing, improperly chosen hyperparameters, or an architecture that struggles to learn the underlying features in the data. I've learned that debugging loss curves requires a systematic approach and a thorough understanding of each part of the pipeline.

The primary function of loss in a CNN is to quantify the discrepancy between the network's predictions and the actual ground truth. When the loss remains static or, even worse, increases, it suggests that the network's weights are not being updated to minimize this discrepancy. The backpropagation algorithm relies on the gradient of the loss function with respect to the network parameters, and if the loss doesnâ€™t decrease, either the gradients are vanishing, exploding, or being misapplied due to an incorrectly designed network or data. A common pitfall is rushing into debugging the model architecture without first ensuring the data is ready for consumption by the network.

Let's explore some of the frequent reasons, focusing on practical scenarios.

**Data Issues**

Data preprocessing is often overlooked, but its impact on training is substantial. Issues like incorrect scaling or standardization, poor data augmentation strategies, or imbalanced class distributions can all contribute to a stagnant loss. For instance, if your pixel values are not normalized (or standardized) to a common range, like [-1, 1], then the initial weights of your network may not be in the optimal range. The gradients, therefore, might not be large enough to push the model in the correct direction. Likewise, if your augmentation is too aggressive, you might introduce so much variation that the model has difficulty learning consistent patterns.

**Code Example 1: Incorrect Normalization**

```python
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
from PIL import Image
import os

class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, image_folder, transform=None):
        self.image_folder = image_folder
        self.image_paths = [os.path.join(image_folder, f) for f in os.listdir(image_folder) if f.endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg'))]
        self.transform = transform

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.image_paths)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        image_path = self.image_paths[idx]
        image = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGB')
        if self.transform:
            image = self.transform(image)
        return image, torch.randint(0, 10, (1,)) # Dummy label

#Incorrect transform. Assumes range 0-255 instead of standardizing to range [-1, 1] or 0 to 1.
incorrect_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((256,256)),
    transforms.ToTensor()
    ])


# Assume 'images' folder has PNG, JPG images
incorrect_dataset = CustomDataset(image_folder='images', transform=incorrect_transform)
incorrect_dataloader = DataLoader(incorrect_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)


# Correct transform uses standardization
correct_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((256, 256)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])  # ImageNet normalization
])

correct_dataset = CustomDataset(image_folder='images', transform=correct_transform)
correct_dataloader = DataLoader(correct_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)


#Sample usage (Assume a CNN named 'model')
# Example usage within training loop:
#   for batch in incorrect_dataloader:
#      output = model(batch[0]) #Loss likely to stall or underperform

#   for batch in correct_dataloader:
#      output = model(batch[0]) # Loss likely to decrease
```
In the provided code, `incorrect_transform` only converts the image to a tensor without standardizing it, keeping pixel values in the 0-1 range. The `correct_transform` normalizes the image data using precomputed means and standard deviations from the ImageNet dataset, ensuring the model receives inputs within a more manageable range, often enabling better learning. Note, that the dummy label is simply a demonstration for the dataloader. In practice, one needs to be mindful of categorical or numerical labels and ensure that their shapes match that of the model.

**Hyperparameter Issues**

The choice of hyperparameters significantly impacts training performance. An excessively high learning rate can lead to instability, where the loss oscillates or fails to converge, or even diverge. A learning rate that is too small can cause the model to get stuck in a local minima. Batch size also plays a role. Very small batch sizes can cause gradients to be erratic, while too large batch sizes can slow down learning. Choosing a bad optimizer is another consideration; for instance, a vanilla SGD might be suboptimal in some circumstances when an Adam variant can offer better convergence. Likewise, poor choices in the momentum parameter, regularization, or weight initialization can stagnate the loss function.

**Code Example 2: Learning Rate Impact**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32*128*128,10) # Assume input 256 x 256

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x


model = SimpleCNN() # Initialize the network

# Example of a high learning rate
high_learning_rate = 0.1
optimizer_high_lr = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=high_learning_rate)
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Example of a low learning rate
low_learning_rate = 0.0001
optimizer_low_lr = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=low_learning_rate)

# Example of a reasonable learning rate
reasonable_learning_rate = 0.001
optimizer_reasonable_lr = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=reasonable_learning_rate)

#Assume dummy data
input_data = torch.randn(32, 3, 256, 256) #Batch of 32 images of shape 3 x 256 x 256
labels = torch.randint(0,10,(32,))

# Within the training loop
# using optimizer_high_lr might cause loss to stagnate or diverge
output = model(input_data)
loss = loss_fn(output, labels)
optimizer_high_lr.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer_high_lr.step()

# using optimizer_low_lr might cause loss to decrease very slowly, or get stuck
output = model(input_data)
loss = loss_fn(output, labels)
optimizer_low_lr.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer_low_lr.step()

# using optimizer_reasonable_lr should allow loss to decrease
output = model(input_data)
loss = loss_fn(output, labels)
optimizer_reasonable_lr.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer_reasonable_lr.step()
```

The code illustrates how an improperly set learning rate can negatively affect model training. The `optimizer_high_lr`, employing a learning rate of 0.1, may cause unstable loss behavior and make it hard for the model to learn, while the `optimizer_low_lr`, using 0.0001, will lead to extremely slow convergence, potentially getting stuck in local minima. It is imperative to use techniques like learning rate schedules or perform an exhaustive hyperparameter search to find optimal training parameters for your models.

**Architecture and Complexity Issues**

The network's architecture must be compatible with the complexity of the task. A model that is too shallow or contains too few parameters might not be able to learn the necessary features, resulting in poor performance. A network that is too deep or has too many parameters for a relatively simple task could also lead to convergence problems. Also, choices related to specific layer types, such as inappropriate pooling or non-linearities, can hinder learning. If the gradient is too small or zero due to the activation function, learning will stall. Consider a scenario where ReLU is used in a very deep network, and too many neurons are inactive, or "dead."

**Code Example 3: Network Capacity Issues**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=10):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16*128*128, num_classes) # Assume input 256x256 after convolution and pooling

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x


class DeeperCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=10):
        super(DeeperCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(64*32*32, num_classes) # Assume input 256 x 256


    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = self.pool(self.relu(self.conv3(x)))
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Assume labels for demonstration
labels = torch.randint(0,10,(32,))
input_data = torch.randn(32, 3, 256, 256) #Batch of 32 images of shape 3 x 256 x 256
# SimpleCNN may be too shallow for complex data.
model_shallow = SimpleCNN()
optimizer_shallow = optim.Adam(model_shallow.parameters(), lr=0.001)
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

#DeeperCNN may be more suited for complex data
model_deep = DeeperCNN()
optimizer_deep = optim.Adam(model_deep.parameters(), lr=0.001)


#Training loop examples
# Loss may stagnate for the shallow CNN on complex images
output = model_shallow(input_data)
loss = loss_fn(output, labels)
optimizer_shallow.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer_shallow.step()

# Loss should decrease using the deeper model
output = model_deep(input_data)
loss = loss_fn(output, labels)
optimizer_deep.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer_deep.step()
```

The comparison between `SimpleCNN` and `DeeperCNN` exemplifies how architectural choices affect the loss. `SimpleCNN` might lack the necessary layers and parameters to learn intricate patterns in the input, while `DeeperCNN` can better handle such patterns. This highlights the importance of tailoring network depth and width to the complexity of the data.

In summary, a non-decreasing loss is rarely a mysterious problem. It most commonly stems from issues with the data, hyperparameters, or model architecture. Proper data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization, and a careful choice of model architecture are crucial for effective training. For further study, I recommend books focusing on deep learning fundamentals, practical guides for PyTorch, and online courses covering computer vision techniques. Specifically, texts covering Convolutional Neural Networks in detail are advisable along with books focused on PyTorch practices for computer vision. Furthermore, resources that offer guidance on training best practices will prove invaluable. These will provide you with a much more thorough explanation for the nuances that can influence loss behavior during training.
