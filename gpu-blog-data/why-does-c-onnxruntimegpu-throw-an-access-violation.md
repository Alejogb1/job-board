Access violations during ONNX Runtime GPU session runs in C++ often pinpoint a misalignment between the expected data layout by the GPU kernels and the actual memory layout provided by the host application. This primarily stems from incorrect tensor preparation before the inference call, specifically regarding data types, shapes, and memory contiguity, or issues within the ONNX model itself when interpreted by the specific GPU environment. Having spent years optimizing inference pipelines, I’ve frequently encountered these exceptions, leading me to establish a methodical debugging approach.

The root cause typically isn’t a flaw in ONNX Runtime (ORT) itself but a discrepancy in how data is fed into it. The GPU operates under strict data organization constraints; an attempt to read beyond allocated memory bounds or interpret data of the wrong type results in an access violation. This manifests as a crash, and the ORT exception message is often a generic indicator, requiring further analysis to pinpoint the precise problem.

Let's break down the most frequent causes, focusing on data pre-processing and input formatting for GPU execution. First, data types in C++ and the ONNX model need complete alignment. If your C++ application is feeding floating point data as a single-precision type (float) but the model expects a double-precision type (double), the ORT runtime will attempt to interpret memory based on the model’s expectation, leading to out-of-bounds access when the memory region isn't large enough. Conversely, providing too much memory won't automatically resolve the issue; the stride and type interpretation will be incorrect. Second, tensor shapes must be precisely what the model expects. If a model has an input shape defined as (1, 3, 224, 224), you cannot simply feed data with the shape (3, 224, 224) or (1, 3, 224, 225), even if the total number of elements matches. The memory layout as interpreted by the GPU computation kernels must exactly match the tensor dimensions used by the model. Third, memory management, especially when dealing with multi-dimensional data, is a critical aspect. The ORT API expects memory to be contiguous. If a data array is constructed by stitching together smaller fragments, the API may interpret the data as a contiguous block, and consequently, the GPU kernels will attempt to read data that is not physically present in memory resulting in an error. Finally, issues within the ONNX model, such as incompatible operators for the specific GPU architecture or models built using specific unsupported frameworks versions, also lead to these exceptions.

To clarify these concepts, consider the following examples.

**Example 1: Data Type Mismatch**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include "onnxruntime_cxx_api.h"

int main() {
  Ort::Env env(ORT_LOGGING_LEVEL_WARNING, "example_env");
  Ort::SessionOptions sessionOptions;
  sessionOptions.SetGraphOptimizationLevel(GraphOptimizationLevel::ORT_ENABLE_ALL);
  Ort::Session session(env, L"model.onnx", sessionOptions);

  // Model input info (assumed)
  std::vector<int64_t> inputShape = {1, 3, 224, 224};
  std::vector<float> floatInput(3 * 224 * 224); // CORRECT DATA TYPE

  // Fictional data population here
  // ...

  Ort::MemoryInfo memoryInfo = Ort::MemoryInfo::CreateCpu(OrtDeviceAllocatorType::ORT_DEVICE_ALLOCATOR_DEFAULT, OrtMemType::ORT_MEMTYPE_DEFAULT);
  Ort::Value inputTensor = Ort::Value::CreateTensor<float>(memoryInfo, floatInput.data(), floatInput.size(), inputShape.data(), inputShape.size());

  Ort::RunOptions runOptions;
  std::vector<Ort::Value> outputTensors;

    try {
      outputTensors = session.Run(runOptions,
                                  {"input_name"},
                                  {&inputTensor},
                                  1,
                                  {"output_name"},
                                  1);
    } catch (const Ort::Exception& exception) {
      std::cerr << "Error during inference: " << exception.what() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

  return 0;
}
```

Here, if the model expects double precision instead of float, this code will likely cause an access violation when run on the GPU. The correct approach involves constructing `inputTensor` with the appropriate type such as Ort::Value::CreateTensor<double>. This highlights the importance of inspecting the input tensor type expectation of the model via tools like Netron or custom ONNX parsing before writing the C++ code. If the input type is a double, the vector should be of type `std::vector<double>`.

**Example 2: Incorrect Tensor Shapes**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include "onnxruntime_cxx_api.h"

int main() {
  Ort::Env env(ORT_LOGGING_LEVEL_WARNING, "example_env");
  Ort::SessionOptions sessionOptions;
  sessionOptions.SetGraphOptimizationLevel(GraphOptimizationLevel::ORT_ENABLE_ALL);
  Ort::Session session(env, L"model.onnx", sessionOptions);

    // Model input info (assumed)
  std::vector<int64_t> inputShape_model = {1, 3, 224, 224}; // Model expects this shape
  std::vector<int64_t> inputShape_incorrect = {3, 224, 224}; //incorrect shape
  std::vector<float> inputData(3 * 224 * 224);

  // Fictional data population here
  //...


    Ort::MemoryInfo memoryInfo = Ort::MemoryInfo::CreateCpu(OrtDeviceAllocatorType::ORT_DEVICE_ALLOCATOR_DEFAULT, OrtMemType::ORT_MEMTYPE_DEFAULT);
    Ort::Value inputTensor = Ort::Value::CreateTensor<float>(memoryInfo, inputData.data(), inputData.size(), inputShape_incorrect.data(), inputShape_incorrect.size()); //incorrect shape

  Ort::RunOptions runOptions;
  std::vector<Ort::Value> outputTensors;
  try {
      outputTensors = session.Run(runOptions,
                                  {"input_name"},
                                  {&inputTensor},
                                  1,
                                  {"output_name"},
                                  1);
    } catch (const Ort::Exception& exception) {
      std::cerr << "Error during inference: " << exception.what() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

  return 0;
}
```

In this case, the code provides an input of shape (3, 224, 224) which the model does not expect, which it expects to be (1, 3, 224, 224). Again, this shape mismatch, even though the number of elements are the same, causes an access violation because the stride within the tensor will be incorrectly interpreted and lead to out-of-bounds reads during kernel execution. The solution lies in accurately using the `inputShape_model` variable when constructing `inputTensor`.

**Example 3: Non-Contiguous Memory**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include "onnxruntime_cxx_api.h"

int main() {
  Ort::Env env(ORT_LOGGING_LEVEL_WARNING, "example_env");
  Ort::SessionOptions sessionOptions;
  sessionOptions.SetGraphOptimizationLevel(GraphOptimizationLevel::ORT_ENABLE_ALL);
  Ort::Session session(env, L"model.onnx", sessionOptions);

    // Model input info (assumed)
    std::vector<int64_t> inputShape = {1, 3, 224, 224};
    std::vector<float> data_fragment1(224*224);
    std::vector<float> data_fragment2(224*224);
    std::vector<float> data_fragment3(224*224);
    std::vector<float> combinedData;

    //Assume some data population
    //...

    combinedData.insert(combinedData.end(), data_fragment1.begin(), data_fragment1.end());
    combinedData.insert(combinedData.end(), data_fragment2.begin(), data_fragment2.end());
    combinedData.insert(combinedData.end(), data_fragment3.begin(), data_fragment3.end());


    Ort::MemoryInfo memoryInfo = Ort::MemoryInfo::CreateCpu(OrtDeviceAllocatorType::ORT_DEVICE_ALLOCATOR_DEFAULT, OrtMemType::ORT_MEMTYPE_DEFAULT);
    Ort::Value inputTensor = Ort::Value::CreateTensor<float>(memoryInfo, combinedData.data(), combinedData.size(), inputShape.data(), inputShape.size());


    Ort::RunOptions runOptions;
    std::vector<Ort::Value> outputTensors;
    try {
        outputTensors = session.Run(runOptions,
                                    {"input_name"},
                                    {&inputTensor},
                                    1,
                                    {"output_name"},
                                    1);
    } catch (const Ort::Exception& exception) {
      std::cerr << "Error during inference: " << exception.what() << std::endl;
      return 1;
    }


  return 0;
}
```

In this example, while the `combinedData` vector contains the total number of elements expected by the input shape, the data within is not necessarily contiguous in the way ORT's GPU kernels need it. The data is in essence, split and stitched together. It assumes data continuity that isn't guaranteed when populating `combinedData` in this way. The corrected approach requires either using contiguous memory from the start by allocating a `std::vector<float> combinedData(1*3*224*224)` and filling it in a continuous way, or, if the data has to be initially fragmented due to certain reasons, using another approach of creating a contiguously allocated memory buffer, and copying the fragments into it.

For further understanding, the ONNX documentation provides detailed specifications for tensor layout and data types. Resources focusing on GPU programming, specifically CUDA documentation (if targeting NVIDIA GPUs), elucidate memory access patterns necessary for efficient kernel execution. Books on deep learning and model optimization also offer context on data preprocessing techniques relevant to ensuring correct data input for deep learning models. The ORT documentation, although not the sole reference for data preparation issues, contains numerous examples and usage guides that can be beneficial for debugging. Finally, thorough testing of the data preparation pipeline with varied data inputs is the most effective way to diagnose this type of problem in the long term.
