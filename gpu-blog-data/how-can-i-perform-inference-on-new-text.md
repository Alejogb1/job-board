Performing inference on new text with a pre-trained PyTorch NLP model for document classification necessitates a careful understanding of the model's input expectations and the post-processing required to obtain meaningful classifications. My experience building and deploying several such models for various clients highlights the importance of consistent data preprocessing and accurate handling of model outputs.  The key fact to remember is that the model expects a specific input format, typically a numerical tensor, and its output is rarely a directly interpretable class label.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Inference, in this context, refers to the process of using a trained model to predict the class of new, unseen text documents.  This involves several crucial steps:

* **Preprocessing:** The input text must be transformed into a format compatible with the chosen model.  This usually involves tokenization (splitting the text into individual words or sub-words), converting tokens into numerical representations (using a vocabulary or word embeddings), and potentially padding or truncating sequences to ensure uniform input length.  The preprocessing steps must mirror those used during the model's training phase.  Inconsistencies here will lead to incorrect or unreliable predictions.

* **Model Input:** The preprocessed text is fed into the model as a tensor.  The specific tensor dimensions and data type depend entirely on the model architecture.  For instance, a model expecting sequences of length 512 might require a tensor of shape (1, 512), where 1 represents the batch size (a single document in this case) and 512 the sequence length.

* **Model Forward Pass:** The preprocessed tensor is passed through the model's layers, resulting in a tensor representing the model's output. This output often takes the form of logits, representing the raw, unnormalized scores for each class.

* **Post-Processing:** The logits need to be converted into probabilities using a softmax function.  The class with the highest probability is then selected as the model's prediction for the input text.

* **Error Handling:** Robust inference code should handle potential errors, such as invalid input formats or unexpected model outputs.  This includes checks for missing data, incorrect tensor shapes, and handling exceptions that might arise during the process.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate inference using three different scenarios, each reflecting a different level of complexity and model architecture.  These are illustrative and should be adapted to the specific model and preprocessing steps employed.

**Example 1: Simple Linear Classifier**

This example assumes a simple linear model where the input is a pre-computed vector representation of the text (e.g., TF-IDF).  This simplifies the preprocessing step considerably.

```python
import torch

# Assume 'model' is a pre-trained linear classifier
# Assume 'text_vector' is a pre-computed vector representation of the new text
text_vector = torch.tensor([0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3]).float()  # Example vector

# Perform inference
with torch.no_grad():  # Avoid unnecessary gradient computations
    output = model(text_vector)

# Apply softmax to get probabilities
probabilities = torch.softmax(output, dim=0)

# Get predicted class (index of highest probability)
predicted_class = torch.argmax(probabilities).item()

print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}, Probabilities: {probabilities}")
```

This code directly feeds the pre-computed vector into the model.  The `torch.no_grad()` context manager ensures that no gradients are calculated, improving efficiency during inference.  The softmax function transforms the raw scores into probabilities.  `torch.argmax` identifies the index of the highest probability, providing the class prediction.


**Example 2:  BERT-based Classifier**

This example demonstrates inference with a BERT-based model, highlighting the complexities of tokenization and input formatting.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

# Load pre-trained tokenizer and model
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)  # Assuming binary classification

# New text
new_text = "This is a sample text for classification."

# Tokenization and encoding
encoded_input = tokenizer(new_text, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')

# Inference
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**encoded_input)
    logits = outputs.logits

# Softmax and prediction
probabilities = torch.softmax(logits, dim=1)
predicted_class = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=1).item()

print(f"Predicted class: {predicted_class}, Probabilities: {probabilities}")
```

This code utilizes the `transformers` library for easy handling of BERT.  The tokenizer converts the text into token IDs, and the `padding` and `truncation` arguments ensure consistent input length.  The model takes the encoded input and returns logits. Post-processing remains the same, obtaining probabilities and the predicted class.

**Example 3: Handling Batched Inference**

For efficiency, processing multiple documents simultaneously is crucial. This example demonstrates batched inference.


```python
import torch

# Assume 'model' is a pre-trained model
# Assume 'preprocessed_texts' is a list of preprocessed text tensors

# Batch the inputs
batch = torch.stack(preprocessed_texts)

# Perform inference
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(batch)
    logits = outputs.logits

# Apply softmax and get predictions for each document in the batch
probabilities = torch.softmax(logits, dim=1)
predicted_classes = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=1).tolist()


print(f"Predicted classes: {predicted_classes}, Probabilities: {probabilities}")
```

This code demonstrates efficient batch processing.  The `torch.stack` function combines multiple tensors into a single batch tensor. The model processes the entire batch, and the predictions are extracted using `torch.argmax` for each individual document.  This is much faster than processing documents individually.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further study, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation, the Hugging Face Transformers library documentation, and a thorough textbook on natural language processing.  Exploring research papers on specific model architectures and their applications will further enhance your understanding.  Consider focusing on resources that detail best practices for deploying and optimizing NLP models for production use.  Furthermore, familiarity with common NLP tasks and their evaluation metrics will be indispensable for successful model deployment and interpretation of results.
