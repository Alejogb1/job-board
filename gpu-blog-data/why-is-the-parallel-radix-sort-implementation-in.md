In my experience optimizing high-throughput data pipelines, I’ve frequently encountered the challenges of implementing parallel algorithms correctly, particularly with radix sort. The issue you’re facing – incorrect results from a parallel radix sort in Java – often stems from how shared memory is managed during the counting and distribution phases of the algorithm. Without meticulous handling of data dependencies, race conditions will corrupt the data, making the parallel version output inconsistent. The radix sort itself, inherently stable when implemented sequentially, loses this property when parallelism is introduced inappropriately. This arises when individual threads simultaneously modify the same shared memory locations or when their access is not appropriately synchronized.

The standard radix sort operates in a series of iterations based on digit or bit positions, starting from the least significant. During each iteration, it performs a counting sort. Counting sort, by definition, needs to know the total count of elements for each digit/bucket before it starts distributing them into the output. In a sequential implementation, this is straightforward. However, when applying parallelism, the counting step must be handled such that each thread works on a subset of the data and their results are aggregated in a safe and coherent way. Simply allowing threads to increment a shared counter for each bucket will invariably lead to race conditions. A common manifestation of this is that the final counts become under- or overestimated, causing the redistribution step to misplace values.

Furthermore, the redistribution phase, where elements are moved to their respective buckets, is equally prone to errors. If multiple threads concurrently try to write to the same output index without synchronization, the last write will overwrite others, losing data. Because radix sort depends on a previous sorted state within each iteration, these inaccuracies propagate and the final result cannot converge to the correct ordering. Moreover, the inherent property of stability of radix sort could be violated. Stability in a sorting algorithm implies that elements with the same key or digit value retain their original relative order. Improperly synchronized redistribution steps can easily shuffle elements with the same key incorrectly, breaking the stability and resulting in incorrect ordering.

Now, let me share three code examples outlining how this can go wrong and how these issues can be addressed. Note, all examples are simplified for clarity, and you will likely encounter edge cases with practical implementations.

**Example 1: Naive Parallel Counting**

This example shows the naive case where multiple threads are trying to increment the counters without proper synchronization.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class BadParallelRadix {
    static void parallelCountingSort(int[] arr, int bitMask, int shift) {
        int[] counts = new int[2];
        int numThreads = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numThreads);
        int chunkSize = arr.length / numThreads;

        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
            int start = i * chunkSize;
            int end = (i == numThreads - 1) ? arr.length : (i + 1) * chunkSize;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                for (int j = start; j < end; j++) {
                    int bucket = (arr[j] & bitMask) >> shift;
                    counts[bucket]++; // Race condition here
                }
            });
        }
        executor.shutdown();
        try {
            executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        System.out.println("Counts (incorrect): " + Arrays.toString(counts));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] data = {7, 3, 8, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6};
        parallelCountingSort(data, 1, 0);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, the `counts` array is shared between threads. Without synchronization on `counts[bucket]++`, increments from different threads interfere, giving incorrect bucket counts. The resulting count array is flawed, leading to incorrect redistribution in later steps.

**Example 2:  Addressing Counting Race Condition using Thread-Local Storage**

This snippet introduces thread-local storage to mitigate race conditions on the counts array.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ImprovedParallelRadix {
    static void parallelCountingSort(int[] arr, int bitMask, int shift) {
        int numThreads = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numThreads);
        ThreadLocal<int[]> localCounts = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> new int[2]); // Thread-local counts
        int chunkSize = arr.length / numThreads;

        for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
           int start = i * chunkSize;
            int end = (i == numThreads - 1) ? arr.length : (i + 1) * chunkSize;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                int[] counts = localCounts.get();
                for (int j = start; j < end; j++) {
                    int bucket = (arr[j] & bitMask) >> shift;
                    counts[bucket]++;
                }
            });
        }
        executor.shutdown();
        try {
            executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }

        int[] finalCounts = new int[2];
        for(int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
            int[] local = localCounts.get();
            finalCounts[0] += local[0];
            finalCounts[1] += local[1];
            localCounts.remove();
        }
        System.out.println("Counts (correct): " + Arrays.toString(finalCounts));
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] data = {7, 3, 8, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6};
        parallelCountingSort(data, 1, 0);
    }
}
```
Here, instead of a single shared `counts` array, each thread gets its own private `localCounts`. After all threads have finished their local counting, the `finalCounts` is created by summing all thread-local `counts`. This avoids the direct race condition on the counters. Notice the explicit removal of thread-local instances after the aggregation to avoid memory leaks in thread pools.

**Example 3: Improperly Handling the Output Array during Redistribution**

This example illustrates the issue of simultaneous writes during the distribution stage and a simplistic approach to a fix using synchronized blocks.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class BadParallelRadixRedistribution {
    static void parallelRedistribute(int[] arr, int bitMask, int shift, int[] counts, int[] temp) {
        int numThreads = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numThreads);
         int chunkSize = arr.length / numThreads;
        int[] prefixSums = new int[counts.length];
         prefixSums[0] = counts[0];
         for(int i = 1; i < counts.length; i++) {
           prefixSums[i] = prefixSums[i-1] + counts[i];
         }
        for(int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
           int start = i * chunkSize;
           int end = (i == numThreads - 1) ? arr.length : (i + 1) * chunkSize;
            executor.submit(() -> {
               for(int j = start; j < end; j++) {
                   int bucket = (arr[j] & bitMask) >> shift;
                   synchronized (temp){
                       temp[--prefixSums[bucket]] = arr[j];  // Race condition here
                   }
               }
           });
        }
         executor.shutdown();
        try {
           executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
       } catch (InterruptedException e) {
           Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] data = {7, 3, 8, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6};
         int[] counts = {4, 4};
         int[] temp = new int[data.length];
        parallelRedistribute(data, 1, 0, counts, temp);
        System.out.println("Sorted Array (incorrect): " + Arrays.toString(temp));
    }
}
```

In this snippet, the `prefixSums` array, which dictates where elements are placed in the `temp` array, is shared across threads. Without synchronization, multiple threads may try to place elements in the same position, thereby overwriting results. While the use of `synchronized(temp)` can sometimes produce correct output, its highly inefficient. The synchronized block makes it so that redistribution can be very slow. This naive approach while fixing a race condition introduces a new performance bottleneck.

In practice, this issue is more complicated and requires a more sophisticated approach such as performing a scan across the local prefix sums before the redistribute stage, then using those computed global offsets. A lock-free implementation can increase performance by allowing multiple threads to attempt to place data at the same time (using atomic operations), but these are more complex and beyond a simple example.

To mitigate these issues in a practical setting, consider the following resources:

1.  **Parallel Algorithm Textbooks:** Refer to advanced algorithm design textbooks which contain dedicated chapters on parallel sorting algorithms. They provide theoretical context and practical implementation insights, including solutions to concurrent data access problems.
2.  **Java Concurrency Documentation:** Deepen your understanding of Java’s concurrency tools, particularly those within the `java.util.concurrent` package. Familiarize yourself with concepts such as thread pools, atomic variables, and advanced locking mechanisms.
3.  **Research Papers on Parallel Radix Sort:** Academic literature often covers in depth analysis of radix sort and its parallelization techniques. Articles detailing efficient parallel radix sort implementations using different models can be instrumental. They often delve into performance considerations and potential bottlenecks of various approaches.

Implementing a correct parallel radix sort requires meticulous planning of data dependencies and synchronization. The choice of parallelization approach will have profound impact on the throughput and the correctness. In summary, the examples and resources highlighted should give you a much better understanding of the difficulties that may come with parallel radix sorting.
