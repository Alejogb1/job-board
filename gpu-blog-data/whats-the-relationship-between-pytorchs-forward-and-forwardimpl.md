The interplay between `forward` and `_forward_impl` within PyTorch modules is crucial for understanding how models are executed, particularly when dealing with custom module implementations and torchscript compatibility. Iâ€™ve spent considerable time debugging model behavior in complex architectures, and the subtle distinction between these methods is where many unexpected behaviors originate, specifically around tracing and model serialization.

The `forward` method in a PyTorch `nn.Module` is the public-facing interface that you typically call when performing inference or during the forward pass of training. This is what most users directly interact with. However, `forward` itself might not always directly contain the entire logic for the forward computation; frequently, it serves as a gateway. The core computations often reside in a method named `_forward_impl`. This indirection is not just for design preferences; it's fundamentally tied to how PyTorch handles graph tracing for operations like model serialization via `torch.jit`.

When a PyTorch model is traced, the tracer records the operations being executed within the `_forward_impl` method. The `forward` method, on the other hand, is not directly considered part of the computational graph when tracing. This separation is essential for two primary reasons: Firstly, it allows for pre-processing or post-processing steps to occur within the `forward` method *without* having those operations become a part of the traced graph. Secondly, it enables more controlled modifications of the core computation in `_forward_impl` without altering the overall signature or interaction method provided by `forward`. This is particularly important in complex models where logging, conditional executions based on input types, or parameter adjustments before the actual forward pass are desired.

Think of `forward` as the public API, and `_forward_impl` as the private implementation detail for the core computation. Calling the module directly, for example, `module(input)`, executes the `forward` method. It's `forward`'s responsibility to potentially manipulate the input, or check it, and then it *typically* calls `_forward_impl` to perform the core model calculations. When tracing is active, the tracer dives directly into `_forward_impl`, ignoring the actions that were done by `forward` that are not standard PyTorch operations. If your custom logic is in `forward`, then that will be excluded from the trace. The traced graph contains operations from the `_forward_impl`, which will be used to serialize the model using torchscript.

Here are three illustrative code examples that clarify these points:

**Example 1: Basic Forward with No `_forward_impl`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super(SimpleModule, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Usage
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
model = SimpleModule(10, 5)
output_tensor = model(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape)

# This simple case still uses an internal _forward_impl implicitly defined within the linear layer.
# Here, forward directly executes the internal operation of nn.Linear which has a _forward_impl defined internally.

traced_model = torch.jit.trace(model, input_tensor)
print(traced_model.graph)

```
*Commentary:* In this initial example, we have a standard `nn.Module` with only a `forward` method. We use an `nn.Linear` layer, which internally has its implementation. The key point is that we can trace this model successfully, even though it doesn't have its own `_forward_impl` defined. Internally, when we call the model, `forward` calls the linear layer which will call its own internal `_forward_impl`, and since that internal function is a standard torch function it is properly handled during tracing. The traced model's graph will show the graph of computation within `nn.Linear`'s internal implementation.

**Example 2: Manual `_forward_impl` and Manipulation in `forward`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super(CustomModule, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)

    def _forward_impl(self, x):
         return self.linear(x)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x * 2 # Manipulation in forward
        return self._forward_impl(x)

# Usage
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
model = CustomModule(10, 5)
output_tensor = model(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape)

traced_model = torch.jit.trace(model, input_tensor)
print(traced_model.graph)

```
*Commentary:* Here, we explicitly define a `_forward_impl` method that now performs the linear computation. The `forward` method now manipulates the input by multiplying it by two *before* passing it to `_forward_impl`. The traced model graph, will *not* show the multiplication by two done in forward. The traced graph only contains what was done in `_forward_impl`. This demonstrates that the `forward` method can modify input and execute logic that is not part of the computational graph traced by `torch.jit`. It provides more freedom when working with `torch.jit` and complex logic.

**Example 3: Conditional Logic and No `_forward_impl`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ConditionalModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super(ConditionalModule, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)

    def forward(self, x, use_linear2=False):
         if use_linear2:
             return self.linear2(x)
         else:
             return self.linear1(x)


# Usage
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
model = ConditionalModule(10, 5)
output_tensor1 = model(input_tensor, use_linear2=False)
output_tensor2 = model(input_tensor, use_linear2=True)
print(output_tensor1.shape, output_tensor2.shape)

# This will fail, because there are two different computational graphs
# depending on the value of "use_linear2" which is a parameter of the forward function, and not the input
# traced_model = torch.jit.trace(model, input_tensor, use_linear2=False)

# However, we can use torch.jit.script which will allow conditionals
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(model)
print(scripted_model.graph)


```
*Commentary:* This example shows a common pitfall of using conditional execution within the `forward` method.  Here, the output depends on the `use_linear2` boolean which is an argument to forward.  `torch.jit.trace` expects static graphs; the behavior of `forward` is dynamic.  A call to `torch.jit.trace` will fail. However, using `torch.jit.script` instead will work correctly, allowing for conditionals in the forward method. `torch.jit.script` will attempt to compile the entire model including the `forward` function. If conditionals are used, this will be converted into an if statement in the script graph. However, it is still useful to separate logic into `_forward_impl` in many situations to increase code readability, organization and maintainability.

In summary, while you might initially only interact with the `forward` method, awareness of `_forward_impl` is critical for model debugging, especially when using tracing or custom layers with non-standard operations. By placing the core computational logic in `_forward_impl` and using `forward` as a flexible public interface, you can more efficiently utilize the PyTorch ecosystem, especially when working with `torch.jit`. It ensures that the core forward computation is captured during tracing while also allowing for additional logic within the `forward` method. Understanding this relationship prevents unexpected behaviors that can arise from misusing these methods when creating more complex models. It further enhances model portability through correct handling of graph-based optimizations and model serialization with `torch.jit`.

For further exploration, I recommend consulting the PyTorch documentation, specifically the sections concerning `nn.Module` and `torch.jit`. Also consider reviewing example implementations of complex modules within the torchvision and torchaudio libraries. Studying these practical implementations will further solidify your understanding of this important distinction between the forward methods and their intended use.
