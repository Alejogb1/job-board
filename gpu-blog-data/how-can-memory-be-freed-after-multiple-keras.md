The crucial point regarding memory management after multiple Keras training sessions within R lies not solely in Keras's operation, but in R's garbage collection mechanism and its interaction with the underlying memory allocation of TensorFlow/Keras.  My experience working on large-scale neural network training pipelines has shown that simply relying on R's garbage collector can be insufficient, especially when dealing with significant model architectures or extensive datasets.  Effective memory management necessitates a multi-pronged approach targeting both R's runtime environment and the Keras session lifecycle.

**1. Understanding the Memory Allocation Process:**

Each Keras training session in R, utilizing TensorFlow or another backend, allocates significant memory for model weights, gradients, optimizer states, and intermediate computations.  While R's garbage collector *attempts* to reclaim unused memory, it does so asynchronously and doesn't inherently understand the intricate dependencies within TensorFlow's computational graph.  Consequently, even after a model is seemingly unused, the memory allocated for it might persist, leading to memory leaks and system instability, especially in scenarios with many consecutive training runs.  The key is to explicitly manage the Keras session and explicitly release resources held by TensorFlow.

**2. Strategies for Memory Management:**

My approach emphasizes proactive memory management rather than reactive garbage collection.  This involves meticulous control over the Keras session lifecycle and careful consideration of data structures.  This translates to three primary strategies:

* **Explicit Session Closure:**  The most fundamental step is to explicitly close the Keras session after each training run. This ensures that all TensorFlow resources associated with that session are released back to the system.  Failure to do this directly leads to accumulating memory usage.

* **Object Removal:**  While closing the session releases TensorFlow resources, memory occupied by R objects (model, history, etc.) remains.  These objects need to be explicitly removed from R's workspace using the `rm()` function.  Setting `gc()` after `rm()` encourages the garbage collector to perform a more immediate cleanup.

* **Data Structure Optimization:**  Careful consideration of data structures can significantly impact memory usage.  For example, using smaller batches during training, employing data generators to load data on-demand rather than loading the entire dataset into memory at once, and converting data to a more memory-efficient format (like sparse matrices if applicable) can prevent memory exhaustion.


**3. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Training with Explicit Session Management:**

```R
library(keras)

# Training function with explicit session management
train_model <- function(model, data, epochs) {
  k <- backend()
  k$clear_session() # Ensure a clean start
  on.exit(k$clear_session()) # Ensure session closure on exit

  history <- model %>% fit(data$x, data$y, epochs = epochs)
  return(history)
}


# Example usage:
model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 64, activation = 'relu', input_shape = c(784)) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')

# Assuming data is a list with 'x' and 'y' components
data <- list(x = matrix(rnorm(784*100), nrow = 100, ncol = 784), y = matrix(sample(0:9, 100, replace = TRUE), ncol = 1))


history1 <- train_model(model, data, epochs = 10)
rm(model, history1)
gc() # Encourage garbage collection

model2 <- keras_model_sequential() %>% ... # Another model
history2 <- train_model(model2, data, epochs = 10)
rm(model2, history2)
gc()
```

This example demonstrates the use of a custom function `train_model` which incorporates `k$clear_session()` both at the beginning and explicitly using `on.exit()`, guaranteeing the session is closed regardless of function execution outcome.  The subsequent `rm()` and `gc()` calls are crucial for releasing R objects and triggering garbage collection.


**Example 2: Using Data Generators for Memory Efficiency:**

```R
library(keras)

# Create a data generator function
data_generator <- function(data, batch_size){
  function() {
    indices <- sample(nrow(data$x), batch_size)
    list(x = data$x[indices, ], y = data$y[indices, ])
  }
}

# ... (Model definition as in Example 1) ...

data_gen <- data_generator(data, batch_size = 32)

# Training with the generator
k <- backend()
k$clear_session()
on.exit(k$clear_session())
history <- model %>% fit_generator(data_gen, steps_per_epoch = nrow(data$x) / 32, epochs = 10)
rm(model, history, data_gen)
gc()
```

This example leverages `fit_generator` to process data in smaller batches. This significantly reduces the memory footprint, especially when dealing with large datasets that wouldn't fit into memory otherwise. The generator function ensures that only a subset of the data is loaded into memory at any given time.


**Example 3:  Managing Multiple Models with a Loop:**

```R
library(keras)

num_models <- 5
model_history <- list()

for (i in 1:num_models){
  k <- backend()
  k$clear_session()
  on.exit(k$clear_session())

  model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
    layer_dense(units = 64, activation = 'relu', input_shape = c(784)) %>%
    layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')

  history <- train_model(model, data, epochs = 5) #train_model function from Example 1

  model_history[[i]] <- history
  rm(model, history)
  gc()
}
rm(model_history)
gc()
```

This example demonstrates how to manage the training of multiple models in a loop, ensuring each model's resources are properly released before the next model's training begins.  The `model_history` list could be saved to disk if needed, after which it should be removed from memory.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

*  The R documentation on garbage collection.
*  The Keras documentation on backend management and session handling.
*  A comprehensive guide on R memory management strategies.
*  Documentation on the chosen deep learning backend (TensorFlow/CNTK/etc.) focusing on memory management.

By combining these strategies, the likelihood of memory issues arising from multiple Keras training sessions within R will be significantly reduced, ensuring smoother and more stable operation, particularly critical in resource-constrained environments.  Consistent application of these techniques throughout the development process is crucial for maintaining system stability and avoiding performance bottlenecks.
