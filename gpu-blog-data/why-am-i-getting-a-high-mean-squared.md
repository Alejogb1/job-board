Mean squared error (MSE), when unexpectedly elevated in the context of long short-term memory (LSTM) model training, frequently indicates a mismatch between the model's capacity, the data's characteristics, and the training regime. Having worked extensively with recurrent neural networks for time-series forecasting, I’ve observed that achieving satisfactory convergence isn't a given, requiring careful consideration of several interacting factors, rather than just a single cause. The following explores common culprits contributing to high MSE during LSTM fitting.

First, the nature of the data itself is paramount. Time series data often exhibits non-stationarity, meaning its statistical properties change over time. Consider, for example, trying to predict stock prices. The volatility patterns today might differ significantly from those a year ago. An LSTM, while powerful, might struggle to generalize across such shifts if not appropriately conditioned. In such cases, data pre-processing becomes indispensable. Techniques like differencing, which calculates the difference between successive data points, can help transform a non-stationary series into a stationary one. Another common pre-processing step involves scaling the data. LSTMs, like most neural networks, perform best when the input data has a standardized range, often within 0 and 1. Failing to scale can lead to internal weight adjustments becoming skewed, hindering effective learning. These scaling parameters must also be applied to the validation data to prevent inconsistent evaluation.

Another issue can be related to the architecture of the LSTM itself. The number of layers, the size of the hidden state, and the length of the lookback window, or sequence length, all impact performance. A model with too few parameters might not have enough capacity to capture the underlying patterns, resulting in underfitting and thus, high MSE. Conversely, a model with too many parameters can overfit, capturing noise and failing to generalize well to new data. Experimentation with different configurations, often informed by knowledge of the inherent structure in the data, is required to find an optimal architecture. The choice of activation function within the LSTM cell and across the fully connected layers also holds significance. ReLU, for example, can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem with deep networks; often, using alternatives like sigmoid or tanh, or a variant of ReLU, such as LeakyReLU, can lead to better convergence. Additionally, applying regularization techniques like dropout to reduce overfitting is beneficial.

The training process itself can also contribute to a high MSE. The selection of an appropriate optimizer and learning rate are crucial. An optimizer like Adam or RMSprop is often a better choice for LSTM models than stochastic gradient descent (SGD) because they adapt their learning rate across model parameters based on gradients. A poorly chosen learning rate can lead to oscillations around the minimum of the loss function, never converging fully. The batch size also affects training. Too small a batch size can result in noisy updates; too large can result in less efficient use of data and less precise updates. Furthermore, the number of epochs—or iterations through the entire training dataset—needs proper adjustment. Insufficient epochs prevent the model from fully learning, while excessive epochs could lead to overfitting. Careful monitoring of the validation loss over the training process is vital for selecting the number of epochs to train for, and to check for potential overfitting. The process of monitoring requires setting aside some data as a validation set.

Finally, the type of data being used can be impactful. If the data has a strong signal relative to the noise, the model is more likely to learn. The presence of outliers or anomalies can make it difficult for the model to generalize, as can missing or improperly handled data. Ensuring the data is representative of the underlying distribution will help in the training process.

Let’s illustrate these points with some code examples, using Python with Keras, assuming we have some pre-existing time series data represented as NumPy arrays:

**Example 1: Data Pre-processing and Standardization**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def preprocess_data(data, lookback):
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(len(scaled_data) - lookback - 1):
        t = scaled_data[i:(i + lookback)]
        X.append(t)
        y.append(scaled_data[i + lookback])
    return np.array(X), np.array(y), scaler

# Example Usage:
time_series_data = np.random.rand(1000)  # Replace with actual data.
lookback_period = 20
X, y, data_scaler = preprocess_data(time_series_data, lookback_period)

X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1)) # Reshape for LSTM input
```

This example standardizes the data using `StandardScaler` and also formats the data into sequences of length *lookback*. It is critical to store the `data_scaler` which would be used to transform future data into the same feature space. We also reshape the input to a 3D tensor to be used as the input for the LSTM.

**Example 2: LSTM Model Construction and Training**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def create_lstm_model(lookback, features, hidden_units, dropout_rate):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(hidden_units, input_shape=(lookback, features)))
    model.add(Dropout(dropout_rate))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='mean_squared_error')
    return model

# Example Usage
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = create_lstm_model(lookback_period, X.shape[2], 50, 0.2)

history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.1, verbose=0) # verbose=1 provides output
# Evaluate on Test set
loss = model.evaluate(X_test,y_test)
print(f"Test MSE: {loss}")
```

This example builds an LSTM with a configurable hidden state size, dropout, and compiles it with the Adam optimizer. The training process includes a validation split to allow for the evaluation of overfitting and allows us to see where to stop in the training process, often after we reach an asymptote of performance of the validation set. We then show a common method to evaluate performance, testing the model on the held-out test set.

**Example 3: Prediction and Inverse Scaling**

```python
def predict(model, X, data_scaler):
  predictions = model.predict(X)
  predictions_reshaped = predictions.reshape(-1,1)
  inverted_predictions = data_scaler.inverse_transform(predictions_reshaped).flatten()
  return inverted_predictions

# Example Usage
predictions = predict(model, X_test, data_scaler)
print(predictions)
```

The final code example demonstrates how to use the model on new data and how to invert the scaling operation, bringing the data back to the original space.

For further learning on this topic, I recommend focusing on resources covering time series analysis, recurrent neural networks, specifically LSTMs, and general best practices in deep learning model development. Books or tutorials that address practical issues like data scaling, regularization techniques, and hyperparameter tuning will prove invaluable. Publications that feature comprehensive experimental studies in sequence modeling often provide deeper insight. Furthermore, any well-regarded online platform that allows you to execute and experiment with machine learning code will be of great help.
