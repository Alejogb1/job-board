Fully connected neural networks in PyTorch, despite their apparent simplicity, can exhibit perplexing failures in learning multi-category classification, particularly when the underlying data and network architecture are not carefully considered. My experience, spanning several years developing machine learning models for sensor data analysis at a research lab, has highlighted that this often stems from a confluence of factors, ranging from inadequate data preprocessing to suboptimal optimization strategies. It is rarely a single issue; rather, a combination of less-than-ideal choices commonly results in the network failing to converge towards an acceptable solution.

A crucial initial point is that the loss function, which serves as the compass for the network’s training process, must align with the problem's nature. In multi-category classification, a common pitfall is to use a loss function not suited to discrete class labels. For example, using Mean Squared Error (MSE) which is primarily designed for regression, instead of Cross-Entropy Loss, a more appropriate metric, can lead to very slow learning, oscillating training loss, or outright failure. Cross-Entropy Loss is designed for probability distributions generated by softmax outputs, which are standard in multi-class classification. MSE's penalization strategy lacks alignment with what we expect from a probabilistic classification output. The network tends to output probabilities further away from target’s one-hot encoded vector, instead of learning the probability distribution of categories.

Another significant aspect relates to data preprocessing. If input features are not standardized (i.e., having zero mean and unit variance) or normalized within a reasonable range, training can become unstable and slow. Large variations in feature scales can bias the gradients, leading to some parameters dominating the learning process while others are effectively ignored. I recall facing a similar issue with audio sensor data; raw amplitude values ranged from -3000 to 3000, which caused my network to stagnate until I applied feature scaling using sklearn’s `StandardScaler`. Furthermore, if the target variable is not one-hot encoded (for example, if the categories are integers starting from 0), the Cross-Entropy loss function may produce unexpected gradients that hinder learning. One-hot encoding transforms each category label into a vector where the index corresponding to the class is 1, and all others are 0.

The architecture itself also plays a vital role. An improperly sized network, either too small or excessively large, will hamper performance. If the network lacks sufficient capacity, it cannot effectively learn the complex decision boundaries necessary to separate the input data into its respective classes. On the other hand, if the network has too many parameters relative to training samples, it can overfit the training data, leading to poor generalization. I found this to be the case when implementing a dense network to classify a relatively small dataset of human heart sound data; the model achieved low loss on the training set, but performed poorly with new data. Regularization techniques, such as dropout, can mitigate overfitting, but the basic architecture must still be sensible.

Optimization parameters constitute another frequently overlooked source of failure. The learning rate, specifically, has a profound impact on training dynamics. Too high and the optimizer might overshoot the minimum of the loss function, resulting in divergent training. Conversely, a learning rate that is excessively low will cause training to proceed very slowly, or sometimes the algorithm can get stuck in a local minimum. Momentum and Adaptive optimizers such as Adam, can also help. However, an inappropriate choice for other optimizer parameters like weight decay, can also harm convergence.

Here are three code examples to illustrate these points:

**Example 1: Incorrect Loss Function**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Sample data and model (simplified)
X = torch.randn(100, 10)  # 100 samples, 10 features each
y = torch.randint(0, 3, (100,)) # 3 class classification

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 20),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(20, 3) # Output layer for 3 categories
)

# Incorrect Loss: MSE (should be CrossEntropyLoss)
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(100):
    outputs = model(X)
    # Need one-hot encoding for MSE loss, which is rarely used for classification problem
    y_one_hot = F.one_hot(y, num_classes=3).float()
    loss = loss_fn(outputs, y_one_hot)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

Here, using `nn.MSELoss()` directly is incorrect for this multi-class classification task. The network will struggle to converge. Though it might look as if the loss is reducing during training, it is not indicative of the classification performance. To correctly compare the results the predicted label should be compared with actual categorical label which is difficult to do in this case.

**Example 2: Lack of Feature Scaling**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# Sample data with unscaled features
X_np = np.random.uniform(-1000, 1000, (100, 10))  # Large, unscaled feature range
y_np = np.random.randint(0, 3, (100,))

X = torch.tensor(X_np, dtype=torch.float32)
y = torch.tensor(y_np, dtype=torch.long)

# Data Scaling (using StandardScaler from Scikit-learn)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_np)
X_scaled = torch.tensor(X_scaled, dtype=torch.float32)

model_scaled = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 20),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(20, 3)
)

loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer_scaled = optim.Adam(model_scaled.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(100):
    outputs = model_scaled(X_scaled)
    loss = loss_fn(outputs, y)
    optimizer_scaled.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer_scaled.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

In this scenario, the initial data `X_np` is not scaled which would cause unstable training, while applying `StandardScaler` transforms the input to zero mean and unit variance, which promotes more efficient training, as the `model_scaled` will learn faster. The comparison here is not between two different models, but the same model applied to two different scaled data. This showcases how a preprocessing technique can change the training dynamics of the model.

**Example 3: Inadequate Optimizer Parameters (high learning rate)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Sample data and model (simplified)
X = torch.randn(100, 10)  # 100 samples, 10 features each
y = torch.randint(0, 3, (100,)) # 3 class classification

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 20),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(20, 3) # Output layer for 3 categories
)

loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# High learning rate that might diverge
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1)

for epoch in range(100):
    outputs = model(X)
    loss = loss_fn(outputs, y)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

Here, a learning rate of 1 is likely too high, causing oscillation and potentially divergence during training. Using the same architecture, using the optimizer `optim.Adam` with a learning rate of 0.001 would provide a stable training for the same data. The output of the program should show a loss value that initially decreases, and then oscillates without converging to a low number. This behavior occurs when the optimizer jumps from one side of the loss minimum to another.

For resources, I recommend focusing on thorough documentation provided by the PyTorch organization, and books on machine learning that explain the theoretical foundations of neural networks and optimization algorithms. These typically cover the underlying mathematical principles, helping you understand why certain choices are made when creating and training a model. Articles in online machine learning journals and blogs can also provide detailed explorations of specific loss functions or optimizer techniques and how they apply to different use cases. I have found that investing time in mastering these core concepts greatly improves one's ability to diagnose and rectify issues like these.
