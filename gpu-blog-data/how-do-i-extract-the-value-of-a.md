The core challenge when working with TensorFlow tensors lies in understanding that they are not Python scalars, lists, or NumPy arrays by default. Instead, they are symbolic handles to computational nodes within a TensorFlow graph. Directly accessing their 'value' often requires an explicit evaluation within a TensorFlow session or through eager execution.

My experience developing deep learning models for image recognition taught me early on that the apparent 'value' of a tensor displayed during debugging is not what's used for calculations. I encountered numerous issues, especially when trying to use intermediate tensor results outside the computational graph, necessitating a thorough grasp of tensor evaluation.

TensorFlow, particularly in its graph-based versions (prior to 2.0), operates by defining a computational graph. This graph represents the data flow and operations but does not inherently execute them. Think of a blueprint for a building; the blueprint describes the structure but doesn't construct the actual building. Tensors are nodes within this blueprint, holding symbolic references to values that are calculated only when the graph is executed.

In essence, extracting the numerical 'value' of a tensor means bringing that node to life, computing the operation and producing an actual numerical entity. This typically involves the following techniques:

**1. Session Evaluation (TensorFlow 1.x or Graph Mode in TF2.x):**

In TensorFlow 1.x, or in graph mode in TensorFlow 2.x, calculations are done inside a `tf.Session`. I usually initialize my sessions using a 'with' statement which ensures resources are released properly:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a tensor
a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(2)
c = tf.add(a, b)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  # Evaluate the tensor 'c' to get its value
  value_of_c = sess.run(c)
  print(value_of_c) # Output: 7
```

Here, `tf.constant` creates constant tensors, and `tf.add` specifies an addition operation in the graph. The key line is `sess.run(c)`. This initiates the computation and returns the result, which is then stored in `value_of_c`.  Without `sess.run()`, printing `c` would yield only the Tensor object’s meta-information, such as the tensor's dtype and shape.

It's critical to remember that `sess.run()` can take multiple tensors as input, resulting in multiple output values in the same order as the input. This allowed me, for instance, to extract multiple intermediate layer activations in a single run for analysis. If a tensor is an intermediate result depending on other tensors, all preceding tensors in the dependency chain will be computed when evaluated by `sess.run()`.

**2. Eager Execution (TensorFlow 2.x):**

TensorFlow 2.x enables eager execution by default, which simplifies the process considerably. This model directly evaluates each operation as it's encountered, akin to Python’s traditional execution style:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tf.config.run_functions_eagerly(True)

# Create a tensor
a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(2)
c = tf.add(a, b)

# Directly access the value
value_of_c = c.numpy()
print(value_of_c) # Output: 7

```

With eager execution enabled or by using `.numpy()` the tensor’s computed value becomes readily available without explicit session management. The `.numpy()` method is essential for accessing the actual numerical value of a TensorFlow tensor when using eager execution. It converts a tensor into a NumPy array, which you can manipulate directly.  It handles tensor's computation and returns a plain numpy array representing the tensor data. This is crucial when you want to leverage functions within NumPy's ecosystem or perform array-based analysis.

Eager execution was a game-changer for debugging and prototyping.  Its ease of use significantly reduced the development time and allowed me to quickly explore different model structures by evaluating their output on the fly, without the need for session management. It felt far more interactive than graph-based development.

**3. Utilizing `tf.function` (TensorFlow 2.x and Later):**

When leveraging TensorFlow's `tf.function` for graph compilation within eager execution environments, which is very common for performance optimisation,  you might need to explicitly extract values from tensors within the compiled graph using `.numpy()`. This function decorator optimises the function for faster execution using the computational graph.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

@tf.function
def calculate_sum(x,y):
  z = tf.add(x, y)
  return z

# Create tensors
a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(2)

# Execute the compiled function
result_tensor = calculate_sum(a,b)

# Extract value from the result tensor
result_value = result_tensor.numpy()
print(result_value) # Output: 7
```

The `tf.function` decorator compiles the Python function into a TensorFlow graph, which can significantly speed up computations. However, the output of this compiled function returns a tensor. It needs to be converted to a usable value, just as with non-compiled graphs. The same `.numpy()` method as used for eager tensors accomplishes this conversion, retrieving the actual numeric result. This was particularly helpful when deploying large models as the use of compiled functions made inferences very fast.

It’s important to note that trying to use the tensor directly outside of the function’s scope without retrieving its actual value will typically not work and may raise an error.  The tensor object itself is often bound to the computational context within the decorated function. This is why accessing the value through the `.numpy()` method is indispensable in such situations.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further exploration of TensorFlow tensors and their manipulation, consult the official TensorFlow documentation. Specifically, study the sections covering eager execution, graph mode, and `tf.function`. The TensorFlow tutorials offer practical examples demonstrating tensor manipulation in both eager and graph-based approaches. Books specifically covering Deep Learning with TensorFlow frequently provide extended sections on tensor operations and value extraction.  Finally, practicing by implementing simple model operations and focusing on value checking during debugging will significantly deepen your understanding of the process.
