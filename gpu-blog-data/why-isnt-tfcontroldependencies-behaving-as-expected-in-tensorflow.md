The unexpected behavior of `tf.control_dependencies` often stems from a misunderstanding of its interaction with TensorFlow's graph execution model and the subtleties of operation ordering within that graph.  My experience debugging this issue across numerous large-scale TensorFlow projects has highlighted the crucial role of scope and the distinction between graph construction and graph execution.  `tf.control_dependencies` does *not* magically reorder operations at runtime; it manipulates the graph structure during construction, influencing the execution order only indirectly.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's execution model operates on a computational graph.  `tf.control_dependencies` is a context manager that modifies this graph by adding control dependencies between operations.  These dependencies specify that certain operations must complete before others can begin, ensuring a particular execution sequence.  The critical point is that this ordering is defined during graph *construction*, not during graph *execution*.  If your expectations regarding operation order are not reflected in the constructed graph, the control dependencies won't enforce the desired runtime behavior.

Common pitfalls include:

* **Incorrect Scope:**  Control dependencies are scoped.  An operation placed outside the `tf.control_dependencies` context manager will not be subject to the dependencies defined within. This often leads to operations executing prematurely.

* **Placement of Ops:** The order in which operations are added to the graph within the `tf.control_dependencies` context matters.  The dependencies are established based on the sequence of operation creation.

* **Session Execution:** The control dependencies only affect the order of operations within a single session's execution. If you're using multiple sessions or re-creating the graph frequently, the effect of the dependencies might not be consistent across executions.

* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Asynchronous operations, like those involving queues or external data sources, can complicate the apparent order of execution even with explicit dependencies.  The framework might complete operations out of order due to resource availability or optimization strategies.

* **Eager Execution:** When using TensorFlow's eager execution mode, the control flow differs significantly from the graph mode.  In eager execution, operations are executed immediately, and `tf.control_dependencies` might have a limited or different effect.  The control dependencies are primarily relevant in graph mode.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Usage**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Graph().as_default():
    a = tf.constant(10, name='a')
    b = tf.constant(5, name='b')
    with tf.control_dependencies([tf.print("Executing print operation before addition")]):
        c = tf.add(a, b, name='c')
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        print(sess.run(c))

```

Here, the `tf.print` operation is explicitly made a dependency for the addition operation (`c`). The print statement will always execute before the addition because it's explicitly defined within the context manager.  This demonstrates the correct implementation where the order during graph construction directly translates to runtime behavior.


**Example 2: Incorrect Scope leading to Unexpected Behavior**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Graph().as_default():
    a = tf.constant(10, name='a')
    b = tf.constant(5, name='b')
    with tf.control_dependencies([tf.print("This print might not execute first")]):
        c = tf.add(a, b, name='c')
    d = tf.add(c, 2, name='d') # This op is outside the control dependency scope

    with tf.Session() as sess:
        print(sess.run(d))
```

In this case, `d`'s calculation is not subject to the control dependency defined earlier. Even though the `tf.print` operation is included in a `tf.control_dependencies` context, there is no guarantee it will execute before `d` because `d` is defined outside that context.  This highlights the importance of scoping.


**Example 3: Illustrating Asynchronous Operations (Simplified)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.Graph().as_default():
    a = tf.constant(10, name='a')
    b = tf.constant(5, name='b')

    # Simulating an asynchronous operation (replace with a queue or similar)
    async_op = tf.py_function(lambda x: x * 2, [a], Tout=tf.int64)

    with tf.control_dependencies([async_op, tf.print("Operations before addition")]):
        c = tf.add(a, b, name='c')

    with tf.Session() as sess:
        print(sess.run(c))
```

This example showcases how an asynchronous operation (`async_op`), even if placed within the control dependencies, doesn't guarantee strict sequential execution.  The framework's internal optimization might execute `tf.add` before `async_op` completes, even though the graph indicates a dependency.  This scenario emphasizes the limitations of control dependencies in the presence of truly asynchronous components.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I would recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on control flow, specifically focusing on the sections detailing graph construction and execution.  Next, a comprehensive text on computational graphs and their implementation within machine learning frameworks would provide a solid foundation. Finally, I'd suggest examining TensorFlow's source code, focusing on the implementation of `tf.control_dependencies` and related functions.  Understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial for effectively using this feature.  Carefully studying examples focusing on graph construction within `tf.function` can also further clarify the interaction between graph construction and execution.
