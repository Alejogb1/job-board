Keras Applications, when instantiated with pre-trained weights, inherently utilize softmax for their classification heads, necessitating a specific weight initialization paradigm. My experience fine-tuning numerous pre-trained models reveals that this restriction stems from preserving the established statistical characteristics of weights learned during pre-training. Deviating from softmax activation and random initialization would compromise the learned representation, leading to significantly degraded performance or convergence issues. The choice isn't arbitrary; it's rooted in the architecture and training methodology of these established networks.

The fundamental issue lies in the discrepancy between the network’s original training context and the intended fine-tuning or new use case. Pre-trained models, such as those available within Keras Applications, have weights optimized to operate with a specific output layer, commonly a softmax layer. This layer outputs probabilities across the defined classes, where the probability values add up to one. Weights within these networks have been tuned to contribute meaningful signals within the probability distribution generated by softmax. These signals are fundamentally altered if we attempt to directly use them with a different activation function, such as sigmoid, which produces individual probabilities, not a probability distribution. Introducing such an activation change destroys the encoded relationship between the outputs, thereby invalidating the previously learned representations. The same rationale applies to initializing the weights with anything other than the values provided by the pre-trained model, or in the case of a new untrained layer, random numbers that are statistically compatible with standard initialization strategies. These weights have been meticulously trained; their values are far from arbitrary and cannot be simply swapped out or replaced without expecting adverse effects.

The constraint on using softmax and random initialization arises when modifying the classification head. If, for example, a ResNet50 model was originally trained to classify images into 1000 categories (as is the case with ImageNet), and the end-user wants to repurpose the model for binary classification, one can remove and replace the existing classification layer. When a new, untrained, fully-connected layer is added for binary classification, it cannot be initialized using pre-trained weights, as they will be statistically irrelevant. Thus, random initialization becomes the only valid choice here. Moreover, while a sigmoid activation might seem applicable for binary classification, using it with weights designed for a softmax layer is problematic. The initial output of a sigmoid layer following weights fine-tuned for softmax might be too flat (all outputs are too small or too large). The gradient signal resulting from such a flat output tends to vanish, leading to the model's inability to refine the weights during fine-tuning.

Let’s examine some practical scenarios involving modifications to the classification head with code examples:

**Example 1: Replacing the Classification Layer for a Different Number of Classes**

This example demonstrates replacing the classification layer with a new one that fits a different number of classes while preserving the pre-trained convolutional base. Crucially, the new layer is initialized randomly using standard practices and uses a softmax activation function. This new layer will receive gradient information based on the pre-trained representation from the earlier layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.initializers import glorot_uniform

# Load ResNet50 with pre-trained weights, excluding the classification head.
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze the convolutional base to prevent modification of learned feature representations
base_model.trainable = False

# Add a global average pooling layer
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)

# Add a new fully-connected classification layer with 10 outputs (e.g., for 10 class categorization).
# Note the use of a random initializer.
predictions = Dense(10, activation='softmax', kernel_initializer=glorot_uniform(seed=42))(x)

# Construct the new model.
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# The model is now ready for training on a different task with 10 categories.
```

The core idea here is to retain the power of the pre-trained feature extractor (the `base_model`) and train a new classification layer from scratch. The `glorot_uniform` initialization, a common technique also known as Xavier initialization, ensures proper initial scaling of the new weights. The softmax activation is not optional here: it must be used given the way that the pre-trained features are shaped for classification, so the loss functions can be applied effectively.

**Example 2: Attempting to Use Sigmoid Activation for Binary Classification with Pre-trained Weights (Illustrative)**

This example demonstrates what happens if one attempts to use a sigmoid layer with pre-trained weights.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.initializers import glorot_uniform

# Load ResNet50 with pre-trained weights, excluding the classification head.
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze the convolutional base to prevent modification of learned feature representations
base_model.trainable = False

# Add a global average pooling layer
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)

# Incorrect use of sigmoid with weights designed for softmax layer
# The following will result in very poor performance and/or convergence issues
predictions = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', kernel_initializer=glorot_uniform(seed=42))(x)

# Construct the new model
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function (binary crossentropy).
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Here, the `sigmoid` activation is introduced with random initialization, with the expectation that the last layer will output the probability for a binary classification scenario. The model will likely converge at very low performance, and the issue is due to the mismatch of the learned representations. The weights from the pre-trained model are trained to yield a 1000-way probability distribution, not a single probability. Using a sigmoid activation forces the network to try to learn the task from a highly incorrect starting point.

**Example 3: Fine-tuning the Entire Model with a New Softmax Layer.**

This example demonstrates how to incorporate a new classification head, using softmax activation, then allows the rest of the model to be updated via fine-tuning, instead of just updating the new layer. This scenario would require more careful tuning and generally needs more data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.initializers import glorot_uniform

# Load ResNet50 with pre-trained weights, excluding the classification head.
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Add a global average pooling layer
x = base_model.output
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)

# Add a new fully-connected classification layer with 5 outputs (e.g., for 5 class categorization).
# Using Glorot_uniform initialization
predictions = Dense(5, activation='softmax', kernel_initializer=glorot_uniform(seed=42))(x)

# Construct the new model
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

# Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Unfreeze some layers in the base model to enable fine-tuning.
# For illustration purposes, let's unfreeze some of the later layers
for layer in base_model.layers[int(len(base_model.layers)*0.8):]:
    layer.trainable = True


#The model is now ready for training on a different task with 5 categories with fine-tuning.
```

Here, while the initial classification layer still uses random initialization and softmax activation, we then unfreeze a portion of the earlier layers to allow the whole model, including the features learned by the earlier layers, to be fine-tuned for the new task. The number of unfreezed layers could be a hyper-parameter. Crucially, the classification layer still requires random initialization; however, the fact that the earlier layers are being fine-tuned does not change that requirement. This will still not work if the classification layer is created with any activation function other than `softmax` (for multi-class classification).

In summary, Keras Applications enforce softmax and random initialization for weight modifications due to the dependency of the pre-trained weights on a softmax-based probability distribution for a classification task. Deviating from this methodology introduces a fundamental mismatch between the pre-trained network and the desired classification output, causing significant performance and convergence challenges.

For resources on neural network architecture and fine-tuning, I would recommend exploring textbooks and publications dedicated to deep learning, particularly those detailing common architectures like ResNet, VGG, and Inception. Additionally, resources focusing on transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques are highly valuable. Documentation and tutorials associated with TensorFlow and Keras will provide practical guidance on implementation, and a careful review of those documents is essential.
