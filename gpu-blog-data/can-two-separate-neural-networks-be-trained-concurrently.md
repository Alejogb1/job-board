Concurrent training of two distinct neural networks across separate GPUs is achievable, contingent on proper resource allocation and system architecture.  My experience optimizing large-scale model training for high-frequency trading applications has highlighted the crucial role of inter-GPU communication and efficient data partitioning in such scenarios.  Poorly managed resource utilization can negate the performance benefits of parallel training, leading to slower overall training times than a single-GPU approach.

The primary challenge lies in minimizing the overhead associated with data transfer between the GPUs.  While GPUs offer immense parallel processing power, the speed of data movement between them often forms a bottleneck. This latency directly impacts the overall training efficiency.  Furthermore, the choice of deep learning framework and its ability to effectively utilize multiple GPUs significantly influences the success of concurrent training.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Concurrent training involves splitting the workload—specifically, the training dataset and potentially the model itself—across multiple GPUs. Each GPU processes a subset of the data, independently computing gradients and updating its portion of the model parameters.  Periodic synchronization is crucial to ensure that the model parameters remain consistent across all GPUs.  This synchronization typically involves an all-reduce operation, where gradients from each GPU are aggregated and averaged before being applied to the model parameters. The frequency of this synchronization impacts the trade-off between communication overhead and the accuracy of gradient estimates. More frequent synchronization leads to less divergence between individual model instances on different GPUs but increases communication overhead. Less frequent synchronization reduces communication overhead but risks increased divergence and slower convergence.

Effective concurrent training necessitates meticulous consideration of several factors:

* **Data Parallelism:** This is the most common strategy.  The dataset is partitioned across the GPUs, with each GPU training on its own subset.  This approach is relatively straightforward to implement but necessitates efficient data transfer mechanisms.

* **Model Parallelism:** This approach partitions the model itself across the GPUs, with each GPU responsible for processing a specific layer or a set of layers. This strategy is more complex to implement but can be beneficial for extremely large models that do not fit entirely onto a single GPU.

* **Hybrid Parallelism:** This combines both data and model parallelism to leverage the strengths of each approach.  It’s often employed for exceptionally large models and datasets.

* **Communication Framework:**  Choosing the right framework (e.g., NCCL, Horovod) for inter-GPU communication is vital. These frameworks provide optimized communication primitives to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

* **Hardware Considerations:** GPU memory capacity, inter-GPU communication bandwidth, and CPU performance all play significant roles in determining the efficiency of concurrent training.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples utilize PyTorch, demonstrating different aspects of concurrent training.  These are simplified illustrations and would require adaptation for real-world applications.  I’ve omitted error handling for brevity.

**Example 1: Data Parallelism using `torch.nn.DataParallel`**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.utils.data as data

# Define a simple neural network
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 50)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(50, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Assuming dataset is loaded as 'train_loader'
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
  print("Let's use", torch.cuda.device_count(), "GPUs!")
  model = nn.DataParallel(Net().cuda())
else:
  model = Net().cuda()

criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(10):
    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
        inputs = inputs.cuda()
        labels = labels.cuda()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

*Commentary:* This example leverages PyTorch's built-in `DataParallel` module for simplified data parallelism.  It automatically distributes the input batches across available GPUs.  The assumption is that the `train_loader` provides data in a format compatible with PyTorch's data loaders.

**Example 2:  Manual Data Parallelism with Gradient Averaging**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... (Net definition from Example 1) ...

device_ids = [0, 1] # Assuming two GPUs are available
model = nn.DataParallel(Net(), device_ids=device_ids)
model.to(device_ids[0]) #Ensure the model is on the right GPU

criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(10):
    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
        inputs = inputs.cuda(device_ids[0])
        labels = labels.cuda(device_ids[0])

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()

        for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:
            for param in param_group['params']:
                param.grad /= len(device_ids) # Manual gradient averaging
        optimizer.step()
```

*Commentary:* This demonstrates a more explicit approach to data parallelism. Gradient averaging is performed manually after the backward pass to ensure consistent updates across all GPUs.  This provides more control but requires more manual implementation.  It's crucial to divide the gradients by the number of GPUs to avoid over-updating the parameters.

**Example 3:  Illustrative Model Parallelism (Simplified)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

#Simplified Model Parallelism - Linear Layers on Separate GPUs
class NetPart1(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NetPart1, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10,50)

    def forward(self,x):
        return torch.relu(self.fc1(x))


class NetPart2(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NetPart2, self).__init__()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(50,10)

    def forward(self,x):
        return self.fc2(x)


# ... (Dataset loading as in Example 1) ...

device_ids = [0,1]
model_part1 = NetPart1().to(device_ids[0])
model_part2 = NetPart2().to(device_ids[1])

criterion = nn.MSELoss()

optimizer1 = optim.SGD(model_part1.parameters(), lr=0.01)
optimizer2 = optim.SGD(model_part2.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(10):
    for i,(inputs,labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
        inputs = inputs.to(device_ids[0])
        labels = labels.to(device_ids[1]) #Labels to GPU 1 for demonstration

        optimizer1.zero_grad()
        optimizer2.zero_grad()
        intermediate_output = model_part1(inputs)
        intermediate_output = intermediate_output.to(device_ids[1]) #Transfer data
        outputs = model_part2(intermediate_output)
        loss = criterion(outputs,labels)
        loss.backward()

        optimizer1.step()
        optimizer2.step()

```

*Commentary:* This example showcases a rudimentary form of model parallelism.  The network is split into two parts, each residing on a separate GPU.  The output of the first part needs to be transferred to the second GPU, highlighting the communication overhead inherent in this approach. More sophisticated model parallelism requires careful consideration of layer dependencies and communication strategies.

Explore the documentation for libraries like NCCL and Horovod to grasp the intricacies of inter-GPU communication.  Furthermore, delve into research papers on large-scale model training and optimization techniques, particularly those focusing on efficient data partitioning and gradient aggregation strategies.  Consult textbooks on parallel and distributed computing for a theoretical foundation in these concepts.  Finally, practical experience through implementing distributed training on diverse hardware configurations is essential for developing expertise in this area.
