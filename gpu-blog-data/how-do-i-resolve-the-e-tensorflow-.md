The `tensorflow/core/util/events_writer.cc:104` error in Ubuntu TensorFlow GPU installations often stems from insufficient permissions or corrupted TensorFlow event files within the designated log directory.  This is based on my experience troubleshooting similar issues across numerous projects involving large-scale model training and deployment on high-performance computing clusters.  The error message itself is unhelpful, providing no direct indication of the root cause; therefore, a systematic approach to diagnostics is crucial.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `events_writer.cc` file manages the logging of training events in TensorFlow.  These events contain metrics, gradients, and other information crucial for monitoring the training process.  The error at line 104 typically manifests when TensorFlow attempts to write these events to a file, but encounters a permission issue or a problem with the file's integrity.  This could be due to various reasons:

* **Insufficient File System Permissions:** TensorFlow might lack write access to the directory where it attempts to log events.  This is particularly common when running TensorFlow within Docker containers or under restricted user accounts.

* **Disk Space Exhaustion:** A full or nearly full disk can prevent TensorFlow from writing new log files, resulting in this error.

* **Corrupted Log Files:**  Previous instances of TensorFlow might have left behind corrupted log files.  These can interfere with subsequent training runs.

* **Antivirus or Security Software Interference:**  Overzealous security software might interfere with TensorFlow's attempts to write files.

* **Incorrectly Configured TensorFlow Installation:**  Issues during the installation process can leave TensorFlow in a state where it can't properly manage its log files.

Therefore, the resolution strategy involves checking file system permissions, disk space availability, examining existing log files for corruption, temporarily disabling security software, and, as a last resort, reinstalling TensorFlow.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following code snippets illustrate methods for investigating and mitigating the issue.  These examples assume a basic familiarity with the command line interface and Python.

**Example 1: Checking Disk Space:**

```bash
df -h
```

This command displays the disk space usage for all mounted file systems.  Look for partitions with low available space (e.g., less than 10%). If a low disk space is detected, remove unnecessary files or consider increasing the disk space before restarting the TensorFlow process.  Note that TensorFlow can log to various temporary directories, requiring examination of multiple locations.


**Example 2: Checking TensorFlow Log Directory Permissions:**

```bash
ls -l /tmp/tensorflow # Replace /tmp/tensorflow with your TensorFlow log directory if different
```

This command lists the files and directories within the typical TensorFlow log directory, showing ownership and permissions.  The output should reveal whether the user running TensorFlow has write access ('w' in the permissions string). If not, you may need to change permissions using `chmod`:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 /tmp/tensorflow # Use with caution, potentially less restrictive permissions are sufficient.
```

**Caution:**  While the above `chmod` command grants full access, it's generally recommended to assign more specific permissions based on security best practices.  Adjust the numerical value (777) based on your needs; research Unix file permissions for further details.

**Example 3: Cleaning Up TensorFlow Log Files:**

```python
import os
import shutil

log_dir = "/tmp/tensorflow" # Replace with your TensorFlow log directory

try:
    shutil.rmtree(log_dir)
    os.makedirs(log_dir)
    print(f"Successfully cleaned and recreated {log_dir}")
except OSError as e:
    print(f"Error cleaning log directory: {e}")

```

This Python script attempts to remove the TensorFlow log directory and recreate it. This is a drastic step that will erase all existing TensorFlow logs; therefore, ensure you've backed up any crucial data before running this.  If the issue persists after this, it is likely not due to corrupted log files.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides extensive information on troubleshooting various issues.  Consult the TensorFlow website's troubleshooting section.  Reviewing the error logs generated by TensorFlow (outside of the `events_writer` issue) can provide additional clues.  Furthermore, Stack Overflow and other community forums often have threads discussing similar errors and their solutions. Finally, understanding Unix command-line tools (like `ls`, `chmod`, `df`, `find`) is essential for efficient debugging in Linux environments.  Advanced users might consider using system monitoring tools to assess disk I/O performance and CPU usage during TensorFlow execution, which can help identify performance bottlenecks that might indirectly cause the error.  Thoroughly reviewing TensorFlow's installation instructions to ensure a clean installation and proper environment configuration is a proactive measure that can prevent such issues.
