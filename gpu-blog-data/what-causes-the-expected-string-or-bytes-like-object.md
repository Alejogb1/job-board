The "expected string or bytes-like object" error in Django Wagtail frequently stems from attempting to use an object where a string or bytes-like object is explicitly required.  This often manifests within template rendering, model field interactions, or when working with database queries involving non-string data types. My experience troubleshooting this across numerous Wagtail projects, particularly those involving custom StreamFields and integrations with external APIs, has highlighted three primary causes.

**1. Incorrect Data Type Passed to Template:**

Wagtail, like Django, leverages template engines to dynamically generate HTML.  These engines expect specific data types, primarily strings or bytes-like objects, for rendering. Passing objects that are not directly convertible to strings, such as lists, dictionaries, or custom objects, will result in the error.  This is particularly common when dealing with complex data structures retrieved from models or APIs.

**Clear Explanation:** Template engines employ methods like string formatting or interpolation to insert data into HTML. If the engine encounters an object it cannot directly interpret as a string (e.g., a `User` object or a `datetime` object without explicit string conversion), it throws the "expected string or bytes-like object" exception.  The engine lacks the inherent capability to understand the internal structure of arbitrary objects and convert them automatically to a representation suitable for HTML.

**Code Example 1 (Illustrating the Problem):**

```python
# models.py
from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel
from wagtail.core.fields import RichTextField
from wagtail.core.models import Page

class MyPage(Page):
    content = RichTextField(blank=True)
    data_object = models.JSONField(default=dict, blank=True, null=True) #Store arbitrary data


    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('data_object'),
    ]

# templates/my_template.html
{% load wagtailcore_tags %}

<h1>My Page</h1>
<p>{{ page.data_object }}</p>  <!-- Incorrect: data_object is a dictionary -->

```

This code snippet demonstrates a potential source of the error.  `page.data_object` is a dictionary, not directly renderable in a template.

**Code Example 2 (Corrected Version):**

```python
# templates/my_template.html
{% load wagtailcore_tags %}

<h1>My Page</h1>
{% if page.data_object %}
  {% for key, value in page.data_object.items %}
    <p>{{ key }}: {{ value }}</p>
  {% endfor %}
{% else %}
  <p>No data available.</p>
{% endif %}

```

Here, the corrected code iterates through the dictionary and renders key-value pairs as strings, avoiding the error.

**2.  Incorrect Data Type in Model Fields:**

When interacting with model fields, especially those storing non-string data types such as dates, integers, or booleans, ensuring appropriate type handling is crucial.  Improper casting or attempting to use these fields directly in string contexts can trigger the error. This is often seen when generating calculated fields or manipulating data before database storage.

**Clear Explanation:** Database interactions often involve explicit type conversion.  If a model field is expected to store a string but receives a different data type (e.g., an integer is assigned to a `CharField`), a conversion issue might arise during retrieval or processing.  Furthermore, improperly handling `ForeignKey` relationships in templates without explicitly referencing the appropriate string representation can lead to this error.

**Code Example 3 (Illustrating Incorrect Model Handling):**

```python
# models.py
from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel
from wagtail.core.fields import RichTextField
from wagtail.core.models import Page
from django.db import models

class MyPage(Page):
    content = RichTextField(blank=True)
    number_field = models.IntegerField()  # Integer field

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('number_field'),
    ]

#templates/my_template.html
<p>My Number: {{ page.number_field }}</p>  #Potentially problematic.

```

While this might seemingly work,  direct insertion of an integer into the template might present issues in certain contexts or template engines.  Explicit conversion is preferred.

**Code Example 3 (Corrected Version):**

```python
#templates/my_template.html
<p>My Number: {{ page.number_field|stringformat:"d" }}</p> #Explicit conversion

```

The `stringformat` filter explicitly converts the integer to a string.  Alternatively, one could handle this within the view or model.

**3.  Issues with Database Queries and Foreign Key Relationships:**

Complex database queries, especially those involving `ForeignKey` or `ManyToManyField` relationships, can lead to this error if the results are not correctly handled before use in templates or other contexts.   Accessing attributes incorrectly or forgetting to resolve relationships can result in objects being passed where strings are expected.

**Clear Explanation:**  Database queries often return querysets or objects, not immediately usable in template contexts.  Correctly accessing the related object's string representation – for example, a user's name from a `ForeignKey` to a `User` model – requires accessing the appropriate attribute of the related object and converting it to a string if necessary.


In summary, the "expected string or bytes-like object" error in Wagtail is often symptomatic of a mismatch between the expected data type and the actual data type used. Carefully examine data types, perform explicit type conversion where needed, use appropriate filters, and correctly handle model relationships to prevent this prevalent error.

**Resource Recommendations:**

1. Django Documentation (specifically sections on template engines and model field types).
2. Wagtail Documentation (focused on template rendering and model customization).
3. Python documentation on built-in functions for data type conversion.
4.  A thorough understanding of Django's ORM.


By meticulously inspecting data types within templates, models, and database interactions, developers can proactively prevent and effectively troubleshoot the "expected string or bytes-like object" error in Wagtail.  My extensive work with Wagtail's rich API and diverse projects has reinforced this methodology as the most effective approach to prevent this common issue.
