The abrupt increase in model loss upon reloading and resuming training frequently stems from inconsistencies between the model's state at the point of saving and the environment in which it's reloaded. This isn't solely a matter of random weight initialization; rather, it's a subtle interplay of several factors, often overlooked during the model serialization and deserialization process.  In my experience debugging large-scale NLP models, I've encountered this issue repeatedly, and its root cause is almost always a discrepancy in data preprocessing, optimizer state, or even subtle differences in hardware configurations.

**1. Data Preprocessing Discrepancies:**

The most common culprit is a change in the data preprocessing pipeline between saving and reloading the model. This might seem trivial, but even minor alterations can drastically alter the input features presented to the model.  Consider scenarios where:

* **Tokenization:**  Changes to the tokenizer (e.g., adding new vocabulary, altering tokenization rules) will lead to different input representations. The model, trained on a specific vocabulary and tokenization scheme, will struggle to interpret the newly processed data, resulting in a sudden jump in loss.  This is particularly relevant with sub-word tokenizers, where vocabulary size and tokenization strategy can significantly affect embeddings.
* **Normalization:**  If normalization parameters (mean, standard deviation) are calculated on the training data *before* saving and applied differently after reloading, the input distribution will shift. This unexpected change in input distribution throws off the model's internal representations, leading to higher loss.  This applies to both input features and labels if normalization is applied to the target variable.
* **Data Augmentation:**  Variations in data augmentation techniques applied before and after reloading can similarly lead to inconsistencies. If augmentation parameters are not meticulously tracked and reproduced, the distribution of the training data changes, impacting the model's ability to generalize.

**2. Optimizer State and Hyperparameters:**

The optimizer's internal state, including momentum, learning rate scheduling, and gradient accumulation, needs to be perfectly preserved.  Failing to accurately reload the optimizer's state often leads to instability and increased loss.  If the optimizer's hyperparameters are modified after reloading (e.g., changing the learning rate without a well-defined scheduling strategy), the model's optimization trajectory will be disrupted, potentially leading to divergence.


**3. Hardware and Software Environment:**

While less frequent, inconsistencies in the hardware or software environments can also affect the model's behavior. Different versions of libraries (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) might have subtle changes in numerical computation that influence the gradient calculations.  Furthermore, using different hardware (e.g., CPUs vs. GPUs, different GPU architectures) can introduce discrepancies due to variations in floating-point precision and memory management.


**Code Examples:**

Let's illustrate these points with examples using PyTorch.  Assume `model`, `optimizer`, and `train_loader` are already defined.

**Example 1:  Inconsistent Tokenization**

```python
# Save the model and tokenizer separately.
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')
torch.save(tokenizer, 'tokenizer.pth') # Assuming you have a custom tokenizer

# ... later, during reloading ...

loaded_model = Model() # Instantiate your model class again
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))
loaded_tokenizer = torch.load('tokenizer.pth')

# If tokenizer is modified between saving and loading, this will cause problems.
for batch in train_loader:
    inputs = loaded_tokenizer(batch['text']) # Tokenize with the reloaded tokenizer
    # ... rest of your training loop ...
```

**Example 2: Incorrect Optimizer State Loading**

```python
# Incorrect way to save the optimizer - only saves the model's state
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')

# ... later ...
loaded_model = Model()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))
optimizer = optim.Adam(loaded_model.parameters(), lr=0.001) # Optimizer is re-initialized!

# Correct way to save and load the optimizer state
torch.save({'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(), 'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer.state_dict()}, 'checkpoint.pth')

# ... later ...
checkpoint = torch.load('checkpoint.pth')
loaded_model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer_state_dict'])
```

**Example 3: Data Normalization Discrepancy**

```python
# Calculate normalization statistics on the training data *before* training
mean = data.mean()
std = data.std()
normalized_data = (data - mean) / std


# ...during training...
torch.save({'model': model.state_dict(), 'mean': mean, 'std': std}, 'model_with_stats.pth')

#...during reloading...
checkpoint = torch.load('model_with_stats.pth')
loaded_model = Model()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model'])

#Recalculating normalization parameters, this will lead to inconsistency!
new_mean = train_data.mean()
new_std = train_data.std()
normalized_data = (train_data - new_mean) / new_std  # Using recalculated stats
```



**Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest carefully reviewing the documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (PyTorch or TensorFlow). Pay close attention to sections covering model saving and loading, optimizer state management, and best practices for reproducibility.  Additionally, a thorough understanding of serialization and deserialization concepts is crucial for avoiding these pitfalls.  Consult relevant texts on numerical computation and machine learning reproducibility for a more theoretical foundation.  Finally, maintaining detailed logs of your preprocessing pipelines, hyperparameters, and training environment configuration is essential for debugging such issues effectively.  These logs can aid in identifying discrepancies between the training runs.
