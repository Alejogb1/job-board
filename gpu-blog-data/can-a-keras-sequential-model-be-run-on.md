The efficacy of GPU acceleration for a Keras Sequential model hinges primarily on the backend used and the appropriate configuration of the hardware and software environment.  My experience optimizing deep learning models over the past five years has shown that while Keras itself is framework-agnostic, the underlying computational engine dictates the hardware utilization.  A Keras Sequential model, inherently, does not intrinsically possess the capability to leverage a GPU; rather, it's the backend's responsibility to manage the distribution of computations across available processing units.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras, a high-level API for building neural networks, serves as an abstraction layer. It doesn't directly interact with hardware. The actual computation is handled by a backend engine, most commonly TensorFlow or Theano (though Theano support is waning).  TensorFlow, in particular,  is designed to effectively utilize GPUs via CUDA (for NVIDIA GPUs) or ROCm (for AMD GPUs).  Therefore, to run a Keras Sequential model on a GPU, you must ensure:

* **Appropriate Backend:** Your Keras installation must be configured to use a backend capable of GPU acceleration (TensorFlow with CUDA/ROCm support being the primary choice).
* **GPU Driver Installation:** Correctly installed and updated drivers for your GPU are critical. Incompatibility or outdated drivers are frequent causes of GPU acceleration failure.
* **CUDA/ROCm Toolkit:** If using NVIDIA GPUs, the CUDA toolkit must be installed and configured correctly; for AMD GPUs, it's the ROCm stack.  These toolkits provide the necessary libraries and tools for TensorFlow to interact with the GPU.
* **TensorFlow Installation with GPU Support:** The TensorFlow installation must explicitly include GPU support.  This often involves selecting a specific wheel file or building TensorFlow from source with the appropriate flags during installation.
* **Hardware Compatibility:** Your GPU must meet the minimum specifications required by TensorFlow.  Older GPUs or those lacking sufficient memory may not offer significant performance benefits or might even impede training.


Failure to meet any of these prerequisites will result in the model running on the CPU, regardless of whether you're using a Keras Sequential model or a more complex architecture. The backend automatically chooses the execution device based on its configuration and the availability of resources.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Verifying GPU Availability:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```

This concise snippet uses TensorFlow's `config` module to check the number of GPUs available to the current Python session.  A zero output indicates the absence of GPU support, necessitating troubleshooting of the aforementioned prerequisites.  I frequently used this during my work on large-scale image classification projects to quickly verify the correct configuration before initiating computationally expensive training loops.

**Example 2:  Simple Sequential Model with GPU Acceleration:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Verify GPU availability (as in Example 1)

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Assuming 'x_train' and 'y_train' are your training data
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward Sequential model built using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend. The crucial aspect here is the implicit GPU usage if the environment is correctly configured (as shown by Example 1). TensorFlow will automatically leverage the GPU for the training process if available.  This approach was particularly useful for rapid prototyping, allowing me to quickly test model architectures before optimizing for large datasets.


**Example 3:  Explicit Device Placement (Advanced):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

#List physical devices
physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

#Select the GPU for training
try:
  tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices(physical_devices[0], 'GPU')
except RuntimeError as e:
  # Handle the error
  print(e)

with tf.device('/GPU:0'): #Explicitly placing the model on GPU 0
    model = keras.Sequential([
        Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

```

This example extends the previous one by explicitly assigning the model to a specific GPU (GPU:0 in this case).  This level of control is beneficial when working with multiple GPUs or managing resource allocation across multiple processes. I used this approach extensively in distributed training scenarios, where precise control over device placement was vital for maximizing parallel processing.  Error handling is included to catch potential issues with GPU configuration.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation.
*   A comprehensive guide to CUDA programming (for NVIDIA GPUs).
*   The official documentation for your specific GPU model.
*   A textbook on deep learning fundamentals.
*   Advanced tutorials on TensorFlow's distributed training capabilities.


These resources offer a solid foundation for understanding and addressing the nuances of GPU acceleration with Keras.  A thorough understanding of these concepts is essential for effectively harnessing the power of GPUs for deep learning tasks.  Failing to properly configure the environment will lead to wasted computation and suboptimal performance, no matter how sophisticated the model architecture.
