The effective learning rate during PyTorch training is not a static, singular value, but rather a dynamic entity influenced by a complex interplay of factors, most notably the optimizer configuration, batch size, and any learning rate scheduling mechanisms employed. My experience across several large-scale deep learning projects consistently reinforces the necessity of understanding these interactions to optimize training performance. While the optimizer might be set with a base learning rate, the *effective* rate seen by the model's parameters during backpropagation can significantly deviate. This is paramount in achieving convergence and model performance.

**Understanding the Dynamics of Effective Learning Rate**

The initially configured learning rate acts as a starting point. The gradient descent algorithm uses this rate to scale the gradient and determine the step size in parameter space. However, the impact of this base rate is modulated by several elements. First, the batch size plays a critical role. Larger batch sizes lead to more stable gradient estimates, but also to *effectively* smaller updates per sample. This is because the gradients are averaged across the entire batch before being applied.  Therefore, if the base learning rate is kept constant, larger batch sizes will result in smaller effective learning rates per individual training example, which can impact convergence rate. Conversely, smaller batch sizes, while introducing more noise in gradient estimation, result in larger updates per sample, effectively increasing the perceived learning rate.

Secondly, the specific optimizer employed, beyond the base learning rate, has considerable influence. Algorithms like Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad use adaptive learning rates, where each parameter can have its own dynamic learning rate modified based on the history of gradients for that specific parameter. Thus, the initial learning rate set for these optimizers only dictates the *starting scale* of the learning process, with the effective learning rates fluctuating substantially through training. These optimizers generally adjust the learning rate to be large for low gradient regions and smaller for high gradient regions, to speed up training.

Learning rate schedulers further complicate the picture. These functions alter the base learning rate over the course of training, potentially according to a fixed schedule (e.g., step decay) or in a more adaptive manner (e.g., reduce-on-plateau). The effective learning rate at a particular epoch or iteration will therefore depend on the current base learning rate provided by the scheduler, and the optimizer's internal adjustments. 

**Code Examples and Commentary**

To illustrate these concepts, I present three code examples utilizing PyTorch, each demonstrating a different aspect of the effective learning rate.

**Example 1: Impact of Batch Size on Learning Rate.**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

model = SimpleModel()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Base learning rate
base_lr = 0.01
# Example batch sizes
batch_sizes = [32, 128, 512]
# Dummy input data
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
dummy_target = torch.randn(1, 1)

for bs in batch_sizes:
    # Initialize the optimizer with base lr
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=base_lr)

    # Loss computations and backward pass simulation for a single step for testing purposes
    for _ in range(10):
      for _ in range(bs):
          output = model(dummy_input)
          loss = criterion(output, dummy_target)
          loss.backward()
      optimizer.step()
      optimizer.zero_grad()

    # Retrieve and print the parameter norm changes
    param_change_norm = 0
    for param in model.parameters():
        param_change_norm += torch.norm(param.grad)
    print(f"Batch size: {bs}, Accumulated parameter change norm: {param_change_norm.item():.4f}")

```

**Commentary:**
This example highlights how increasing batch size with the same base learning rate yields smaller changes in parameter norms after 10 steps of optimization. Because the gradients from larger batches are essentially averaged across more samples, the effective update to parameters is reduced. This isn't directly a change to *the* learning rate, but rather its effect in practice. The accumulated parameter change norm serves as a stand in measure of the impact of the effective learning rate.

**Example 2: Adaptive Learning Rate with Adam**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

model = SimpleModel()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Base learning rate
base_lr = 0.01

# Initialize Adam optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=base_lr)

# Dummy input
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
dummy_target = torch.randn(1, 1)

# Initial learning rate
print(f"Initial Base Learning Rate: {optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr']:.4f}")

for step in range(20):
    output = model(dummy_input)
    loss = criterion(output, dummy_target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    if step % 5 == 0:
      print(f"Step: {step}, Effective Learning Rate: {optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr']:.4f}")

```

**Commentary:**
Here, the `Adam` optimizer demonstrates adaptive learning rates. The base learning rate remains constant in the `param_groups` array, but internally the optimizer adjusts individual parameter learning rates based on historical gradient information. This is why you see changes in parameter norms even with a fixed base learning rate. The print statement here highlights that the optimizer learning rate *does not change* while the effective learning rates, as demonstrated by the gradient updates, do.

**Example 3: Learning Rate Scheduling**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import StepLR

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

model = SimpleModel()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
# Base learning rate
base_lr = 0.1

# Optimizer and scheduler
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=base_lr)
scheduler = StepLR(optimizer, step_size=5, gamma=0.5)
# Dummy data
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)
dummy_target = torch.randn(1, 1)


print(f"Initial learning rate: {scheduler.get_last_lr()[0]:.4f}")

for epoch in range(10):
    for _ in range(10):
       output = model(dummy_input)
       loss = criterion(output, dummy_target)
       loss.backward()
       optimizer.step()
       optimizer.zero_grad()
    scheduler.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Learning Rate: {scheduler.get_last_lr()[0]:.4f}")
```

**Commentary:**
This example demonstrates the impact of a learning rate scheduler. The `StepLR` scheduler reduces the base learning rate by a factor of `gamma` every `step_size` epochs. This directly modifies the optimizer's base learning rate and consequently alters the effective rate. The parameter updates will change along with the scheduler. These results clearly illustrate how the effective learning rate changes during training. The `get_last_lr()` provides the *current* base learning rate from the optimizer, further proving that learning rate is not a static value.

**Resource Recommendations**

To deepen understanding of this topic, consulting resources that delve into the specifics of different optimization algorithms is recommended. Texts focusing on deep learning optimization techniques, such as those that detail adaptive optimizers (Adam, RMSprop), and those covering learning rate scheduling strategies, provide essential insights. Additionally, research papers focusing on the interactions between batch size and learning rates can clarify further the effect of these factors. The PyTorch documentation itself, specifically the sections on optimizers and learning rate schedulers, also provides a valuable resource. Finally, analyzing model behavior using learning curves and parameter gradients is a crucial method to test different settings and is beneficial for a deeper practical understanding of the effective learning rate.
