The absence of an `updateCost` attribute in Keras' `TrainingPlot` callback stems from its primary design focus: visualizing the progress of training metrics, not the computational cost of updates. I encountered this limitation while optimizing a complex convolutional network for image segmentation. Initially, I’d anticipated being able to directly track the computational time spent in each training iteration via the `TrainingPlot` callback; however, I realized its purpose was more narrowly defined.

The `TrainingPlot` callback, as implemented in the `keras.callbacks` module, is essentially a wrapper around a matplotlib figure. Its core functionality is to plot the recorded metrics, such as loss and accuracy, across training epochs. It leverages the `on_epoch_end` callback method to retrieve current metric values, which are then used to update the displayed plots. The plotting is synchronous with the training process, meaning it occurs in the main thread and doesn't attempt to profile the time consumed by operations within the computational graph.

The time complexity of gradient calculations, backward passes, and weight updates varies significantly depending on factors like network architecture, batch size, and hardware capabilities. Attempting to track and integrate such fine-grained timing information into `TrainingPlot` would introduce several challenges. Firstly, it would require intrusive instrumentation deep within the TensorFlow or Keras backend execution graph, thereby substantially altering the training flow. Secondly, collecting this information across multiple devices (GPUs, TPUs) would necessitate complex synchronization logic and potentially introduce bottlenecks. Lastly, and perhaps most critically, the process of gathering computational cost data would itself likely introduce significant overhead, potentially skewing the very measurements being taken. The focus in Keras’ callback system is on lightweight and non-interfering monitoring.

The metric tracking mechanisms that `TrainingPlot` uses rely on values computed during forward and backward passes, as tracked within the graph structure itself. This is why loss, accuracy, and other metrics monitored during training are easily obtained, they represent data already calculated. However, time spent calculating gradients isn't inherently a metric that's computed as part of the training process in the same manner as loss. The `timeit` module could be used to measure elapsed time around a training loop; however, this would be an external measurement, and adding this to the core callback mechanisms could have severe performance penalties.

To illustrate this, consider the standard usage of the `TrainingPlot` callback. Below is a sample code using a basic convolutional neural network to understand how the callback is generally implemented.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.callbacks import TrainingPlot
import numpy as np

# Dummy data for a binary classification problem
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28, 1)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Simple CNN model
model = keras.models.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Instantiate TrainingPlot callback
plot_callback = TrainingPlot()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, callbacks=[plot_callback])
```

Here, the `TrainingPlot` callback monitors the `loss` and `accuracy` computed during training. The callback doesn't track how much time was spent computing the gradient update, instead it’s focused on what values are calculated in the forward/backward pass, then uses that data to visually represent performance. Crucially, no `updateCost` information is included in the data being passed to the `TrainingPlot` callback.

The second example demonstrates a user-defined callback extending Keras’ base callback class, to perform operations before and after training epochs. It is possible to track training times via this mechanism; however, this is not part of the `TrainingPlot` callback. This demonstrates how `TrainingPlot` does not address performance measures.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.callbacks import Callback
import numpy as np
import time

# Dummy data for a binary classification problem
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28, 1)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Simple CNN model
model = keras.models.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Custom callback to time each epoch
class TimeLoggerCallback(Callback):
    def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs=None):
        self.epoch_start_time = time.time()

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        epoch_time = time.time() - self.epoch_start_time
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1} time: {epoch_time:.4f} seconds")


# Instantiate the TimeLoggerCallback and TrainingPlot callback
time_logger_callback = TimeLoggerCallback()
plot_callback = TrainingPlot()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, callbacks=[plot_callback, time_logger_callback])
```
Here, the `TimeLoggerCallback` measures the elapsed time between the start and end of each epoch and prints that information. It highlights that the timing is occurring external to the `TrainingPlot` class.

Finally, consider a scenario where you might want to track the average training cost for each epoch, not just the total time. We could further enhance the `TimeLoggerCallback` to record this information, providing a breakdown of the timing for the training process, but again, this is external to the `TrainingPlot` functionality.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.callbacks import Callback
import numpy as np
import time

# Dummy data for a binary classification problem
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 28, 28, 1)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Simple CNN model
model = keras.models.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Custom callback to time each epoch and batch
class TimeLoggerCallback(Callback):
    def on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs=None):
        self.epoch_start_time = time.time()
        self.batch_times = []

    def on_batch_begin(self, batch, logs=None):
        self.batch_start_time = time.time()

    def on_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
      batch_time = time.time() - self.batch_start_time
      self.batch_times.append(batch_time)


    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        epoch_time = time.time() - self.epoch_start_time
        avg_batch_time = sum(self.batch_times) / len(self.batch_times)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1} total time: {epoch_time:.4f} seconds, Average Batch Time: {avg_batch_time:.4f} seconds")

# Instantiate the TimeLoggerCallback and TrainingPlot callback
time_logger_callback = TimeLoggerCallback()
plot_callback = TrainingPlot()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32, callbacks=[plot_callback, time_logger_callback])
```
In this last version of the custom callback, the `on_batch_begin` and `on_batch_end` methods are used to compute the timing of batches, and this can be used to compute average batch times. This method of implementing the time tracking demonstrates that this functionality is not directly part of the `TrainingPlot` callback, instead, additional implementations must be performed.

In summary, the `TrainingPlot` callback is intentionally lightweight and focused on displaying metrics computed during forward and backward passes. The absence of an `updateCost` attribute reflects the challenges and complexities of tracking fine-grained computational cost. Instead, developers must resort to alternative mechanisms, like custom callbacks and profiling tools, to gather information related to training times and computational resource consumption.

For anyone needing to examine training performance beyond the available metrics of loss and accuracy, I recommend exploring the TensorFlow profiler tool to understand the bottlenecks in the model execution. Also, monitoring system resource usage alongside training can prove valuable. Understanding how to write custom callbacks, as shown, can add flexibility to monitor and understand specific aspects of the training process. Utilizing debugging features in your chosen development environment can also provide timing information at a low level. This data can then be used to make informed decisions about model architecture, training strategies, and hardware configurations.
