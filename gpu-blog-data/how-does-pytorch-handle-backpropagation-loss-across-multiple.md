When training multiple neural networks jointly within PyTorch, a crucial understanding revolves around how gradients from a single loss function propagate backward to update the parameters of each network involved. Specifically, the mechanism relies on PyTorch's dynamic computation graph and the autograd system's ability to trace operations across these networks, even when their architectures and outputs are interconnected.

Essentially, PyTorch constructs a graph representing all performed tensor operations. During the forward pass, tensors flow through each network, resulting in intermediate outputs and eventually a loss value derived from those outputs, perhaps combined in some way. The autograd engine meticulously tracks these operations. When `.backward()` is called on the loss, the computational graph is traversed in reverse, accumulating gradients for each parameter involved in the computation. This process doesn’t arbitrarily apply gradients across networks but rather meticulously follows the connections established through the forward pass. If one network's output is an input to another, the gradient flow will follow that dependency. Critically, gradients are accumulated correctly across multiple networks that contribute to the single loss function. This is not automatic aggregation on all networks, but rather path-specific based on connected operations.

To illustrate this, I'll present three different scenarios involving two networks: one with a simple linear structure, and another with a convolutional layer, and how gradients propagate.

**Scenario 1: Sequential Forward Pass**

In this example, the output of `NetworkA`, which we shall call `LinearNet`, directly becomes the input for `NetworkB`, a Convolutional Network dubbed `ConvNet`. The loss is calculated based on the final output of `ConvNet`.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class LinearNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(LinearNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x


class ConvNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, output_channels):
        super(ConvNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(input_channels, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, output_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32 * 32 * output_channels, 10) #assuming 32x32 input after convolution

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x


# Instantiate networks
linear_net = LinearNet(10, 20, 32*32)
conv_net = ConvNet(1, 1)

# Loss and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer_a = optim.Adam(linear_net.parameters(), lr=0.001)
optimizer_b = optim.Adam(conv_net.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Generate dummy input
input_a = torch.randn(1, 10) # batch size of 1, 10 features
input_b = torch.randn(1, 1, 32, 32) # batch size of 1, 1 channel, 32x32

# Dummy target
target = torch.randint(0, 10, (1,))

# Zero grads
optimizer_a.zero_grad()
optimizer_b.zero_grad()


# Forward pass
output_a = linear_net(input_a)
output_b = conv_net(output_a.reshape(1,1,32,32)) # reshaped as required by the conv_net
loss = criterion(output_b, target)

# Backward pass
loss.backward()

# Update weights
optimizer_a.step()
optimizer_b.step()

print(f"Gradients computed for LinearNet parameters: {all(p.grad is not None for p in linear_net.parameters())}")
print(f"Gradients computed for ConvNet parameters: {all(p.grad is not None for p in conv_net.parameters())}")
```

In this scenario, the output of `linear_net` directly feeds into `conv_net`. The `.backward()` call on the calculated loss causes PyTorch to trace the graph backward, computing gradients for both `linear_net`’s parameters and `conv_net`’s parameters, since both participate in the computation of loss. The optimizers then update the network’s parameters based on the calculated gradients.  The fact that two optimizers, for `linear_net` and `conv_net` respectively, were instantiated is paramount. This highlights the need to manage parameter updates separately for different networks in multi-network scenarios.

**Scenario 2: Shared Input**

Here, both `LinearNet` and `ConvNet` process the same input, their outputs are combined using a simple summation, and this combined result is used to calculate the loss.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class LinearNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(LinearNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x


class ConvNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, output_channels):
        super(ConvNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(input_channels, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, output_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32 * 32 * output_channels, 10) #assuming 32x32 input after convolution

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Instantiate networks
linear_net = LinearNet(10, 20, 10)
conv_net = ConvNet(1, 1)

# Loss and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer_a = optim.Adam(linear_net.parameters(), lr=0.001)
optimizer_b = optim.Adam(conv_net.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Generate dummy input
input_a = torch.randn(1, 10)
input_b = torch.randn(1, 1, 32, 32) # dummy input to shape, not used in forwarding

# Dummy target
target = torch.randint(0, 10, (1,))


# Zero grads
optimizer_a.zero_grad()
optimizer_b.zero_grad()


# Forward pass
output_a = linear_net(input_a)
output_b = conv_net(input_b)
output_combined = output_a + output_b # Combine the two outputs

loss = criterion(output_combined, target)

# Backward pass
loss.backward()

# Update weights
optimizer_a.step()
optimizer_b.step()

print(f"Gradients computed for LinearNet parameters: {all(p.grad is not None for p in linear_net.parameters())}")
print(f"Gradients computed for ConvNet parameters: {all(p.grad is not None for p in conv_net.parameters())}")

```

In this case, the gradients backpropagate to both networks because the outputs are summed, and both output tensors contribute to the final loss. PyTorch correctly accumulates gradients across these separate paths and updates the parameters accordingly. Note that the fact that input_b is an unrelated tensor does not affect this behavior, the gradients are correctly computed. Again, separate optimizers are used.

**Scenario 3: Separate Losses**

In this scenario, each network produces an output, each output has a corresponding loss computed against a target, and a total loss is computed as the sum of both individual losses. This reflects a scenario where both networks are trained for different tasks but are connected in the optimization procedure.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class LinearNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(LinearNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x


class ConvNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_channels, output_channels):
        super(ConvNet, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(input_channels, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(16, output_channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32 * 32 * output_channels, 10) #assuming 32x32 input after convolution

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x


# Instantiate networks
linear_net = LinearNet(10, 20, 10)
conv_net = ConvNet(1, 1)

# Loss and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer_a = optim.Adam(linear_net.parameters(), lr=0.001)
optimizer_b = optim.Adam(conv_net.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Generate dummy input
input_a = torch.randn(1, 10)
input_b = torch.randn(1, 1, 32, 32)

# Dummy target
target_a = torch.randint(0, 10, (1,))
target_b = torch.randint(0, 10, (1,))


# Zero grads
optimizer_a.zero_grad()
optimizer_b.zero_grad()


# Forward pass
output_a = linear_net(input_a)
output_b = conv_net(input_b)


loss_a = criterion(output_a, target_a)
loss_b = criterion(output_b, target_b)
loss = loss_a + loss_b

# Backward pass
loss.backward()

# Update weights
optimizer_a.step()
optimizer_b.step()

print(f"Gradients computed for LinearNet parameters: {all(p.grad is not None for p in linear_net.parameters())}")
print(f"Gradients computed for ConvNet parameters: {all(p.grad is not None for p in conv_net.parameters())}")
```

Here, `loss_a` affects only parameters in `linear_net`, and `loss_b` affects only the parameters in `conv_net`.  The addition of the losses propagates the gradient backward to each of the relevant networks according to their specific contributions. Again, each network requires its own optimizer to update the weights specific to its parameters.

These examples illustrate that PyTorch’s autograd system seamlessly handles backpropagation across multiple neural networks by dynamically constructing a graph of operations. It ensures that gradients are computed correctly and propagated back through each of these networks based on their direct or indirect participation in the computation of the loss, whether the networks are sequentially connected, share inputs, or have separate losses that are combined. The key to successful training is ensuring that each participating network has its own dedicated optimizer.

For further study, I recommend exploring resources that delve into PyTorch's core concepts of automatic differentiation and computational graphs. Specifically, examine documentation and tutorials focusing on `torch.autograd`, and the functionalities of `loss.backward()`, `optimizer.zero_grad()`, and `optimizer.step()`. Resources that explain concepts like "gradient accumulation" and "parameter management" in complex models, particularly multi-task scenarios, would provide additional insight. Understanding these core concepts will provide the foundation for successfully implementing complex multi-network architectures.
