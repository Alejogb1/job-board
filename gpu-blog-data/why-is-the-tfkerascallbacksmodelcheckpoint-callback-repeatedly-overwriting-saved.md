ModelCheckpoint's behavior of repeatedly overwriting saved models, even when configured for per-epoch saving, often stems from a misunderstanding of its interaction with the `filepath` parameter and the default filename structure when `save_best_only` is `False`. This issue commonly surfaces when individuals expect each epoch to produce a unique file without explicitly specifying a variable in the `filepath` string that uniquely identifies each training iteration.

The core mechanism of `ModelCheckpoint` revolves around monitoring a specific metric during training. Depending on the setting of `save_best_only`, the callback either saves the model weights at the end of each epoch *or* only when the monitored metric improves. Importantly, the filename for the saved model is derived directly from the `filepath` argument. When a single, static filepath is provided, the callback repeatedly saves to this exact location, effectively overwriting the previous model save.

Let’s consider a scenario I encountered while developing a convolutional neural network for image classification. I initially set up my `ModelCheckpoint` like so, expecting a different model file per epoch:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

filepath = "my_model.h5"
checkpoint = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath=filepath,
    save_weights_only=False,
    monitor='val_loss',
    save_best_only=False,
    save_freq='epoch'
)

# Assume model and training data are defined elsewhere.
# model.fit(..., callbacks=[checkpoint])
```

In this code, I defined `filepath` as "my_model.h5". Despite the configuration designed to save after each epoch (`save_freq='epoch'`), each time the callback triggered, it saved the model to "my_model.h5", effectively erasing the previous save. I confirmed that the `save_freq` was correctly set, which meant the issue was not in how often saving occured, but rather the filename. I naively assumed that because `save_freq` was configured for each epoch, the callback would handle name generation.

To resolve this issue, I needed to modify the `filepath` string to dynamically include the epoch number. Keras provides a placeholder mechanism using curly braces `{}` for this purpose. By including `{epoch}` in the `filepath`, the callback will replace this placeholder with the actual epoch number during saving. I modified my code as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

filepath = "my_model_epoch_{epoch}.h5"
checkpoint = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath=filepath,
    save_weights_only=False,
    monitor='val_loss',
    save_best_only=False,
    save_freq='epoch'
)

# Assume model and training data are defined elsewhere.
# model.fit(..., callbacks=[checkpoint])
```

With this revised code, the callback now saves model files named "my_model_epoch_1.h5", "my_model_epoch_2.h5", and so on, correctly creating distinct files for each epoch. The `filepath` became a template to construct the desired file output. The use of placeholders extends beyond just `{epoch}`; other placeholders like `{batch}` and monitored metric values can be used to construct filename strings according to the needs of one’s project. This enables more precise save naming for analysis during post-training processes, especially when dealing with numerous runs.

Another scenario where overwriting might occur even with epoch numbers is if `save_best_only` is set to `True`, and the monitored metric does not improve for multiple epochs. In this case, the callback *will not* save the model during those epochs, and it will reuse the last known best model’s filename when a new better metric is reached. If one is not explicitly using placeholders, this could still result in an overwriting situation. Furthermore, with the default `save_best_only=False` this situation would just overwrite without a problem, as the filename is not dynamic. I have personally seen this lead to confusion during analysis of model runs. To demonstrate, consider the following snippet where I include the `val_loss` in the filename:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

filepath = "my_model_val_loss_{val_loss:.4f}_epoch_{epoch}.h5"
checkpoint = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
    filepath=filepath,
    save_weights_only=False,
    monitor='val_loss',
    save_best_only=True,
    save_freq='epoch'
)

# Assume model and training data are defined elsewhere.
# model.fit(..., callbacks=[checkpoint])
```

In this case, I used a more precise floating-point representation for the monitored metric in the filename. If the validation loss is, for example, not improving sufficiently with each epoch, multiple files may have the same val_loss prefix. While the epoch will be appended, the val_loss component of the filename gives greater clarity to the model's performance during that particular save. Using the correct placeholders can often resolve most unexpected behavior arising from `ModelCheckpoint`, particularly when it is coupled with `save_best_only = True`.

To summarize, the common problem of overwriting with `tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` boils down to insufficient dynamism in the `filepath` argument when `save_best_only` is set to `False`. Explicitly including placeholders like `{epoch}` and `{val_loss}` (along with correct formatting of floating-point values) is crucial for saving uniquely named model files at each epoch or when a monitored metric improves. `save_best_only=True`, while convenient for keeping only the best model, will not save a model file if a metric does not improve for multiple epochs, and if the `filepath` is not dynamic, then the overwriting issue will present itself. The user is responsible for properly structuring the filename using placeholders to avoid losing data.

For additional insights, I recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint`. Also, consult examples of implementation on tutorial websites focused on practical applications of deep learning. Examining use cases with customized training loops, not just the standard `model.fit` implementation, can shed light on the callback's inner workings in more nuanced scenarios. Furthermore, research into best practices for model management in larger-scale deep learning projects should be considered to further refine use of checkpointing procedures. These resources, while not specific code solutions, offer invaluable context and will increase understanding and effective implementation.
