The core issue in computing gradients for non-trainable variables in TensorFlow eager execution lies in the automatic differentiation mechanism's reliance on the `trainable` attribute.  While TensorFlow's `GradientTape` effortlessly handles gradients for trainable variables,  it requires a more nuanced approach when dealing with variables explicitly marked as non-trainable.  This stems from the optimization process:  gradients are calculated and applied *only* to trainable variables during the model's training phase.  My experience debugging complex reinforcement learning models, particularly those involving separate policy and value networks with shared parameters, underscored this constraint.

**1. Clear Explanation**

TensorFlow's `tf.GradientTape` utilizes the `watch()` method to explicitly track the variables whose gradients will be computed.  Simply put, if a variable isn't watched, its gradient won't be calculated even if it participates in the computation graph. For non-trainable variables, this is crucial because they are, by definition, excluded from the automatic tracking mechanism. The `watch()` function provides the necessary bypass, explicitly instructing the `GradientTape` to record the operations involving these variables.  This allows us to compute gradients for any variable, regardless of its `trainable` status.  However, it's important to remember that these gradients are solely for informational purposes; they won't be automatically applied during optimization.  One needs explicit update mechanisms to incorporate these gradients if needed.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Basic Gradient Calculation for a Non-Trainable Variable**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a non-trainable variable
x = tf.Variable(3.0, trainable=False)
y = tf.Variable(2.0, trainable=True)

# Define a simple function
def my_function(a, b):
  return a * b

# Use GradientTape to compute gradients
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  tape.watch(x) # Explicitly watch x
  z = my_function(x, y)

# Compute the gradients
dz_dx = tape.gradient(z, x)
dz_dy = tape.gradient(z, y)

# Print the gradients
print(f"dz/dx: {dz_dx}") # Output: dz/dx: 2.0
print(f"dz/dy: {dz_dy}") # Output: dz/dy: 3.0
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental usage of `tape.watch()`. Even though `x` is not trainable, by explicitly watching it, we can successfully compute its gradient.  Note that `y`, being trainable, doesn't require explicit watching.

**Example 2:  Gradient Calculation with Multiple Non-Trainable Variables and a Custom Loss Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define non-trainable variables
a = tf.Variable(1.0, trainable=False)
b = tf.Variable(2.0, trainable=False)
c = tf.Variable(3.0, trainable=True)

# Define a custom loss function
def loss_function(a, b, c):
    return tf.square(a + b - c)

# Use GradientTape
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch([a, b]) # Watch multiple non-trainable variables
    loss = loss_function(a, b, c)

# Compute gradients
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [a, b, c])

# Print the gradients
print(f"Gradient w.r.t. a: {gradients[0]}")
print(f"Gradient w.r.t. b: {gradients[1]}")
print(f"Gradient w.r.t. c: {gradients[2]}")

```

This example showcases the flexibility of `tape.watch()` by handling multiple non-trainable variables. The custom loss function further illustrates practical applications.  The output will reflect the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to a, b, and c.


**Example 3:  Handling Gradient Computation within a Custom Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self, non_trainable_weight):
    super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
    self.non_trainable_weight = tf.Variable(non_trainable_weight, trainable=False)
    self.trainable_weight = tf.Variable(1.0, trainable=True)


  def call(self, inputs):
    return inputs * self.non_trainable_weight + self.trainable_weight

# Instantiate the custom layer
layer = CustomLayer(non_trainable_weight=2.0)

# Input tensor
inputs = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Compute gradients using GradientTape
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    tape.watch(layer.non_trainable_weight)
    outputs = layer(inputs)

gradients = tape.gradient(outputs, [layer.non_trainable_weight, layer.trainable_weight])

print(f"Gradient w.r.t. non-trainable weight: {gradients[0]}")
print(f"Gradient w.r.t. trainable weight: {gradients[1]}")
```

This example integrates the gradient computation for a non-trainable variable within a custom Keras layer.  This is common in scenarios requiring specialized computations where the non-trainable variable represents a learned or pre-computed parameter.  Again, `tape.watch()` is essential to enable gradient calculation for the non-trainable weight.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on `tf.GradientTape` and eager execution, are invaluable.  Furthermore, a solid grasp of calculus, especially partial derivatives, is crucial for interpreting the computed gradients correctly.  Exploring resources on automatic differentiation would further enhance understanding of the underlying mechanisms.  Reviewing examples from TensorFlow tutorials focusing on custom layers and loss functions will solidify your knowledge and provide practical applications.  Finally, working through several independent gradient computation exercises will help internalize the concepts.
