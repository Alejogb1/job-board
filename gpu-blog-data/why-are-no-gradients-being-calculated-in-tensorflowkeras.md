The absence of gradient calculations in TensorFlow/Keras typically stems from a misconfiguration within the model's architecture or training process, often related to the improper use of layers, custom training loops, or tape recording mechanisms.  My experience debugging similar issues across various projects, including a large-scale image recognition system and a time-series forecasting model, points towards several common culprits.

**1.  Tape Recording and `tf.GradientTape` Misuse:**

TensorFlow relies on automatic differentiation through the use of `tf.GradientTape`. This context manager records operations performed within its scope, allowing for the subsequent calculation of gradients. The most prevalent reason for failing gradient calculations is incorrect usage or a lack of `tf.GradientTape`.  The tape must encompass all operations involved in the forward pass of your model, from the input to the loss function.  Failure to do so results in an empty gradient.  Furthermore, the tape's resources must be managed carefully; forgetting to call `tape.gradient()` after recording will leave gradients uncalculated.  I've personally encountered this issue multiple times, particularly when refactoring existing code or implementing custom training loops.  Ensure the tape is properly opened, all relevant operations occur within its scope, and gradients are explicitly calculated using `tape.gradient()`.  Improper nesting of tapes can also lead to unexpected behaviour, usually requiring careful examination of the recording process.

**2.  Layer Configuration and Automatic Differentiation Compatibility:**

Certain layers or operations might not be automatically differentiable.  While TensorFlow supports a vast range of operations, custom layers or those employing operations not inherently differentiable (e.g.,  certain control flow operations without proper gradient registration) will necessitate manual gradient calculation.   This frequently occurs when incorporating external libraries or implementing highly specialized layers.  In one project involving a physics simulation integrated into a neural network, I had to manually derive and implement gradients for a custom layer simulating fluid dynamics because the underlying physics engine wasn't automatically differentiable.  Review your model's layers; verify that they are compatible with automatic differentiation.  Consult the documentation for any custom or less common layers you are using.  If necessary, consider implementing custom gradient functions using `tf.custom_gradient`.

**3.  Incorrect Loss Function and Optimizer Configuration:**

An improperly defined loss function or optimizer can impede gradient calculation.  A non-differentiable loss function, for example, will prevent the calculation of gradients. Similarly, incorrect configuration of the optimizer (e.g.,  incorrect learning rate, missing or inappropriate optimizer parameters) can lead to numerical instability or prevent gradients from being properly applied during the optimization process.  I once spent considerable time troubleshooting a model where the loss function contained a non-differentiable element, disguised as a seemingly innocuous conditional statement.  Thoroughly scrutinize your loss function for any such hidden non-differentiable components.  Ensure the optimizer is appropriately configured for your model's architecture and loss function.  Experimenting with different optimizers (Adam, SGD, RMSprop) might highlight issues with optimizer compatibility.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Usage of `tf.GradientTape`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(10):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:  #Crucial: Tape records operations within this block
        inputs = tf.random.normal((32, 10))
        targets = tf.random.normal((32, 1))
        predictions = model(inputs)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(predictions - targets)) #Mean Squared Error

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables) #Compute gradients
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables)) #Apply gradients
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")
```

This example demonstrates the correct use of `tf.GradientTape` to record operations and compute gradients.  The `tape.gradient()` function efficiently calculates gradients with respect to the trainable variables. The `apply_gradients` method then updates the model's weights.

**Example 2: Handling a Custom Layer Requiring Manual Gradient Calculation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.custom_gradient
def my_custom_layer(x):
    y = tf.math.sin(x) # Example custom operation

    def grad(dy):
        return dy * tf.math.cos(x) #Manual gradient calculation for sin(x)

    return y, grad


model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    lambda x: my_custom_layer(x), # Incorporating custom layer
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# ... (Rest of the training loop remains similar to Example 1)
```

Here, a custom layer `my_custom_layer` is defined, requiring explicit gradient calculation using `tf.custom_gradient`.  The `grad` function provides the gradient for backpropagation. This approach is necessary when dealing with operations that don't have automatic differentiation support.

**Example 3:  Debugging a Non-Differentiable Loss Function:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Problematic Loss Function (contains a non-differentiable element)
def problematic_loss(predictions, targets):
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(predictions - targets)) # L1 loss, differentiable
    # Introduces a non-differentiable element.  This is illustrative, not best practice!
    loss += tf.cast(tf.math.greater(tf.reduce_mean(predictions), 0.5), tf.float32)
    return loss


# ... (Model definition remains unchanged)
# Training Loop (modified to utilize the problematic loss)
for epoch in range(10):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        # ... (Input data and predictions remain the same)
        loss = problematic_loss(predictions, targets)

    try:
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        #... (Gradient application and output remain the same)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Gradient calculation failed: {e}")
        break

```

This example highlights a common issue â€“ a non-differentiable component within the loss function. The `tf.cast(tf.math.greater(...), tf.float32)` introduces a non-differentiable step function.  The `try-except` block helps identify failures in gradient calculations due to such non-differentiable components.  The use of absolute value as part of L1 loss here, in isolation, is fine. The crucial problem is the inclusion of the indicator function. This code demonstrates how to detect failure, but more importantly points out the flaw in design.

**Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on `tf.GradientTape` and custom gradients.  The official TensorFlow tutorials and examples provide further practical insights.  Explore advanced topics such as automatic differentiation, and delve into the inner workings of various optimizers.  Reviewing relevant research papers on automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization techniques will broaden your understanding.


By systematically examining these aspects of your TensorFlow/Keras model and training process, you can effectively troubleshoot the absence of gradient calculations. Remember that careful attention to detail is crucial in this context, as subtle errors can significantly impede the training process.
