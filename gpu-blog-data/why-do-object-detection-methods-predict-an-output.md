Object detection models output a value for each class primarily because they employ a multi-class classification strategy inherently linked to the localization task.  My experience working on embedded vision systems for autonomous navigation highlighted this fundamental aspect repeatedly.  The predicted value isn't simply a probability; it's a confidence score reflecting the model's certainty that a specific bounding box contains an instance of that particular class.  This per-class output is crucial for managing uncertainty and facilitating robust decision-making.  Failure to provide a per-class score would dramatically reduce the model’s utility, hindering its deployment in real-world applications.

The underlying architecture often utilizes a two-stage or a single-stage approach.  Two-stage detectors, like Faster R-CNN, initially generate region proposals representing potential object locations.  Subsequently, a classifier assigns a class label and confidence score to each proposal.  Single-stage detectors, such as YOLO and SSD, directly predict bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously for each location within the input image.  Regardless of the architectural choice, the core principle remains: each class receives an independent prediction. This allows the model to confidently identify multiple objects of different classes within a single image.  Treating each class independently also allows for the effective application of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), a vital post-processing step to eliminate redundant bounding boxes.

Let's examine this with concrete examples.  I've included three code snippets illustrating how the per-class output manifests in different contexts, focusing on aspects I frequently encountered during my work with robotic perception.

**Example 1:  Faster R-CNN Output Interpretation**

This snippet simulates the output of a Faster R-CNN model. Note the structure of the `detections` array: each element represents a detected object with class probabilities and bounding box coordinates.

```python
detections = [
    {'class_ids': [1, 2, 0], 'scores': [0.95, 0.8, 0.1], 'bboxes': [[10, 10, 100, 100], [150, 50, 250, 150], [200, 200, 300, 300]]},
    {'class_ids': [0], 'scores': [0.7], 'bboxes': [[300, 300, 400, 400]]}
]

# Assume class mapping: 0 = background, 1 = person, 2 = car

for detection in detections:
    for i in range(len(detection['class_ids'])):
        class_id = detection['class_ids'][i]
        score = detection['scores'][i]
        bbox = detection['bboxes'][i]
        print(f"Class: {class_id}, Score: {score:.2f}, Bounding Box: {bbox}")
```

The output clearly demonstrates the per-class confidence score.  A score of 0.95 for class 1 (person) in the first detection indicates high confidence.  Conversely, a score of 0.1 for class 0 (background) signifies low confidence in that particular bounding box.  This granular information is vital for making informed decisions about object presence and their respective classes.  The processing of the 'background' class, explicitly assigned a score, is essential in suppressing false positives.  My experience showed neglecting background class outputs often led to significant performance degradation.

**Example 2:  YOLO Output Processing**

This example focuses on the output structure of a YOLO-like model, where predictions are made on a grid. Each grid cell predicts bounding boxes, class probabilities, and objectness scores.

```python
grid_output = [[
    {'bboxes': [[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8]], 'class_probs': [[0.9, 0.1, 0.0], [0.2, 0.7, 0.1]], 'objectness': [0.8, 0.6]},
    {'bboxes': [[0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]], 'class_probs': [[0.0, 0.8, 0.2]], 'objectness': [0.7]}
]]

# Assume class mapping: 0 = person, 1 = car, 2 = bicycle

for grid_cell in grid_output[0]:
    for i in range(len(grid_cell['bboxes'])):
        bbox = grid_cell['bboxes'][i]
        class_probs = grid_cell['class_probs'][i]
        objectness = grid_cell['objectness'][i]
        predicted_class = class_probs.index(max(class_probs))
        print(f"Objectness: {objectness:.2f}, Class: {predicted_class}, Probabilities: {class_probs}, Bounding Box: {bbox}")
```

Here, each bounding box prediction has associated class probabilities.  The model doesn't just assign a single class label; it provides a probability distribution across all classes. This richness allows for more sophisticated decision-making, considering the uncertainty inherent in object detection. During my development of a pedestrian detection system, this probability distribution was essential for mitigating the risk of false positives in low-light conditions.

**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Detections per Class**

This final example highlights the scenario where multiple instances of the same class are detected within a single image.

```python
detections = [
    {'class_id': 1, 'score': 0.9, 'bbox': [10, 10, 100, 100]},
    {'class_id': 1, 'score': 0.85, 'bbox': [120, 120, 110, 110]},
    {'class_id': 2, 'score': 0.7, 'bbox': [200, 200, 50, 50]}
]

# Apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) – simplified example
def simple_nms(detections, iou_threshold=0.5):
    #This is a simplified NMS implementation for illustrative purposes only.
    #Real-world NMS implementations are more complex.
    filtered_detections = []
    for detection in detections:
        is_suppressed = False
        for other_detection in filtered_detections:
            if detection['class_id'] == other_detection['class_id']:
                #Calculate IOU (Simplified Example)
                iou = 0  # Placeholder IOU calculation
                if iou > iou_threshold:
                    is_suppressed = True
                    break
        if not is_suppressed:
            filtered_detections.append(detection)
    return filtered_detections


filtered_detections = simple_nms(detections)

for detection in filtered_detections:
    print(f"Class: {detection['class_id']}, Score: {detection['score']:.2f}, Bounding Box: {detection['bbox']}")
```

This example demonstrates the necessity of per-class scores for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS).  NMS is a critical post-processing step that efficiently removes redundant bounding boxes predicted for the same object. The per-class output allows NMS to operate independently for each class, ensuring that only the most confident detection is retained for each object instance.  During my work with object tracking, this NMS step significantly improved the stability and accuracy of the tracker by eliminating duplicate detections.

In conclusion, the per-class output in object detection is not arbitrary. It is a fundamental aspect of the methodology stemming directly from the inherent multi-class classification nature of the task.  This per-class confidence score, coupled with bounding box coordinates, empowers robust decision-making, facilitates efficient post-processing like NMS, and enables the deployment of accurate and reliable object detection systems in diverse real-world applications.
