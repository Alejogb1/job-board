The unexpected behavior of `tf.reshape` not returning `None` for the first element, even when the reshaping operation would logically result in a dimension of size zero, often stems from a misunderstanding of how TensorFlow handles empty tensors and broadcasting.  In my experience debugging large-scale TensorFlow models, particularly those involving dynamic input shapes and conditional operations, this has proven a frequent source of subtle bugs.  The key is recognizing that `tf.reshape` doesn't inherently *check* for the validity of the target shape against the input tensor's size; it performs the operation based on the provided shape, potentially leading to unexpected outputs, including seemingly nonsensical values for empty dimensions.


**1.  Explanation of Behavior**

TensorFlow's `tf.reshape` operates under the principle of flattening and reshaping. It first flattens the input tensor into a 1D array and then rearranges the elements according to the new shape specified.  The crucial aspect is that the total number of elements must remain consistent. If the specified shape is incompatible with the number of elements in the input, an error will be raised, usually a `tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError`.  However, the function doesn't explicitly check for cases where a dimension is zero *before* the reshaping process.

Consider this scenario: you have a tensor `a` with shape (2, 0) – two rows, zero columns.  Logically, it's an empty tensor.  If you attempt to reshape it to (0, 2), you might expect `None` or an empty tensor as the result.  Instead, TensorFlow will proceed with the reshape operation.  Since there are zero elements, the reshaping is effectively a no-op; it doesn’t produce an error, but it also doesn't magically fill the zero-sized dimension with something like `None`. The resulting tensor will retain its zero-sized dimension.

This behavior is consistent with how TensorFlow handles broadcasting and empty tensors.  Operations on empty tensors are typically defined to result in empty tensors of the appropriate shape, not `None`.  The presence of the zero dimension signifies the absence of data, not a null value or the absence of a dimension entirely.  `None` in Python, while often used to represent the absence of a value, is not directly analogous to a dimension of size zero in a TensorFlow tensor.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Reshaping an empty tensor**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.zeros((2, 0), dtype=tf.float32)  # Create an empty tensor
print(f"Original shape: {a.shape}")
b = tf.reshape(a, (0, 2))  # Reshape to (0, 2)
print(f"Reshaped shape: {b.shape}")
print(f"Reshaped tensor: {b}")
```

Output:

```
Original shape: (2, 0)
Reshaped shape: (0, 2)
Reshaped tensor: tf.Tensor([], shape=(0, 2), dtype=float32)
```

Here, we explicitly create an empty tensor. The reshape operation doesn't produce an error, resulting in an empty tensor of the new shape.  Note that the output is not `None` but an empty tensor explicitly showing the shape (0,2).

**Example 2:  Reshaping with a zero-sized dimension in the middle**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=tf.float32)
print(f"Original shape: {a.shape}")
b = tf.reshape(a, (2, 0, 3))  # Inserting a zero-dimension
print(f"Reshaped shape: {b.shape}")
try:
    print(f"Reshaped tensor: {b}") #Attempting to print would result in an error.
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Output:

```
Original shape: (2, 3)
Reshaped shape: (2, 0, 3)
Error: Cannot convert a symbolic Tensor to a NumPy array.
```

This demonstrates that attempting to insert a zero-dimension within the tensor that breaks the total element count will, in many cases, be impossible. This will result in a runtime error. Attempting to print the resulting tensor will fail, as the tensor has no valid values.


**Example 3: Conditional reshaping based on input size**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def conditional_reshape(input_tensor):
  shape = tf.shape(input_tensor)
  rows = shape[0]
  cols = shape[1]
  new_shape = tf.cond(tf.equal(cols, 0), lambda: (rows, 0), lambda: (cols, rows))
  return tf.reshape(input_tensor, new_shape)

a = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.zeros((2, 0), dtype=tf.float32)
print(f"Reshape a: {conditional_reshape(a).shape}")
print(f"Reshape b: {conditional_reshape(b).shape}")

```

Output:

```
Reshape a: (3, 2)
Reshape b: (2, 0)
```

This example showcases a more robust approach.  Instead of blindly reshaping, we conditionally determine the new shape based on the input tensor's dimensions, handling the case of zero-sized dimensions explicitly.  This prevents unexpected behavior and ensures that the reshape operation is only performed when it is valid.  This illustrates a more defensive programming style to address potential issues with unexpected input shapes and prevent the erroneous creation of an otherwise logically-inconsistent tensor.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on tensor manipulation and shape manipulation, provides in-depth information about `tf.reshape`'s behavior and other relevant functions. I also recommend consulting advanced TensorFlow tutorials and books focused on building and debugging complex models involving dynamic shapes and control flow.  Finally, reviewing the source code for relevant TensorFlow operations (if comfortable with C++) can provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.  Understanding the nuances of tensor broadcasting and how it interacts with empty tensors is crucial.   Careful consideration of your input data and output expectations will greatly improve the robustness of your TensorFlow code.
