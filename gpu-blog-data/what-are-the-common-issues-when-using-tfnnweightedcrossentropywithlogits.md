The core challenge with `tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits` stems from the often-misunderstood interaction between the `weights` parameter and the inherent properties of the logits and labels.  I've spent considerable time debugging models leveraging this function, primarily during my work on a multi-class image classification project involving imbalanced datasets, and have identified several recurring pitfalls.  These primarily revolve around improper weight specification, handling of numerical instability, and the subtle influence on the gradient calculation.

**1.  Clear Explanation of Potential Issues:**

The function `tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits` computes a weighted cross-entropy loss.  The crucial point is that this weighting applies *per-class* and not per-example.  This is a critical distinction.  A common mistake is to misinterpret the `weights` argument as a sample-wise weighting mechanism.  Instead, it should reflect the relative importance of correctly classifying each class in your output space.  The size of the `weights` tensor must precisely match the number of classes.  For a binary classification problem, it's a vector of length 2; for a 10-class problem, it's a vector of length 10.  Each element corresponds to the weight applied to the cross-entropy loss for that specific class.

Furthermore, inappropriate weight assignments can lead to numerical instability.  Extremely large weight values for certain classes can cause gradients to explode during training, leading to `NaN` values and model divergence. Conversely, weights that are too small for under-represented classes can prevent the model from learning effectively about those classes.  A balanced approach is crucial, and often requires careful empirical tuning.

Another frequently overlooked aspect is the impact on the gradient calculation.  The weighted cross-entropy loss modifies the gradients calculated during backpropagation.  This can affect the learning dynamics and potentially lead to slower convergence or suboptimal solutions if the weights aren't chosen carefully or in alignment with your data's characteristics.  The weighting skews the optimization process, emphasizing the reduction of error for higher-weighted classes.

Finally, the logits provided to the function must be unnormalized scores.  Providing probabilities directly will lead to incorrect results.  These logits are typically the output of a dense layer without a final activation function (such as sigmoid or softmax).  The function internally applies the appropriate sigmoid or softmax operations depending on the number of classes in the label tensor.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Binary Classification with Class Weighting**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define weights for positive and negative classes
class_weights = tf.constant([0.9, 0.1]) #Higher weight for the positive class

# Example logits and labels (assume shape [batch_size, 1])
logits = tf.constant([[2.0], [-1.0], [1.5], [-2.5]])
labels = tf.constant([[1.0], [0.0], [1.0], [0.0]])

# Calculate weighted cross-entropy loss
loss = tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=logits, pos_weight=class_weights[1]/class_weights[0]) # Note the pos_weight calculation!

# Calculate the mean loss over the batch
mean_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss)

print(f"Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss: {mean_loss.numpy()}")
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a binary classification scenario where the positive class is significantly under-represented. The `pos_weight` parameter is calculated as the ratio of the negative class weight to the positive class weight and directly provides the weight associated with the positive class, which is how `tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits` expects it for binary classification. It effectively upweights the loss for the positive class during training.


**Example 2: Multi-Class Classification with Custom Weights**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define weights for each of the 3 classes
class_weights = tf.constant([0.2, 0.5, 0.3])

# Example logits (shape [batch_size, 3]) and one-hot encoded labels (shape [batch_size, 3])
logits = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 0.5], [0.2, 0.8, 1.5], [2.5, 0.1, 0.9]])
labels = tf.constant([[0.0, 1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]])

# Calculate weighted cross-entropy loss
loss = tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=logits, pos_weight=class_weights)

# Calculate the mean loss over the batch
mean_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss)

print(f"Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss: {mean_loss.numpy()}")
```

*Commentary:* This showcases multi-class classification with custom class weights.  Note how `class_weights` is a vector of length 3, one for each class. This demonstrates flexibility in assigning different weights to control the contribution of each class to the overall loss function.


**Example 3: Handling Numerical Instability**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define weights (introducing a potentially problematic large weight)
class_weights = tf.constant([1.0, 1000.0, 1.0])

# Example logits and labels
logits = tf.constant([[0.1, 0.2, 0.7], [0.8, 0.1, 0.1], [0.2, 0.6, 0.2]])
labels = tf.constant([[0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]])

#Adding clip operation to handle potential instability
clipped_logits = tf.clip_by_value(logits, -10, 10) #preventing extremely large or small logits

loss = tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=clipped_logits, pos_weight=class_weights)
mean_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss)
print(f"Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss: {mean_loss.numpy()}")
```

*Commentary:* This example highlights a potential instability issue caused by a very high weight for one class. The `tf.clip_by_value` function demonstrates a practical approach to mitigating this.  Clipping prevents extremely large or small values in the logits, reducing the chance of gradient explosion.  Careful consideration of weight scaling and potential clipping strategies is essential for stable training.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive details on the `tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_logits` function.  Examine the sections on loss functions and gradient calculations within the official TensorFlow documentation.  Furthermore, consult reputable machine learning textbooks and research papers focused on class imbalance issues and cost-sensitive learning.  Reviewing examples of imbalanced dataset handling in the context of deep learning would be beneficial.  Finally, explore articles and tutorials specifically addressing numerical stability in deep learning model training.
