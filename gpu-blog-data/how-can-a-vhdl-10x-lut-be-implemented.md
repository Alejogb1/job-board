Implementing a 10^x Lookup Table (LUT) in VHDL using a `select` statement, while conceptually straightforward, quickly becomes unwieldy for practical x values exceeding a small integer. The core challenge stems from the exponential growth of the table itself; for an input 'x' ranging from 0 to, say, 3, you would need to explicitly enumerate 10^0, 10^1, 10^2, and 10^3 entries in your select statement. This approach becomes unsustainable with even moderately sized inputs, highlighting the need for alternative design strategies. However, the direct implementation provides valuable insight into understanding the mechanics of a LUT and select statements.

A `select` statement in VHDL operates on an input signal, and based on its value, assigns a corresponding output. For our 10^x LUT, 'x' would serve as the input signal and 10^x would be the output. This relationship is defined within a `when` clause for each possible value of 'x'. Given the inherent limitation that VHDL requires complete enumeration of all possible values in a `select` statement when dealing with enumeration types, we'll focus on integer inputs. For small integer ranges, this is quite doable.

First, consider a basic example where x is an integer ranging from 0 to 2. We would need to calculate 10^0, 10^1, and 10^2.

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity ten_to_the_x_lut is
  port (
    x : in integer range 0 to 2;
    result : out integer
  );
end entity ten_to_the_x_lut;

architecture behavioral of ten_to_the_x_lut is
begin
  process (x)
  begin
    case x is
      when 0 =>
        result <= 1; -- 10^0
      when 1 =>
        result <= 10; -- 10^1
      when 2 =>
        result <= 100; -- 10^2
      when others =>
        result <= 0; -- Default case
    end case;
  end process;
end architecture behavioral;

```

Here, a `case` statement is used rather than a `select` because the latter requires a specific format that doesn’t match our use case. The `process(x)` statement indicates that the code within the `process` is executed whenever the input `x` changes. This ensures that the output `result` is always up-to-date. Within the `process` the `case` statement evaluates the value of `x`. If `x` is 0, then `result` is set to 1, if it's 1 `result` becomes 10 and when x is 2 `result` becomes 100. The 'others' case provides a default output of 0 which could be considered an error condition. The use of a `case` statement here mirrors the functionality of a `select` statement, but offers a slightly more flexible syntax when dealing with integer ranges.

Expanding on the prior example, suppose `x` is now in the range 0 to 3. The code will grow accordingly:

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity ten_to_the_x_lut_extended is
  port (
    x : in integer range 0 to 3;
    result : out integer
  );
end entity ten_to_the_x_lut_extended;

architecture behavioral of ten_to_the_x_lut_extended is
begin
  process (x)
  begin
    case x is
      when 0 =>
        result <= 1; -- 10^0
      when 1 =>
        result <= 10; -- 10^1
      when 2 =>
        result <= 100; -- 10^2
      when 3 =>
        result <= 1000; -- 10^3
      when others =>
        result <= 0;
    end case;
  end process;
end architecture behavioral;
```
This example directly shows the exponential growth of the code as the possible inputs of x increase, each increment requiring a new `when` clause. This demonstrates the practical limitations of this approach when dealing with larger or variable ranges. The underlying mechanics of LUTs are evident here: each input (x) has a corresponding pre-calculated output (10^x), which is directly assigned.

Now let’s move on to something that might be closer to a real-world scenario. Consider we want to represent x in a wider range, but we don't need every value in between. Instead of a full LUT, we can use the `select` statement (or the case, as we’ve used here for clarity) to implement different scaling factors for specific values of `x`, for instance, a simplified approximation. If we need values 10^0, 10^2 and 10^5 and a default value for the remainder of the integer range:

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity approximated_ten_to_the_x is
    port (
        x      : in  integer;
        result : out integer
    );
end entity approximated_ten_to_the_x;

architecture behavioral of approximated_ten_to_the_x is
begin
  process (x)
  begin
    case x is
      when 0 =>
        result <= 1; -- 10^0
      when 2 =>
        result <= 100; -- 10^2
      when 5 =>
        result <= 100000; --10^5
        when others =>
        result <= 0;
    end case;
  end process;
end architecture behavioral;
```
Here, the `x` input is an integer without a range, which means that it can take any integer value. We only need to map specific values of `x`, i.e., 0, 2, and 5. The `others` case is set to zero as a default condition, which serves as a mechanism to catch out-of-range inputs that we don’t explicitly define. This could be an invalid value or a condition that requires handling in a different manner in a real-world design.

These examples illustrate the fundamental principle of using select statements (or case statements) to realize LUT functionality, even for non-continuous input ranges. However, the exponential nature of the 10^x function renders a direct, enumerated lookup table impractical for all but the simplest cases. For larger input ranges, more efficient techniques, such as using a ROM (Read Only Memory) initialized with the desired table or utilizing a mathematical algorithm that can be synthesised in hardware, become necessary. Hardware synthesis tools often provide libraries or mechanisms to efficiently implement these alternative methods.

For further understanding of these alternative approaches, focusing on literature regarding ROM implementations for lookup tables, algorithmic logic synthesis for custom functions, and VHDL coding best practices for combinational logic is recommended. Exploring publications on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) design, specifically on resource utilization optimization, would also provide valuable insight into hardware efficient design principles. Standard VHDL text books and design guides, coupled with an understanding of digital design fundamentals, are essential for mastering these concepts.
