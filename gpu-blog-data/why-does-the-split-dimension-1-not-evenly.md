The confusion arises from a misunderstanding of how data is partitioned during parallel processing, specifically with respect to ‘splits’ and ‘dimensions.’ The dimension parameter (set to 1 in your scenario) specifies the axis along which data is to be split, not the number of resulting partitions. The number of splits (4) defines the *target* level of parallelism, which is not always directly achievable due to various factors concerning the dataset's structure and the specific splitting algorithm implemented. Let me explain this using concepts and examples from experiences I’ve gained optimizing machine learning pipelines for large-scale datasets.

In essence, the dimension parameter in the context of distributed data processing determines which 'direction' the dataset is partitioned. Consider a multidimensional array. If we have a 2D matrix and specify dimension 0, we are splitting it along its rows. Specifying dimension 1 splits it along columns. This is fundamentally distinct from the number of splits we desire. The split count represents our desired degree of concurrency, a concept related but not directly correlated to dimension.

Splitting along a specific dimension doesn't guarantee a perfect division into the precise number of target splits. The splitting operation is constrained by the nature of the data itself. If, for example, we have a matrix with 5 rows and we want 4 splits along dimension 0 (rows), the splitting algorithm might give us splits with 2, 1, 1, and 1 rows, based on data-balancing requirements or the limitations of the underlying processing framework.

Let's delve deeper into the relationship between splits and dimensions with code examples. I'll be using a Python-esque pseudo-code to demonstrate, since language-specific syntax isn’t the focus here, and it will maintain the intended abstraction.

**Example 1: Splitting a 2D Array Along Dimension 0 (Rows)**

Imagine a matrix data_array initialized as below, with 5 rows and 10 columns:

```python
data_array = create_matrix(rows=5, cols=10)
target_splits = 4
split_dim = 0

splits = perform_split(data_array, target_splits, split_dim)
print(f"Number of splits: {len(splits)}")
for i, split in enumerate(splits):
  print(f"Split {i} has {split.num_rows()} rows")
```

The `perform_split` function would, in a real distributed framework, divide `data_array` into the specified target number of splits along the rows. The actual number of rows each split gets isn’t necessarily equal, even if we set `target_splits = 4`. The output might look something like:

```
Number of splits: 4
Split 0 has 2 rows
Split 1 has 1 rows
Split 2 has 1 rows
Split 3 has 1 rows
```

Here, dimension 0 was specified, resulting in splits along the rows. The splits are not of equal size, and the number of splits achieved matches the specified target (4), however the actual split sizes are determined internally based on the dataset's structure.

**Example 2: Splitting a 2D Array Along Dimension 1 (Columns)**

Consider the same `data_array` with 5 rows and 10 columns. This time, we split along dimension 1 (columns):

```python
data_array = create_matrix(rows=5, cols=10)
target_splits = 4
split_dim = 1

splits = perform_split(data_array, target_splits, split_dim)
print(f"Number of splits: {len(splits)}")
for i, split in enumerate(splits):
    print(f"Split {i} has {split.num_cols()} columns")
```

In this case, we are partitioning along the columns. The output might be:

```
Number of splits: 4
Split 0 has 3 columns
Split 1 has 3 columns
Split 2 has 2 columns
Split 3 has 2 columns
```
Dimension 1 was specified, resulting in splits along the columns. While we still have 4 splits, they again may not be evenly sized. The number of columns within each split is managed by the underlying framework and is not directly derived from merely dividing 10 columns by 4.

**Example 3: Handling Non-Divisible Dimensions (Using a different shape matrix for clarity)**

Now, imagine a 3D tensor. When working with tensors and multi-dimensional data, the concept of dimension and split size often has a non-intuitive interaction. Imagine a tensor as a stack of matrices; with a dimension of 0 corresponding to splitting along the matrices, a dimension of 1 to splitting along rows in each matrix, and dimension 2 along the columns in each matrix. Let's assume we have a tensor of shape (3, 5, 10). If we try to split this with a target of 4 splits along dimension 0:

```python
data_tensor = create_tensor(dim1=3, dim2=5, dim3=10)
target_splits = 4
split_dim = 0

splits = perform_split(data_tensor, target_splits, split_dim)
print(f"Number of splits: {len(splits)}")
for i, split in enumerate(splits):
  print(f"Split {i} has {split.shape()[0]} matrices ")
```

The result would likely be 3 splits, since the underlying data along dimension 0 only permits a maximum of 3 partitions, and the framework would probably choose to create 3 partitions or might perform a repartitioning scheme which may not always be equal in size for the splits (e.g., it might repartition dimension 1 or 2 to get 4 splits).

```
Number of splits: 3
Split 0 has 1 matrices
Split 1 has 1 matrices
Split 2 has 1 matrices
```

Here, despite requesting 4 splits, we ended up with 3 because the dimension being split has only 3 elements. This highlights that the number of splits is often constrained by the dataset's shape along the split dimension. The splitting algorithm may repartition in complex scenarios like this one. The output of the framework and how it re-partitions is often based on an internal algorithm that depends on the framework being used.

The core misunderstanding here stems from confusing the desired *level of parallelism* (specified by the number of splits) with the *direction of splitting* (indicated by the dimension). The dimension dictates how the data is divided, while the target number of splits aims to control the number of parallel processes that will operate on the data. They are not inherently linked through a simple division formula. Internal algorithms handle the actual splitting, often involving complex strategies for load balancing, data locality, and minimizing communication overhead.

Therefore, a target number of splits of 4 does not always mean an equal partitioning of data within a given dimension. The actual split sizes depend on both the shape of the dataset and internal implementation details.

For further learning, I recommend exploring resources that delve into the specifics of distributed computing frameworks. Research publications on parallel data processing techniques and advanced data partitioning strategies would also be extremely beneficial. Furthermore, consulting documentation on specific distributed data processing systems such as Apache Spark, TensorFlow, or similar platforms will provide concrete insights into their implemented splitting algorithms and configurations.
