TensorFlow's `tf.keras.callbacks` primarily focus on epoch-level or overall training statistics.  Directly obtaining batch-level statistics *without* aggregation requires a slightly different approach, leveraging custom callbacks and potentially modifying the training loop.  In my experience developing robust training pipelines for large-scale image classification, circumventing the inherent aggregation within Keras callbacks proved crucial for detailed performance monitoring and debugging.  This is achieved by directly accessing and processing the outputs of each batch within a custom callback.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in the design of `tf.keras.callbacks`.  They are designed to receive aggregated data after each epoch.  To get batch-level information, one must bypass this aggregation mechanism. This necessitates creating a custom callback that interacts with the training process at a finer granularity.  Instead of relying on the callback's built-in methods that summarize epoch-level metrics, we need to intercept the training loop's internal computations.  We accomplish this by implementing the `on_train_batch_end` method within a custom callback class.  This method provides access to the batch-specific losses and metrics calculated during the forward and backward passes.  Critically, we avoid Keras's automatic aggregation by storing these metrics individually for each batch.  This approach increases memory consumption linearly with the number of batches, so it's advisable for smaller datasets or where detailed per-batch analysis is paramount. For very large datasets,  consider techniques like periodically saving and flushing batch statistics to a file or database to manage memory efficiently.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Batch-Level Loss Tracking**

This example demonstrates a simple callback that tracks the loss for each batch.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class BatchLossCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self):
        super(BatchLossCallback, self).__init__()
        self.batch_losses = []

    def on_train_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        self.batch_losses.append(logs['loss'])

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(...) # Your model definition
model.compile(...) # Your compilation settings

batch_loss_callback = BatchLossCallback()
model.fit(..., callbacks=[batch_loss_callback], ...)

# Access batch-level losses after training
print(batch_loss_callback.batch_losses)
```

This code defines a callback that appends the loss from `logs['loss']` to the `batch_losses` list after each batch.  The `logs` dictionary, available in the `on_train_batch_end` method, contains various metrics computed for the batch.  Note that this requires the loss to be included in the metrics during model compilation.


**Example 2:  Tracking Multiple Metrics per Batch**

This extends the previous example to track multiple metrics.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class BatchMetricsCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, metrics):
        super(BatchMetricsCallback, self).__init__()
        self.batch_metrics = {metric: [] for metric in metrics}

    def on_train_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        for metric in self.batch_metrics:
            if metric in logs:
                self.batch_metrics[metric].append(logs[metric])

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(...) # Your model definition
model.compile(..., metrics=['accuracy', 'mse']) # Include desired metrics

batch_metrics_callback = BatchMetricsCallback(['loss', 'accuracy', 'mse'])
model.fit(..., callbacks=[batch_metrics_callback], ...)

# Access batch-level metrics after training
print(batch_metrics_callback.batch_metrics)
```

This callback tracks a list of specified metrics.  It iterates through the provided `metrics` list and appends the value from `logs` to the corresponding list in `batch_metrics` only if the metric exists in the `logs` dictionary.  This enhances flexibility by allowing tracking of custom metrics or a subset of available metrics.  Error handling (checking if a metric exists in `logs`) is crucial for robustness.


**Example 3:  Batch-Level Prediction and Ground Truth Comparison**

This demonstrates accessing predictions and ground truths for detailed batch-level analysis.  This requires modifying the training loop slightly to capture predictions before they are aggregated. Note that this is more computationally intensive.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class BatchPredictionCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self):
        super(BatchPredictionCallback, self).__init__()
        self.batch_predictions = []
        self.batch_ground_truths = []


    def on_train_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None):
        # Accessing batch data directly isn't standard in callbacks, so this requires knowledge of the internal model.fit loop
        # This is a simplification and might vary depending on your data loading strategy and model architecture
        x_batch = self.model.input #this is only if you have access to this attribute
        y_batch = self.model.output #this is only if you have access to this attribute
        predictions = self.model.predict_on_batch(x_batch)

        self.batch_predictions.append(predictions)
        self.batch_ground_truths.append(y_batch)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(...) # Your model definition
model.compile(...) # Your compilation settings

batch_prediction_callback = BatchPredictionCallback()
model.fit(..., callbacks=[batch_prediction_callback], ...)


# Analyze batch-level predictions and ground truths
for i in range(len(batch_prediction_callback.batch_predictions)):
    #Perform per-batch analysis e.g., calculate metrics or visualizations.
    predictions = batch_prediction_callback.batch_predictions[i]
    ground_truths = batch_prediction_callback.batch_ground_truths[i]
    # Example: calculate mean squared error for the batch
    mse = np.mean(np.square(predictions - ground_truths))
    print(f"Batch {i+1} MSE: {mse}")

```

This example shows a more advanced usage, directly accessing predictions.  Direct access to `self.model.input` and `self.model.output` is not officially supported and depends on the internals of the model. This is illustrated for educational purposes; the exact method for accessing these would vary depending on the model structure and data handling mechanism.  It is crucial to understand the implications and potential for errors before implementing this.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  The official TensorFlow documentation on custom callbacks.
*  Advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on custom training loops.
*  Literature on monitoring and debugging deep learning models.


Remember to carefully consider memory management when implementing these callbacks, particularly when dealing with large datasets.  Always prioritize code clarity and maintainability.  These examples provide a foundation; adapting them to your specific needs and model architecture is essential for successful implementation.
