The core challenge in indexing a 3D torch tensor with unique indices per sample along a specific axis lies in efficiently generating and applying these indices, especially when dealing with large datasets.  My experience optimizing data pipelines for high-throughput image processing has underscored the importance of vectorized operations to avoid performance bottlenecks in this scenario.  Failing to leverage these optimized methods leads to significant slowdowns, particularly when dealing with the iterative nature inherent in per-sample indexing.

This response will detail the methods for achieving unique indexing along a chosen axis of a 3D tensor, focusing on efficiency and clarity.  We will assume the tensor represents a batch of samples (e.g., images), where the first dimension corresponds to the batch size, the second dimension to the height, and the third to the width.  The goal is to index each sample with a unique set of indices along, for instance, the height axis (second dimension).

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The process involves generating a set of indices for each sample, ensuring uniqueness within each sample's indices. This requires considering the tensor's shape to prevent index out-of-bounds errors.  We can leverage broadcasting and advanced indexing capabilities within PyTorch to achieve this efficiently.  The generation of unique indices can be approached in several ways:  using arithmetic progression, leveraging cumulative sums, or employing more sophisticated methods for specific index patterns.

For a 3D tensor `tensor` of shape (Batch_Size, Height, Width), we aim to generate a set of indices for each sample along the height dimension (axis=1).  We first need to determine the number of indices per sample, which corresponds to the height.  Then, we generate a set of unique indices for each sample, ensuring that these indices do not overlap between samples.  This generation is crucial and will be explored in the subsequent code examples. Finally, we use advanced indexing in PyTorch to apply these generated indices to the tensor.  The chosen method depends on the desired index pattern and the trade-off between code complexity and execution speed.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Arithmetic Progression**

This example uses arithmetic progression to generate indices. It's straightforward but may become computationally expensive for very large tensors.

```python
import torch

def index_with_arithmetic_progression(tensor, axis=1, offset=10):
    """Indexes a tensor using arithmetic progressions along a specified axis.

    Args:
        tensor: The input 3D torch tensor.
        axis: The axis along which unique indices are generated (default: 1).
        offset: The difference between consecutive indices (default: 10).  Must be >= 1.  Setting to 1 generates consecutive indices, which may be less efficient than other approaches.

    Returns:
        A new tensor with indexed elements.  Returns None if invalid inputs are provided.
    """
    if not isinstance(tensor, torch.Tensor) or tensor.ndim != 3 or axis not in [0,1,2] or offset < 1:
        print("Error: Invalid input parameters")
        return None

    batch_size, height, width = tensor.shape
    indices = torch.arange(height) * offset  # Generates indices for a single sample

    # Broadcasting to create indices for each sample with offsetting
    indices = indices.unsqueeze(0).repeat(batch_size, 1) + torch.arange(batch_size).unsqueeze(1) * offset * height

    #Checks for Out Of Bounds, if an index exceeds the height, then returns None
    if indices.max() > height -1:
        print("Error: Index out of bounds")
        return None

    indexed_tensor = tensor.gather(axis, indices)
    return indexed_tensor

# Example usage:
tensor = torch.randn(3, 5, 4) #Example tensor: batch size 3, height 5, width 4
indexed_tensor = index_with_arithmetic_progression(tensor, axis=1, offset=2)
print(indexed_tensor)
```


**Example 2: Cumulative Sum for Consecutive Indexing**

This example is highly efficient for consecutive indexing and avoids explicit loop iterations, leveraging PyTorch's optimized cumulative sum function.

```python
import torch

def index_with_cumulative_sum(tensor, axis=1):
    """Indexes a tensor using cumulative sums along a specified axis.  This method is optimal for generating consecutive indices.

    Args:
        tensor: The input 3D torch tensor.
        axis: The axis along which unique indices are generated (default: 1).

    Returns:
        A new tensor with indexed elements. Returns None if invalid inputs are provided.
    """
    if not isinstance(tensor, torch.Tensor) or tensor.ndim != 3 or axis not in [0,1,2]:
        print("Error: Invalid input parameters")
        return None

    batch_size, height, width = tensor.shape
    indices = torch.cumsum(torch.ones(height, dtype=torch.long), dim=0)

    # Broadcasting for each sample:
    indices = indices.unsqueeze(0).repeat(batch_size, 1)

    indexed_tensor = tensor.gather(axis, indices)
    return indexed_tensor

# Example usage
tensor = torch.randn(3, 5, 4)
indexed_tensor = index_with_cumulative_sum(tensor, axis=1)
print(indexed_tensor)

```


**Example 3: Advanced Indexing with Meshgrid (for Non-Consecutive, Patterned Indexing)**


This offers flexibility but requires a deeper understanding of advanced indexing and meshgrid creation within PyTorch.  It's suitable for more complex indexing patterns beyond simple arithmetic progressions.

```python
import torch

def index_with_meshgrid(tensor, axis=1, pattern = [0,2,4]):
    """Indexes a tensor using meshgrid for flexible and patterned indexing.

    Args:
        tensor: The input 3D torch tensor.
        axis: The axis along which unique indices are generated (default: 1).
        pattern: A list representing the desired indexing pattern. The length of this list must be <= the size of the chosen axis.

    Returns:
        A new tensor with indexed elements. Returns None if invalid inputs are provided.
    """
    if not isinstance(tensor, torch.Tensor) or tensor.ndim != 3 or axis not in [0,1,2]:
        print("Error: Invalid input parameters")
        return None

    batch_size, height, width = tensor.shape
    if len(pattern) > height:
        print("Error: Pattern length exceeds axis size.")
        return None
    
    indices = torch.tensor(pattern).unsqueeze(0).repeat(batch_size, 1)
    indexed_tensor = torch.gather(tensor, axis, indices)
    return indexed_tensor

# Example usage
tensor = torch.randn(3, 5, 4)
indexed_tensor = index_with_meshgrid(tensor, axis=1, pattern=[0,2,4])
print(indexed_tensor)


```

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding of tensor manipulation and advanced indexing in PyTorch, I highly recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation.  A thorough understanding of broadcasting and vectorized operations is essential for optimal performance.  Exploring resources on linear algebra and matrix operations will also prove valuable for comprehending the underlying principles.  Finally, studying examples of efficient data processing pipelines in similar domains (e.g., image processing, natural language processing) will provide additional insights and context for tackling complex indexing challenges.
