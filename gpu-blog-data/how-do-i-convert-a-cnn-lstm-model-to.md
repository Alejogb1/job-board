The core challenge in converting a CNN-LSTM model to a 1D-CNN model lies in the inherent difference in how temporal dependencies are handled.  CNN-LSTMs leverage LSTM layers to capture long-range temporal information within sequential data, whereas 1D-CNNs rely on convolutional filters to extract local features.  Direct substitution isn't possible; rather, the 1D-CNN must be architecturally designed to implicitly capture, or at least approximate, the temporal relationships previously learned by the LSTM.  This necessitates careful consideration of filter sizes, depth, and pooling strategies.  My experience in developing time-series anomaly detection systems has highlighted this crucial point repeatedly.  In several projects, I found that simply replacing the LSTM with a 1D-CNN resulted in significantly degraded performance unless the new architecture was carefully calibrated.

The conversion process requires a shift from explicitly modelling temporal dependencies (LSTM) to implicitly capturing them through the convolutional filters' receptive fields. The spatial dimension of the input data remains unchanged, but the way temporal context is integrated alters fundamentally.  The goal is to maintain similar feature extraction capabilities while simplifying the model architecture.  This is rarely a perfect mapping; instead, it is an approximation achieved through architectural design choices and potentially hyperparameter tuning.

**1. Explanation:**

The CNN-LSTM model likely processes input data as a sequence of feature vectors (e.g.,  time series data where each vector represents a time step’s features). The CNN part extracts spatial features from each vector, and the LSTM part captures temporal dependencies between the CNN-extracted features across time steps. To convert this to a 1D-CNN, we need to design a 1D-CNN that can capture both spatial and temporal information within a single architecture.  This involves careful consideration of the following:

* **Input Reshaping:** The input to the 1D-CNN should be reshaped to reflect the temporal dependencies.  Instead of feeding each time step independently, we might consider creating a single long input vector that concatenates all time steps.  Alternatively, the input might be reshaped to a 2D tensor where one dimension represents the time steps and the other represents the spatial features.

* **Filter Size and Depth:** The filter size determines the temporal context considered by each convolution. Larger filter sizes allow capturing longer-range temporal dependencies, but might overfit.  The depth of the convolutional layers influences the complexity of the learned features.  Experimentation is crucial to find optimal values.

* **Pooling Layers:** Pooling layers reduce dimensionality and help extract more robust features.  Max pooling can be used to retain the most significant features within a temporal window, while average pooling can provide a smoother representation.

* **Output Layer:** The output layer needs to produce logits that match the labels' dimensionality.  This ensures consistent output shape and proper calculation of loss during training.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Conversion with Reshaping**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming 'input_data' is a tensor of shape (batch_size, timesteps, features)
# and 'labels' is a tensor of shape (batch_size, num_classes)

# Reshape input for 1D-CNN
reshaped_input = tf.reshape(input_data, (batch_size, timesteps * features))

# 1D-CNN Model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(timesteps * features,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(reshaped_input, labels, epochs=10)

```

This example demonstrates a simple conversion by reshaping the input data into a 1D vector.  This approach ignores the inherent temporal structure, sacrificing potential performance for simplicity.

**Example 2:  Preserving Temporal Information with 2D Input**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming 'input_data' is a tensor of shape (batch_size, timesteps, features)
# and 'labels' is a tensor of shape (batch_size, num_classes)

# 1D-CNN Model with 2D input
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=5, activation='relu', padding='same'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=128, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', padding='same'),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(input_data, labels, epochs=10)
```

Here, the temporal information is preserved by feeding the input as a 2D tensor to the 1D convolutional layers.  The `padding='same'` argument ensures that the output has the same temporal length as the input after convolution.  `GlobalAveragePooling1D` provides a global temporal context before the final dense layer.

**Example 3: Handling Variable Length Sequences**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming 'input_data' is a list of tensors, each with shape (timesteps_i, features)
# and 'labels' is a tensor of shape (batch_size, num_classes)

# Pad sequences to max length
max_length = max(len(seq) for seq in input_data)
padded_input = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(input_data, maxlen=max_length, padding='post')

# 1D-CNN Model for variable-length sequences
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(max_length, features)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', padding='same'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
    tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True)), #Adding a bidirectional LSTM for enhanced temporal capture
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])


# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(padded_input, labels, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates handling variable length sequences which is not uncommon in real world time series data. It leverages padding to create equal length inputs for the model.  Note that a bidirectional LSTM has been strategically added after convolution to attempt better approximation of the original CNN-LSTM functionality.  This illustrates that a complete replacement of the LSTM is not always the most effective strategy.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet; "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron;  "Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control" by Box & Jenkins; "Convolutional Neural Networks for Time Series Classification" (relevant research papers on this specific topic are invaluable).  Thorough exploration of TensorFlow and Keras documentation is essential.  Pay close attention to layers such as `Conv1D`, `MaxPooling1D`, `GlobalAveragePooling1D`, `Bidirectional`, and  `LSTM`.  Understanding the mechanics of padding, different pooling methods, and the effect of filter sizes is paramount.
