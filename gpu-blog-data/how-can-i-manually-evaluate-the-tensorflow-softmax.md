The core challenge in manually evaluating the TensorFlow softmax function lies in understanding its numerical stability considerations.  During my years working on large-scale image classification projects, I've encountered numerous instances where naive implementations failed catastrophically due to overflow or underflow errors.  The exponential nature of softmax necessitates careful handling of potentially extreme values.  Therefore, a robust manual evaluation requires a technique that mitigates these issues.  This involves a two-step process:  normalizing the input vector to prevent overflow, and then employing a stable computation of the exponentials and their normalization.

**1.  Explanation:**

The softmax function, given a vector `z`, is defined as:

`softmax(z)_i = exp(z_i) / Σ_j exp(z_j)`

where `i` and `j` index the elements of the input vector `z`.  The denominator acts as a normalization term, ensuring the output vector sums to 1.  However,  `exp(z_i)` can easily exceed the maximum representable floating-point number, leading to overflow. Conversely, if `z_i` is a large negative number, `exp(z_i)` might underflow to zero, causing loss of information.

To address this, we employ a normalization strategy before applying the exponential function.  The key is to subtract the maximum value of the input vector from each element:

`z_i' = z_i - max(z)`

This transformation doesn't alter the result of the softmax because:

`exp(z_i - max(z)) / Σ_j exp(z_j - max(z)) = exp(z_i) * exp(-max(z)) / (Σ_j exp(z_j) * exp(-max(z))) = exp(z_i) / Σ_j exp(z_j)`

The subtraction shifts the values, preventing overflow. The exponential operation now operates on smaller, more manageable numbers, increasing numerical stability.  The normalization constant then ensures the output values sum to 1.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Python with NumPy**

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax_numpy(z):
    """Computes softmax using NumPy, handling potential overflow/underflow."""
    z = np.array(z)  # Ensure z is a NumPy array
    z -= np.max(z) # Normalize to prevent overflow
    exp_z = np.exp(z)
    return exp_z / np.sum(exp_z)

z = [1000, 1001, 999]  #Example with potential overflow
result = softmax_numpy(z)
print(result) #Output will be a stable and normalized probability distribution

z = [-1000, -1001, -999] # Example with potential underflow
result = softmax_numpy(z)
print(result) #Output will be a stable and normalized probability distribution
```

This example leverages NumPy's vectorized operations for efficiency. The subtraction of the maximum value is crucial for numerical stability.  The division by the sum ensures the output is a probability distribution.

**Example 2: Python with pure Python (for illustrative purposes)**

```python
import math

def softmax_pure_python(z):
    """Computes softmax using pure Python, less efficient but demonstrates the process."""
    max_z = max(z)
    exp_z = [math.exp(i - max_z) for i in z]
    sum_exp_z = sum(exp_z)
    return [i / sum_exp_z for i in exp_z]

z = [1, 2, 3]
result = softmax_pure_python(z)
print(result) #Output will be a stable and normalized probability distribution.

```

This example shows the underlying logic without external libraries. It is significantly less efficient for large vectors but helps in understanding the step-by-step calculations.

**Example 3: TensorFlow (for comparison)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

z = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
result = tf.nn.softmax(z)
print(result.numpy()) #Output will be a stable and normalized probability distribution.  .numpy() converts the TensorFlow tensor to a NumPy array for printing.

```

TensorFlow's built-in `tf.nn.softmax` function internally handles numerical stability issues.  This is the preferred method in production environments due to its optimization and efficiency.  This example is provided to contrast the manual implementation with the optimized TensorFlow implementation.  Note that TensorFlow's internal implementation might vary slightly, but it will maintain stability.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of numerical stability in machine learning, I would suggest consulting reputable textbooks on numerical methods and machine learning.  Look for detailed discussions on floating-point arithmetic and strategies for mitigating numerical instability in algorithms like softmax.  Specialized literature on deep learning frameworks, particularly those focused on TensorFlow, can also offer valuable insights into the internal workings of the optimized softmax functions.  Furthermore, studying the source code of established machine learning libraries, while advanced, provides a highly detailed understanding of these numerical techniques.
