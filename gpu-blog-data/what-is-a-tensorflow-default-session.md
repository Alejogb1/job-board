TensorFlow's default session, prior to TensorFlow 2.x, served as a crucial global context for executing TensorFlow operations.  Understanding its role is paramount to grasping the execution model of earlier TensorFlow versions, and its absence in later versions highlights a significant shift in the framework's design.  My experience working on large-scale distributed training systems extensively utilized this functionality before the introduction of eager execution, so I'll elaborate on its mechanics and implications.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

In essence, the TensorFlow default session provided a single, globally accessible instance of a `tf.compat.v1.Session` object.  Any TensorFlow operations – variable creation, graph definition, and tensor manipulation – were implicitly associated with this session unless explicitly specified otherwise. This implied execution model streamlined the workflow for simpler applications.  However, this implicit behavior created several potential pitfalls, especially in more complex projects involving multiple graphs or asynchronous operations.

The `tf.compat.v1.Session` object managed the execution of the computational graph.  The graph itself is a representation of the computations to be performed, constructed by adding operations (nodes) and their dependencies (edges).  The default session would then execute this graph, typically using optimized backends for speed and efficiency.  Crucially, the default session handled the allocation and management of resources, including GPU memory, crucial for resource-intensive deep learning workloads.

The primary drawback of this implicit behavior was the lack of explicit control over the session.  Managing multiple independent computations within a single program required careful management of scope and, if not handled correctly, frequently led to resource contention or unexpected behavior. This was particularly problematic when dealing with multiple threads or processes interacting with the TensorFlow graph.  My experience troubleshooting a production pipeline involving asynchronous data ingestion and model training vividly highlights the importance of explicit session management for reliability and reproducibility.

The shift towards eager execution in TensorFlow 2.x eliminated the need for a default session.  Operations are executed immediately, allowing for more interactive development and improved debugging. While this simplification simplifies the user experience, understanding the role of the default session in earlier TensorFlow versions remains essential for maintaining legacy codebases and comprehending the evolutionary path of the framework.  This understanding also provides valuable insight into the challenges and design tradeoffs involved in building scalable and robust machine learning systems.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Default Session Usage (TensorFlow 1.x):**

```python
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
tf.disable_v2_behavior() # Required for TensorFlow 1.x compatibility

# Create a simple computation graph
a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(10)
c = tf.add(a, b)

# Implicitly use the default session to execute
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess: #Creates a default session implicitly inside the block
    result = sess.run(c)
    print(result) # Output: 15

#Further operations will need to be associated with a session.
```

This example demonstrates the implicit use of the default session. The `tf.compat.v1.Session()` context manager creates and manages the session. Note the need for `tf.disable_v2_behavior()` for compatibility with older TensorFlow versions.  All operations within the `with` block are executed within this session.  Outside this block, further operations would require explicit session handling or would result in an error.

**Example 2: Explicit Session Management (TensorFlow 1.x):**

```python
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
tf.disable_v2_behavior()

# Define the graph
a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(10)
c = tf.add(a, b)

# Create a session explicitly
sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()

# Run the computation
result = sess.run(c)
print(result) # Output: 15

# Close the session explicitly when finished
sess.close()
```

This illustrates the explicit creation and management of a session.  The `sess.close()` call is crucial for releasing resources.  Failure to close the session might lead to resource leaks, especially in long-running applications or when multiple sessions are involved.  Explicit session management provides much finer control over the lifecycle of TensorFlow operations and is preferable for robust code.

**Example 3:  Illustrating potential issues with default sessions and multiple graphs:**

```python
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
tf.disable_v2_behavior()

# Graph 1
with tf.Graph().as_default():
    a = tf.constant(5)
    b = tf.constant(10)
    c = tf.add(a, b)
    sess1 = tf.compat.v1.Session()
    result1 = sess1.run(c)
    print(f"Result from Graph 1: {result1}")  #Output: Result from Graph 1: 15
    sess1.close()

# Graph 2 – This will fail if not explicitly setting the session.
with tf.Graph().as_default():
    x = tf.Variable(0, name='x')
    increment_op = tf.compat.v1.assign_add(x, 1)
    sess2 = tf.compat.v1.Session()
    init = tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()
    sess2.run(init)
    for _ in range(5):
      sess2.run(increment_op)
    final_value = sess2.run(x)
    print(f"Final value of x from Graph 2: {final_value}") #Output: Final value of x from Graph 2: 5
    sess2.close()

```
This example showcases the need for explicit graph and session management. Attempting to interact with graph2 using the default session after graph1 would lead to confusion and errors, highlighting the importance of explicitly managing sessions when working with multiple graphs.  Each graph requires its own session for proper execution.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation (specifically the sections on sessions and eager execution for different versions), any reputable textbook on TensorFlow or deep learning fundamentals, and advanced resources on distributed TensorFlow systems would be beneficial for a deeper understanding of this topic and its evolution within the TensorFlow ecosystem.  Furthermore, I would recommend exploring publications detailing performance optimization strategies in TensorFlow.  Understanding these nuances is key to building performant machine learning pipelines.
