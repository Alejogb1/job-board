Singularity containers, by design, isolate processes from the host system, presenting a challenge when installing Python packages dependent on GPU resources, especially when the installation or initial import of the package triggers file creation within the container’s filesystem. This situation requires a nuanced approach to ensure the package can function correctly without violating the container's read-only principle.

Fundamentally, the read-only nature of Singularity images means we cannot directly modify the container's filesystem during runtime. If a Python package attempts to write to the filesystem at the time of import, we face errors unless we pre-stage or accommodate this behavior. We need a method to either include pre-generated files within the container or allow for write operations within a specified location. Common scenarios include neural network libraries that require cached kernels or configuration files to reside in a writable location. My experience working with several deep learning model deployment projects has made me quite familiar with these issues.

The typical approach to building a Singularity container involves constructing a definition file (commonly `.def`) which is then used by Singularity to create the container image (`.sif`). My approach will be demonstrated in three distinct examples, each building on the previous one to showcase progressively complex solutions.

**Example 1: Pre-Staging Required Files**

The most direct method involves generating the necessary files *before* the container image is built. This ensures that these files are baked directly into the read-only image, eliminating the need for runtime writes. This is practical if the required files are static and easily created. Let us imagine that our package, `hypothetical_gpu_lib`, needs a configuration file named `config.ini` placed within its install directory.

First, we will manually create the config file and place it into an auxiliary directory. Let us also assume that the location within the package install is: `/opt/python_packages/hypothetical_gpu_lib/config.ini`

```bash
# Create directory to mimic package install
mkdir -p auxiliary/opt/python_packages/hypothetical_gpu_lib

# Create a dummy config file
echo "[settings]\ngpu_enabled = True" > auxiliary/opt/python_packages/hypothetical_gpu_lib/config.ini
```

Now, our Singularity definition file will include these files during build time:

```singularity
Bootstrap: docker
From: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.09-py3

%files
  auxiliary/opt /opt

%environment
  export PYTHONPATH=/opt/python_packages:$PYTHONPATH
  export PATH=/opt/python_packages/bin:$PATH

%post
  pip install hypothetical_gpu_lib --no-cache-dir
```

**Commentary:**
The `%files` section in the definition file copies the directory structure including `config.ini` from our `auxiliary` location into the corresponding container location within `/opt`. During the `%post` step, where we install `hypothetical_gpu_lib`, the config file is present and readily available during import without requiring a filesystem write at runtime. This approach is simple and efficient for pre-determined files. However, it fails if those files depend on the environment or have to be built at runtime.

**Example 2: Using a Writable Overlay with Bind Mounts**

When files need to be dynamically generated or if we want to persist the changes across runs, a writable overlay (bind-mount) is the best route. This approach uses a directory on the host system that is mounted to a specific location within the container's filesystem, enabling write operations within this mount point. This is useful if our package needs to write temporary files or create a cache of some type. Suppose `hypothetical_gpu_lib` creates a cache in `/tmp/hypothetical_gpu_cache`.

The Singularity definition file would appear as follows:

```singularity
Bootstrap: docker
From: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.09-py3

%environment
  export PYTHONPATH=/opt/python_packages:$PYTHONPATH
  export PATH=/opt/python_packages/bin:$PATH

%post
  pip install hypothetical_gpu_lib --no-cache-dir
```

Now, when running the container, we would mount a host directory to `/tmp/hypothetical_gpu_cache`. For example, assuming we wanted a directory named `gpu_cache` in our current directory on the host we would do the following:

```bash
# Creating local directory for bind mount
mkdir gpu_cache

# Run the container with the bind mount
singularity run --bind gpu_cache:/tmp/hypothetical_gpu_cache  my_container.sif python -c "import hypothetical_gpu_lib"
```

**Commentary:**
Here, we keep the container image clean and rely on a bind mount during runtime. The `singularity run` command with the `--bind` option maps the `gpu_cache` directory from the host to the `/tmp/hypothetical_gpu_cache` directory inside the container. This approach allows our Python package to create and modify files within the mount point. The drawback is that the cache is transient. The cache is preserved if the same directory on the host is used between runs of the container.

**Example 3: Using a Writable Overlay within the Container itself with Overlay Filesystem**

For situations where a dedicated host directory is not desirable and we want to keep container behavior isolated and self-contained, a more robust approach is to use a writable overlay file as an internal, read-write layer on top of the read-only image. This is particularly important in shared environments or where the container should be completely portable and self-contained. Here, instead of bind mounting, we'll create and attach a custom overlay when we run the container. This is similar to the prior example but gives us more control as the data can be contained alongside the image instead of existing outside of it.

Let's reuse the previous scenario where `hypothetical_gpu_lib` requires a `/tmp/hypothetical_gpu_cache`. Our definition file remains the same as Example 2:

```singularity
Bootstrap: docker
From: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.09-py3

%environment
  export PYTHONPATH=/opt/python_packages:$PYTHONPATH
  export PATH=/opt/python_packages/bin:$PATH

%post
  pip install hypothetical_gpu_lib --no-cache-dir
```
Now we must create the writable overlay (this will be named `my_overlay.img`) before running the container, and then attach it when running the container.

```bash
# Create a blank file and format it as a ext3 filesystem (the size of the file depends on expected workload)
truncate -s 1G my_overlay.img
mkfs.ext3 my_overlay.img

# Run the container with overlay using Singularity exec (similar to run, but allows more control over execution)
singularity exec --overlay my_overlay.img my_container.sif  python -c "import hypothetical_gpu_lib"
```
**Commentary:**
In this example, a file named `my_overlay.img` is created, formatted, and used as an overlay. This allows the container to perform file system writes within this virtual layer, without modifying the underlying image. Subsequent executions of the container will retain the modifications within `my_overlay.img`, providing a persistent writable layer. It should be noted that the overlay filesystem needs to be big enough for all the data being written or else write operations will fail.

For the cases described above, I would like to provide recommendations for further investigation. Detailed information can be found in the official Singularity documentation, which provides information on bind mounts and overlay filesystems. In-depth Python package deployment information can be found in official package documentation for the packages being installed and their use cases. Container security measures for shared environments should be investigated as needed in your specific use case. Finally, GPU resource management should be optimized through the use of the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, alongside NVIDIA’s official documentation.
