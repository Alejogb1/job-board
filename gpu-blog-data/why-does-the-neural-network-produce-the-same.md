The phenomenon of a neural network producing identical outputs for distinct inputs, often termed "mode collapse" or "output saturation," typically arises from a confluence of issues in the training process rather than a flaw in the network architecture itself. Over years spent training diverse models, from image classification to sequence generation, I’ve encountered this problem repeatedly, each time revealing subtle nuances in the underlying causes. The core issue revolves around the network’s inability to effectively learn a diverse representation of the input space, resulting in a degenerate mapping where multiple inputs collapse to the same output point.

The most prevalent contributing factor is insufficient gradient signal during training. This can manifest in several ways. One common scenario involves an excessively high learning rate. When the learning rate is too aggressive, the network's weights are updated too drastically with each iteration. This can lead to the network rapidly converging to a local minimum in the loss landscape, where it gets stuck, effectively ceasing to learn. The network settles into a state where the same set of weights and biases are used irrespective of the input. In this situation, the subtle differences in input that should influence the network’s activation patterns and subsequently the output are effectively washed out during backpropagation. The network fails to distinguish inputs at a high level, which collapses into the same output.

Another crucial element is poor data normalization. If the input data lacks a consistent distribution, with some features significantly larger or smaller than others, the gradients for some weights will be disproportionately larger than others. This can cause these highly-influenced weights to overshadow the others during updates, rendering the learning of other features, or subtle variations within the high-magnitude features, ineffective. In turn, the network can then be effectively insensitive to changes in input values that do not impact the highly-weighted features. Essentially, the model learns a mapping function that disproportionately relies on a subset of input features. If those features are relatively constant across different inputs, it will output a similar response. This reduces the network's ability to capture nuanced patterns and can cause the network to become insensitive to inputs in which these critical features are constant or within a narrow range, often leading to a mode collapse.

A further factor to consider is the chosen activation function. Some activation functions, particularly those with saturation regions like sigmoid or tanh, can lead to vanishing gradients. When the activation values fall into these regions, the derivative becomes exceptionally small. During backpropagation, these small gradients get multiplied through the layers, resulting in negligible weight updates for earlier layers, rendering them ineffective at learning. If the model is in an area of the parameter space where the activation functions are constantly saturated, a similar output would be produced for all inputs. In my experience, I have found ReLU and its variants to be more resilient to this, though other issues with ReLU can also arise.

The network's architecture itself also plays a role. A network with insufficient capacity, that is, with too few parameters, might lack the ability to learn a complex, non-degenerate mapping, often leading to it collapsing into a single output. Conversely, a network with excessive capacity can overfit the training data and simply memorize the outputs. In the latter case, even small variations in input may lead to significant differences in the internal representations but ultimately map back to the same output during the forward pass if the model has memorized the mapping.

Here are three code examples to illustrate these points, using Python and a conceptual representation of a simplified feed-forward network:

**Example 1: High Learning Rate with Invariant Output**

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
  return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
  return sigmoid(x) * (1 - sigmoid(x))

def forward_pass(inputs, weights, biases):
  output = sigmoid(np.dot(inputs, weights) + biases)
  return output

def train_network(inputs, targets, learning_rate, epochs):
    weights = np.random.rand(inputs.shape[1], 1)
    biases = np.random.rand(1)
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for i in range(inputs.shape[0]):
            input_data = inputs[i].reshape(1, -1)
            target = targets[i].reshape(1, -1)

            output = forward_pass(input_data, weights, biases)
            error = output - target
            delta_output = error * sigmoid_derivative(np.dot(input_data, weights) + biases)

            weight_gradient = np.dot(input_data.T, delta_output)
            bias_gradient = np.sum(delta_output)
            weights = weights - learning_rate * weight_gradient
            biases = biases - learning_rate * bias_gradient
    return weights, biases
    
inputs = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
targets = np.array([[0.2], [0.4], [0.6]])
learning_rate = 10 # Extremely high learning rate
epochs = 100
trained_weights, trained_biases = train_network(inputs, targets, learning_rate, epochs)
print(f"Weights after training: {trained_weights}")
print(f"Bias after training: {trained_biases}")

for input_data in inputs:
    output = forward_pass(input_data.reshape(1,-1), trained_weights, trained_biases)
    print(f"Input: {input_data}, Output: {output}")

```
In this example, the exceedingly high learning rate disrupts the training process. Despite distinct inputs, the output converges to nearly identical values after a relatively small number of training epochs due to the overcorrection from the large learning rate. This shows the network being 'pushed' to a specific area of the weight space during training, where it can't differentiate the inputs.

**Example 2: Unnormalized Input Data**

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
  return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
  return sigmoid(x) * (1 - sigmoid(x))

def forward_pass(inputs, weights, biases):
  output = sigmoid(np.dot(inputs, weights) + biases)
  return output

def train_network(inputs, targets, learning_rate, epochs):
    weights = np.random.rand(inputs.shape[1], 1)
    biases = np.random.rand(1)
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for i in range(inputs.shape[0]):
            input_data = inputs[i].reshape(1, -1)
            target = targets[i].reshape(1, -1)

            output = forward_pass(input_data, weights, biases)
            error = output - target
            delta_output = error * sigmoid_derivative(np.dot(input_data, weights) + biases)

            weight_gradient = np.dot(input_data.T, delta_output)
            bias_gradient = np.sum(delta_output)
            weights = weights - learning_rate * weight_gradient
            biases = biases - learning_rate * bias_gradient
    return weights, biases


inputs = np.array([[1, 1000], [2, 2000], [3, 3000]]) # Unnormalized input
targets = np.array([[0.2], [0.4], [0.6]])
learning_rate = 0.1
epochs = 100
trained_weights, trained_biases = train_network(inputs, targets, learning_rate, epochs)
print(f"Weights after training: {trained_weights}")
print(f"Bias after training: {trained_biases}")

for input_data in inputs:
    output = forward_pass(input_data.reshape(1,-1), trained_weights, trained_biases)
    print(f"Input: {input_data}, Output: {output}")

```
Here, the second feature in the input data has a magnitude 1000 times larger than the first. The network disproportionately prioritizes the larger feature, failing to learn the importance of the smaller feature, and thus effectively producing similar outputs due to the dominant weight being determined by the larger input feature.

**Example 3: Activation Saturation (Conceptual)**

(This conceptual example won’t execute directly, but illustrates a common behavior)
Imagine a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function. If the input signal to the neuron, prior to the sigmoid activation, consistently results in extremely large positive or negative values, the sigmoid will saturate at close to 1 or 0 respectively. Even if the weights and inputs to the neuron are different, once the signal falls into the saturation region, the variation in the activation value would be minimal. The output of that neuron (and others in that area of the space) would be nearly identical, irrespective of the subtle differences in input. This conceptual visualization illustrates the impact of saturation.

To mitigate this problem, a multi-faceted approach is essential. First, careful hyperparameter tuning of the learning rate, potentially employing adaptive optimizers, is crucial. Furthermore, input normalization techniques such as standardization or min-max scaling are paramount. Selecting appropriate activation functions such as ReLU or its variants, which are less prone to saturation, is often beneficial. Finally, monitoring the training process, particularly during its initial stages, is important to identify whether any of the issues highlighted are occurring before the network collapses and ceases to learn a meaningful representation.

For further information on this area I recommend exploring texts related to practical machine learning, especially focusing on the areas of training neural networks, optimization algorithms, and data preprocessing. Books that discuss the practical application of deep learning and related challenges, are always a good starting point. Specific publications covering optimization for neural networks and their pitfalls can provide deeper understanding of this particular issue.
