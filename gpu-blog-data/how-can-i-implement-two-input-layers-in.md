The key to implementing multiple input layers in a Keras Dense network lies in understanding the functional API, which provides the flexibility to define complex network architectures beyond the limitations of the sequential model.  My experience working on large-scale recommendation systems extensively utilized this approach to incorporate diverse user and item features.  Directly stacking multiple input layers into a single `Sequential` model isn't feasible; instead, we need to create separate input tensors and then concatenate or combine their outputs before feeding them to subsequent dense layers.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core concept involves defining separate input layers for each data source, each with its respective input shape.  These are treated as independent tensors.  The crucial step is then merging these tensors.  This can be achieved primarily through two methods:  concatenation or element-wise operations (e.g., addition, multiplication).  Concatenation is suitable when the input features represent different, independent aspects of the data. Element-wise operations are more appropriate when the inputs represent similar features from different sources and a combined representation is needed.  After merging, the combined tensor is then fed to subsequent dense layers for processing.  The final output layer will then provide the network's prediction based on the combined information from both input sources.

The choice between concatenation and element-wise operations depends critically on the nature of your input data. If the inputs represent fundamentally different attributes (e.g., user demographics and movie ratings in a recommendation system), concatenation is preferred, allowing the network to learn independent representations from each input branch. If the inputs represent similar features measured from different perspectives (e.g., two sets of sensor readings), element-wise operations might be more suitable, forcing the network to consider the relationship between the corresponding elements.

Remember to ensure that the output shapes of the branches prior to merging are compatible.  For concatenation, the dimensions must match along all axes except the axis being concatenated. For element-wise operations, the tensors must have identical shapes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Concatenation of two input layers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, concatenate

# Define input layers
input_layer_1 = Input(shape=(10,)) # 10-dimensional input
input_layer_2 = Input(shape=(5,)) # 5-dimensional input

# Define dense layers for each input
dense_layer_1 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_layer_1)
dense_layer_2 = Dense(32, activation='relu')(input_layer_2)

# Concatenate the outputs of the dense layers
merged = concatenate([dense_layer_1, dense_layer_2])

# Add subsequent dense layers
dense_layer_3 = Dense(16, activation='relu')(merged)
output_layer = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(dense_layer_3)  #Example binary classification

# Create the model
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_layer_1, input_layer_2], outputs=output_layer)

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# ... training code ...
```

This example demonstrates the use of the Keras functional API to build a model with two input layers.  Each input is first passed through its own dense layer to extract relevant features before being concatenated.  The subsequent dense layers then process the combined information.  Crucially, note the `keras.Model` instantiation with both input and output layers explicitly defined.


**Example 2: Element-wise addition of two input layers**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Add

# Define input layers (same shape required for element-wise operations)
input_layer_1 = Input(shape=(10,))
input_layer_2 = Input(shape=(10,))

# Define dense layers (optional, but often beneficial for feature transformation)
dense_layer_1 = Dense(10, activation='relu')(input_layer_1)
dense_layer_2 = Dense(10, activation='relu')(input_layer_2)

# Element-wise addition
merged = Add()([dense_layer_1, dense_layer_2])

# Subsequent layers
dense_layer_3 = Dense(5, activation='relu')(merged)
output_layer = Dense(1, activation='linear')(dense_layer_3)  # Example regression

# Create and compile the model
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_layer_1, input_layer_2], outputs=output_layer)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse') #Mean Squared Error for regression
# ... training code ...
```

This example showcases element-wise addition.  Observe that the input shapes are identical to allow for this operation.  Adding dense layers before the addition step allows the network to learn transformations before combining the information element-wise.  The choice of loss function (`mse`) reflects a regression task.


**Example 3:  Handling different input dimensions with reshaping and concatenation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Reshape, concatenate

# Different input dimensions
input_layer_1 = Input(shape=(10, 5)) # 10 rows of 5 dimensional vectors
input_layer_2 = Input(shape=(20,))

# Reshape layer 1 to match desired dimensions before concatenation
reshaped_layer_1 = Reshape((50,))(input_layer_1) #Flattens the tensor. 10x5 = 50

#Dense layers to process inputs
dense_layer_1 = Dense(32, activation='relu')(reshaped_layer_1)
dense_layer_2 = Dense(32, activation='relu')(input_layer_2)

# Concatenate
merged = concatenate([dense_layer_1, dense_layer_2])

# Subsequent layers
dense_layer_3 = Dense(16, activation='relu')(merged)
output_layer = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(dense_layer_3)

# Model definition and compilation
model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_layer_1, input_layer_2], outputs=output_layer)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# ... training code ...
```

This example highlights how to handle discrepancies in input dimensions using reshaping.  The `Reshape` layer is crucial for making the dimensions compatible for concatenation.  This scenario is common when dealing with structured data of varying lengths or formats.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation on the functional API is an essential resource.  Furthermore, a thorough understanding of tensor operations in TensorFlow or other deep learning frameworks is crucial.  Finally, studying established examples of multi-input neural network architectures within research papers or practical applications can be extremely beneficial in designing and implementing complex network structures.
