TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities, while powerful, don't directly support symbolic integration.  Its gradient computation relies on the chain rule applied to differentiable functions;  numerical integration techniques, however, often involve non-differentiable operations like discrete summations.  Therefore, a direct application of `tf.GradientTape` to an integral approximation will fail unless carefully structured.  My experience working on Bayesian inference models involving complex likelihood functions has repeatedly highlighted this limitation and necessitated indirect approaches.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The core issue stems from the fundamental difference between symbolic and numerical computation. TensorFlow excels at symbolic differentiationâ€”taking the derivative of a mathematical expression before numerical evaluation.  Numerical integration, on the other hand, approximates the integral using numerical techniques (e.g., trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, Monte Carlo methods).  These methods often involve finite sums or other non-differentiable operations.  `tf.GradientTape` cannot directly differentiate these discrete summations because they lack a continuous, differentiable counterpart.

To compute gradients with respect to parameters influencing the integrand, we must resort to indirect strategies.  The most common approach is to treat the numerical integration as a differentiable black box. We calculate the integral approximation, and then use automatic differentiation on the *result* of the approximation, treating the integration process itself as a single, differentiable operation.  This requires the integration routine to be implemented as a TensorFlow function or operation, ensuring that its output is a TensorFlow tensor, allowing the gradient computation to proceed.  Crucially, the gradients obtained represent the sensitivity of the *approximation* to parameter changes, not the true gradient of the integral itself.  The accuracy of the gradient approximation depends directly on the accuracy of the numerical integration method and the step size used.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Trapezoidal Rule with Parameterized Integrand**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def trapezoidal_rule(func, a, b, n, params):
  """Approximates definite integral using trapezoidal rule.

  Args:
    func: The integrand function (TensorFlow function).
    a: Lower limit of integration.
    b: Upper limit of integration.
    n: Number of intervals.
    params:  TensorFlow variable(s) influencing the integrand.

  Returns:
    Approximation of the definite integral.
  """
  x = tf.linspace(a, b, n + 1)
  dx = (b - a) / n
  y = func(x, params)
  integral_approx = dx * (0.5 * y[0] + tf.reduce_sum(y[1:-1]) + 0.5 * y[-1])
  return integral_approx

# Example usage:
a = 0.0
b = 1.0
n = 1000

# Parameterized integrand
def integrand(x, params):
  return params[0] * tf.sin(params[1] * x)

params = tf.Variable([1.0, 2.0], dtype=tf.float64)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  integral = trapezoidal_rule(integrand, a, b, n, params)

gradients = tape.gradient(integral, params)
print(f"Gradients: {gradients}")
```

This example demonstrates the use of the trapezoidal rule within a TensorFlow context.  The `integrand` function is defined to accept a parameter tensor `params`, allowing gradients to be computed with respect to these parameters. The crucial aspect is that the trapezoidal rule itself is not directly differentiated; rather, its output, the integral approximation, is used for gradient calculation.


**Example 2: Monte Carlo Integration**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def monte_carlo_integration(func, a, b, n_samples, params):
  """Approximates definite integral using Monte Carlo method."""
  x = tf.random.uniform([n_samples], minval=a, maxval=b, dtype=tf.float64)
  y = func(x, params)
  integral_approx = (b - a) * tf.reduce_mean(y)
  return integral_approx


# Example usage:
a = 0.0
b = 1.0
n_samples = 10000

# Parameterized integrand (same as before)
def integrand(x, params):
  return params[0] * tf.sin(params[1] * x)

params = tf.Variable([1.0, 2.0], dtype=tf.float64)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  integral = monte_carlo_integration(integrand, a, b, n_samples, params)

gradients = tape.gradient(integral, params)
print(f"Gradients: {gradients}")

```

This example employs Monte Carlo integration, another common numerical method. The randomness introduced by `tf.random.uniform` does not hinder the gradient computation, as `tf.reduce_mean` is a differentiable operation.  However, the accuracy of both the integral and the gradient relies on the number of samples (`n_samples`).


**Example 3:  Handling Non-Differentiable Components via `tf.stop_gradient`**

In some cases, the integrand might contain non-differentiable components that need to be excluded from gradient calculation. This can be achieved using `tf.stop_gradient`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Example with a non-differentiable part in integrand
def integrand_with_nondiff(x, params):
    non_diff_part = tf.cast(x > 0.5, tf.float64)  #Heaviside Step Function
    return params[0] * tf.sin(params[1] * x) + params[2] * tf.stop_gradient(non_diff_part) #stop gradient for non diff part

params = tf.Variable([1.0, 2.0, 0.5], dtype=tf.float64)

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  integral = trapezoidal_rule(integrand_with_nondiff, 0.0, 1.0, 1000, params)

gradients = tape.gradient(integral, params)
print(f"Gradients: {gradients}")

```

This example incorporates a Heaviside step function, which is not differentiable at x=0.5. Using `tf.stop_gradient` prevents errors during backpropagation by effectively treating this part as a constant during gradient calculation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of automatic differentiation and its application in TensorFlow, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation and relevant chapters in introductory machine learning textbooks focusing on neural networks and optimization.  Furthermore,  numerical analysis textbooks covering quadrature methods (numerical integration) provide invaluable context for understanding the limitations and potential inaccuracies inherent in approximating integrals.  Finally, advanced texts on Bayesian inference are beneficial for comprehending the contexts where these techniques are often necessary.
