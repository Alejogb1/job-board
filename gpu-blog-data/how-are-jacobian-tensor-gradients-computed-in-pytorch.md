The core challenge in computing Jacobian tensor gradients in PyTorch lies in understanding the inherent dimensionality of the problem and effectively leveraging PyTorch's autograd functionality.  My experience working on high-dimensional optimization problems within the context of differentiable rendering highlighted this intricacy.  Directly computing the full Jacobian matrix for functions with large input and output dimensions becomes computationally prohibitive.  Instead, one focuses on efficiently computing specific slices or vector-Jacobian products, significantly reducing the computational burden.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Jacobian matrix represents the gradient of a vector-valued function with respect to its vector-valued input.  Consider a function  `y = f(x)`, where `x` is an input tensor of shape `(n,)` and `y` is an output tensor of shape `(m,)`. The Jacobian, denoted as `J`, is an `(m x n)` matrix where `J[i, j]` represents the partial derivative of the i-th element of `y` with respect to the j-th element of `x`, i.e., `∂y[i]/∂x[j]`.  PyTorch doesn't directly compute the full Jacobian matrix for large tensors due to its considerable memory and computational requirements, scaling quadratically with input and output dimensions.

Instead, PyTorch's `torch.autograd` efficiently computes vector-Jacobian products (VJPs) and Jacobian-vector products (JVPs).  A VJP calculates the product of a vector `v` (shape `(m,)`) and the Jacobian `J`, resulting in a vector of shape `(n,)`. This is equivalent to computing `v ⋅ ∇ₓf(x)`, where `∇ₓf(x)` represents the gradient of `f(x)` with respect to `x`.  A JVP, conversely, computes the product of the Jacobian `J` and a vector `u` (shape `(n,)`), yielding a vector of shape `(m,)`. This corresponds to computing the directional derivative of `f(x)` in the direction of `u`.

These computations leverage PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine, avoiding explicit calculation of the full Jacobian.  This is far more efficient for high-dimensional problems where computing and storing the full Jacobian is impractical.  For specific elements of the Jacobian, one can compute individual partial derivatives through targeted calls to `torch.autograd.grad`.  However, for accessing larger portions of the Jacobian, techniques leveraging VJPs and JVPs, often implemented with `torch.autograd.functional.jvp` and `torch.autograd.functional.vjp`, become necessary.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Computing a single Jacobian element using `torch.autograd.grad`:**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x**2  # y is a vector of shape (3,)

# Compute the partial derivative of y[1] with respect to x[0]
grad = torch.autograd.grad(y[1], x, create_graph=True)[0]
print(f"∂y[1]/∂x[0] = {grad[0]}")

#Further computation - example showing Hessian computation for x[0]
hessian_element = torch.autograd.grad(grad[0],x,create_graph=True)[0][0]
print(f"Hessian Element (∂²y[1]/∂x[0]²) = {hessian_element}")


```

This example demonstrates computing a single element of the Jacobian. The `create_graph=True` argument enables computation of higher-order derivatives, as showcased through Hessian calculation.  This approach is suitable for smaller problems but becomes inefficient for large Jacobians.

**Example 2: Computing the VJP using `torch.autograd.functional.vjp`:**

```python
import torch
from torch.autograd.functional import vjp

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = torch.sin(x)  # y is a vector-valued function of x
v = torch.tensor([0.5, 1.0, 0.2]) #Vector to multiply with Jacobian

vjp_result, = vjp(lambda x_: torch.sin(x_), x, v)
print(f"Vector-Jacobian product: {vjp_result}")

```

This example utilizes `vjp` to compute the vector-Jacobian product. It's significantly more efficient than computing the full Jacobian, especially for high-dimensional problems.  The lambda function defines the vector-valued function whose Jacobian we're interested in.

**Example 3: Computing the JVP using `torch.autograd.functional.jvp`:**

```python
import torch
from torch.autograd.functional import jvp

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
u = torch.tensor([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]) #Direction vector

jvp_result, = jvp(lambda x_: torch.exp(x_), x, u)
print(f"Jacobian-vector product: {jvp_result}")

```

This example demonstrates the use of `jvp` for calculating the Jacobian-vector product.  Similar to `vjp`, it avoids the explicit construction of the full Jacobian matrix. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with large-scale models where the Jacobian itself would be too large to store.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation provides comprehensive details on automatic differentiation, including the `torch.autograd` module.  Additionally, I would recommend consulting research papers on adjoint methods and automatic differentiation for a deeper theoretical understanding.  Finally, several advanced machine learning textbooks cover the intricacies of gradient computations in the context of neural networks.  Understanding the interplay between computational graphs and automatic differentiation is crucial for effective application of these techniques.  These resources, when studied in conjunction with practical experience, provide a solid foundation for mastering Jacobian tensor gradient computations within PyTorch.
