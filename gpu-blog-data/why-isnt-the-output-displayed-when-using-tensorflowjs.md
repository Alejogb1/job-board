When using TensorFlow.js (`tfjs`) and encountering a situation where model predictions do not visibly produce output after employing `tf.loadLayersModel`, the core issue often stems from how asynchronous operations are handled in JavaScript, particularly with regards to model loading and subsequent prediction execution. The model loading function `tf.loadLayersModel` returns a Promise. Consequently, model availability and prediction can only occur once this promise resolves, and any attempt to use the model before this completion will lead to unexpected behaviour. I've personally seen many developers struggle with this asynchronous nature, and its implications are frequently overlooked, which leads to silent failures.

The crux of the matter is that JavaScript code does not execute in a single sequential manner when dealing with asynchronous tasks. The `tf.loadLayersModel` function initiates a process that fetches the model's JSON structure and weights from the specified URL, which takes time depending on network conditions. The rest of the script, without special handling, will likely continue to execute *before* the model is fully loaded. Thus, attempts to perform predictions using an unloaded model will either cause an error or, more often, return undefined results silently. This problem often goes undetected because no exception is actively thrown, giving the misleading impression of correct operation.

To illustrate, consider the following incorrect example:

```javascript
// Example 1: Incorrect - Synchronous use after asynchronous load

async function runModel(){
  const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('model/model.json');
  const inputTensor = tf.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4]);
  const prediction = model.predict(inputTensor);
  console.log(prediction); // Expecting prediction tensor here

}

runModel()
console.log("Script done running");
```
In the example above, the asynchronous function runModel will execute and resolve the promise, returning and continuing the execution of the script. The message "Script done running" will appear immediately after starting the `runModel` function. Only once the `runModel` function finishes, will any output show. But there may be no output if the promise is rejected with an error.

The error here does not come from the `model.predict` call itself but from how the model is being used. The model may or may not be fully available to use once `console.log(prediction)` is called, even if the return of the promise from the asynchronous call is awaited. Specifically, `tf.loadLayersModel` initiates the fetching, parsing, and loading process. It returns a promise. While the `await` keyword can be used to resolve this promise, that only means that the model will be available *within the scope of the asynchronous function*.

This leads to the next step in addressing the issue. Even if the model is loaded, we are still dealing with tensor output. We need to extract the numerical data from this tensor output using methods such as `data()` or `array()`, which are also asynchronous and need careful handling. If these are missed, the console output will show a `tf.tensor` object instead of the numerical result.

Let's look at another illustrative example that, despite resolving the model load, will still return a tensor object and not the actual numerical data.

```javascript
// Example 2: Incorrect - Lack of data extraction

async function runModel() {
    const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('model/model.json');
    const inputTensor = tf.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4]);
    const prediction = model.predict(inputTensor);

    console.log(prediction); //  This will output a tensor, not values

}

runModel();
```

The output here will likely be a `tf.Tensor` object, not the actual numeric predictions. This is because, while `model.predict` executes correctly, it returns a tensor, and that tensor needs to be converted into a format that is readable for console output.

The corrected implementation would require extraction from the tensor via a `data` call, and await the promise it returns. Here is how the code would be modified for this case:

```javascript
// Example 3: Correct - Asynchronous model loading and data extraction

async function runModel() {
  try{
    const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('model/model.json');
    const inputTensor = tf.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4]);
    const prediction = model.predict(inputTensor);
    const predictionData = await prediction.data();
    console.log(predictionData); // Correct output
  }
  catch(err){
    console.error("Error loading model", err);
  }

}

runModel();
```

In the final example above,  the `data()` method is called and awaited. This resolves the final piece of the puzzle, extracting the actual numeric values from the tensor and allowing them to be displayed to the console. Note also that I've added a `try`/`catch` block to handle potential exceptions raised during model loading. These can be particularly useful for debugging network connectivity issues.

In conclusion, debugging issues where no output is displayed when using `tf.loadLayersModel` and `model.predict` is not related to the model or its prediction, but is a symptom of insufficient management of JavaScript's asynchronous operations and lack of tensor data extraction. To correctly display results, the following steps must be carefully followed: firstly, await the `tf.loadLayersModel` promise ensuring the model is fully loaded; secondly, extract the prediction data using the `data()` or `array()` method, awaiting the promise it returns; finally, implement proper error handling to account for situations where the model cannot be loaded. Proper understanding and implementation of these steps avoids the frustrating silent failures frequently encountered by new `tfjs` users.

For additional learning, I recommend focusing on resources that cover JavaScript's asynchronous programming paradigms, including Promises and `async`/`await`. Also explore materials that give an in-depth understanding of `tf.Tensor` objects and the various ways to interact with them, such as the methods for data extraction. Look for examples of asynchronous programming workflows. The official TensorFlow.js documentation, along with tutorials focused on JavaScript Promises and the async/await syntax are invaluable. These resources will give you the required foundations to properly manage asynchronous operations and effectively extract numerical data from TensorFlow.js tensors.
