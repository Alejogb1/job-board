PyTorch’s tensor operations, designed for GPU acceleration, offer optimized methods for counting element occurrences, making a conversion to NumPy unnecessary and often inefficient for large tensors. The key lies in leveraging PyTorch’s broadcasting and element-wise comparison capabilities. I’ve frequently encountered situations where avoiding the CPU roundtrip for large tensors significantly reduces computation time during model training and evaluation.

**Core Technique: Boolean Masking and Summation**

The fundamental approach hinges on creating a boolean mask by comparing the original tensor with each unique value and then summing the `True` values, which represent the occurrences of that specific value. This avoids iterative approaches which are slow on GPUs. The process can be broken down into the following steps:

1.  **Identify Unique Values:** We first need to obtain a list or tensor of all unique values present within the input tensor. This is crucial because we'll be iterating over these unique values. PyTorch’s `torch.unique()` function provides an optimized method for achieving this efficiently.
2.  **Generate Boolean Masks:** For each unique value, we create a boolean mask by comparing the original tensor against that value using the element-wise equality operator (`==`). This operation results in a new tensor of the same shape as the original, where `True` indicates elements matching the current unique value and `False` otherwise. The broadcasting rules in PyTorch ensure this operation is element-wise, even for tensors of different shapes.
3.  **Sum the Masks:** Each boolean mask can be summed to count how many `True` values there are, giving the number of occurrences of the respective unique value. Summing a boolean tensor is directly supported in PyTorch and is efficiently computed on the designated device.
4. **Combine and Return Results**: Finally, results can be combined in a tensor or dictionary representing the counts of each unique value.

**Code Example 1: Simple 1D Tensor**

```python
import torch

def count_occurrences_1d(tensor):
    """Counts occurrences of unique values in a 1D tensor.

    Args:
        tensor: A 1D PyTorch tensor.

    Returns:
        A tuple of (unique_values, counts) tensors.
    """
    unique_values = torch.unique(tensor)
    counts = torch.zeros_like(unique_values, dtype=torch.int64)

    for i, val in enumerate(unique_values):
       counts[i] = (tensor == val).sum()

    return unique_values, counts


# Example usage:
data = torch.tensor([1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1])
unique_vals, counts = count_occurrences_1d(data)
print("Unique Values:", unique_vals)
print("Counts:", counts)

```

This first example is straightforward. It demonstrates the basic mechanics for a 1D tensor. First, `torch.unique()` gets the distinct values from the input `tensor`. Then, we loop through each unique value, create the boolean mask using `(tensor == val)`, and sum it to obtain the count. This approach iterates over the unique values instead of the entire tensor to avoid redundant comparisons. While concise, it should be noted that this is still less efficient than broadcasting all masks at once.

**Code Example 2:  General N-Dimensional Tensor**

```python
import torch

def count_occurrences_nd(tensor):
    """Counts occurrences of unique values in an N-dimensional tensor.

    Args:
        tensor: An N-dimensional PyTorch tensor.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are unique values and values are counts.
    """
    unique_values = torch.unique(tensor)
    counts = {}


    for val in unique_values:
        mask = (tensor == val)
        counts[val.item()] = mask.sum().item() # use .item() for dictionary keys

    return counts

# Example usage:
data = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 2], [3, 1, 4], [2, 3, 1]])
counts = count_occurrences_nd(data)
print("Counts:", counts)

```

This function extends the previous example to N-dimensional tensors.  The core logic using boolean masks and sums remains consistent. The primary change is how the results are stored. Instead of returning parallel tensors of values and counts, we return a dictionary where each unique value serves as a key mapped to its count. The usage of `.item()` is crucial when the unique value is being used as a key in a Python dictionary; this explicitly extracts a Python scalar value from the one-element tensor.

**Code Example 3: Optimization using Broadcasting**

```python
import torch

def count_occurrences_optimized(tensor):
  """Counts occurrences of unique values using broadcasting optimization.

  Args:
    tensor: An N-dimensional PyTorch tensor.

  Returns:
    A tuple of (unique_values, counts) tensors.
  """
  unique_values = torch.unique(tensor)
  masks = (tensor == unique_values.view(-1, *[1]*tensor.ndim))
  counts = masks.sum(dim=tuple(range(1, masks.ndim)))

  return unique_values, counts

# Example Usage:
data = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 2], [3, 1, 4], [2, 3, 1]])
unique_vals, counts = count_occurrences_optimized(data)
print("Unique Values:", unique_vals)
print("Counts:", counts)
```

This third example optimizes further by using PyTorch broadcasting. Here, the unique values tensor `unique_values` is reshaped to have the same number of dimensions as the input `tensor`. When compared, the input `tensor` is effectively compared to all unique values simultaneously, generating a tensor of masks. This avoids explicit Python loops by using broadcasting to compare all values against all unique values simultaneously on the GPU.  We then sum along all dimensions except the first which correspond to the different values, using `dim=tuple(range(1, masks.ndim))`. This is generally more efficient than the previous two examples, particularly when dealing with many unique values or large input tensors.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of PyTorch tensor operations and optimization strategies, I recommend exploring the official PyTorch documentation. Specifically, focus on the sections covering:

*   **Tensor Creation and Manipulation:** Understanding tensor creation, indexing, and reshaping are fundamental for efficiently working with PyTorch.

*   **Broadcasting Semantics:** Comprehending how PyTorch handles element-wise operations between tensors of differing shapes is essential for optimizing code.

*   **Element-wise Operations:** Understanding the various element-wise comparison operators (`==`, `<`, `>`, etc.) and their optimized implementations.

*   **Reduction Operations:** Review the `torch.sum()` operation as well as other reduction functions and the `dim` argument for their optimal use across different tensor shapes.

*   **`torch.unique()`:** Familiarizing oneself with the functionality of this operation and its optional parameters.

Additionally, consulting any advanced tutorials or research papers that focus on high-performance tensor computations using PyTorch, and studying examples from models in the TorchVision or Huggingface libraries can provide practical insights. Examining open-source code is often the best learning environment.
