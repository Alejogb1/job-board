Preventing Keras from calculating metrics during training, while retaining those metrics for evaluation, involves strategic configuration of the model and its training procedure. I've encountered this issue frequently in situations where training speed is critical, such as when experimenting with large datasets or computationally expensive models. The core of the solution lies in understanding how Keras handles `metrics` during `model.compile()` and subsequent training. Keras computes these metrics after each batch (or epoch) during the training process, and for large, intricate models, this calculation introduces a significant overhead. It's vital to understand that the metrics are not inherently necessary for model *training* itself; they are primarily tools to monitor performance.

When you specify metrics in `model.compile()`, Keras by default computes and accumulates these values across batches during training epochs. These values are then displayed during the training progress. However, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score, while informative, don’t contribute to the optimization of the model’s trainable weights. The backpropagation process only relies on the loss function’s gradient, not the metric values. This distinction allows us to decouple the metric calculation from the training loop.

To prevent metric calculation during training, we leverage Keras' ability to accept metrics as functions or strings. Specifically, we define metrics only for the evaluation phase and not for the training. While this might seem counterintuitive, the training logic only uses the loss values for optimization. Here's how this works in practice: we avoid specifying the `metrics` argument during the `compile()` step and instead pass it to the `model.evaluate()` function. Consequently, the metrics are calculated only when explicitly called for during evaluation or after training completion. This eliminates the overhead during the training loops, leading to faster iteration times.

Here’s the implementation with concrete examples:

**Example 1: Basic Model without Training Metrics**

This example demonstrates how to define a simple model and train it without computing metrics during training.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Generate dummy data
np.random.seed(42)
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(1000, 1))
X_test = np.random.rand(200, 10)
y_test = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(200, 1))

# Define a simple model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model, no metrics specified for training
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Train the model (notice no metric output during training)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=1)

# Evaluate the model with metrics (only here are metrics calculated)
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test Loss: {loss:.4f}, Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

In this code, the crucial part is `model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')`. No metrics are specified. Consequently, the output during `model.fit()` does not display accuracy values.  When `model.evaluate()` is invoked after training, loss and accuracy values for the test set are computed. By decoupling the metrics from training, we gain performance. The data generation is done purely to ensure the code is executable. The focus remains on the absence of metric calculation during training.

**Example 2: Using Callbacks for Evaluation with Metrics**

While the previous example avoids metric calculations, in practical scenarios, it's desirable to monitor metrics during the training process without adding overhead by calculating them after each batch. Keras' callbacks can handle this, allowing us to calculate metrics periodically, often at the end of an epoch.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Data is the same as example 1

class MetricCallback(keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def __init__(self, test_data, metrics):
        super().__init__()
        self.test_data = test_data
        self.metrics = metrics

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        x_test, y_test = self.test_data
        results = self.model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
        for i, metric in enumerate(self.metrics):
            print(f"{metric}: {results[i+1]:.4f}", end=', ')  #Skip loss for printing metric
        print() # Newline


# Define a simple model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model, no metrics specified
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Instantiate the custom callback
metric_callback = MetricCallback(test_data=(X_test, y_test), metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model, evaluating metrics after each epoch using callback
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=1, callbacks=[metric_callback])

```

Here, we define a custom callback `MetricCallback` that evaluates the model on the test set at the end of each training epoch. The `model.compile()` call still doesn't include metrics. The callback retrieves the test data and computes the specified metrics using `model.evaluate()`. This approach lets us monitor the metrics’ progress during training without the overhead of metric computations after each training batch.  The output will display metrics only at the end of each epoch. Note that this solution still performs a full evaluation pass on the entire test set, which may be computationally expensive for very large datasets.

**Example 3: Custom Training Loop**

For the most control, and to completely avoid Keras’ metric computation during training, you can implement a custom training loop. This approach grants explicit control over each step and makes the most efficient use of resources.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

# Data is same as example 1

# Define a simple model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Define optimizer
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()


@tf.function
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(x, training=True)
        loss = loss_fn(y, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

# Training loop
epochs = 10
batch_size = 32
num_batches = X_train.shape[0] // batch_size

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in range(num_batches):
        x_batch = X_train[batch * batch_size: (batch + 1) * batch_size]
        y_batch = y_train[batch * batch_size: (batch + 1) * batch_size]
        loss = train_step(x_batch, y_batch)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Training loss: {loss:.4f}")

# Evaluate the model with metrics (only here metrics calculated)
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test Loss: {loss:.4f}, Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

```

Here, we use a `tf.GradientTape` to compute the gradients.  The `train_step` function is decorated with `@tf.function` to enhance its performance. Crucially, we do not compute any metrics during the training loop. This loop focuses solely on calculating and applying gradients based on the loss function. The metrics are evaluated using `model.evaluate()` only after training, as in the first example. The training loss is simply used for validation of the training process, not for model optimization. Custom training loops, although more verbose, afford the most flexibility and control.

**Resource Recommendations**

To deepen understanding and explore additional techniques, I recommend referring to the following resources:

*   The TensorFlow documentation offers a comprehensive guide to custom training loops and callbacks. The sections on `tf.GradientTape` and custom callbacks are particularly pertinent.
*   Keras documentation provides detailed information on the `model.compile()` method, including how metrics are handled, and the use of callbacks.
*   Books focusing on advanced deep learning techniques and optimization often address the topic of separating training optimization from performance monitoring. These sources can be found at libraries, both digital and physical.

These examples highlight different methods to circumvent Keras' default behavior of metric calculations during training. The approach depends on the desired level of control and complexity. By either omitting metric specifications in `compile`, using callbacks for periodic evaluation, or building custom training loops, one can substantially enhance training speed while retaining metric evaluations at desired intervals.
