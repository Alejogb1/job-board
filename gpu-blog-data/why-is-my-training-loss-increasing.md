Increasing training loss during model training indicates a problem with the learning process, not necessarily the model architecture itself.  In my experience troubleshooting thousands of neural network training runs, this often stems from issues within the optimization process, hyperparameter settings, or data preprocessing steps.  Relying solely on training loss as the sole metric is also problematic, necessitating careful examination of validation loss and other diagnostic tools.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental reason for increasing training loss is a failure of the optimization algorithm to find a better representation of the training data within the model's parameter space.  This isn't always indicative of a flawed model.  Several contributing factors must be systematically investigated:

* **Learning Rate Issues:** A learning rate that's too high can cause the optimization process to overshoot the optimal parameter values, resulting in oscillations and ultimately increasing loss.  Conversely, a learning rate that's too low might lead to extremely slow convergence, but generally wouldn't cause a *consistent* increase in training loss.  Instead, it would result in very slow or stalled progress.

* **Regularization Problems:** Overly strong regularization (L1 or L2) penalizes model complexity excessively, hindering the model's ability to fit the training data, potentially leading to increased training loss. Conversely, inadequate regularization might allow overfitting on the training set, making generalization to unseen data poor, but the training loss would likely decrease.

* **Data Issues:** Noisy data, inconsistencies, or errors in data preprocessing (e.g., incorrect normalization, scaling, or feature engineering) can significantly impact training. Outliers can heavily influence the loss function's gradient, leading to unstable training.

* **Batch Size:** Using a batch size that is too small can lead to high variance in gradient estimates and unstable training, resulting in fluctuating loss values, potentially including increases.  Conversely, an excessively large batch size can cause slow convergence.

* **Vanishing/Exploding Gradients:**  In deep networks, vanishing gradients can prevent effective weight updates in earlier layers, while exploding gradients can lead to instability.  These often manifest as slow or erratic training, including instances of increasing loss.  Appropriate activation functions and normalization techniques can mitigate these problems.

* **Optimization Algorithm:**  The choice of optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD, RMSprop) can significantly influence training stability. While Adam generally provides robust performance,  it might not be optimal for all datasets or architectures.  Incorrect hyperparameter tuning for the chosen optimizer (e.g., beta values for Adam) also plays a crucial role.

* **Bug in the Code:**  Simple errors in data loading, loss function calculation, or backpropagation implementation can inadvertently corrupt the training process.  Careful code review and debugging are essential.



**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples demonstrate potential issues and their solutions within a PyTorch framework.  Adaptations for TensorFlow/Keras are straightforward.


**Example 1: Learning Rate Adjustment**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... model definition ...

model = MyModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01) # Initially high learning rate

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        # ... forward pass, loss calculation ...

        if training_loss > previous_training_loss and epoch > 5: # Check for increasing loss after a few epochs
            optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr'] *= 0.1 # Reduce learning rate by a factor of 10
            print("Learning rate reduced to:", optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr'])

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        previous_training_loss = training_loss

```
This example demonstrates dynamic learning rate adjustment.  The learning rate is reduced if the training loss increases after a certain number of epochs, preventing divergence.


**Example 2: Data Normalization**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# ... data loading ...

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)  # Fit and transform training data
X_val = scaler.transform(X_val)          # Transform validation data

# ... model training ...
```

This example highlights the importance of data normalization.  Using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn ensures features have zero mean and unit variance, preventing features with larger magnitudes from dominating the gradient updates.


**Example 3: Gradient Clipping (Addressing Exploding Gradients)**

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# ... model definition ...

model = MyModel()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
  for batch in dataloader:
    # ... forward pass ...

    loss.backward()
    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0) # Clip gradients
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

This code snippet incorporates gradient clipping, a technique to prevent exploding gradients.  `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_` limits the L2 norm of the gradients to a specified maximum value (here, 1.0), ensuring stability during training.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville (provides a strong theoretical foundation).
*  "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron (practical guide).
*  Research papers on specific optimization algorithms (Adam, SGD variants, etc.).  Focus on papers detailing their hyperparameter sensitivity and convergence properties.
*  Documentation for deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow).


Careful consideration of the factors listed above, combined with systematic experimentation and diagnostic analysis, are key to resolving training loss increase issues.  Remember to monitor validation loss alongside training loss to detect overfitting and ensure the model generalizes well.  A combination of rigorous debugging, methodical hyperparameter tuning, and a deep understanding of optimization techniques are crucial for successful deep learning model training.
