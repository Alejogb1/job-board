The discrepancy you're observing in TensorFlow regarding image batch cropping, where a batch of shape [5] is produced when an axis-0 dimension of 4 is expected, almost certainly stems from an incongruence between the intended input shape and the actual shape of the data fed into the TensorFlow operation.  Over the years, I've debugged numerous instances of this, primarily originating from data preprocessing inconsistencies or misunderstandings about TensorFlow's broadcasting behavior.  The root cause rarely lies in a fundamental flaw within TensorFlow itself; instead, it's almost always a problem with data handling preceding the TensorFlow operation.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow, like many deep learning frameworks, is highly sensitive to data shapes. Operations like slicing, cropping, and batching are rigidly defined based on the dimensions provided.  If the input tensor's shape doesn't align precisely with the expectations of the operation, unexpected behavior, such as the cropping to a [5] batch from an expected [4] batch, will result.

The most frequent culprit is a mismatch between the expected number of samples (the first dimension, axis 0) and the actual number of samples present in the input data. This might manifest in several ways:

* **Incorrect Data Loading:**  Your data loading process might inadvertently load an extra sample, or conversely, fail to load a necessary sample. This is especially common with file I/O operations where edge cases, such as corrupted files or empty directories, are not adequately handled.
* **Data Augmentation Errors:** If you are performing data augmentation (e.g., random cropping, flipping), a bug in your augmentation pipeline might lead to the generation of an extra or fewer images than intended.
* **Preprocessing Oversights:** Functions applied during preprocessing might inadvertently alter the number of samples.  For instance, a filter operation that removes images based on certain criteria could unintentionally decrease the sample count.
* **Dimension Misinterpretation:** A more subtle issue is the misinterpretation of the tensor's shape.  Sometimes, a dimension representing something other than the sample count (e.g., a channel dimension in an image) might be mistakenly treated as the batch size.

To resolve this, a meticulous examination of your data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation steps is vital.  Print statements strategically placed throughout these pipelines are exceptionally useful for identifying the precise point where the shape discrepancy occurs.  Moreover, employing assertion checks to verify the expected shape at various stages ensures early detection of shape inconsistencies.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Here are three examples illustrating potential scenarios and debugging strategies:

**Example 1: Incorrect Data Loading**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate incorrect data loading - an extra sample is loaded
data = np.random.rand(5, 28, 28, 1) #Incorrectly loaded 5 samples instead of 4

# Define a placeholder for the input images (correct expected shape)
input_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[4, 28, 28, 1])

# Attempt to process the data. This will cause a shape mismatch error.
with tf.Session() as sess:
    try:
        sess.run(tf.identity(input_placeholder), feed_dict={input_placeholder: data})
    except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
        print("TensorFlow Error:", e) # This will explicitly print the shape mismatch error.
        print("Shape of loaded data:", data.shape) #Highlighting the problem
```

This example showcases how loading an incorrect number of images (5 instead of 4) directly leads to a TensorFlow error when attempting to feed the data to a placeholder expecting a different shape. The error message will clearly indicate the shape mismatch.

**Example 2: Data Augmentation Issue**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Simulate data augmentation that generates an extra sample
original_data = np.random.rand(4, 28, 28, 1)
augmented_data = np.concatenate((original_data, np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 1)), axis=0) # Adds an extra sample

#Further processing will lead to a [5] batch size
# ... (TensorFlow processing pipeline using augmented_data) ...
print("Augmented data shape:", augmented_data.shape) # Showcases the incorrect shape
```

Here, a faulty augmentation step adds an extra sample, resulting in an unexpected batch size.  Explicitly printing the `augmented_data` shape highlights the problem's origin.

**Example 3:  Preprocessing Filter**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

data = np.random.rand(4, 28, 28, 1)
#Simulate removing a sample based on a (random in this case) condition
filtered_data = data[np.random.rand(4) > 0.5]

#Further processing will be impacted
print("Shape of filtered data:", filtered_data.shape) #Note the potentially altered shape
# ... (TensorFlow processing pipeline using filtered_data) ...
```
This example shows how a preprocessing filter (here, a random filter for illustrative purposes) can unexpectedly reduce the number of samples, leading to an incorrect batch size in subsequent TensorFlow operations.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on tensor manipulation and data handling.  Pay particular attention to sections covering tensor shapes, broadcasting, and common data preprocessing techniques.  Additionally, consult debugging guides and tutorials specific to TensorFlow to learn effective techniques for identifying shape-related issues.  Finally, a thorough understanding of NumPy array manipulation is crucial, as NumPy is often used for data preprocessing before feeding it to TensorFlow.  Careful study of error messages, leveraging print statements and assertions, will significantly aid in pinpointing the exact location of the problem.
