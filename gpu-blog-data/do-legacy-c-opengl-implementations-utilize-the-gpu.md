The assertion that legacy C++ OpenGL implementations *do not* utilize the GPU is fundamentally incorrect.  While the level of GPU utilization and the abstraction provided varied significantly across different implementations and OpenGL versions (specifically pre-3.0), the core function of OpenGL, even in its earliest forms, was to offload rendering tasks to the graphics processing unit.  My experience working on several projects in the early 2000s, involving porting and optimizing rendering engines from fixed-function pipeline OpenGL 1.x to more programmable shader-based approaches, confirmed this repeatedly. The misunderstanding likely stems from the indirect nature of the interaction and the varying degrees of control offered to developers.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Early OpenGL implementations relied heavily on the fixed-function pipeline. This means a significant portion of the rendering process, including transformations (model, view, projection), lighting calculations, texturing, and rasterization, was handled by pre-programmed hardware functions within the GPU. The developer's interaction was primarily through function calls that specified the parameters for these fixed operations.  For instance, setting up a light source involved calling `glLightfv`, which sent the light data to the GPU.  Similarly, texture application was managed through calls like `glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D)` and `glTexImage2D`, instructing the GPU to use and load a specific texture.

The perceived lack of direct GPU control in legacy OpenGL stems from the absence of explicit shader programming.  Modern OpenGL and other APIs like DirectX heavily leverage programmable shaders (vertex and fragment shaders), which grant developers granular control over the GPU's behavior through custom GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) or HLSL (High-Level Shading Language) code.  In contrast, the fixed-function pipeline of legacy OpenGL abstracted away shader development; however, this abstraction didn't imply that the GPU was bypassed. Instead, it meant that the GPU executed pre-defined shader programs inherent to its architecture.

The key distinction is between *direct* and *indirect* GPU utilization. Legacy OpenGL employed indirect utilization via the fixed-function pipeline.  While the developer didn't write shaders explicitly, the GPU was still fundamentally responsible for processing the geometrical data, lighting, texturing, and rasterization—operations it performs far more efficiently than a CPU.  This is crucial for real-time rendering.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Triangle Rendering (OpenGL 1.x)**

```c++
#include <GL/gl.h>
#include <GL/glu.h> // For gluPerspective (often used even in fixed-function)

void display() {
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT); // GPU-accelerated clear
    glLoadIdentity(); // Reset modelview matrix

    glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES); // Start rendering primitives
    glColor3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f); // Set color (sent to GPU)
    glVertex3f(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f); // Vertex data (sent to GPU)
    glColor3f(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);
    glVertex3f(-1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f);
    glColor3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
    glVertex3f(1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f);
    glEnd(); // End rendering primitives

    glFlush(); // Forces execution (but GPU does the actual drawing)
}

int main(...) {
  // ... OpenGL initialization ...
  glutDisplayFunc(display);
  glutMainLoop();
  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** Even this rudimentary example implicitly uses the GPU. `glClear` clears the framebuffer (a GPU operation).  `glVertex3f` sends vertex data to the GPU's vertex processing pipeline.  `glColor3f` sets the color, which is used in the rasterization stage performed by the GPU. `glFlush` is a synchronization call, ensuring that the CPU waits for the GPU to finish the operations it queued. The rendering itself happens entirely on the GPU.

**Example 2: Enabling Texturing (OpenGL 1.x)**

```c++
GLuint textureID;

// ... texture loading omitted for brevity ... glTexImage2D(...)

glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D); // Enable texturing (GPU operation)
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, textureID); // Bind texture (GPU operation)

glBegin(GL_QUADS); // Rendering textured quad
    // ... vertex coordinates and texture coordinates ...
glEnd();

glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D); // Disable texturing (GPU operation)
```

**Commentary:**  This code snippet explicitly demonstrates GPU interaction. `glEnable` and `glDisable` directly control texture processing on the GPU. `glBindTexture` selects the texture to be applied, another GPU-level action.  The actual texture application and blending happen within the GPU's fixed-function pipeline during rasterization.

**Example 3:  Lighting (OpenGL 1.x) – Indirect GPU Utilization**


```c++
GLfloat lightAmbient[] = { 0.2f, 0.2f, 0.2f, 1.0f };
GLfloat lightDiffuse[] = { 0.8f, 0.8f, 0.8f, 1.0f };
GLfloat lightPosition[] = { 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f };

glLightfv(GL_LIGHT0, GL_AMBIENT, lightAmbient);
glLightfv(GL_LIGHT0, GL_DIFFUSE, lightDiffuse);
glLightfv(GL_LIGHT0, GL_POSITION, lightPosition);
glEnable(GL_LIGHTING);
glEnable(GL_LIGHT0);
```

**Commentary:**  This section sets up a light source using `glLightfv`.  While not explicitly writing shader code, the provided light parameters are directly used by the GPU's built-in lighting calculations within the fixed-function pipeline. Enabling lighting via `glEnable(GL_LIGHTING)` activates the GPU's dedicated lighting hardware. The calculation of lighting effects on the vertices occurs within the GPU itself.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of legacy OpenGL, I recommend consulting the original OpenGL specification documents (covering versions 1.x to 2.x).  These provide detailed explanations of the fixed-function pipeline and the functionality of each function call.  Furthermore, studying older OpenGL textbooks and tutorials focusing on the fixed-function pipeline will provide valuable insight into the underlying GPU interactions despite the lack of explicit shader programming.  Finally, examining the source code of open-source game engines or rendering libraries from that era can reveal how developers interacted with the GPU indirectly through the OpenGL API.  These resources, while potentially difficult to locate, are essential for a complete understanding of how legacy OpenGL utilized – and did not bypass – the GPU.
