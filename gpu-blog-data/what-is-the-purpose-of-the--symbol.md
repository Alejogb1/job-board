The `@` symbol in TensorFlow, specifically within the context of Python, serves as the operator for matrix multiplication, as distinct from element-wise multiplication. This distinction is critical in deep learning and linear algebra applications where matrix operations are fundamental. I encountered this firsthand during my work developing a convolutional neural network for image classification. Initially, I mistakenly used `*` for matrix products, leading to severely incorrect results and highlighting the importance of precise operator usage in TensorFlow.

In Python, the `*` operator performs element-wise multiplication when applied to NumPy arrays or TensorFlow tensors. This means that corresponding elements in the two operands are multiplied together. For example, if you have two tensors, `a = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and `b = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]`, `a * b` results in `[[5, 12], [21, 32]]`. This is not the desired behavior for many linear algebra operations, such as the calculation of intermediate activations in neural networks, where matrix multiplication, adhering to defined rules of row-by-column products, is required.

The `@` symbol, introduced in Python 3.5 as the infix operator for `__matmul__` or matrix multiplication, directly addresses this issue. When used with TensorFlow tensors, it invokes TensorFlow's optimized matrix multiplication routines, which involve significantly different computation logic than element-wise operations. These routines ensure proper alignment of rows and columns and aggregate the products according to linear algebra rules. Using `@` on the same tensors `a` and `b` as before results in `[[19, 22], [43, 50]]`, the correct matrix product.

The following three code examples illustrate the behavior of `@` and the distinction from element-wise multiplication:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example 1: Basic 2x2 Matrix Multiplication
matrix_a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]], dtype=tf.float32)
matrix_b = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Element-wise multiplication (incorrect for matrix product)
element_product = matrix_a * matrix_b
print("Element-wise product:\n", element_product.numpy())

# Matrix multiplication (correct)
matrix_product = matrix_a @ matrix_b
print("Matrix product:\n", matrix_product.numpy())

```

In this first example, I defined two 2x2 tensors. Using the `*` operator generates the element-wise product, where each element is the product of elements at the same index.  The `@` operator produces the matrix product according to the standard rules of matrix algebra. The output clarifies the difference, demonstrating that the result from element-wise multiplication is not appropriate when aiming for a matrix product. This snippet highlights the fundamental difference in how these operators manipulate the tensors.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example 2: Matrix Multiplication in a Layer of a Neural Network
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
weight_matrix = tf.constant([[0.5, 0.2], [0.1, 0.6], [0.3, 0.1]], dtype=tf.float32)
bias_vector = tf.constant([0.1, 0.2], dtype=tf.float32)

# Incorrect usage: Element-wise multiplication is not appropriate here.
# This will throw an error because the shapes are not compatible for element-wise multiplication
#element_layer = input_tensor * weight_matrix  #This line will cause a broadcast error


# Correct usage: Matrix multiplication
layer_output = input_tensor @ weight_matrix + bias_vector
print("Layer output:\n", layer_output.numpy())

```

Example two simulates a single layer operation within a neural network. The `input_tensor` represents an input vector to the layer. `weight_matrix` represents the weights connecting the input to the layer, and `bias_vector` represents the biases of the layer's nodes. If we had mistakenly tried to use `*` the operation would be invalid due to mismatched shapes.  However, with the `@` operator, matrix multiplication is carried out correctly, then the bias vector is added. This snippet illustrates how `@` is essential for correctly applying weights and calculating intermediate values in neural networks and highlights why `*` would not work in this context.  It exemplifies the critical application of the matrix multiplication operator in a practical deep learning context.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example 3: Matrix Transposition and Multiplication
matrix_c = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Matrix transpose and self-multiplication using @
matrix_c_transposed = tf.transpose(matrix_c)
result_matrix = matrix_c @ matrix_c_transposed
print("Result matrix (using matrix product):\n", result_matrix.numpy())

#Illustrating Element wise multiplication on transposed matrix
element_wise_result = matrix_c * tf.transpose(matrix_c) #will trigger a broadcast error.
#This is because of shape mismatch of the matrices for element wise multiplication

```

In example three, I demonstrate the use of matrix transpose alongside `@`.  First, I define a matrix `matrix_c`, then transpose it using `tf.transpose`. I then compute the matrix product of `matrix_c` and its transpose using the `@` operator. The result is a correct matrix product according to matrix algebra. An attempt at element wise multiplication shows the shape mismatch error which is the incorrect operation in this scenario. The inclusion of matrix transpose before the use of `@` shows another essential context in linear algebra operations, and reemphasizes the incorrectness of using `*` when a matrix product is required.

Beyond these practical examples, there are several crucial considerations.  First, while element-wise operations are often vectorized and hence fast, matrix multiplication is often computationally intensive, making optimization critical. TensorFlow takes advantage of optimized libraries such as BLAS to provide efficient matrix multiplication implementations through the `@` operator. Second, the proper understanding and use of the `@` symbol are critical for debugging models. An incorrect choice here can lead to models that do not converge or produce invalid results, as I experienced during my earlier neural network development. This requires practitioners to thoroughly understand linear algebra principles and how TensorFlow implements matrix operations.  Furthermore, the dimensions of the tensors involved in matrix multiplication have to match the rules for matrix algebra, or TensorFlow will return an error. It's crucial to align rows and columns correctly to prevent unexpected behaviors.

For further exploration and comprehension, I recommend several resources. The official TensorFlow documentation is an invaluable asset, providing detailed explanations of its operations and functions. "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville offers a strong theoretical basis for understanding matrix operations within the context of deep learning. Additionally, numerous online courses available through platforms like Coursera, edX, and Udacity, offer hands-on training that directly helps solidify the practical application of these concepts and operators. The key to fully grasping the role of `@` is repeated practice and a consistent review of foundational linear algebra and matrix operations. This, coupled with practical experience in building neural networks and utilizing TensorFlow, will lead to a thorough understanding.
