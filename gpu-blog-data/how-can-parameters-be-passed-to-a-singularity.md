Passing parameters to a Singularity container from a Jupyter-Docker environment requires a nuanced understanding of both container technologies and their respective execution mechanisms.  Crucially, the method hinges on leveraging Docker's capabilities to manage the environment in which Singularity operates, rather than attempting direct communication between the two container runtimes.  Direct inter-container communication is generally discouraged due to security and complexity considerations. My experience working on large-scale genomics pipelines, where Singularity was essential for reproducible bioinformatics workflows within a Dockerized JupyterHub environment, underscored this point.

The solution involves a two-step process: first, passing parameters into the Docker environment hosting the Jupyter Notebook; second, using these parameters to construct the Singularity execution command within the notebook. This approach ensures that the parameters are securely handled and accessible within the isolated Singularity container environment.

**1. Parameter Passing into the Docker Environment:**

This stage leverages standard Docker runtime arguments.  When launching the Docker image containing your Jupyter environment, use environment variables or command-line arguments to inject the desired parameters.  These parameters can then be accessed within the Jupyter Notebook itself.  Environment variables offer better encapsulation and maintainability for complex parameter sets.

**2. Constructing the Singularity Execution Command:**

Within your Jupyter Notebook, access the parameters passed from the Docker environment. These will be accessible via `os.environ` (for environment variables) or via `sys.argv` (for command-line arguments). Construct the Singularity `exec` command dynamically, incorporating these parameters as arguments to your Singularity container.  This ensures the parameters are passed directly to the application running *inside* the Singularity container.

**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Using Environment Variables**

```python
import os
import subprocess

# Access parameters passed as environment variables.  These were set when the Docker image launched.
param1 = os.environ.get("PARAM1", "default_value1")
param2 = os.environ.get("PARAM2", "default_value2")

# Construct the Singularity execution command dynamically.
singularity_command = ["singularity", "exec", "/path/to/my.sif", "/path/to/my/application", param1, param2]

# Execute the Singularity container.  Check the return code for errors.
process = subprocess.Popen(singularity_command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
stdout, stderr = process.communicate()

# Handle output and errors
if process.returncode == 0:
    print("Singularity container executed successfully. Output:\n", stdout.decode())
else:
    print("Error executing Singularity container. Error:\n", stderr.decode())

```

This example demonstrates the robust method of using environment variables.  The `os.environ.get()` function provides a safe way to retrieve parameters, handling cases where a parameter might be missing. The use of `subprocess.Popen` allows for capturing both standard output and standard error streams, crucial for debugging.


**Example 2: Using Command-Line Arguments (less preferred)**

```python
import sys
import subprocess

# Access parameters passed as command-line arguments. Less secure than environment variables.
if len(sys.argv) < 3:
    print("Usage: python script.py <param1> <param2>")
    sys.exit(1)

param1 = sys.argv[1]
param2 = sys.argv[2]

# Construct the Singularity execution command.
singularity_command = ["singularity", "exec", "/path/to/my.sif", "/path/to/my/application", param1, param2]

# Execute the command and handle output/errors (same as Example 1).
process = subprocess.Popen(singularity_command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
stdout, stderr = process.communicate()

if process.returncode == 0:
    print("Singularity container executed successfully. Output:\n", stdout.decode())
else:
    print("Error executing Singularity container. Error:\n", stderr.decode())
```

While functional, this method is less secure and less maintainable than using environment variables, especially for multiple parameters.  Error handling remains crucial.

**Example 3:  Handling complex parameter structures using JSON**


```python
import os
import subprocess
import json

# Assume parameters are passed as a JSON string in the environment variable PARAM_JSON
param_json_str = os.environ.get("PARAM_JSON", "{}")

try:
    params = json.loads(param_json_str)
    param1 = params.get("param1", "default_value1")
    param2 = params.get("param2", "default_value2")
    param3 = params.get("param3", "default_value3")

    # Construct the Singularity command, handling potential missing parameters gracefully
    singularity_command = ["singularity", "exec", "/path/to/my.sif", "/path/to/my/application", param1, param2, param3]


    process = subprocess.Popen(singularity_command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    stdout, stderr = process.communicate()

    if process.returncode == 0:
        print("Singularity container executed successfully. Output:\n", stdout.decode())
    else:
        print("Error executing Singularity container. Error:\n", stderr.decode())

except json.JSONDecodeError:
    print("Error decoding JSON parameter string.")
    sys.exit(1)
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"Missing required parameter: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)
```

This sophisticated example leverages JSON for structured parameter passing.  This is particularly beneficial when dealing with numerous or nested parameters.  It includes robust error handling for JSON decoding and missing keys.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For further study, I recommend consulting the official documentation for Singularity and Docker.  A good understanding of Python's `subprocess` module is also crucial.  Additionally, review materials on secure coding practices when handling external inputs.  Finally, exploring container orchestration tools like Kubernetes can provide further insights into managing complex containerized workflows.
