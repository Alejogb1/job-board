Autograd, the core mechanism behind backpropagation in deep learning frameworks, fundamentally operates by constructing a computational graph that tracks operations performed on tensors. When calculating element-wise gradients, this graph structure enables a precise and efficient reverse pass, differentiating functions at their most granular level. My experience implementing custom layers in frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow has shown that understanding this mechanism is crucial for debugging and optimization.

The process begins during the forward pass. As tensors undergo various mathematical operations, like addition, multiplication, or more complex functions, the framework not only computes the resulting tensor but also records each operation as a node within the computational graph. These nodes store references to their input tensors (operands) and the specific function that was applied. Crucially, each node also stores the derivative of the function with respect to each of its inputs. For instance, the node corresponding to an element-wise addition would store the derivative of the addition with respect to its two operands, which is simply 1 for both. This is local gradient information.

Let's illustrate with a simplified example of adding two tensors, `A` and `B`, to produce `C`. The computational graph would have three nodes: one each for `A`, `B`, and `C`. The connection from `A` to `C` would represent the addition, `C=A+B`. The same connection for `B` and `C` would also represent the addition. In the graph itself each node corresponding to addition would store the partial derivative for inputs `A` and `B` which are 1. During the forward pass, only `C` is calculated from `A` and `B`.

The magic happens during the backward pass when we compute the gradient of a scalar loss function with respect to every parameter of the network. Starting from the final loss node, the framework traverses the computational graph backwards, applying the chain rule of calculus at each node. When computing gradients element-wise, the core idea remains the same, however it is applied at each location of the tensor. This traversal multiplies the local gradient information stored in each node (computed and stored during the forward pass) with the incoming gradient from the subsequent node (computed by the chain rule).

For the previous example, consider a loss function, L, where L depends on C. The derivative of L with respect to C would be obtained using other layers of the model. In this simplified case, assume the derivative is computed. This gradient, dL/dC, arrives at the node C. Using the chain rule, the gradient dL/dA will be dL/dC * dC/dA, where dC/dA is the local gradient which we have already calculated as 1. Because it's an element-wise addition, the derivative applies to each element individually. The resulting gradient, dL/dA, then propagates backwards to the node A. The same occurs for node B, allowing computation of dL/dB.

This process continues recursively until the gradients reach the input tensors or trainable parameters, which are then used to update the network weights. This is how autograd manages to calculate the derivative of even a complex function, by reducing it to a series of simple steps where the gradients are known or readily computed.

Let's examine code examples to further clarify the process.

**Example 1: Element-wise Addition and Multiplication**

This example demonstrates how autograd handles both element-wise addition and multiplication with a framework like PyTorch.

```python
import torch

# Initialize tensors requiring gradient computation
A = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], requires_grad=True)
B = torch.tensor([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]], requires_grad=True)

# Element-wise addition
C = A + B

# Element-wise multiplication
D = C * A

# Define a loss function
loss = D.sum()

# Perform backward pass
loss.backward()

# Access gradients
print("Gradient of loss with respect to A:\n", A.grad)
print("Gradient of loss with respect to B:\n", B.grad)
```
In this instance, the tensors `A` and `B` are initialized to track gradient information. `C` is the result of element-wise addition, while `D` results from an element-wise multiplication between `C` and `A`. The loss function is simply the sum of all elements in `D`. When the `.backward()` is called, the computational graph calculates gradients from the loss back to the parameters. Crucially, the gradient for each element of `A` and `B` is calculated individually according to the chain rule, illustrating autograd's element-wise precision. `A.grad` and `B.grad` will contain the resulting element-wise gradient of the loss function.

**Example 2: Using Element-wise Non-linearities**

This code shows how non-linear functions also maintain element-wise gradient calculations.
```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Initialize a tensor requiring gradient
X = torch.tensor([[1.0, -2.0], [3.0, -4.0]], requires_grad=True)

# Apply element-wise ReLU activation
Y = F.relu(X)

# Apply element-wise sigmoid activation
Z = torch.sigmoid(Y)

# Compute the loss
loss = Z.sum()

# Perform backpropagation
loss.backward()

# Check the gradient of X
print("Gradient of loss with respect to X:\n", X.grad)

```
The input tensor `X` undergoes two element-wise, non-linear transformations. First, the ReLU function, which outputs max(0, x) for each element, is applied. This results in a tensor `Y` where the negative values become 0. Subsequently, the sigmoid function is applied to all elements of the `Y` to produce `Z`. The backward pass computes gradients for all elements in `X`.  It illustrates how autograd manages complex non-linearities efficiently by applying the chain rule at each element's location. Note that due to the zero gradient of ReLU for negative inputs, certain elements of the `X.grad` tensor will be 0 as a result.

**Example 3: Broadcasting**

This example showcases how autograd handles element-wise operations when implicit broadcasting is involved.

```python
import torch

# Initialize a 2x2 tensor and a 1x2 tensor
A = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], requires_grad=True)
B = torch.tensor([[5.0, 6.0]], requires_grad=True)

# Element-wise addition with broadcasting
C = A + B

# Loss function
loss = C.sum()

# Backward pass
loss.backward()

# Inspect gradients
print("Gradient of loss with respect to A:\n", A.grad)
print("Gradient of loss with respect to B:\n", B.grad)
```

Here, we have two tensors with different dimensions that are still added element-wise.  `B`, which has shape `[1, 2]`, is implicitly "broadcast" to match the shape of `A`, `[2, 2]`, before the addition. This implicit expansion is also accounted for within the autograd system, which calculates gradients correctly across the broadcasted dimensions. When gradients flow backward the autograd engine ensures `B.grad` will have the correct shape as the original tensor that was used for the calculation and the gradient from the different elements that were broadcast to A will be accumulated correctly. `A.grad` will have the expected shape and individual gradient values.

When diving deeper, there are several resources I would recommend for further study. Texts on numerical computation and optimization offer insights into the underlying mathematical principles of gradient computation, and specific documentation for libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow provide implementation details and advanced features of autograd engines. Additionally, numerous academic papers delve into efficient implementations of backpropagation and its variants, which will further expand your knowledge of element-wise gradient calculation. Understanding how these systems work can make a huge difference in crafting efficient and accurate deep learning models.
