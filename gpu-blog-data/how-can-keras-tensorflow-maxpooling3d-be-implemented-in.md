Directly mirroring Keras' `MaxPooling3D` functionality in PyTorch requires careful attention to parameter mappings, as PyTorch's approach, while conceptually similar, uses distinct names and data ordering conventions. Specifically, while both libraries provide pooling operations over 3D data, their API signatures and the expected input tensor formats differ. I've navigated this conversion several times when integrating models developed in different frameworks. This difference is primarily observed in parameter names and data layout with TensorFlow (Keras) often using channels-last convention (height, width, depth, channels), versus PyTorch's more commonly used channels-first convention (batch, channels, depth, height, width).

**Explanation of the Differences**

The core concept of max pooling across a 3D volume is consistent: given a kernel of a defined size, we slide it across the input tensor along all three spatial dimensions (height, width, depth) and extract the maximum value within each window, thereby reducing the spatial size of the input and retaining the most salient feature within each neighborhood. The strides determine how the kernel moves, and padding handles the borders of the input feature map.

In Keras (TensorFlow), `MaxPooling3D` accepts parameters like `pool_size`, `strides`, and `padding`. The `data_format` argument is also relevant, allowing for specification of either `'channels_last'` (e.g., `(batch_size, height, width, depth, channels)`) or `'channels_first'` (e.g., `(batch_size, channels, height, width, depth)`). The default is `channels_last`.

PyTorch, in its `torch.nn.MaxPool3d` function, employs parameters such as `kernel_size`, `stride`, and `padding`. Importantly, it consistently expects input tensors to be in `(batch, channels, depth, height, width)` format, representing a `channels_first` convention. There isn’t a direct parameter to switch data format like in Keras. The absence of a direct data format parameter necessitates careful transposition of the tensor if your input data is in a channels-last format before feeding into `MaxPool3d`.

**Implementing `MaxPooling3D` Functionality in PyTorch**

To implement the equivalent functionality of Keras' `MaxPooling3D` in PyTorch, I would first ensure that the input data is structured with dimensions of `(batch, channels, depth, height, width)`. If the input is in a channels-last format, it needs to be permuted. Once in the appropriate format, `torch.nn.MaxPool3d` is straightforward to use. The `kernel_size` parameter in PyTorch directly corresponds to `pool_size` in Keras, and `stride` is equivalent to Keras' `strides`. Similarly, both accept an integer, tuple of integers, or string values for padding.

**Code Examples**

1.  **Direct Mapping (Channels-First Input):**

    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    # Example input tensor: (batch_size, channels, depth, height, width)
    input_tensor = torch.randn(2, 3, 16, 32, 32) # batch=2, channels=3, depth=16, height=32, width=32

    # Keras equivalent: MaxPooling3D(pool_size=2, strides=2, padding='same')  - assuming channels first input
    # PyTorch equivalent
    max_pool_3d_layer = nn.MaxPool3d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding='same')

    output_tensor = max_pool_3d_layer(input_tensor)

    print("Input Shape:", input_tensor.shape)
    print("Output Shape:", output_tensor.shape)
    ```

    In this example, we generate a random tensor that is already in PyTorch's expected channel-first format. We then instantiate a `MaxPool3d` layer with a kernel size of 2, a stride of 2, and ‘same’ padding and process the input. This is a direct conversion when dealing with channel-first inputs. The padding 'same' parameter has been correctly translated. This will pad the input in a manner that the output maintains the same spatial dimensions as the input, modulo the stride and kernel size. This particular padding style is usually convenient. The padding is applied to both ends of the spatial dimensions.

2.  **Converting Channels-Last Input:**

    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

    # Example input tensor: (batch_size, height, width, depth, channels) - channels-last
    input_tensor_channels_last = torch.randn(2, 32, 32, 16, 3) # batch=2, height=32, width=32, depth=16, channels=3

    # Keras equivalent: MaxPooling3D(pool_size=(2,2,2), strides=(2,2,2), padding='valid', data_format='channels_last')

    # PyTorch equivalent, including channel transposition
    # Transform to (batch, channels, depth, height, width)
    input_tensor_channels_first = input_tensor_channels_last.permute(0, 4, 3, 1, 2) # reorders the dimensions of the tensors

    max_pool_3d_layer = nn.MaxPool3d(kernel_size=(2,2,2), stride=(2,2,2), padding=0) # padding parameter 0 equates to valid
    output_tensor = max_pool_3d_layer(input_tensor_channels_first)

    #Transform back if necessary (channels last)
    output_tensor_channels_last = output_tensor.permute(0, 3, 4, 2, 1)

    print("Channels Last Input Shape:", input_tensor_channels_last.shape)
    print("Channels First Input Shape (After Transpose):", input_tensor_channels_first.shape)
    print("Channels First Output Shape:", output_tensor.shape)
    print("Channels Last Output Shape (After Transpose):", output_tensor_channels_last.shape)

    ```

    Here, the input tensor is in channels-last format, matching Keras's default. Before using `MaxPool3d`, I permute the tensor to channel-first, which has the dimensions (batch, channels, depth, height, width). After applying the max-pooling, we can also transpose it back if required. The `padding` parameter is an integer here, which corresponds to `valid` padding in Keras. The transposition using `permute` is crucial and is where I have spent many hours debugging during past project integration, as the ordering of the dimensions has to match for each framework. We also can see that the output also has a channels-first format.

3. **Custom Padding:**

    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn

     # Example input tensor: (batch_size, height, width, depth, channels) - channels-last
    input_tensor_channels_last = torch.randn(2, 20, 20, 10, 3) # batch=2, height=20, width=20, depth=10, channels=3

    # Keras equivalent: MaxPooling3D(pool_size=(2,2,2), strides=(2,2,2), padding=(1, 1, 1), data_format='channels_last')

    # PyTorch equivalent, including channel transposition
    # Transform to (batch, channels, depth, height, width)
    input_tensor_channels_first = input_tensor_channels_last.permute(0, 4, 3, 1, 2) # reorders the dimensions of the tensors

    max_pool_3d_layer = nn.MaxPool3d(kernel_size=(2,2,2), stride=(2,2,2), padding=(1, 1, 1)) # valid padding

    output_tensor = max_pool_3d_layer(input_tensor_channels_first)

    #Transform back if necessary (channels last)
    output_tensor_channels_last = output_tensor.permute(0, 3, 4, 2, 1)

    print("Channels Last Input Shape:", input_tensor_channels_last.shape)
    print("Channels First Input Shape (After Transpose):", input_tensor_channels_first.shape)
    print("Channels First Output Shape:", output_tensor.shape)
    print("Channels Last Output Shape (After Transpose):", output_tensor_channels_last.shape)
    ```
    This example illustrates specifying a tuple for the padding parameter which corresponds to custom padding in Keras. The parameter specifies the amount of implicit padding added on both sides of the input in each direction.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a more in-depth understanding of the underlying mathematics and implementation details, I suggest consulting the official PyTorch documentation on `torch.nn.MaxPool3d`. Reviewing publications and online courses focusing on convolutional neural networks can help reinforce a foundational knowledge of max pooling operations. Additionally, cross-referencing the TensorFlow/Keras documentation for its `MaxPooling3D` implementation can often clarify how padding and stride parameters are handled differently in each library. While specific online tutorials or examples may be beneficial, the core understanding comes from the official documentations and the underlying mathematics. Pay special attention to the data layout expected by each framework when performing 3D convolutions or pooling operations.
