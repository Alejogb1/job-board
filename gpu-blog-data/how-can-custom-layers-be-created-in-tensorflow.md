Creating custom layers in TensorFlow, particularly those constructed from a stack of individual neurons, necessitates a deep understanding of TensorFlow's low-level APIs and a methodical approach to defining both forward and backward propagation.  My experience implementing complex neural network architectures, including those for time-series forecasting and image recognition, has highlighted the importance of careful tensor manipulation to ensure efficient computation and gradient propagation.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

A custom layer in TensorFlow is essentially a callable object that transforms input tensors into output tensors through a defined computation.  Building a layer from individual neurons means defining the connections and operations for each neuron explicitly. This differs from using pre-built layers like `Dense` which handle these details internally. We achieve this by leveraging `tf.keras.layers.Layer` as a base class, overriding its `call` method to define the forward pass and, crucially, its `compute_output_shape` method for proper shape inference.  The backward pass (gradient calculation) is typically handled automatically by TensorFlow's automatic differentiation system, provided the operations within the `call` method are differentiable.  However, in cases involving custom operations, we might need to define a `compute_output_shape` method that accurately reflects the dimensions of the output tensor. This allows TensorFlow to efficiently manage memory and optimize the computational graph.

The core challenge lies in effectively stacking the neurons and managing the tensor transformations.  Each neuron's output contributes to the next layer's input.  Careful consideration must be given to weight matrix dimensions, bias vectors, and activation functions to ensure proper dimensionality alignment at each stage.  Efficient vectorization techniques are crucial for performance.  Avoid looping over individual neurons; instead, use TensorFlow's built-in vectorized operations for efficient processing of entire batches of data.  This is paramount for scaling to larger datasets and models.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: A Simple Stack of Neurons (Fully Connected)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class StackedNeurons(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, activation='relu', **kwargs):
        super(StackedNeurons, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dense_layers = [tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, activation=activation) for _ in range(3)] # Stack of 3 Dense layers

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = inputs
        for layer in self.dense_layers:
            x = layer(x)
        return x

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        return self.dense_layers[-1].compute_output_shape(input_shape)

#Usage
layer = StackedNeurons(64)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((10, 32)) #Batch of 10, 32 features
output = layer(input_tensor)
print(output.shape)
```

This example demonstrates a stack of three fully connected dense layers. Each `Dense` layer acts as a single neuron layer in a broader sense; the neurons within each dense layer are not explicitly defined but handled by the `Dense` layer's internal logic. The use of a list of layers allows for simple iteration during the forward pass.  The `compute_output_shape` method leverages the built-in functionality of the final dense layer to infer the output shape.

**Example 2: Stacked Neurons with Custom Activation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomActivation(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def call(self, inputs):
    return tf.nn.elu(inputs) * tf.sigmoid(inputs) #Example custom activation

class StackedNeuronsCustomActivation(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(StackedNeuronsCustomActivation, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dense_layers = [tf.keras.layers.Dense(units) for _ in range(2)]
        self.activation = CustomActivation()

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = inputs
        for layer in self.dense_layers:
            x = layer(x)
            x = self.activation(x)  #Applying the custom activation
        return x

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        return self.dense_layers[-1].compute_output_shape(input_shape)

#Usage
layer = StackedNeuronsCustomActivation(32)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((5, 16))
output = layer(input_tensor)
print(output.shape)
```

This expands upon the previous example by introducing a custom activation function.  This highlights the flexibility in defining neuron behaviour beyond pre-defined TensorFlow options.  The custom activation is applied after each dense layer.

**Example 3:  Handling Variable-Sized Inputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class VariableInputStackedNeurons(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(VariableInputStackedNeurons, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, activation='sigmoid')

    def call(self, inputs):
        #Handle variable length sequences (if applicable) - Example using LSTM like behavior
        x = tf.reduce_mean(inputs, axis=1) # average pooling over time dimension
        x = self.dense1(x)
        x = self.dense2(x)
        return x

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
        return (input_shape[0], self.dense2.units)

# Usage:
layer = VariableInputStackedNeurons(10)
#Example input with varying time steps but same number of features
input_tensor1 = tf.random.normal((10,5,20)) #Batch of 10 sequences of 5 time steps, each 20 features
input_tensor2 = tf.random.normal((3, 12, 20)) #Batch of 3 sequences of 12 time steps, each 20 features
output1 = layer(input_tensor1)
output2 = layer(input_tensor2)
print(output1.shape, output2.shape) # Output shape remains consistent regardless of input sequence length

```

This example demonstrates handling variable-length input sequences.  This is common in sequence processing tasks.  It uses average pooling over the sequence length (time dimension) before applying fully connected layers.  The `compute_output_shape` is adjusted to correctly reflect the output shape after the pooling and fully connected layers. Note: more sophisticated sequence handling might involve recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, which are beyond the scope of building a layer from individual neurons in this simple demonstration.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on custom layers and Keras APIs, are invaluable.  A strong understanding of linear algebra and calculus is also crucial for comprehending the underlying mathematical operations.  Further, exploring the source code of existing TensorFlow layers can provide insights into implementation best practices.  Finally, consulting advanced deep learning textbooks covering neural network architectures and backpropagation algorithms is beneficial.
