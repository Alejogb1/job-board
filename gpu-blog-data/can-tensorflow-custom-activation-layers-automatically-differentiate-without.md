TensorFlow's ability to automatically differentiate custom activation layers hinges on the function's differentiability, not the presence of explicit gradient or weight specifications within the layer's definition.  My experience developing and deploying complex neural networks across various platforms, including embedded systems, has highlighted the importance of understanding this distinction.  Automatic differentiation relies on the underlying computational graph and the ability of TensorFlow's autograd system to symbolically or numerically compute derivatives.  Therefore, a custom activation layer will automatically differentiate *if and only if* the activation function itself is differentiable.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's automatic differentiation engine, often referred to as autograd, employs techniques like reverse-mode differentiation (backpropagation) to compute gradients efficiently.  This process does not necessitate the explicit definition of gradients within the layer's code.  Instead, the autograd system analyzes the computational graph constructed during the forward pass of the network.  This graph represents the sequence of operations performed on the input data. Each operation has an associated gradient function, which is automatically applied during the backward pass to compute gradients with respect to the network's weights and other parameters, including the inputs to the activation function.

Critically, the success of automatic differentiation depends entirely on the mathematical properties of the activation function. If the function is differentiable, the autograd system can compute its derivative.  If the function is not differentiable everywhere (e.g., containing absolute value or piecewise functions with discontinuities in their derivatives),  the automatic differentiation process will either fail or produce inaccurate results.  It’s crucial to ensure the activation function's mathematical properties align with the requirements of automatic differentiation.  Approximations might be used for non-differentiable points, but this should be handled carefully to avoid stability issues during training.  Manual gradient specification becomes necessary only when dealing with functions that defy automatic differentiation, which isn’t generally the case for standard activation functions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Differentiable Activation Function (Swish)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class Swish(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self):
    super(Swish, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x):
    return x * tf.sigmoid(x)

# Example usage:
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  Swish(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
#Training proceeds automatically; gradients for Swish are calculated automatically.
```

This example demonstrates a custom Swish activation layer.  The `call` method defines the forward pass operation.  No gradient is explicitly specified.  TensorFlow automatically computes the gradient of the Swish function during backpropagation because it's differentiable everywhere.


**Example 2:  Piecewise Linear Function (Requires Custom Gradient)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class PiecewiseLinear(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self):
    super(PiecewiseLinear, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x):
    return tf.where(x > 0, x, 0.1 * x)  # Piecewise linear function

  def get_config(self):
    config = super().get_config()
    return config

@tf.custom_gradient
def piecewise_linear_with_gradient(x):
  def grad(dy):
    return tf.where(x > 0, dy, 0.1 * dy)
  return tf.where(x > 0, x, 0.1 * x), grad

class PiecewiseLinearWithGradient(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self):
    super(PiecewiseLinearWithGradient, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x):
    return piecewise_linear_with_gradient(x)


# Example Usage
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  PiecewiseLinearWithGradient(), # Using custom gradient function
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
```

This example showcases a piecewise linear function, which is not differentiable at x=0.  Automatic differentiation might yield incorrect gradients at this point.  Therefore, a custom gradient function is defined using `@tf.custom_gradient` to provide the correct gradient calculation, ensuring proper backpropagation.


**Example 3: Non-Differentiable Function (Requires Approximation or Alternative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

class NonDifferentiable(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def __init__(self):
    super(NonDifferentiable, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x):
    return tf.cast(tf.greater(x, 0), tf.float32)  #Step function

# Example usage (will likely fail or produce poor results):
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
  NonDifferentiable(), #Non-differentiable function
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
#Training will likely fail or converge poorly due to the non-differentiable nature.  Approximation or replacement needed.
```

This example uses a step function (Heaviside step function), which is not differentiable at x=0.  Attempting to train a model with this activation function will likely result in training failure or extremely poor performance.  Approximations with differentiable functions (e.g., sigmoid with a steep slope) or alternative approaches are necessary.  Automatic differentiation will not work correctly for this function.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation on custom layers and automatic differentiation provides detailed explanations and examples.  Additionally, texts focusing on advanced topics in deep learning and numerical optimization offer valuable insights into the underlying principles of automatic differentiation.  Exploring resources dedicated to gradient-based optimization algorithms is also beneficial for a deeper understanding of the backpropagation process within TensorFlow.  Finally, understanding the calculus underpinning differentiation is crucial for correctly designing and implementing custom activation layers.
