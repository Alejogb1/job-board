The AIX dbx debugger, unlike its GNU counterpart, does not support shell commands embedded directly within its initialization file, .dbxinit. This limitation is a consequence of dbx's design, which primarily focuses on debugging rather than acting as a shell scripting environment. Attempting to execute shell commands such as `set edit emacs`, as if it were a typical shell script, triggers a syntax error because dbx interprets such directives as invalid debugger commands.

Specifically, dbx parses the .dbxinit file line by line, expecting each line to conform to its specific command syntax. This syntax includes debugger commands such as `stop at`, `print`, `run`, and `cont`, amongst others. The `set` command, while familiar in shell scripting contexts, possesses a distinctly different meaning and functionality within dbx. It is utilized to set dbx variables, not environment variables for an external editor, or to invoke external programs.

My experience debugging C applications on AIX for several years, particularly during the porting of a large POSIX application from Linux, revealed the stark contrast in debugger behavior between platforms. Initially, I attempted to leverage the same .dbxinit file from my Linux development setup on AIX. It quickly became apparent that the AIX `dbx` does not behave identically to `gdb` in that regard.

The typical workflow involves configuring an editor preference. However, with AIX dbx, this requires a different approach. There isn’t a built-in capability to launch or set an external editor using the `set` command within the debugger initialization itself.

Let’s illustrate this with three code examples.

**Example 1: The Erroneous Attempt (Typical .dbxinit)**

```
# This is a typical .dbxinit file attempt on AIX
# This will produce a syntax error
set edit emacs
```

This example represents the common mistake made by users familiar with shell-based configurations. In this case, dbx will interpret `set` as a dbx command attempting to assign a value to a dbx variable named 'edit,' and ‘emacs’ as an invalid value or subsequent command component, resulting in a syntax error upon parsing. The parser will likely report something akin to “invalid syntax, set command requires a valid assignment.”  This highlights the core issue: dbx's parser is designed to understand debugger commands, not shell commands.

**Example 2: Setting a DBX variable (Correct Usage)**

```
# This is a valid dbx .dbxinit file
set $stacklimit = 1024
print $stacklimit
```

In contrast to the prior attempt, this shows a correct use of the `set` command. Here, it is utilized to modify a debugger-specific variable, `$stacklimit`, not an environment variable or shell-related parameter. This demonstrates that the `set` command within dbx is reserved for manipulating dbx-specific variables and internal state, not for executing shell commands. The second line will print the value set to the `$stacklimit` variable, which will be 1024. It highlights that set commands must be in the form 'set <variable_name> = <value>'.

**Example 3: Alternative Approach (Launching Editor Separately)**

```
# This is a dbx .dbxinit file utilizing a workaround
# It won't run emacs, but uses a dbx alias.
alias edit = "shell emacs `tty`"
```
This approach illustrates a workaround: the use of dbx aliases combined with the `shell` command.  It doesn't directly "set edit emacs" as initially attempted.  Instead, it creates an alias called `edit`. When the user types "edit" at the `(dbx)` prompt, dbx will execute the shell command `emacs `tty``. `tty` outputs the current terminal name allowing the emacs to be run on the same terminal session. This allows a method to invoke an external program, but it does not equate to setting the program as the default editor within the context of `dbx` itself. This method is less convenient, as it requires explicit invocation from the dbx command line, but it remains a viable option on AIX dbx. Note that this also opens emacs on a separate tty.

The absence of direct shell command execution within `dbxinit` mandates different practices for editor integration. The alias method offers a workaround, but doesn’t offer seamless integration in the way a GDB configuration would.  A more suitable solution might be to configure the system environment to launch emacs as the editor when you are using other applications or scripts, but this approach does not allow you to invoke it directly from within dbx initialization.

Further, it is important to understand that while dbx does have some scripting capabilities using its built-in `eval` command and using its scripting capabilities, it doesn’t support direct shell commands in the way a bash or similar shell script would. This command can be used to call a custom script or a sequence of dbx commands, but cannot directly execute shell command on its own.

When transitioning between debuggers on different operating systems, understanding their specific nuances in scripting and initialization is critical. Simply transposing configurations from one debugger to another can lead to unexpected behavior or outright failures. This has been a consistent lesson across different debugging environments I’ve worked with, including those on Solaris and HP-UX systems.

For those seeking to understand AIX dbx further, I recommend exploring the official IBM documentation which covers topics such as command syntax, built-in variables, and debugging techniques. Furthermore, the book, "AIX System Administration" published by IBM Redbooks, although a general guide, provides additional insight into the AIX environment. A practical approach also involves creating small testing scenarios within dbx, to gain a feel for the command line functionality and error reporting behavior. These resources provide a more in-depth explanation compared to relying on third-party websites. Learning from the documentation and trying out the commands within the debugger are the most reliable approaches.
