The `InvalidArgumentError` frequently encountered when using Keras-viz, a visualization tool for Keras models, typically stems from mismatches between the computational graph produced by Keras and the assumptions made by the visualization backend, particularly regarding tensor shapes and data types. Having spent considerable time debugging Keras models and their visualizations, I've observed this error surface primarily in cases involving dynamic shapes, custom layers, and inconsistencies between the expected input tensors of the model and those being used for visualization.

Fundamentally, Keras-viz, which often relies on backends like GraphViz or similar libraries, needs a well-defined, static computational graph to generate clear and interpretable diagrams. When a Keras model introduces dynamism, such as via `tf.function` usage with variable shapes or custom layers that manipulate tensor dimensions outside of standard Keras operations, the visualization backend can struggle to map these operations to a fixed graph representation. This results in an error. It is not uncommon, for instance, that while the model itself may function without issue during training and inference, the specific requirements imposed on the computational graph during visualization uncover incompatibilities.

Let's consider a basic scenario. Keras-viz will typically attempt to trace the input tensors and propagate them through all the layers to depict the connections and transformations applied to the tensors. This tracing mechanism relies on static tensor shapes for accurate depiction. If a layer, for instance, performs an operation where the shape of the tensor is only determined at runtime, the visualization tool may not have the required shape information at the graph creation stage. This shape mismatch will trigger the `InvalidArgumentError`.

I’ll illustrate through a series of examples.

**Example 1: Dynamic Shape in Custom Layer**

Consider a simple custom layer defined as follows, which modifies the tensor shape using `tf.reshape`, where the target shape depends on a variable defined during model creation. This is not a highly uncommon requirement, especially if you are experimenting with more advanced model architectures:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import keras_viz

class DynamicReshapeLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, target_size, **kwargs):
        super(DynamicReshapeLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.target_size = target_size

    def call(self, inputs):
        batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[0]
        return tf.reshape(inputs, [batch_size, self.target_size])

    def get_config(self):
      config = super().get_config()
      config.update({
          "target_size": self.target_size
      })
      return config


# Create a minimal model incorporating the custom layer
input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(100,))
reshaped_tensor = DynamicReshapeLayer(50)(input_tensor)
output_tensor = keras.layers.Dense(10)(reshaped_tensor)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)


# Attempt to visualize
try:
    keras_viz.plot_model(model, show_shapes=True)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during visualization: {e}")
```

In this example, the `DynamicReshapeLayer` reshapes the tensor using a `target_size` parameter set during the layer initialization, but this can cause issues during visualization since the static shape is not fully defined by the initial layer configuration. While the Keras model works correctly and the reshape operation occurs during the forward pass, keras-viz may struggle due to its dependency on a static graph definition. The error often appears in the form of a `InvalidArgumentError` pointing to the shape incompatibility.

**Example 2: Mismatch in Input Shapes**

Another common cause is a mismatch between the input data provided to `plot_model` (implicitly or explicitly) and the input shape expected by the Keras model. The function often requires a dummy input or an equivalent tensor that aligns with model’s input shape, for the graph trace generation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import keras_viz
import numpy as np


input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(64,64,3))
x = keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu')(input_tensor)
x = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2))(x)
x = keras.layers.Flatten()(x)
output_tensor = keras.layers.Dense(10)(x)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)


# Incorrect visualization attempts

try:
  keras_viz.plot_model(model,show_shapes=True)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during visualization: {e}")

try:
  # Providing an input with a different shape
  dummy_input = np.random.random((1, 32,32,3))
  keras_viz.plot_model(model, show_shapes=True, input_data=dummy_input)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during visualization with incorrect input shape: {e}")
```

In the code above, the model's expected input is a tensor of shape (None, 64, 64, 3) (batch size is variable), but if no input is specified or if we provide an array with different dimensions (in the second exception), this will trigger a shape incompatibility during visualization, generating the dreaded `InvalidArgumentError`. Keras-viz expects the input data to conform to the model's tensor shape, failing which it cannot properly traverse the graph for drawing.

**Example 3: Complex Tensor Manipulation**

Lastly, when a Keras model incorporates custom layers that perform complex operations that are not easily represented by standard symbolic calculations, or where there is dependency on external parameters or calculations, these can generate graph construction issues when they come across the tracing required for visualization

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import keras_viz

class ComplexLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, multiplier=2, **kwargs):
        super(ComplexLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.multiplier = multiplier

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Some complex and hard to trace operation
        return tf.add(inputs, self.multiplier * tf.reduce_sum(inputs,axis=1, keepdims = True))

    def get_config(self):
      config = super().get_config()
      config.update({
          "multiplier": self.multiplier
      })
      return config


input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(10,))
x = ComplexLayer(multiplier=3)(input_tensor)
output_tensor = keras.layers.Dense(10)(x)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output_tensor)


# Attempt to visualize

try:
    keras_viz.plot_model(model, show_shapes=True)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during visualization: {e}")
```
Here, `ComplexLayer` performs a sum reduction of the input tensor and multiplies it with an external parameter, which makes it hard to symbolically represent. This can cause an `InvalidArgumentError` during Keras-viz’s graph tracing phase.

**Recommendations**

Debugging `InvalidArgumentError`s with Keras-viz requires a systematic approach. Begin by examining your model's layers and identifying if there are any layers that alter shapes in a dynamic or non-standard way, like in our first example. If custom layers are present, thoroughly review their logic to ensure tensor shapes are consistently managed. When using `tf.function`, check that your usage does not introduce unexpected shape behaviors.

It is also imperative to meticulously confirm that the dummy input shape passed, or the implicitly expected shape if you provide none, corresponds accurately with the input tensor shape your model requires, as shown in the second example. If your model contains advanced layers, especially those involving non-standard tensor manipulations like the third example, try creating a simplified version of the model to isolate where the error originates.

For troubleshooting, resources like the TensorFlow documentation, the Keras API documentation, and any specific documentation for your visualization tool are invaluable. Additionally, community forums specific to data science and machine learning can provide support and insights. Lastly, stepping through the model layer-by-layer, even manually with print statements of shapes, can be helpful if the source of dynamic shapes is difficult to identify. Careful attention to the tensor shapes at each step is generally required when integrating custom layers or dynamic shape changes.
