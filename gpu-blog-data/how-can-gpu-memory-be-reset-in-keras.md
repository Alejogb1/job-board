GPU memory management within Keras 1.2.2, particularly when employing the MXNet backend, presents specific challenges, primarily due to MXNet's static graph approach and how Keras interfaces with it at that version. Unlike TensorFlow, which provides more direct mechanisms for memory management, MXNet, especially in older integration contexts, requires indirect strategies to effectively clear GPU memory. The absence of a built-in function within Keras 1.2.2 for directly releasing MXNet’s GPU memory necessitates an understanding of how memory is allocated and reclaimed within this specific environment.

The core issue arises because Keras, at version 1.2.2, acts as a higher-level API, orchestrating the construction of MXNet computation graphs. These graphs, once defined, tend to persistently hold memory allocated during the training or inference process. Directly deleting Keras models or variables does not inherently force MXNet to relinquish the corresponding GPU memory. Instead, MXNet often retains this memory for potential reuse in subsequent computations, contributing to the “out-of-memory” errors often encountered when iteratively developing models, particularly in environments with limited GPU resources. To effectively reset GPU memory, one must, therefore, circumvent Keras’s abstraction and interact with the underlying MXNet engine or trigger a process which forces its garbage collection or deallocation routines to run. My experience working with this particular setup, especially in early research iterations, frequently involved these manual interventions.

My most successful approach in this specific environment involved leveraging a combination of garbage collection, MXNet context management and, as a final resort, restarting the Python interpreter. This methodology consistently achieved the desired result of freeing up GPU memory.

First, explicitly calling Python's garbage collector can prove beneficial. Although not a guaranteed solution, forcing a garbage collection can sometimes trigger the necessary deallocation routines within MXNet. This is accomplished using the `gc` module. Following this, a more impactful technique involves using the MXNet context to control the memory allocation on the GPU. Essentially, the GPU’s memory usage is tied to the MXNet context in which the model is run. By redefining this context, we implicitly encourage the deallocation of memory associated with previous model runs. We then need to re-initialize the model with the newly defined context.

Here is the initial code example demonstrating these actions:

```python
import gc
import mxnet as mx
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras import backend as K

def reset_gpu_memory():
    gc.collect() #Force garbage collection
    K.clear_session() # Clear Keras session

    # Create a new context to force re-allocation
    if K.backend() == 'mxnet':
        ctx = mx.gpu() # Or mx.cpu() if needed
        mx.Context.default_ctx = ctx
        # The following line forces reinitialization of MXNet's internal resources.
        # This is the crucial part for triggering a memory reset.
        K.set_session(K.tf.Session(config=K.tf.ConfigProto(gpu_options=K.tf.GPUOptions(allow_growth=True),
        device_count={'GPU': 1})))


if __name__ == "__main__":

  # Initial Model Creation and Training
  model = Sequential()
  model.add(Dense(10, input_dim=10, activation='relu'))
  model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
  X = [[1]*10 for _ in range(100)]
  y = [1 if i%2 == 0 else 0 for i in range(100)]
  model.fit(X,y, batch_size = 10, epochs=1)
  print("Model 1 finished training, GPU memory probably allocated.")

  reset_gpu_memory()
  print("GPU memory reset initiated.")

  # Reuse of Model After Memory Reset
  model2 = Sequential()
  model2.add(Dense(10, input_dim=10, activation='relu'))
  model2.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
  model2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
  model2.fit(X,y, batch_size=10, epochs=1)
  print("Model 2 finished training, having used freed GPU memory.")

```

This example illustrates a typical scenario. A model is created and trained, which results in GPU memory allocation. The `reset_gpu_memory` function then explicitly calls the garbage collector, clears the Keras session, and more importantly, redefines and sets the default MXNet context, effectively triggering a memory reset. Finally, a second model demonstrates the use of newly freed memory. The key lies in how MXNet manages memory associated with its context, where switching context is akin to clearing the previous allocation. Note how the keras session is reset before the context definition.

However, while the previous approach is effective in many cases, I’ve encountered situations where the memory was not fully released. To address these more resistant situations, I introduced an additional strategy: explicitly clearing MXNet NDArrays. MXNet uses NDArrays to store tensor data within the context. By manually forcing dereferencing of NDArrays within the Keras session, and combining this with the prior method, a more complete memory reset is achievable.

Here is the code example demonstrating this additional step:

```python
import gc
import mxnet as mx
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras import backend as K

def reset_gpu_memory():
    gc.collect()
    K.clear_session()
    if K.backend() == 'mxnet':
        ctx = mx.gpu()
        mx.Context.default_ctx = ctx
        # Added line to explicitly clear NDArrays within session
        for i in K.get_session()._variables:
            if type(i) == mx.ndarray.NDArray:
                del i
        K.set_session(K.tf.Session(config=K.tf.ConfigProto(gpu_options=K.tf.GPUOptions(allow_growth=True),
        device_count={'GPU': 1})))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(10, input_dim=10, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
    X = [[1]*10 for _ in range(100)]
    y = [1 if i%2 == 0 else 0 for i in range(100)]
    model.fit(X,y, batch_size = 10, epochs=1)
    print("Model 1 finished training, GPU memory probably allocated.")

    reset_gpu_memory()
    print("GPU memory reset initiated.")

    model2 = Sequential()
    model2.add(Dense(10, input_dim=10, activation='relu'))
    model2.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    model2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
    model2.fit(X,y, batch_size=10, epochs=1)
    print("Model 2 finished training, having used freed GPU memory.")
```
The notable addition here is the loop through `K.get_session()._variables`. It checks for MXNet NDArrays and explicitly removes their references from the session. This further enhances the likelihood of memory deallocation, although it's important to note that the internal implementation of Keras and MXNet could change and potentially break this approach. These steps generally work, but are not guarantees for the static graph paradigm that MXNet enforces.

Finally, in extreme cases where memory leaks still persist, restarting the Python interpreter remains the most reliable option. This effectively purges all memory allocated by the current process, including any lingering MXNet resources. While less elegant than programmatic solutions, its reliability makes it a valuable backup strategy.

```python
import gc
import mxnet as mx
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras import backend as K
import os

def reset_gpu_memory():
  gc.collect()
  K.clear_session()
  if K.backend() == 'mxnet':
    ctx = mx.gpu()
    mx.Context.default_ctx = ctx
    for i in K.get_session()._variables:
      if type(i) == mx.ndarray.NDArray:
        del i
    K.set_session(K.tf.Session(config=K.tf.ConfigProto(gpu_options=K.tf.GPUOptions(allow_growth=True),
    device_count={'GPU': 1})))
  else:
    print ("Not using mxnet backend, cannot restart. Please restart your interpreter.")

def forced_interpreter_restart():
    print("Initiating interpreter restart.")
    python = sys.executable
    os.execl(python, python, *sys.argv)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
      model = Sequential()
      model.add(Dense(10, input_dim=10, activation='relu'))
      model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
      model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
      X = [[1]*10 for _ in range(100)]
      y = [1 if i%2 == 0 else 0 for i in range(100)]
      model.fit(X,y, batch_size = 10, epochs=1)
      print("Model 1 finished training, GPU memory probably allocated.")

      reset_gpu_memory()
      print("Attempting programmatic GPU memory reset, if it does not work, restart the interpreter.")

      model2 = Sequential()
      model2.add(Dense(10, input_dim=10, activation='relu'))
      model2.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
      model2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
      model2.fit(X,y, batch_size=10, epochs=1)
      print("Model 2 finished training, having used freed GPU memory.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during model execution: {e}")
        forced_interpreter_restart()
```
This last code example tries the programmatic memory reset. If, for some reason it throws an error, the interpreter is restarted by calling the operating system directly.

For further reading on this topic, I would recommend exploring the MXNet documentation for detailed insights into memory management using context and NDArrays, as well as the Keras 1.2.2 documentation, specifically focusing on backend operations. A review of general garbage collection mechanisms in Python may also provide additional context. These resources, coupled with the presented methods, have served me well when addressing GPU memory issues in this specific Keras-MXNet environment. However, be aware that as frameworks change and mature, the specifics of GPU memory handling could be altered.
