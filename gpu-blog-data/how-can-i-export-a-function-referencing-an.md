The core issue stems from PyTorch's automatic differentiation mechanism and its reliance on the computation graph.  When a function references a tensor not explicitly part of the graph, the gradient calculation for that function becomes incomplete, leading to unexpected behavior or outright errors during backpropagation.  This often manifests as a `RuntimeError` related to the inability to trace the gradient.  I've encountered this extensively in my work developing custom neural network layers and optimization routines.  The solution hinges on ensuring the untracked tensor's operations are properly integrated into the computation graph.

The simplest and most common approach involves ensuring the tensor is created within the context of `torch.autograd.set_grad_enabled(True)`.  This globally enables gradient tracking, ensuring that any subsequent tensor operations will be recorded. However, this might be overly broad, impacting performance if not carefully managed.  A more refined strategy leverages the `requires_grad` attribute of tensors and the `torch.no_grad()` context manager.

**1. Explicit Gradient Tracking with `requires_grad`:**

This method provides the finest granularity of control.  By setting `requires_grad=True` directly on the tensor, you explicitly tell PyTorch to track its gradients. This is ideal when dealing with tensors that need gradients calculated for only specific parts of the model.

```python
import torch

def my_function(untracked_tensor):
    # Explicitly enable gradient tracking for the input tensor
    untracked_tensor.requires_grad_(True)  # Modifies the tensor in-place

    # Perform operations on the tensor that require gradient tracking
    result = torch.sin(untracked_tensor) * 2  
    return result

# Example usage:
x = torch.randn(10)  # Initially, x does not require gradient tracking
y = my_function(x)

# Now, gradients can be computed correctly for y with respect to x
y.backward()
print(x.grad) # Gradient of y with respect to x will be calculated correctly.
```

This approach directly addresses the untracked tensor issue by explicitly making it trackable *within* the function's scope.  It avoids the overhead of global gradient tracking enabled with `set_grad_enabled`.  However, it requires careful consideration; if the tensor is already used elsewhere and should *not* be tracked, this approach would be inappropriate.


**2.  Conditional Gradient Tracking with `torch.no_grad()`:**

In situations where a tensor needs gradient tracking only conditionally (e.g., during training but not inference), the `torch.no_grad()` context manager provides a suitable mechanism.

```python
import torch

def my_function(untracked_tensor, train_mode=True):
    if train_mode:
        with torch.enable_grad(): #Locally enables gradient tracking
            result = torch.sin(untracked_tensor) * 2
    else:
        with torch.no_grad(): #Locally disables gradient tracking
            result = torch.sin(untracked_tensor) * 2
    return result

# Example usage:
x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=False)
y_train = my_function(x, train_mode=True)
y_inference = my_function(x, train_mode=False)

# Gradients are calculated only for y_train
y_train.backward()
print(x.grad) # Will print None since x's grad is only calculated when train_mode is True.
```

Here, the `torch.enable_grad()` context manager ensures gradient tracking only when `train_mode` is True. This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios requiring different behavior during training and inference phases.

**3.  Registering Hooks for Custom Gradient Calculations:**

For more complex scenarios involving tensors with intricate dependencies, or when the standard autograd mechanisms are insufficient, custom gradient calculations using hooks become necessary.

```python
import torch

def my_function(untracked_tensor):
    # Register a hook to compute the gradient manually.
    def custom_grad_fn(grad):
        return grad * 2 #Example custom gradient calculation

    untracked_tensor.register_hook(custom_grad_fn)

    result = torch.sin(untracked_tensor)
    return result

# Example usage:
x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=False) #untracked Tensor
y = my_function(x)

y.backward()
# Check gradients. Note that because we registered a hook that doubled it, the gradients
# will be calculated correctly and be double the value of the usual.
print(x.grad)
```

This advanced technique offers complete control over gradient computations, allowing for scenarios beyond standard automatic differentiation. This is crucial when dealing with non-differentiable operations or when specific gradient manipulation is needed.  However, it demands a deeper understanding of PyTorch's internals.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation, particularly sections detailing automatic differentiation and advanced features like custom autograd functions.  Explore examples and tutorials demonstrating the use of `requires_grad`, `torch.no_grad()`, and hook functions.  Furthermore, delve into resources explaining the intricacies of computational graphs in PyTorch.  Finally, understanding the underlying principles of automatic differentiation in the context of machine learning is critical for troubleshooting such problems effectively.  These resources provide the necessary theoretical foundation to navigate complex scenarios involving gradient calculations in PyTorch.
