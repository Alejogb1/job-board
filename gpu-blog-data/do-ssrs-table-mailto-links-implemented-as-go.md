SSRS "Go to URL" actions and HTML `<a href>` tags within table cells, when configured for mailto links, do not inherently cause data duplication or obscuration. However, the visual presentation and user experience can be significantly impacted by how these elements interact with the report's rendering engine and the email client.  My experience in troubleshooting similar issues across numerous enterprise reporting solutions has highlighted the crucial role of proper cell design and HTML rendering capabilities within SSRS.  Improper handling can lead to perceived data issues, but these are artifacts of presentation, not inherent flaws in the mailto functionality itself.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The functionality of a mailto link, regardless of its implementation method within SSRS, remains consistent: it triggers the user's default email client, pre-populating the recipient, subject, and potentially the body with specified data. Problems arise when the report's design fails to account for the inherent behavior of email clients and the rendering of HTML within the table cells.

When using the "Go to URL" action, SSRS directly handles the link's execution.  This generally involves opening the mailto link in a new window or tab, outside the context of the report.  Data obscuration isn't a direct consequence of this action, unless the report itself is designed in a way that obscures data behind the hyperlink element (for instance, excessively large hyperlinks covering other table cells).

Implementing the mailto link via an HTML `<a href>` tag offers greater control over styling and presentation. However, this necessitates careful consideration of how the rendered HTML interacts with the table layout. If not meticulously managed, the link itself, or its associated styling, might visually overlap or obscure adjacent table data. This is a presentation problem, not a data corruption issue.  The data persists; it's simply hidden from view due to CSS conflicts or improper table cell sizing.  In my experience, this is often exacerbated by inconsistent browser rendering or older versions of SSRS.

Another subtle issue, related to both approaches, is the potential for confusion if the mailto link’s contents (particularly the subject line) dynamically pull data from the table. If the generated email's subject line is not explicit enough to distinguish between multiple rows, the user might receive multiple emails that appear identical at a glance, leading to a perceived duplication.

Finally, it's important to remember that the mailto link itself operates independently of the SSRS report. Issues within the email client, including client-side rendering limitations or the user's email configuration, are external factors that could contribute to an impression of data problems even if the SSRS report is correctly implemented.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: "Go to URL" Action:**

This approach is straightforward.  Assume a table with columns "ID" and "Email".

```xml
<ReportItem>
  <Textbox Name="IDTextbox">
    <CanGrow>true</CanGrow>
    <Value>=Fields!ID.Value</Value>
  </Textbox>
  <Textbox Name="EmailTextbox">
    <CanGrow>true</CanGrow>
    <Value>=Fields!Email.Value</Value>
  </Textbox>
  <Action>
    <GoToAction>
      <Hyperlink>="mailto:" & Fields!Email.Value & "?subject=Inquiry regarding ID " & Fields!ID.Value</Hyperlink>
    </GoToAction>
  </Action>
</ReportItem>
```

This code snippet configures the entire row to be a clickable link opening an email to the address in `Fields!Email.Value`. No HTML is involved; the “Go to URL” action handles the interaction.  The subject line dynamically includes the ID, minimizing email ambiguity.


**Example 2:  HTML `<a href>` tag –  Potentially Problematic:**

This example demonstrates a potential problem if not carefully implemented.  Observe the use of inline styling:

```xml
<rd:ReportUnitType>Inch</rd:ReportUnitType>
<CellContents>
  <Textbox Name="IDTextbox">
    <CanGrow>true</CanGrow>
    <Value>=Fields!ID.Value</Value>
  </Textbox>
  <Textbox Name="EmailLink">
    <CanGrow>true</CanGrow>
    <Value>= "<a href='mailto:" & Fields!Email.Value & "?subject=Inquiry'>" & Fields!Email.Value & "</a>"</Value>
    <Style>
      <PaddingLeft>2pt</PaddingLeft>
      <PaddingRight>2pt</PaddingLeft>
    </Style>
  </Textbox>
</CellContents>
```

This approach embeds the HTML directly.  The styling (`PaddingLeft`, `PaddingRight`) is crucial.  Without proper sizing, the link might overflow, obscuring adjacent cells or causing layout issues.  This is a purely presentational problem, easily fixed through appropriate cell sizing and careful HTML and CSS considerations within SSRS's report designer.

**Example 3: HTML `<a href>` tag – Improved Implementation:**

This example addresses potential layout problems by avoiding inline styling and focusing on using SSRS's built-in formatting capabilities. This approach is preferable to inline styling within the HTML.

```xml
<rd:ReportUnitType>Inch</rd:ReportUnitType>
<CellContents>
  <Textbox Name="IDTextbox">
    <CanGrow>true</CanGrow>
    <Value>=Fields!ID.Value</Value>
  </Textbox>
  <Textbox Name="EmailLink">
    <CanGrow>true</CanGrow>
    <Value>=Fields!Email.Value</Value>
    <Action>
      <Hyperlink>="mailto:" & Fields!Email.Value & "?subject=Inquiry regarding ID " & Fields!ID.Value</Hyperlink>
    </Action>
  </Textbox>
</CellContents>
```

This code leverages the "Go to URL" action within the textbox, ensuring functionality is maintained while avoiding manual HTML rendering and layout challenges.  The presentation is handled by SSRS's default styling for hyperlinks, minimizing the risk of conflicts.  This method provides a cleaner separation of concerns.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I would recommend consulting the official SSRS documentation on report design, specifically sections on data regions, HTML rendering within report items, and the proper use of the "Go to URL" action and hyperlinks. Pay particular attention to examples demonstrating advanced table layouts and cell-level formatting. Examining best practices for creating accessible and user-friendly reports will also be beneficial.  Finally, exploring the intricacies of HTML rendering within the SSRS environment, and its potential compatibility quirks with different browsers, is vital.  A thorough understanding of how SSRS interacts with underlying HTML and CSS is crucial in avoiding common layout and presentation pitfalls.  Studying advanced HTML and CSS techniques as they pertain to responsive design could also be valuable.
