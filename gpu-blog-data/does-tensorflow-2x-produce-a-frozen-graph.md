No, TensorFlow 2.x does not directly produce a frozen graph in the same way TensorFlow 1.x did with its `tf.graph` and session-based execution. The core paradigm shift in TensorFlow 2.x towards eager execution and graph construction via `tf.function` necessitates a different understanding of what a "frozen graph" represents and how to achieve a similar outcome. A direct comparison to the frozen graph obtained using `tf.compat.v1.graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants` is inaccurate. In essence, the process of converting a TensorFlow 2.x model for deployment is now more accurately described as model *serialization* and subsequent *loading*, rather than *freezing* in the prior sense.

Let me elaborate, drawing from my experience migrating various TensorFlow 1.x projects to TensorFlow 2.x. In TensorFlow 1.x, we would define a computation graph, create placeholders for input data, and then execute this graph within a session. After training, the graph could be 'frozen' by embedding the trained variable values directly into the graph as constants, thus removing the dependence on separate variable files. The result was a single, self-contained `.pb` (protocol buffer) file, often called a "frozen graph". This streamlined deployment across different environments because it avoided needing to manage separate variable checkpoints.

TensorFlow 2.x, by default, operates in eager mode, where operations execute immediately and the graph is dynamically constructed as the code runs. While this facilitates debugging and experimentation, it doesn't naturally lend itself to the concept of a static, standalone "frozen graph." To benefit from the performance optimizations of graph execution in 2.x, we use the `@tf.function` decorator which transforms Python functions into TensorFlow graphs. But even after leveraging `@tf.function`, there is no single function or method that generates a `frozen_graph.pb` directly as in TF1.x. Instead, we utilize the SavedModel format. This format is more flexible, allowing us to save not just the computational graph, but also variables, assets, and the metadata necessary for loading and running the model in various serving environments. The serialized form, therefore, isn't just a graph, but a directory containing various files.

The core idea is to save your trained model, then load it back for inference using TensorFlow's loading mechanisms. While no `convert_variables_to_constants` is directly required, it can appear that the variables are "frozen" into the saved graph because they exist as constant values within the `SavedModel`. The model, when loaded, no longer relies on external variables.

Here are a few illustrative examples.

**Example 1: A simple linear model training and saving.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os

# Define a simple linear model.
class LinearModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.W = tf.Variable(np.random.rand(), dtype=tf.float32)
        self.b = tf.Variable(np.random.rand(), dtype=tf.float32)

    @tf.function
    def call(self, x):
        return self.W * x + self.b

# Prepare some training data.
X_train = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
y_train = tf.constant([3.0, 5.0, 7.0], dtype=tf.float32)

# Instantiate model, optimizer, and loss function
model = LinearModel()
optimizer = tf.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
loss_func = lambda y_true, y_pred: tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

# Train loop
epochs = 100
for i in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
       y_pred = model(X_train)
       loss = loss_func(y_train, y_pred)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    if i % 10 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch {i}: Loss: {loss.numpy()}")


# Define path to save model
SAVE_PATH = "saved_model_linear"
if not os.path.exists(SAVE_PATH):
    os.makedirs(SAVE_PATH)
tf.saved_model.save(model, SAVE_PATH)

print("Model saved to", SAVE_PATH)
```
This code snippet demonstrates training a basic linear model using TensorFlow 2.x. It defines the model as a `tf.keras.Model`, decorates the call function with `@tf.function`, which causes the computation to be traced and later executed as an efficient TensorFlow graph. The trained model is then saved using `tf.saved_model.save` to a folder `saved_model_linear`. This folder, not a single `.pb` file, contains the SavedModel. The variables ‘W’ and ‘b’ are saved as values with their corresponding graph nodes within this folder, effectively eliminating the need to load from separate checkpoint files.

**Example 2: Loading and using the SavedModel for inference.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define path where model is saved
SAVE_PATH = "saved_model_linear"

# Load the saved model.
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(SAVE_PATH)

# Generate data to test the saved model
test_data = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0], dtype=tf.float32)

# Make predictions using the loaded model
predictions = loaded_model(test_data)

# Print the predictions.
print(f"Predictions: {predictions}")
```
Here, we load the saved model from the directory generated in Example 1, by calling `tf.saved_model.load`. This object encapsulates the graph, trained parameters and any associated metadata needed for execution.  No manual reconstruction of a graph or loading of variables are necessary. The model is treated just like a Python object, allowing simple inference calls such as `loaded_model(test_data)`. This reflects the "serialized" aspect of the model where graph structure, weights and biases all exist within the saved artifacts.

**Example 3: Converting a TensorFlow 2.X SavedModel for TensorFlow Lite**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
# The path where model was saved (from example 1)
SAVE_PATH = "saved_model_linear"

# Load the SavedModel
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(SAVE_PATH)

# Get a concrete function from the SavedModel (required for tflite conversion)
concrete_func = loaded_model.signatures[tf.saved_model.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY]

# Initialize TFLite Converter
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_concrete_functions([concrete_func])

# Convert the model.
tflite_model = converter.convert()

# Save the converted model
with open('linear_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)

print("Model converted and saved as linear_model.tflite")
```

This example illustrates a common downstream usage pattern.  We utilize the same model we saved earlier.  The TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) converter, accessible through `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter`, can convert SavedModels into a `tflite` format for mobile or embedded device usage.  A crucial step here involves extracting a concrete function from the `SavedModel`'s signatures.  This concrete function provides the graph and associated metadata for conversion. TFLite format conversion is an indirect process leveraging saved models in TF2, rather than a direct function such as `convert_variables_to_constants` found in TF1.

**Summary and Resource Recommendations**

In essence, while TensorFlow 2.x does not offer a direct analog to the `frozen_graph.pb` of its predecessor, the `SavedModel` format achieves a similar deployment objective, incorporating model architecture, weights, and operational definitions into a readily loadable structure. The `SavedModel` folder allows loading and inference without requiring explicit variable management. Post training conversion for different downstream applications, such as for mobile deployment via TFLite requires these saved models for its input. Therefore, instead of the concept of "freezing," it is more accurate to consider the concept of saving and serializing models for later loading and inference.

To delve deeper, I suggest exploring the following resources. Consult the official TensorFlow documentation focusing on `tf.function`, `tf.keras.Model`, `tf.saved_model`, and `tf.lite`. There are detailed guides on model saving, loading, and subsequent use. Check the TensorFlow tutorials specifically related to model saving and deployment, these usually cover using the `SavedModel` format. Finally, the source code for TensorFlow's core functionality provides the ultimate insight into these transformation. Examining the implementations of the `SavedModel` loading and TFLite conversion processes will provide an extremely deep understanding of the underlying mechanics. These resources should clarify any ambiguity and provide a solid foundation for utilizing these concepts in practical settings.
