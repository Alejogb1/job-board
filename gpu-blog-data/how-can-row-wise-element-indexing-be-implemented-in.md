PyTorch's C++ API, while powerful, doesn't directly expose a function mirroring Python's convenient row-wise indexing using boolean masks or integer arrays.  Achieving this requires leveraging PyTorch's tensor manipulation capabilities and understanding the underlying memory layout. My experience optimizing deep learning models for embedded systems extensively utilized this technique, so I'll outline the process.

1. **Understanding the Core Challenge:**  The challenge stems from the difference between Python's high-level array manipulation and the lower-level control required in C++. Python's `tensor[mask]` implicitly handles memory access and reshaping, which needs explicit management in C++.  We need to construct a new tensor containing the selected rows, rather than directly indexing in place.

2. **The Approach: Gather Operations and Advanced Indexing**  The most efficient approach involves PyTorch's `torch::gather` operation in combination with advanced indexing techniques using tensors of indices.  `gather` allows efficient selection of elements based on indices provided in a separate tensor. This avoids the overhead of iterating through the tensor manually in a C++ loop.

3. **Code Example 1: Boolean Mask Indexing**

```cpp
#include <torch/torch.h>

// ... other includes and setup ...

auto boolean_mask_indexing(const torch::Tensor& tensor, const torch::Tensor& mask) {
  // Assert mask is a 1D boolean tensor of appropriate size
  TORCH_CHECK(mask.dim() == 1 && mask.numel() == tensor.size(0),
              "Mask dimension mismatch");

  // Find indices of True values in the mask
  auto indices = torch::nonzero(mask).view(-1);

  // Use gather to select rows
  return torch::gather(tensor, 0, indices);
}

int main() {
  //Example Usage
  auto tensor = torch::arange(12).reshape({3, 4}).to(torch::kFloat32);
  auto mask = torch::tensor({true, false, true});
  auto result = boolean_mask_indexing(tensor, mask);
  std::cout << result << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This function takes a 2D tensor and a boolean mask as input.  `torch::nonzero` efficiently identifies the indices of `true` values.  `torch::gather` then selects rows based on these indices along dimension 0.  Error handling using `TORCH_CHECK` ensures the mask's validity.

4. **Code Example 2: Integer Array Indexing**

```cpp
#include <torch/torch.h>

// ... other includes and setup ...

auto integer_array_indexing(const torch::Tensor& tensor, const torch::Tensor& indices) {
  // Assert indices is a 1D tensor of long integers
  TORCH_CHECK(indices.dim() == 1 && indices.dtype() == torch::kLong,
              "Indices must be a 1D tensor of long integers");

  //Check index bounds
  auto max_index = indices.max().item<long>();
  TORCH_CHECK(max_index < tensor.size(0), "Index out of bounds");

  //Use gather to select rows
  return torch::gather(tensor, 0, indices);
}

int main() {
  //Example Usage
  auto tensor = torch::arange(12).reshape({3, 4}).to(torch::kFloat32);
  auto indices = torch::tensor({0, 2}).to(torch::kLong);
  auto result = integer_array_indexing(tensor, indices);
  std::cout << result << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This function uses a tensor of integer indices directly.  Crucially, it includes error checking to prevent out-of-bounds access, a common source of segmentation faults in C++.  The `gather` operation remains the core of the row selection.


5. **Code Example 3:  Advanced Indexing with Multiple Dimensions**

This example demonstrates selecting specific rows *and* columns, showcasing the flexibility of advanced indexing in PyTorch's C++ API.

```cpp
#include <torch/torch.h>

// ... other includes and setup ...

auto advanced_indexing(const torch::Tensor& tensor, const torch::Tensor& row_indices, const torch::Tensor& col_indices) {
  // Error handling omitted for brevity, but crucial in production code.  Check dimensions and types.

  return tensor.index_select(0, row_indices).index_select(1, col_indices);
}

int main() {
    //Example usage
    auto tensor = torch::arange(12).reshape({3, 4}).to(torch::kFloat32);
    auto row_indices = torch::tensor({0, 2}).to(torch::kLong);
    auto col_indices = torch::tensor({1, 3}).to(torch::kLong);
    auto result = advanced_indexing(tensor, row_indices, col_indices);
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Here, `index_select` is used twice: once for rows and once for columns.  This allows precise selection of elements based on both row and column indices.  Thorough error handling, checking the dimensions and types of input tensors, should be included in a production-ready function.

6. **Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is paramount in C++.  Always validate input tensor dimensions, data types, and index bounds to prevent crashes.  `TORCH_CHECK` macro is a good starting point.
* **Memory Management:**  PyTorch's automatic memory management simplifies things, but for very large tensors, manual memory management might improve performance.
* **Performance Optimization:** For extremely performance-critical applications, consider using CUDA for GPU acceleration. PyTorch's C++ API supports CUDA operations seamlessly.
* **Alternatives:** While `gather` and `index_select` are efficient for most cases, other methods like looping with explicit memory access might be necessary for very specialized scenarios.  However, this is generally less efficient and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

7. **Resource Recommendations:**

* The official PyTorch C++ API documentation.
* A comprehensive C++ programming textbook focusing on memory management and performance optimization.
*  A book or online resource focusing on linear algebra and tensor operations.


This approach using `gather` and advanced indexing provides a robust and efficient way to implement row-wise element indexing in PyTorch from C++, directly addressing the limitations of a direct translation from Python's higher-level syntax.  Remember that rigorous error handling and careful attention to memory management are essential for developing production-quality code in C++.
