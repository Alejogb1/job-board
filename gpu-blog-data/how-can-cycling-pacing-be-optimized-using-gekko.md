Optimizing cycling pace with Gekko necessitates a nuanced understanding of the model's constraints and the physiological realities of cycling performance.  My experience working on similar problems in biomechanical modeling highlights the critical role of accurately representing fatigue and power output dynamics, especially when dealing with local infeasibility.  Simply put, Gekko's solution robustness depends heavily on correctly formulating the objective function and the constraints, particularly when dealing with non-convexities inherent in human physiological responses.


**1. Clear Explanation:  Addressing Local Infeasibility in Cycling Pace Optimization**

Local infeasibility in Gekko, when optimizing cycling pace, arises from conflicts between constraints. This is frequently observed due to the non-linear relationship between power output, time, and physiological limitations like lactate threshold.  A common source is defining constraints too tightly, forcing the solver to search for solutions in an infeasible region of the search space.  Another significant contributor is the discretization of the problem.  If the time horizon is divided into too few intervals, the solver might struggle to find a feasible solution that smoothly accounts for variations in power output.  Furthermore, inaccurate representation of the cyclist's physiological model (e.g., simplified power-duration relationship) can lead to local infeasibilities.

My approach to tackling this involves a multi-pronged strategy:  Firstly, I carefully analyze the constraint formulation, ensuring they are realistically achievable and do not conflict. Secondly, I employ a robust solver configuration within Gekko, selecting appropriate tolerances and algorithms to enhance the solver's ability to escape local infeasible regions.  Finally, I refine the model discretization and adjust physiological parameters to better capture the nuances of cycling performance.  Often, a combination of these strategies is necessary to achieve a globally feasible and optimal solution.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following code examples demonstrate different strategies for addressing local infeasibility in Gekko-based cycling pace optimization.  These examples assume a basic understanding of Gekko's syntax and optimization concepts.

**Example 1:  Relaxing Constraints through Slack Variables**

This example introduces slack variables to relax constraints, allowing the solver more freedom to find a feasible solution.  The slack variables penalize deviations from the ideal constraint values, preventing excessive relaxation.

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
import numpy as np

m = GEKKO(remote=False)
nt = 101  # Number of time points
t = m.linspace(0, 1, nt) # normalized time

# Power output (adjustable)
p = m.Var(value=200, lb=0, ub=400) # Adjust bounds as needed

# Heart Rate constraint
hr = m.Var(value=120, lb=60, ub=180)
m.Equation(hr == 60 + 0.8*p + m.MV(value=0,lb=-5,ub=5)) # Slack for HR
#Slack variable penalty
m.Minimize(m.abs(m.MV(value=0)))

# Fatigue model (simplified)
fatigue = m.Var(value=0, lb=0, ub=1)
m.Equation(fatigue.dt() == 0.001*p**2)  # Fatigue increases quadratically with power

# Constraint on fatigue
m.Equation(fatigue <= 0.8) #Adjust upper bound based on experience

# Objective function: Maximize average power over the race
m.Maximize(m.integral(p))

m.options.IMODE = 6  # Dynamic optimization
m.solve(disp=False)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(t, p.value)
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Power (Watts)')
plt.title('Cycling Pace Optimization with Slack Variable')
plt.show()
```

**Commentary:** The slack variable in the heart rate equation allows for minor deviations from the ideal heart rate.  The minimization of the absolute value of this slack variable acts as a penalty, pushing the solution toward the ideal constraint while avoiding infeasibility.  Similarly, adjusted upper bounds for variables based on experience and physiological limits are key to avoiding infeasible scenarios.


**Example 2:  Improving Discretization**

This example increases the number of time points to improve the solver's ability to find a feasible solution.  A finer discretization allows for smoother transitions in power output, mitigating the potential for conflicts between constraints.

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
# ... (rest of the code similar to Example 1, but with nt = 501)
```

**Commentary:**  Increasing `nt` from 101 to 501 significantly refines the time resolution, offering the solver more flexibility in finding a feasible trajectory. This often resolves local infeasibilities that stem from insufficient discretization.


**Example 3:  Using a Different Solver**

This example explores using a different solver within Gekko.  Different solvers have varying strengths in handling non-convex problems and escaping local minima.

```python
from gekko import GEKKO
# ... (rest of the code similar to Example 1)

m.options.SOLVER = 3 # Change solver (e.g., IPOPT)
m.solve(disp=False)
```

**Commentary:** Experimentation with different solvers, such as IPOPT or APOPT, can be crucial when dealing with local infeasibilities.  Each solver has its own algorithmic characteristics, and one might prove more effective than another in navigating a challenging optimization landscape.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of Gekko, I recommend consulting the official Gekko documentation.  Furthermore, exploration of advanced optimization techniques, like sensitivity analysis and constraint qualification checks, provides valuable tools to diagnose and resolve issues related to local infeasibilities.   Finally, reviewing literature on physiological models of cycling performance and fatigue is essential for building accurate and realistic models that are less prone to infeasibility.  This combination of theoretical and practical knowledge is key to effective optimization.
