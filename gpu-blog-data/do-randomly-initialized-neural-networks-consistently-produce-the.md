The deterministic nature of typical neural network training and inference algorithms, absent specific stochastic components, dictates that identical network architectures initialized with the same weights will produce identical outputs for the same inputs.  However, the question's core lies in the behavior when *random* initialization is employed, and whether repeated runs with different random seeds yield consistent results.  My experience in developing high-performance deep learning systems has shown this to be definitively false.  The output will vary significantly.

The inconsistency stems directly from the random weight initialization strategy.  Common methods, such as Xavier/Glorot and He initialization, utilize pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs).  While these generators produce sequences appearing random, they are entirely deterministic given a seed value.  Changing the seed alters the entire sequence of random numbers used to initialize the network's weights, profoundly impacting the network's internal representation and consequently, its output.  This variability is not simply noise; it reflects the fundamental non-linearity of neural networks and the sensitivity of their internal states to initial conditions.  Even small variations in weight initialization can lead to dramatically different learned representations and ultimately, different outputs, even for the same input.

This is not to say that there's no structure to this variability.  The range and distribution of output differences depend on several factors: the network architecture (depth, width, activation functions), the optimization algorithm, the dataset characteristics, and of course, the specific PRNG used.  Furthermore, the impact of varied initialization is usually more pronounced in the early stages of training.  As the network learns, the effect of initial weight values diminishes, although it rarely disappears entirely.

Let's illustrate this with code examples using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.  These examples demonstrate the effect of different random seeds on the final output of a simple neural network.

**Example 1:  Simple Feedforward Network**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def run_network(seed):
    tf.random.set_seed(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)

    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)
    return model.predict(np.array([[0.1]*10]))

print(run_network(42))
print(run_network(137))
print(run_network(271828))
```

This example trains a small feedforward network on randomly generated data.  The crucial line is `tf.random.set_seed(seed)`, which sets the seed for TensorFlow's random number generator.  Each call to `run_network` with a different seed will produce a distinct model and a correspondingly distinct prediction.  The variation in output will be significant, demonstrating the non-deterministic nature of the process.

**Example 2:  Impact of Epochs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def run_network_epochs(seed, epochs):
    tf.random.set_seed(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)

    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=epochs, verbose=0)
    return model.predict(np.array([[0.1]*10]))

print(run_network_epochs(42, 10))
print(run_network_epochs(42, 100))
print(run_network_epochs(137, 1000))
```

Here, we demonstrate how the number of epochs influences the consistency.  While different seeds will still generate different outputs, the difference may become smaller with a higher number of epochs.  However, even with a very large number of epochs, complete consistency is unlikely given the inherent non-linearity of the network and the random initialization.

**Example 3:  Different Initialization Strategies**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def run_network_init(seed, initializer):
    tf.random.set_seed(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)

    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,), kernel_initializer=initializer),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, kernel_initializer=initializer)
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    x_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)

    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, verbose=0)
    return model.predict(np.array([[0.1]*10]))


print(run_network_init(42, tf.keras.initializers.GlorotUniform()))
print(run_network_init(42, tf.keras.initializers.HeUniform()))
print(run_network_init(137, tf.keras.initializers.RandomNormal()))
```

This final example highlights the influence of different weight initializers.  Even with the same seed, altering the initializer (e.g., from GlorotUniform to HeUniform or RandomNormal) will lead to substantially different network behaviors and predictions.  This underscores that the random initialization's impact is not solely determined by the seed but also by the distribution of the random weights themselves.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of neural network initialization, I recommend consulting standard textbooks on deep learning and machine learning.  Look for chapters detailing optimization algorithms and weight initialization strategies.  Further research into the mathematical properties of pseudorandom number generators would also prove beneficial.  The documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) contains detailed information on random number generation and initialization functions.  Finally, explore research papers on the impact of weight initialization on training dynamics and generalization performance.
