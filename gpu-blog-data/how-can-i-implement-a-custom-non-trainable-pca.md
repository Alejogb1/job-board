Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is fundamentally a dimensionality reduction technique that relies on linear transformations computed from the data’s covariance structure; therefore, direct implementation as a trainable layer in a neural network, where weights are learned via backpropagation, does not fully capture its intended behavior. I've encountered this challenge when developing an efficient representation for time series data where pre-processing with PCA was crucial. While Keras `tf.keras.layers` are optimized for training, implementing a static PCA layer requires a different approach.

The essence of implementing a custom, non-trainable PCA layer in Keras involves pre-computing the PCA transformation matrix using your dataset and then embedding that transformation as a layer that applies this fixed matrix. This custom layer, therefore, acts as a static projection that is independent of the neural network's training process. This contrasts with techniques such as autoencoders which *learn* a similar kind of dimensionality reduction.

Here’s a breakdown of how I've handled this in practice:

**1. Compute the PCA Transformation:**

Before defining the custom Keras layer, you must calculate the PCA projection matrix using a dataset representative of your input data. I typically use `scikit-learn` for this because of its ease of use and efficiency.

**Code Example 1: PCA Pre-computation with Scikit-learn**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def compute_pca_projection(data, n_components):
    """
    Computes the PCA projection matrix from a dataset.

    Args:
        data (np.ndarray): Input data (n_samples, n_features).
        n_components (int): Number of principal components to retain.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: PCA projection matrix (n_features, n_components).
        StandardScaler: scaler object for standardization
    """
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

    pca = PCA(n_components=n_components)
    pca.fit(scaled_data)

    return pca.components_.T, scaler


# Example usage:
sample_data = np.random.rand(1000, 64) # 1000 samples, 64 features
n_principal_components = 16
projection_matrix, data_scaler = compute_pca_projection(sample_data, n_principal_components)

print(f"Projection Matrix Shape: {projection_matrix.shape}") # Output: (64, 16)
```
This function standardizes the input data to ensure all features contribute equally to the PCA result. The resulting PCA components are then transposed to give a matrix that can be directly used for projection by a matrix multiplication. Note the `data_scaler` is also returned, and will be crucial for correctly transforming any data before passing it to the custom layer.

**2. Creating the Custom Keras Layer:**

The custom Keras layer will take the pre-computed projection matrix and implement a static linear transformation. We inherit from `tf.keras.layers.Layer` and implement `build` to initialize the matrix and `call` to perform the projection. Critically, this layer should *not* perform updates during training.

**Code Example 2: Custom Non-Trainable PCA Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class PCALayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, projection_matrix, data_scaler, **kwargs):
        super(PCALayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.projection_matrix = tf.constant(projection_matrix, dtype=tf.float32) # ensures constants
        self.data_scaler = data_scaler # store scaling info
        self.built = True # Flag to skip build

    def call(self, inputs):
        scaled_inputs = self.data_scaler.transform(inputs)
        scaled_inputs = tf.convert_to_tensor(scaled_inputs, dtype=tf.float32)
        return tf.matmul(scaled_inputs, self.projection_matrix)

    def get_config(self):
      config = super().get_config()
      config.update({
            "projection_matrix": self.projection_matrix.numpy(),
            "data_scaler": self.data_scaler
      })
      return config
```

Key considerations within this layer implementation:

*   The `projection_matrix` is declared as a `tf.constant` making it non-trainable.
*   I incorporate the standardization using the `data_scaler` stored during the initial PCA computation, this ensures the data fed into the layer follows the exact same scaling regime. This can be modified by incorporating this step into the layer, or not at all if data scaling is handled externally. The `StandardScaler` is a stateful object and requires the use of its `.transform` method rather than its object to be passed into the layer.
*   The `call` method performs the actual matrix multiplication to project the input data into the PCA subspace. The `built` flag skips `build` because the weights are static
*   The `get_config` method is included to allow loading the layer from a saved model. `StandardScaler` is serializable.

**3. Integrating the PCA Layer in a Keras Model:**

The custom PCA layer can then be incorporated into a Keras model like any other layer. The key distinction is that it requires the pre-computed transformation matrix and `StandardScaler` as constructor arguments, and it does not participate in gradient-based learning.

**Code Example 3: Integrating PCALayer into a Keras Model**

```python
from tensorflow.keras import layers, Model

input_shape = (64,)
model_input = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)

pca_layer = PCALayer(projection_matrix, data_scaler)(model_input) # instatiating

dense_1 = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(pca_layer)
output_layer = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(dense_1)

model = Model(inputs=model_input, outputs=output_layer)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.summary()
```

In this example, I define a simple model that includes the custom `PCALayer`. Notice how the initial PCA transformation is static, while the subsequent layers are trained. Any data fed into the model will pass through the precomputed transformation from the `PCALayer` before any learnable layers.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of PCA, I recommend:

1.  **Statistical Analysis Texts:** Texts that cover the mathematics of multivariate analysis, which PCA falls under, typically offer detailed mathematical formulations and proofs. Focus on books that discuss eigenvalue decomposition and singular value decomposition as these form the basis of PCA.
2.  **Dimensionality Reduction Literature:** Explore works that specifically discuss the application of PCA for dimensionality reduction and its role in data analysis. These often provide conceptual explanations and practical applications.
3.  **Scikit-learn Documentation:** The official documentation provides comprehensive information about the `PCA` implementation in Python, including its parameters and various applications.
4.  **TensorFlow Documentation:** The Tensorflow documentation is a necessary resource to understand the implementation of custom Keras layers and the details of their API
5.  **Machine Learning Engineering References:** Materials that focus on practical aspects of building machine learning systems, including topics like data preprocessing and model deployment, are invaluable.

In summary, a non-trainable PCA layer in Keras requires a two-step process: first, pre-compute the transformation matrix with a dataset using `sklearn` or other tools, and second, implement a custom Keras layer which applies that fixed matrix during model inference. This approach ensures that the PCA transformation remains fixed, achieving the desired static dimensionality reduction within a neural network architecture. While this approach doesn’t allow for training the transformation, it guarantees that the PCA preprocessing remains consistent across datasets and is consistent with the original formulation of PCA, and is less computationally expensive in situations where the PCA transformation is already known.
