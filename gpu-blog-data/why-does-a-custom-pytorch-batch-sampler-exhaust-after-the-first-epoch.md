A common pitfall when implementing custom batch samplers in PyTorch, particularly for complex data loading scenarios, is the unintentional exhaustion of the iterator after a single epoch. This arises from how the sampler's internal state is often managed—or, rather, *not* managed—in relation to the `DataLoader`. I've encountered this myself when building custom data pipelines for sequence-based models, where the natural ordering of data wasn't suitable for efficient training and required specific batching strategies.

The core issue lies in the expectation of the `DataLoader` regarding iterator behavior. A standard PyTorch `DataLoader` expects that the `__iter__` method of the provided sampler will return an iterator that can be repeatedly invoked across multiple epochs. Specifically, the `DataLoader` assumes that a fresh iterator will be generated at the start of each epoch. However, if the custom batch sampler's iterator maintains a single, mutable state that's progressively depleted during iteration, this re-initialization never occurs, leading to the 'exhaustion' after the first pass.

The `DataLoader` does not directly re-instantiate the `sampler` object itself. Instead, it repeatedly calls `iter(sampler)` to obtain a new iterator. Therefore, the `sampler`'s `__iter__` method is the crucial point for state management and iterator creation. Without explicit logic to reset internal counters or data structures, the returned iterator will continue to operate with its depleted state and yield nothing in subsequent epochs.

To illustrate, let's consider a basic custom sampler. Imagine a scenario where we want to sample data based on a pre-defined set of indices. Assume we intend to generate batches of size `batch_size` from the pool of available indices.

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Sampler

class MyBadSampler(Sampler):
    def __init__(self, data_length, batch_size):
        self.indices = list(range(data_length))
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.current_index = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        while self.current_index < len(self.indices):
            batch_indices = self.indices[self.current_index: self.current_index + self.batch_size]
            self.current_index += self.batch_size
            yield batch_indices

    def __len__(self):
        return (len(self.indices) + self.batch_size - 1) // self.batch_size


if __name__ == '__main__':
    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
    data = torch.randn(100, 10)
    dataset = TensorDataset(data)
    bad_sampler = MyBadSampler(len(dataset), 10)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_sampler = bad_sampler)

    for epoch in range(2):
        print(f"Epoch: {epoch}")
        for batch in dataloader:
             print(f"Batch shape: {batch[0].shape}") # Prints for first epoch, but not second.

```

In this `MyBadSampler`, the `current_index` is initialized at zero, incremented during batch generation, but never reset. When the `DataLoader` asks for the iterator again in the second epoch, the `current_index` remains at the end of the `indices` list and, as such, the iterator will exhaust immediately. This demonstrates the fundamental flaw: the iterator's state is tied to the state of the sampler's object, and it’s not re-initialized between epochs.

Here is a revised implementation that addresses the above issue:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Sampler

class MyGoodSampler(Sampler):
    def __init__(self, data_length, batch_size):
        self.indices = list(range(data_length))
        self.batch_size = batch_size

    def __iter__(self):
        current_index = 0
        while current_index < len(self.indices):
            batch_indices = self.indices[current_index: current_index + self.batch_size]
            current_index += self.batch_size
            yield batch_indices

    def __len__(self):
        return (len(self.indices) + self.batch_size - 1) // self.batch_size


if __name__ == '__main__':
    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
    data = torch.randn(100, 10)
    dataset = TensorDataset(data)
    good_sampler = MyGoodSampler(len(dataset), 10)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_sampler = good_sampler)

    for epoch in range(2):
        print(f"Epoch: {epoch}")
        for batch in dataloader:
             print(f"Batch shape: {batch[0].shape}") # Prints for both epochs correctly
```

In `MyGoodSampler`, the critical change lies within the `__iter__` method: `current_index` is now initialized *inside* the iterator function scope rather than as part of the sampler object. This ensures a fresh start for each iterator returned by `__iter__`. The iterator's state becomes local and ephemeral to the function, not persisting between calls of `__iter__`. Each epoch now has its own independent iteration process.

Finally, consider a more complex case. Suppose we have a sampler that not only samples data but shuffles it at the start of each epoch, emulating the behavior of `RandomSampler`. This adds an extra layer of complexity:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Sampler
import random

class MyShufflingSampler(Sampler):
    def __init__(self, data_length, batch_size):
        self.data_length = data_length
        self.batch_size = batch_size

    def __iter__(self):
        indices = list(range(self.data_length))
        random.shuffle(indices)
        current_index = 0

        while current_index < len(indices):
            batch_indices = indices[current_index: current_index + self.batch_size]
            current_index += self.batch_size
            yield batch_indices

    def __len__(self):
          return (self.data_length + self.batch_size - 1) // self.batch_size



if __name__ == '__main__':
    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
    data = torch.randn(100, 10)
    dataset = TensorDataset(data)
    shuffling_sampler = MyShufflingSampler(len(dataset), 10)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_sampler = shuffling_sampler)

    for epoch in range(2):
        print(f"Epoch: {epoch}")
        for batch in dataloader:
             print(f"Batch shape: {batch[0].shape}")
```

In `MyShufflingSampler`,  the crucial line `random.shuffle(indices)` is called *inside* the iterator function. Each time a new iterator is requested by the `DataLoader`, the indices are shuffled anew. This correctly ensures that a fresh, randomized sampling occurs for each epoch without exhausting.

Key takeaway: The `__iter__` method of custom samplers must construct a new iterator at each call, completely resetting any necessary internal state. The state should be managed *within* the iterator, not as part of the sampler class attributes. This aligns with the contract of how the `DataLoader` expects a sampler to behave.

For further guidance on data loading best practices in PyTorch, consult the PyTorch official documentation on `torch.utils.data` specifically focusing on `Sampler` and `DataLoader`. There are many tutorials online but understanding the base API from the documentation is often more efficient. Books and guides dedicated to deep learning with PyTorch also provide excellent material on advanced data handling techniques. A solid understanding of iterator behavior and class design principles will also greatly benefit any work involving custom batch sampling.
