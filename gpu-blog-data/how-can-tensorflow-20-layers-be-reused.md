TensorFlow 2.0's inherent flexibility in layer reuse stems from its object-oriented design.  Layers are fundamentally Python classes, allowing instantiation and subsequent reapplication across different parts of a model or even in entirely separate models.  This contrasts sharply with earlier TensorFlow versions, where defining and reusing model components required more manual graph manipulation.  My experience building large-scale recommendation systems heavily relied on this feature to promote modularity and reduce code redundancy.

**1. Clear Explanation of Layer Reuse Mechanisms**

TensorFlow 2.0 layers, subclasses of `tf.keras.layers.Layer`, encapsulate both weights and the computation they perform.  Reuse primarily involves creating an instance of a layer class and then calling it multiple times within a model.  The crucial aspect is that each call to the layer instance uses the *same* set of weights.  This is in contrast to creating multiple instances of the same layer class, which would result in independent weight sets for each instance.

The key mechanisms facilitating reuse are:

* **Layer Instantiation:**  Creating a layer object, e.g., `my_dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')`.  This allocates the necessary weights (in this case, a weight matrix and bias vector) within the layer instance.

* **Layer Call:** Calling the layer object as a function, e.g., `output = my_dense_layer(input_tensor)`. This applies the layer's computation to the input tensor using the internally stored weights. Subsequent calls to `my_dense_layer` with different input tensors will utilize the same learned weights, updating them during training.

* **Model Subclassing:**  This allows incorporating reused layers into custom models, promoting structured model building.  Defining a model class with existing layers as attributes ensures consistency in weight usage across different parts of the model, or even different model instances.

* **Functional API:**  This approach offers a more flexible, graph-based approach to building models. Reused layers are simply added to the graph multiple times.  While offering more explicit control, it necessitates careful management of tensor shapes to ensure compatibility between layer calls.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Simple Reuse within a Sequential Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a custom layer (optional, but demonstrates customizability)
class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, activation='relu')

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense(inputs)

# Create a layer instance
my_layer = MyCustomLayer(64)

# Reuse the layer in a Sequential model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    my_layer,  # First use
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    my_layer,  # Second use (shares weights with the first use)
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.summary()
```

This example clearly demonstrates reuse within a `Sequential` model.  The `MyCustomLayer` instance (`my_layer`) is added twice, ensuring both occurrences share the same weights during training.  The `model.summary()` call will highlight that both instances refer to the same weight parameters.


**Example 2: Reuse within the Functional API**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

input_tensor = tf.keras.Input(shape=(784,))
shared_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')
branch1_output = shared_layer(input_tensor)
branch2_output = shared_layer(input_tensor) # Reuse
merged_output = tf.keras.layers.concatenate([branch1_output, branch2_output])
output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(merged_output)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=output)
model.summary()
```

This showcases reuse within the Functional API. The `shared_layer` is called twice, processing the same input tensor independently yet sharing the same weight parameters. The `concatenate` layer merges the outputs before the final classification layer.

**Example 3: Reuse Across Models**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a reusable layer
my_conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')

# Model 1
model1 = tf.keras.Sequential([
    my_conv_layer,
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Model 2 (using the same conv layer)
model2 = tf.keras.Sequential([
    my_conv_layer,  # Reusing my_conv_layer
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(100, activation='softmax')
])

model1.summary()
model2.summary()
```

This demonstrates reuse across separate models. The `my_conv_layer` is instantiated once and then utilized in both `model1` and `model2`.  This showcases how a pre-trained or custom-designed layer can be seamlessly integrated into different model architectures.  Note that training one model will affect the weights used in the other, unless you use `model.save_weights` and `model.load_weights` to manage this independently.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive coverage of Keras layers and model building techniques.  Studying the source code of various Keras layers will deepen your understanding of their internal mechanisms and how weights are handled.  Books focusing on deep learning with TensorFlow, particularly those emphasizing practical aspects of model construction, are invaluable resources.  Finally, reviewing articles and tutorials specific to the Functional API and model subclassing will significantly improve your proficiency with advanced layer reuse strategies.  Exploring pre-trained models available through TensorFlow Hub can demonstrate effective reuse in real-world scenarios.
