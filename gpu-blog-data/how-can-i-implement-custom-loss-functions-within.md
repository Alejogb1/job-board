Implementing custom loss functions within TensorFlow/Keras RNN cells necessitates a nuanced understanding of how Keras handles layer construction and the backpropagation process.  My experience optimizing sequence-to-sequence models for natural language processing tasks highlighted the limitations of pre-built loss functions when dealing with complex, asymmetric data distributions.  Specifically, the inability to directly incorporate prior knowledge regarding the temporal dependencies within the sequences often led to suboptimal performance. Therefore, a deep dive into creating custom loss functions is crucial for achieving superior results.

**1.  Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in defining a loss function that correctly evaluates the output of an RNN cell at each timestep, considering both the current prediction and the temporal context provided by previous predictions and inputs.  Standard Keras loss functions, like `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` or `mean_squared_error`, are designed for simpler models and do not inherently capture the sequential nature of RNN outputs.  To address this, we must define a loss function that iterates through the timesteps of the RNN's output sequence, calculates the loss at each step, and then aggregates these individual losses to produce a final scalar loss value.  This aggregated loss is then used by the optimizer to update the model's weights during backpropagation.

Crucially, we need to carefully manage the shapes and dimensions of the tensors involved.  The RNN's output will usually be a three-dimensional tensor of shape (batch_size, timesteps, features), where `features` represents the dimensionality of the output at each timestep.  Our custom loss function must correctly handle this multi-dimensional structure and ensure that the loss calculation is performed correctly across all dimensions.  Furthermore, the use of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities is paramount for efficient gradient calculation and model training.

The approach typically involves defining a Python function that accepts the `y_true` (ground truth) and `y_pred` (model predictions) tensors as input.  Inside this function, we iterate through the timesteps, calculate the loss for each timestep (using a suitable loss function for the specific task, such as MSE or categorical cross-entropy), and then sum or average these per-timestep losses to obtain the final loss value.  This function is then passed to the `compile` method of the Keras model.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Mean Squared Error across Timesteps**

This example demonstrates a custom MSE loss function for a regression task where the target variable is a sequence of continuous values.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_mse_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    mse_per_timestep = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred), axis=-1) #MSE at each timestep
    total_mse = tf.reduce_mean(mse_per_timestep, axis=1) #average across timesteps
    return total_mse

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(features)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_mse_loss)
```

This code defines a custom MSE loss function (`custom_mse_loss`) that computes MSE at each timestep and then averages the MSE across timesteps. This average is then returned as the final loss value. This caters for the sequential nature of the RNN output.  The `axis` parameter in `tf.reduce_mean` controls which dimension the averaging is performed over.

**Example 2: Weighted Categorical Cross-Entropy**

This example shows a custom loss function incorporating weights to address class imbalances in a classification problem.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def weighted_cce_loss(y_true, y_pred, class_weights):
    cce_per_timestep = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
    weighted_cce = tf.reduce_mean(cce_per_timestep * class_weights, axis=-1)
    total_weighted_cce = tf.reduce_mean(weighted_cce, axis=1)
    return total_weighted_cce

class_weights = tf.constant([0.2, 0.8]) # Example weights

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=lambda y_true, y_pred: weighted_cce_loss(y_true, y_pred, class_weights))
```

This demonstrates a custom weighted categorical cross-entropy loss function.  The `class_weights` tensor allows assigning different weights to different classes, crucial when dealing with imbalanced datasets.  The lambda function is used to pass the `class_weights` to the custom loss function during compilation.

**Example 3: Incorporating a Regularization Term**

This example showcases adding an L2 regularization term to the loss function to prevent overfitting.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss_with_regularization(y_true, y_pred, regularization_strength=0.01):
    mse_per_timestep = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred), axis=-1)
    total_mse = tf.reduce_mean(mse_per_timestep, axis=1)
    regularization_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.l2_loss(model.layers[0].kernel)) #L2 on LSTM weights
    total_loss = total_mse + regularization_strength * regularization_loss
    return total_loss


model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(timesteps, features)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(features)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=lambda y_true, y_pred: custom_loss_with_regularization(y_true, y_pred))
```

Here, an L2 regularization term is added to the MSE loss. The `regularization_strength` parameter controls the strength of the regularization.  The regularization term is calculated using `tf.nn.l2_loss` applied to the weights of the LSTM layer.  Note that accessing layer weights directly requires awareness of the model architecture.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of TensorFlow/Keras internals, consult the official TensorFlow documentation.  The Keras API documentation provides detailed explanations of layers and loss functions.  Exploring advanced TensorFlow concepts like custom gradients and tensor manipulation will significantly enhance your ability to craft highly specialized loss functions. Studying research papers on sequence modeling and recurrent neural networks will provide insights into various loss functions employed in different applications.  Finally, mastering numerical optimization techniques will be beneficial in fine-tuning the training process with custom loss functions.
