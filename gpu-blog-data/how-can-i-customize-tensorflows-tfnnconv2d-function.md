The core of customizing `tf.nn.conv2d()` lies in understanding that while the function itself is a highly optimized primitive for convolution, its flexibility resides within the inputs you provide, namely the `input`, `filters`, `strides`, `padding`, `data_format`, and `dilations` parameters. Modification is not about altering the core C++ implementation of the function within TensorFlow; it's about orchestrating how these parameters define the convolution operation, and then, further adjusting the result through standard TensorFlow operations. My experience training image recognition models for autonomous vehicles, where fine-grained feature extraction was crucial, has shown this to be a particularly important skillset.

The fundamental functionality of `tf.nn.conv2d()` is to perform a 2D convolution. This mathematical operation involves sliding a kernel (filter) over an input tensor (image or feature map), performing element-wise multiplication between the filter and the overlapping portion of the input, and then summing the result to produce a single output value. This process is repeated across the entire input, effectively mapping spatial relationships in the input to the output feature maps. The convolution process' parameters, accessible in `tf.nn.conv2d()`, control how this sliding window process unfolds. Customization, therefore, revolves around creatively manipulating these parameters.

Let's break down each parameter and its role in customization:

*   **`input`:** This represents the input tensor, typically a batch of images or feature maps, with a shape of `[batch, height, width, channels]` or `[batch, channels, height, width]` based on `data_format`. The content of `input` is, of course, your application-specific data, and adjusting it indirectly impacts the convolution, by passing through different types of data.
*   **`filters`:** This is the convolution kernel; its shape is `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`. The content of the filters determines the patterns that the convolution operation will detect. Designing and training your filters defines the primary customization point in a CNN. You donâ€™t directly modify `tf.nn.conv2d()` but instead control what data it will use by training these `filters` weights.
*   **`strides`:** This parameter controls the step size the filter takes during the convolution process. It is a list or tuple of four integers, `[1, stride_height, stride_width, 1]` or `[1, 1, stride_height, stride_width]` depending on `data_format`. A stride of 1 means the filter moves one pixel at a time, whereas a stride of 2 means it moves two pixels at a time, reducing the output dimension. Modifying strides impacts the receptive field and output resolution.
*   **`padding`:** This parameter dictates how the input borders are handled during convolution. Options include `"VALID"` and `"SAME"`. `"VALID"` means no padding; the output size is smaller than the input. `"SAME"` adds padding to ensure the output size is the same as the input when strides equal 1. Careful use of padding can maintain spatial resolution.
*   **`data_format`:** This parameter is a string, either `"NHWC"` or `"NCHW"`, specifying the order of the dimensions of the `input` and `filters` tensors. This allows the same convolutional operation to be carried out on either of these common tensor formats.
*   **`dilations`:** This parameter introduces gaps between the filter elements. It's a list or tuple of four integers, and if the filter is `[f_h, f_w]`, dilations of `[1, d_h, d_w, 1]` essentially expands the filter to `[f_h + (f_h-1)*(d_h - 1), f_w + (f_w - 1) * (d_w - 1)]` effectively increasing the filter's receptive field without increasing the number of learned parameters.

Here are three examples demonstrating different customization approaches:

**Example 1: Controlling Output Resolution with Strides**

In a recent project, I needed to downsample an input feature map by a factor of two while maintaining as much information as possible. This was necessary to reduce the computational load in later stages of a neural network. I achieved this using strides:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume input_tensor has shape [batch, 64, 64, 32]
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 64, 64, 32))
filters = tf.random.normal(shape=(3, 3, 32, 64))

# Convolution with stride 2 for downsampling
output_tensor_downsampled = tf.nn.conv2d(
    input=input_tensor,
    filters=filters,
    strides=[1, 2, 2, 1],  # Downsampling in height and width dimensions.
    padding='SAME'
)

print(f"Input Shape: {input_tensor.shape}") # Output: (10, 64, 64, 32)
print(f"Downsampled Output Shape: {output_tensor_downsampled.shape}") # Output: (10, 32, 32, 64)
```

Here, the `strides` parameter is modified to `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, effectively applying the filter every two pixels in the height and width dimensions resulting in an output map reduced by half in the height and width axes, while padding ensures the output is still an integer multiple when divided by the stride.

**Example 2: Adjusting Receptive Field with Dilations**

Another common scenario involves needing a large receptive field without greatly increasing the number of trainable parameters. We can achieve this by using a dilated convolution. In this case, I was trying to capture context information in a semantic segmentation task without blowing up memory usage:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume input_tensor has shape [batch, height, width, channels]
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 64, 64, 16))
filters = tf.random.normal(shape=(3, 3, 16, 32))

# Convolution with a dilation rate of 2
output_tensor_dilated = tf.nn.conv2d(
    input=input_tensor,
    filters=filters,
    strides=[1, 1, 1, 1],  # No downsampling/upsampling.
    padding='SAME',
    dilations=[1, 2, 2, 1]  # Dilation applied to height and width
)

print(f"Input Shape: {input_tensor.shape}") # Output: (10, 64, 64, 16)
print(f"Dilated Output Shape: {output_tensor_dilated.shape}") # Output: (10, 64, 64, 32)
```

Here, `dilations=[1, 2, 2, 1]` is used, effectively expanding the filter's area of influence, without increasing the number of trainable parameters and output size is preserved by 'SAME' padding and a 1-pixel stride. This allows for the filter to be exposed to a wider range of input without an expensive increase in the filter dimensions.

**Example 3: Combining Custom Filters and Strides for Feature Extraction**

I often use convolutions as feature extractors, combining learned filters and strategically chosen strides. This can be used to extract feature hierarchies:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume input_tensor has shape [batch, height, width, in_channels]
input_tensor = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 128, 128, 3))

# Create and train filters
filters_custom = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(5, 5, 3, 16)))

# Convolution with strides and custom filters
output_tensor_custom_features = tf.nn.conv2d(
    input=input_tensor,
    filters=filters_custom, # Trained filters
    strides=[1, 1, 1, 1],
    padding='SAME',
)

# Second convolutional layer
filters_second = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal(shape=(3, 3, 16, 32)))

output_tensor_second = tf.nn.conv2d(
  input = output_tensor_custom_features,
  filters = filters_second,
  strides = [1,2,2,1],
  padding='SAME'
)


print(f"Input Shape: {input_tensor.shape}") # Output: (10, 128, 128, 3)
print(f"First Convolution Output Shape: {output_tensor_custom_features.shape}") # Output: (10, 128, 128, 16)
print(f"Second Convolution Output Shape: {output_tensor_second.shape}") # Output: (10, 64, 64, 32)
```

In this case, custom, trainable filters are created and then passed to the function, alongside specific strides of `[1, 1, 1, 1]` for the first layer and `[1,2,2,1]` for the second. The filter weights become part of the model and are optimized to perform well at the task at hand. This allows for extracting specific features relevant to the data, while downsampling in the second convolutional layer with stride 2. This is often the cornerstone of a customized convolutional operation.

In summary, I have not found modification of `tf.nn.conv2d()`'s underlying implementation to be practical or necessary. Instead, the true power of customization comes from meticulously designing and training the convolution parameters via the `filters` parameter and understanding the effects of parameters like `strides`, `padding`, and `dilations`, allowing for complex behaviors that meet varied architectural needs.

For further reading, I recommend focusing on resources that discuss the underlying mathematical concepts of convolution operations, including image processing textbooks and online courses that focus on deep learning.  Research papers focusing on specific convolutional network architectures and their design will provide invaluable insights. Additionally, I advise to explore resources detailing the TensorFlow API and official examples related to `tf.nn.conv2d` and associated functions for thorough understanding.
