TensorFlow 2's SavedModel format, while efficient for deployment, presents a challenge when inspecting the internal model structure.  Directly printing the layers isn't a straightforward operation;  the SavedModel doesn't inherently expose a simple, layer-by-layer representation.  My experience working on large-scale model deployment pipelines highlights the need for indirect methods to achieve this.  Successful retrieval depends on reconstructing the computational graph from the SavedModel's serialized components.

**1.  Explanation:**

The SavedModel primarily stores the model's weights, variables, and the computational graph's structure in a protocol buffer format. This format isn't designed for direct human readability or layer-by-layer printing.  Instead, the process involves loading the SavedModel into a TensorFlow session, reconstructing the model's architecture using the `tf.saved_model.load` function, and then traversing the model's structure to extract and print information about each layer.  This requires understanding the model's construction – whether it's a sequential model, a functional model, or a custom model built using the Keras subclassing API – as the approach to traversing the structure varies accordingly.  For sequential and functional models, direct attribute access is often sufficient; for custom models, a more recursive approach might be necessary, potentially involving introspection of the `__call__` method.  Furthermore, consideration must be given to potential complexities, such as nested models or shared layers.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Sequential Model**

This example demonstrates printing layers for a simple sequential model.  In my previous work optimizing a recommendation system, a similar approach proved invaluable for debugging layer configurations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'my_model' is a sequential model saved as a SavedModel
saved_model_path = "path/to/my_sequential_model"

reloaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(saved_model_path)

print("Layers in the Sequential Model:")
for i, layer in enumerate(reloaded_model.layers):
    print(f"Layer {i+1}: {layer.name}, Type: {type(layer).__name__}, Output Shape: {layer.output_shape}")


```

This code directly iterates through the `layers` attribute of the loaded sequential model, printing the layer's name, type, and output shape. The assumption here is that the model was saved correctly and maintains the expected sequential structure after loading.

**Example 2: Functional Model**

Working on a convolutional neural network for image classification required a more nuanced approach due to the functional model's inherent flexibility.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

saved_model_path = "path/to/my_functional_model"
reloaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(saved_model_path)

print("Layers in the Functional Model:")
tf.keras.utils.plot_model(reloaded_model, to_file='model.png', show_shapes=True, show_layer_names=True)

#Alternatively, for programmatic access without visualization
def print_functional_layers(model):
    for layer in model.layers:
        print(f"Layer: {layer.name}, Type: {type(layer).__name__}")
        if hasattr(layer, 'layers'): # Check for nested models
            print_functional_layers(layer)


print_functional_layers(reloaded_model)

```
This example utilizes `tf.keras.utils.plot_model` for a visual representation of the model's architecture,  which is helpful for understanding complex structures. The recursive function `print_functional_layers` allows traversal of potentially nested models within the functional model.  This recursive method is crucial when dealing with complex architectures. Error handling (try-except blocks) should be added in a production environment to account for unexpected layer types.


**Example 3: Custom Model**

Inspecting a custom model requires a more involved process,  drawing from my experience developing a custom object detection model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

saved_model_path = "path/to/my_custom_model"
reloaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(saved_model_path)

print("Layers in the Custom Model:")
# For custom models, direct layer access might not be available.
# Inspect the model's call method for layer information.

def print_custom_layers(model):
    try:
        for name, layer in model._layer_call_arg_map.items():
            print(f"Layer: {name}, Type: {type(layer).__name__}")
            if hasattr(layer, '_layer_call_arg_map'):
                print_custom_layers(layer)

    except AttributeError:
        print("Unable to directly inspect layers of this custom model.  Consider adding layer tracking during model creation.")


print_custom_layers(reloaded_model)
```

This code attempts to extract layer information from the `_layer_call_arg_map` attribute,  common in custom models.  However, the success of this approach heavily depends on the way the custom model was implemented. If layers are not explicitly registered in this manner, the attempt will fail; thus, the fallback message is vital for debugging.  Including explicit layer tracking in the custom model's construction is the best practice to avoid this issue.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow official documentation on SavedModel and Keras models provides comprehensive guidance.  Furthermore, books on deep learning with TensorFlow and the Keras API offer detailed explanations of model building and architecture.  Finally, exploring TensorFlow's source code itself can provide valuable insights into the inner workings of the SavedModel format and its interaction with Keras models.  These resources should provide sufficient context for resolving the challenge of accessing layer information from a SavedModel.
