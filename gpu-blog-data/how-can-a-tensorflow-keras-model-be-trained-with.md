The efficacy of incorporating label information directly into a TensorFlow-Keras model architecture hinges on understanding the fundamental distinction between supervised and semi-supervised learning paradigms.  While standard supervised learning uses labels exclusively for the loss function calculation and gradient updates, integrating labels as input allows for a form of guided feature transformation, potentially improving model robustness and generalization, particularly in scenarios with limited or noisy data.  This isn't about simply concatenating labels; it requires careful consideration of the data representation and the layer's activation function. In my experience working on medical image classification projects, this approach proved particularly useful in handling class imbalance and incorporating prior knowledge encoded in the label space.

**1.  Explanation:**

The core idea involves constructing an additional layer that receives the labels as input alongside the primary features.  This layer's output is then concatenated with the output of the main feature extraction branch before being fed into the final classification layers. The key is how this supplemental layer interacts with the main network.  Simply concatenating raw label values is often unproductive.  Instead, the label input layer should perform a transformation that encodes the labels in a way that is semantically relevant to the feature space.  This can involve embedding the labels into a lower-dimensional space using techniques such as one-hot encoding followed by a dense layer with an appropriate activation function. The activation function selected critically influences the impact of the label information on the learned representations. For example, a ReLU activation introduces non-linearity, allowing the model to learn complex interactions between the features and labels, while a linear activation maintains a more direct additive influence.

The choice of the activation function and the layer’s dimensionality should be determined empirically through experimentation, considering factors such as the number of classes and the complexity of the feature space.  Regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, are crucial to prevent overfitting, especially given the additional information provided by the label input. The effectiveness of this approach depends heavily on the nature of the data and the task.  In situations with highly correlated features and labels, one can anticipate significant performance improvements.  However, with weakly correlated data, the benefits may be minimal or even detrimental, leading to overfitting and decreased generalization.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Simple Label Embedding and Concatenation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, concatenate, Embedding, Flatten

# Define input shapes
feature_input = Input(shape=(100,), name='feature_input') # Example feature input
label_input = Input(shape=(1,), name='label_input', dtype='int32') # Integer label

# Embed labels into a lower dimensional space
embedding_layer = Embedding(input_dim=10, output_dim=5)(label_input) # 10 classes, 5-dimensional embedding
embedding_flatten = Flatten()(embedding_layer)

# Process features (example: simple dense layer)
feature_dense = Dense(64, activation='relu')(feature_input)

# Concatenate feature and label representations
merged = concatenate([feature_dense, embedding_flatten])

# Output layer
output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(merged) # 10 output classes

# Create and compile the model
model = keras.Model(inputs=[feature_input, label_input], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ...Training code...
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward embedding approach. The labels are one-hot encoded (implicitly handled by `categorical_crossentropy` in this specific training configuration), embedded, flattened, and concatenated with the processed features.  The choice of embedding dimension (5 in this case) is a hyperparameter to be tuned.

**Example 2: Label-Specific Feature Transformation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, concatenate, Lambda, Layer

class LabelConditionalLayer(Layer):
  def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
    super(LabelConditionalLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    self.dense = Dense(units, activation='relu')

  def call(self, inputs):
    features, labels = inputs
    transformed_features = self.dense(features)  # Transformation specific to the label
    return transformed_features

# Define input shapes
feature_input = Input(shape=(100,), name='feature_input')
label_input = Input(shape=(1,), name='label_input')

# Label-specific feature transformation
transformed_features = LabelConditionalLayer(64)([feature_input, label_input])

# Output layer
output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(transformed_features)

# Create and compile the model
model = keras.Model(inputs=[feature_input, label_input], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ...Training code...

```

Here, a custom layer `LabelConditionalLayer` applies a label-dependent transformation to the features.  This offers greater flexibility than simple concatenation, allowing for more complex interactions.  However, it introduces more parameters, increasing the risk of overfitting.

**Example 3:  Using a Separate Branch for Label Processing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, concatenate, GlobalAveragePooling1D

# Define input shapes
feature_input = Input(shape=(100,), name='feature_input')
label_input = Input(shape=(1,), name='label_input', dtype='int32')

# Process features
feature_branch = Dense(64, activation='relu')(feature_input)

# Process labels (using separate branch)
label_branch = Dense(32, activation='relu')(label_input)  #Reduced dimensionality
label_branch = Dense(64, activation='relu')(label_branch) # Shape matching for concatenation


# Concatenate and output
merged = concatenate([feature_branch, label_branch])
output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(merged)

# Create and compile the model
model = keras.Model(inputs=[feature_input, label_input], outputs=output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# ...Training code...
```

This example uses separate branches for feature and label processing before concatenation.  This allows for more independent feature extraction before combining the information.  It’s important to carefully consider the dimensionality of the outputs before concatenation to ensure compatibility.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet; "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron;  "TensorFlow 2.0 for Deep Learning and Machine Intelligence" by Bharath Ramsundar, and "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael Nielsen (available online).  Reviewing papers on semi-supervised learning and conditional generative models will also be beneficial.  These resources provide a strong foundation for understanding the underlying principles and advanced techniques relevant to the problem.
