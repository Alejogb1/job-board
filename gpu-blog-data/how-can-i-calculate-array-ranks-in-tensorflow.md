TensorFlow doesn't directly offer a dedicated "rank" operation in the same way some statistical packages do.  The concept of "rank" in linear algebra, referring to the dimension of the vector space spanned by the rows or columns of a matrix, differs from the common interpretation of rank within the context of array processing, where it usually signifies the ordinal position of an element within a sorted array.  My experience working on large-scale recommendation systems involved extensive array manipulation within TensorFlow, and this distinction was crucial in avoiding costly misunderstandings.  Therefore, calculating what is often colloquially referred to as "array ranks" necessitates a different approach depending on the desired outcome.  We must clarify: are we seeking the indices of elements after sorting, the percentile ranks, or something else entirely?

**1.  Calculating Indices After Sorting (Ordinal Ranks):**

This interpretation is the most straightforward.  We aim to determine each element's position if the array were sorted in ascending order.  The simplest method leverages TensorFlow's sorting capabilities combined with `tf.argsort`.

**Code Example 1: Ordinal Rank Calculation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.constant([5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6])

# Sort the tensor and get indices
sorted_indices = tf.argsort(input_tensor)

# Create a tensor of initial indices
initial_indices = tf.range(tf.shape(input_tensor)[0])

# Scatter initial indices based on sorted indices to get ordinal ranks
ordinal_ranks = tf.scatter_nd(tf.expand_dims(sorted_indices, axis=-1), initial_indices, tf.shape(input_tensor))

#Execute and print the results.  Note that identical elements will have the same rank (in this implementation; other methods may be required for breaking ties).
with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(ordinal_ranks))
    # Expected output: [1 0 4 2 1 3]

```

This code first sorts the input tensor and retrieves the indices that would sort it. Then, it uses `tf.scatter_nd` to effectively map the original indices to their positions within the sorted array, providing the ordinal rank for each element.  Note that this method handles ties by assigning the same rank to identical elements.  For more sophisticated tie-handling, one might consider augmenting the input with a secondary key (e.g., initial index).


**2.  Calculating Percentile Ranks:**

Percentile ranks indicate the percentage of elements in the array that are less than or equal to a given element. This requires a slightly more involved approach.

**Code Example 2: Percentile Rank Calculation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.constant([5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6])

# Sort the tensor
sorted_tensor = tf.sort(input_tensor)

# Calculate the cumulative counts
cumulative_counts = tf.cumsum(tf.ones_like(sorted_tensor, dtype=tf.float32))

# Calculate the percentile ranks
percentile_ranks = (cumulative_counts / tf.cast(tf.shape(sorted_tensor)[0], tf.float32)) * 100

# Create a mapping from original values to indices
value_to_index = tf.lookup.StaticVocabularyTable(tf.lookup.KeyValueTensorInitializer(input_tensor, tf.range(tf.shape(input_tensor)[0])), num_oov_buckets=0)

# Gather percentile ranks based on original indices
original_indices = value_to_index.lookup(input_tensor)

percentile_ranks_original = tf.gather(percentile_ranks, original_indices)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.tables_initializer()) #important for Lookup Table
    print(sess.run(percentile_ranks_original))
    # Expected output (approximately): [66.66667 16.66667 100.      0.     66.66667 83.33333]

```

This example uses `tf.cumsum` to obtain cumulative counts, then normalizes these counts to obtain percentile ranks. The use of `tf.lookup.StaticVocabularyTable` allows efficient mapping between the original values and their corresponding percentile ranks.  Note that this calculation involves floating-point arithmetic, and thus small discrepancies might occur due to precision limitations.


**3.  Handling Multi-Dimensional Arrays:**

Extending the concept of "array ranks" to multi-dimensional arrays requires careful consideration of which dimension the ranking should apply to.  The following example illustrates ranking along a specific axis.

**Code Example 3:  Ranking Along a Specific Axis**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor (2D array)
input_tensor = tf.constant([[5, 2, 9], [1, 5, 6]])

# Specify the axis for ranking (axis=0 ranks columns, axis=1 ranks rows)
axis = 1

# Sort along the specified axis and get indices
sorted_indices = tf.argsort(input_tensor, axis=axis)

# Create initial indices along the specified axis
initial_indices = tf.range(tf.shape(input_tensor)[axis])

#Use tf.tile to replicate indices for each row or column according to the specified axis.
tiled_indices = tf.tile(tf.expand_dims(initial_indices, axis=0), [tf.shape(input_tensor)[0-axis], 1]) if axis == 1 else tf.tile(tf.expand_dims(initial_indices, axis=1), [1, tf.shape(input_tensor)[1]])

#Scatter the initial indices
ordinal_ranks = tf.scatter_nd(tf.concat([tf.expand_dims(tf.range(tf.shape(input_tensor)[0-axis]), axis=-1), tf.expand_dims(sorted_indices, axis=-1)], axis=-1), tiled_indices, tf.shape(input_tensor))

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(ordinal_ranks))
    #Expected Output (axis = 1): [[1 0 2] [0 1 2]]
```

This example demonstrates how to adapt the ordinal rank calculation for a 2D array.  The `axis` parameter in `tf.argsort` dictates the dimension along which sorting occurs.  The code adapts the index generation and scattering accordingly to obtain correct ordinal ranks along the selected axis.  Remember that this approach, like the first, deals with ties by assigning the same rank.  For more complex scenarios, especially in higher dimensions, consider using more advanced tensor manipulation techniques or custom TensorFlow operations.

**Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on tensor manipulation and sorting operations, are indispensable.  Furthermore, a comprehensive linear algebra textbook would provide the necessary theoretical background for understanding the nuances of different rank interpretations.  Finally, reviewing relevant research papers on large-scale data processing and ranking algorithms within the machine learning literature can enhance your understanding of advanced techniques and their applications.
