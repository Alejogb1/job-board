The crucial element in directing Keras model training to a specific GPU lies not within Keras itself, but in its backend, typically TensorFlow or Theano.  Keras acts as a high-level API; the underlying hardware interaction is handled by the backend.  My experience building large-scale image recognition models has consistently highlighted the importance of proper backend configuration for efficient GPU utilization.  Improper configuration can lead to significant performance bottlenecks, even with high-end hardware.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

The process involves several steps, beginning with verifying GPU availability and driver installation.  This is often overlooked but essential.  Next, you must configure the backend to recognize and utilize the desired GPU.  This usually involves environment variables or configuration files, depending on the backend and operating system.  Finally, within your Keras code, you shouldn't need to explicitly mention the GPU; the backend handles the allocation and execution. However,  strategic choices regarding model architecture and data handling can further optimize GPU usage.  For instance, batch size selection directly impacts GPU memory utilization and processing efficiency.  Too large a batch size may cause out-of-memory errors, while too small a batch size might not fully leverage parallel processing capabilities.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: TensorFlow/CUDA setup (Linux)**

This example demonstrates configuring TensorFlow to use a specific GPU on a Linux system. I've encountered situations where multiple GPUs were present, and this approach ensured the model utilized the most powerful one, avoiding unnecessary resource contention.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check GPU availability
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# Specify the GPU to use (replace '0' with the desired GPU ID)
gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
  try:
    tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices(gpus[0], 'GPU')
    logical_gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    print(len(gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
  except RuntimeError as e:
    # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
    print(e)

# Rest of your Keras model training code here...
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

**Commentary:**  The code first checks for available GPUs. Then, `tf.config.experimental.set_visible_devices` is crucial – it makes only the specified GPU visible to TensorFlow. This prevents accidental use of other GPUs, which can be vital when managing resources on a server with multiple GPUs.  Error handling is included to address potential runtime issues.  The subsequent `model.fit` call then implicitly utilizes the specified GPU.


**Example 2:  Using CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES (Linux/macOS)**

This is a more direct, environment variable approach that I've found effective for simpler setups and when integrating Keras within larger workflows.  It's less integrated with TensorFlow's internal mechanisms but provides a powerful level of control.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 python your_keras_script.py
```

**Commentary:** Before running your Keras script, this command sets the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable. The number '1' here refers to the GPU ID (0 for the first GPU, 1 for the second, and so on).  This tells all CUDA-enabled applications, including TensorFlow, to only use the specified GPU.  This method is lightweight and readily adaptable to various scripting environments.


**Example 3: Handling Multiple GPUs with TensorFlow's Strategy API (Advanced)**

This example showcases how to leverage multiple GPUs efficiently using TensorFlow's distribution strategies. I've utilized this technique when training exceptionally large models where single-GPU training was impractically slow.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
  # Build your Keras model here...
  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      # ... your model layers ...
  ])
  # Compile your model here...
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train your model here...
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

**Commentary:** `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()` replicates your model across available GPUs, distributing the workload.  The `with strategy.scope():` block ensures all model components are correctly replicated.  The batch size should be chosen carefully to balance GPU memory consumption and parallel processing efficiency.  This approach requires careful consideration of data parallelism and model architecture to avoid performance degradation.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

*   The official TensorFlow documentation. This is an indispensable resource for resolving backend-specific issues and exploring advanced techniques like distributed training.
*   A comprehensive guide on CUDA programming.  A strong understanding of CUDA is beneficial, particularly for troubleshooting GPU-related errors or optimizing performance.
*   Relevant publications on deep learning model parallelism and optimization strategies. Examining research papers helps one understand the theoretical underpinnings of efficient GPU utilization.


In summary, specifying a GPU for Keras training is primarily a matter of backend configuration.  While Keras itself remains agnostic to the hardware, choosing the correct backend configuration, whether it’s setting environment variables or using TensorFlow’s distribution strategies, is essential for maximizing GPU utilization and ensuring efficient model training.  Carefully considering batch size and adopting suitable strategies for handling multiple GPUs can further enhance performance.  Remember that the optimal approach depends heavily on the specific hardware configuration and the model's complexity.
