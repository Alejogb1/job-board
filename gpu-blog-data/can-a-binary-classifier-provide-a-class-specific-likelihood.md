Binary classifiers, at their core, are designed to predict a binary outcome: belonging to class A or not belonging to class A.  However, the assertion that they *only* provide a binary output is an oversimplification.  My experience working on fraud detection systems at a major financial institution highlighted this nuance repeatedly.  While the final prediction is indeed binary (fraudulent or not), the underlying model often generates a probability score, representing the likelihood of the instance belonging to the positive class (in this case, fraud). This probability score, appropriately calibrated, constitutes a class-specific likelihood score.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The misconception stems from the common practice of applying a threshold to the probability score produced by the classifier.  This threshold transforms the continuous probability into a binary classification.  A threshold of 0.5, for instance, classifies any instance with a probability score above 0.5 as belonging to the positive class and below as the negative class.  However, discarding the probability score itself loses valuable information.  The probability score, often represented as a likelihood, provides a nuanced understanding of the classifier's confidence in its prediction.  A prediction of class A with a probability of 0.99 conveys considerably more certainty than a prediction with a probability of 0.51, even though both are classified as class A under a 0.5 threshold.

Furthermore, the actual generation of this likelihood score depends on the chosen classifier.  Logistic regression, for instance, directly outputs probabilities based on the logistic function.  Support Vector Machines (SVMs), while not directly producing probabilities, can be calibrated using techniques like Platt scaling to provide well-calibrated probability estimates.  Tree-based methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines also offer probability outputs, representing the proportion of trees voting for the positive class.  Therefore, the availability and quality of the class-specific likelihood score are intrinsically tied to the classifier's inherent characteristics and any subsequent calibration applied.

The crucial distinction is between the *prediction* (binary: class A or not class A) and the *likelihood score* (continuous: probability of belonging to class A).  Many algorithms provide access to this likelihood score, allowing for a more granular understanding of the classification beyond a simple binary label.  This likelihood score is particularly useful in situations requiring a risk assessment or nuanced decision-making, as it allows for considering the uncertainty associated with each prediction.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate obtaining likelihood scores from three different common classifiers in Python using the scikit-learn library.  Assume `X` represents the feature data and `y` represents the binary labels (0 or 1).

**Example 1: Logistic Regression**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# ... data preprocessing ...

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict probabilities
probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_test)

# Probabilities are stored in the second column for class 1 (positive class)
class_1_probabilities = probabilities[:, 1]

print(class_1_probabilities)
```

Logistic regression inherently outputs probabilities. `predict_proba` provides a matrix where each row represents an instance and each column the probability for each class.  The second column (`[:, 1]`) contains the probabilities for the positive class (class 1, typically represented as 1).

**Example 2: Support Vector Machine with Platt Scaling**

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# ... data preprocessing ...

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = SVC(probability=True) # Enable probability estimates
calibrated_model = CalibratedClassifierCV(model, method='sigmoid', cv=5)
calibrated_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

probabilities = calibrated_model.predict_proba(X_test)
class_1_probabilities = probabilities[:, 1]

print(class_1_probabilities)
```

SVMs require the `probability=True` flag during initialization.  Furthermore, Platt scaling, implemented through `CalibratedClassifierCV`, is applied to improve the calibration of the probability estimates, making them more reliable.

**Example 3: Random Forest**

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# ... data preprocessing ...

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_test)
class_1_probabilities = probabilities[:, 1]

print(class_1_probabilities)
```

Random Forest classifiers naturally provide probability estimates through `predict_proba`, reflecting the proportion of trees predicting the positive class for each instance.

These examples highlight that obtaining class-specific likelihood scores is feasible with various classifiers. The key is selecting appropriate algorithms and applying calibration techniques when necessary.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of binary classification and probability calibration, I recommend consulting textbooks on machine learning and statistical modeling. Specifically, texts covering logistic regression, support vector machines, and ensemble methods will be invaluable.  Exploring the documentation of various machine learning libraries, like scikit-learn, will also provide practical guidance on implementing and interpreting these models.  Further investigation into the topic of probability calibration, specifically Platt scaling and isotonic regression, is recommended for achieving well-calibrated probability estimates.  Finally, review articles focusing on performance metrics for binary classification beyond simple accuracy, such as AUC-ROC and precision-recall curves, provide important context for evaluating classifier performance and interpreting the generated likelihood scores.
