The unexpected alteration of PyTorch tensor dimensions and the appearance of NaN (Not a Number) values after specific training batches often stems from numerical instability within the model's computations, particularly concerning gradient calculations and memory management.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on large-scale image recognition projects, and the root cause is rarely a single, easily identifiable error.  Instead, it's usually a confluence of factors requiring systematic debugging.

**1.  Explanation of the Problem:**

The primary reason for such behavior is the propagation of numerical errors during training.  These errors can manifest in various ways:

* **Gradient Explosions/Vanishing Gradients:**  These are classic culprits in deep learning.  Exploding gradients lead to extremely large values in the gradients, which, when applied to the model's weights, can result in NaN values due to overflow.  Conversely, vanishing gradients, where gradients become extremely small, can lead to weights not updating effectively, potentially causing unexpected behavior including size changes if the model architecture dynamically adjusts based on learned parameters (e.g., attention mechanisms).  Batch normalization layers can mitigate exploding gradients but don't solve the issue entirely.

* **Incorrect Data Handling:**  Issues with data preprocessing, particularly involving normalization or standardization, can contribute significantly. If your data contains values outside the expected range, or if the normalization process introduces errors (e.g., division by zero), this can lead to NaN values that proliferate through the network.  Similarly, inconsistent data types (e.g., mixing `float32` and `float64`) can lead to unpredictable results.

* **Memory Management:**  PyTorch, like other deep learning frameworks, relies heavily on GPU memory.  Insufficient GPU memory or improper memory management practices (e.g., failing to clear unnecessary tensors) can lead to unexpected behavior, including tensor size changes and NaN values due to memory overwrites or fragmentation.  This is especially problematic in large batch sizes or models with high memory footprints.

* **Model Architecture Issues:**  Specific layers or architectural choices can be prone to numerical instability. For instance, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are notorious for suffering from vanishing/exploding gradients, while certain activation functions (e.g., sigmoid applied to very large inputs) can saturate, leading to gradients close to zero.

* **Incorrect Loss Function or Optimizer:**  An inappropriately chosen loss function or optimizer can exacerbate these numerical issues. For instance, using a loss function that is poorly suited to the data distribution, or selecting an optimizer with an overly large learning rate, can trigger gradient explosions and lead to unstable training.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Gradient Explosion due to high learning rate:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Simple linear model
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1000) # Extremely high learning rate
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
target = torch.randn(1, 1)

for i in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(input_tensor)
    loss = loss_fn(output, target)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: Loss = {loss.item()}, Model Weights: {model.weight.data}")
    if torch.isnan(loss):
        print("NaN detected!")
        break
```

*Commentary:* This example demonstrates a potential cause of NaN values.  The extremely high learning rate (1000) causes the model weights to update wildly, quickly leading to gradient explosion and NaN values in the loss.  Reducing the learning rate significantly would usually alleviate this issue.

**Example 2: Data Preprocessing Error:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Linear(1,1)

#Incorrect data normalization (division by zero possible)
data = torch.tensor([0.0,1.0,2.0])
data = data / (data - 1.0)

input = data.unsqueeze(1) # Correct shape


for i in range (10) :
  output = model(input)
  print(f'Output: {output}')
  if torch.isnan(output).any():
    print("NaN Detected!")
    break

```
*Commentary:*  This illustrates how a flaw in data preprocessing can introduce NaN values. Dividing by zero is attempted, causing NaN values that propagate through the model. Careful data validation and robust normalization techniques are crucial.

**Example 3: Memory Leak (Illustrative):**

```python
import torch
import gc

# Simulating a memory leak scenario (Simplified)
tensors = []
for i in range(1000):
    tensors.append(torch.randn(1000, 1000)) # Create many large tensors

# After a while, perform a garbage collection to clear tensors.  This
# is just an illustration; real memory leaks are harder to detect.
gc.collect()
torch.cuda.empty_cache() # For GPU
print("Memory cleared")
```

*Commentary:* This is a simplified illustration. Real memory leaks are often subtle and involve references to tensors not explicitly released, especially in complex architectures or through unintended object persistence.  Careful attention to tensor management and utilizing PyTorch's debugging tools is essential to identify such problems.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official PyTorch documentation, particularly the sections on numerical stability, optimization techniques, and debugging tools. Explore relevant research papers on gradient clipping, weight normalization, and other methods for mitigating numerical instability in deep learning models.  Familiarize yourself with debugging strategies specific to PyTorch, including using tools to monitor GPU memory usage and inspect intermediate tensor values during training.  Consider the use of profilers to assess computation time and potential bottlenecks, which could suggest memory-related problems.  Thorough testing with smaller datasets and careful examination of data distributions and preprocessing steps will contribute greatly to finding and fixing these issues.
