The core challenge in differentiating log messages from disparate Aiohttp requests lies in effectively correlating log entries with their originating requests.  A simple timestamp alone is insufficient given the asynchronous nature of Aiohttp and the potential for concurrent requests.  My experience debugging high-throughput microservices built on Aiohttp highlighted the critical need for robust request identification.  This necessitates embedding a unique identifier within each request and consistently logging it alongside relevant information.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Effective logging in Aiohttp for differentiating requests requires a three-pronged approach: unique request identification, structured logging, and appropriate logging context management.

* **Unique Request Identification:**  Each incoming Aiohttp request must be assigned a globally unique identifier (GUID). This GUID should be generated upon request arrival and propagated throughout the request lifecycle, persisting across middleware and handlers.  Libraries like `uuid` provide suitable GUID generation.  This ID becomes the central anchor for correlating all log entries associated with a specific request.

* **Structured Logging:**  Avoid unstructured logging.  Instead, leverage structured logging formats like JSON.  This allows for easier parsing and filtering of logs.  Each log entry should contain the request GUID, a timestamp, the log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR), a message describing the event, and any relevant context (e.g., HTTP method, URL, status code, user ID).

* **Logging Context Management:**  To ensure the request GUID propagates consistently, utilize context management mechanisms.  This could involve leveraging request-specific attributes attached to the Aiohttp request object or utilizing a context propagation library like `opentracing` (though not strictly necessary for simple scenarios). The context should be accessible within all functions handling the request.  Failing to do so leads to fragmented and uncorrelatable log entries.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Logging with Request ID**

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import uuid
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

async def handle_request(request):
    request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    request['request_id'] = request_id # Attaching to the request object
    logging.info(f"Request {request_id} received: {request.method} {request.path}")
    # ... further request processing ...
    logging.info(f"Request {request_id} completed.")
    return aiohttp.web.Response(text=f"Request ID: {request_id}")

async def main():
    app = aiohttp.web.Application()
    app.add_routes([aiohttp.web.get('/', handle_request)])
    runner = aiohttp.web.AppRunner(app)
    await runner.setup()
    site = aiohttp.web.TCPSite(runner, 'localhost', 8080)
    await site.start()
    print("Server started at http://localhost:8080")
    await asyncio.sleep(3600) # Keep the server running
    await runner.cleanup()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental approach.  A GUID is generated, assigned to the request object, and included in log messages.  This aids in associating logs with a given request. Note the absence of structured logging; we will enhance this in the next examples.

**Example 2: Structured Logging with JSON**

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import uuid
import logging
import json

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

async def handle_request(request):
    request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    request['request_id'] = request_id
    log_entry = {
        "request_id": request_id,
        "timestamp": str(datetime.datetime.now()),
        "level": "INFO",
        "message": f"Request received: {request.method} {request.path}",
        "method": request.method,
        "path": request.path
    }
    logging.info(json.dumps(log_entry)) # Logging structured data
    # ... request processing ...
    log_entry['level'] = "INFO"
    log_entry['message'] = f"Request completed: {request.method} {request.path}"
    logging.info(json.dumps(log_entry))
    return aiohttp.web.Response(text=f"Request ID: {request_id}")

# ... (rest of the code remains largely the same as Example 1)
```

This example leverages JSON for structured logging, allowing for easier parsing and filtering of logs based on the included fields.  Notice the inclusion of various contextual details.


**Example 3: Context Management with a Custom Logger**

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp
import uuid
import logging
from contextlib import contextmanager

# Custom logger to inject request_id
class RequestLogger:
    def __init__(self, logger):
      self._logger = logger

    @contextmanager
    def log(self, request_id, message, level = logging.INFO):
      try:
          log_entry = {
              "request_id": request_id,
              "timestamp": str(datetime.datetime.now()),
              "level": level,
              "message": message
          }
          self._logger.info(json.dumps(log_entry))
          yield
      except Exception as e:
          log_entry["level"] = logging.ERROR
          log_entry["message"] = f"Error: {e}"
          self._logger.error(json.dumps(log_entry))
          raise


async def handle_request(request):
    request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    request['request_id'] = request_id
    logger = RequestLogger(logging.getLogger(__name__))

    with logger.log(request_id, f"Request received: {request.method} {request.path}"):
        # ... request processing ...
        with logger.log(request_id, f"Processing completed: {request.method} {request.path}"):
          try:
            # Some potentially error-prone task
            pass
          except Exception as e:
            with logger.log(request_id, f"Error processing: {request.method} {request.path}", logging.ERROR):
              raise

    return aiohttp.web.Response(text=f"Request ID: {request_id}")


# ... (rest of the code remains largely the same as Example 2)

```

This example introduces a custom logger class to simplify context management. The `RequestLogger` ensures that the `request_id` is consistently included. The `contextmanager` makes sure that logging happens in the context of the execution, including error handling.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I recommend consulting the official Aiohttp documentation,  a comprehensive guide on Python logging best practices, and a text on designing robust logging strategies for distributed systems.  Reviewing examples of structured logging implementations in other Python web frameworks can also be beneficial.  Understanding JSON serialization and parsing techniques in Python is also crucial for handling structured logs effectively.
