The primary reason an image loaded with Keras' `load_img` function might appear black is due to an often-overlooked detail regarding the function's default behavior and the expected range of pixel values for downstream processing in neural networks.  Specifically, `load_img` by default returns a PIL image object whose pixel values, in a standard RGB format, are typically represented as integers within the range of 0 to 255. However, neural networks, particularly those built with Keras or TensorFlow, generally expect input data to be normalized or scaled to a floating-point range, often between 0 and 1.  Failure to perform this conversion results in the pixel data being interpreted as very small values which, when displayed, appear as black or near-black.

When Keras’ `load_img` returns a PIL image, that object, while containing the image data, is not directly suitable for most deep learning workflows. The `load_img` function itself does not perform any scaling or normalization to prepare the image as input for a model. The raw pixel data as a result stays in the 0-255 integer range. Neural networks are highly sensitive to the magnitude of input values; having pixel values in the hundreds as opposed to between zero and one causes issues for gradient calculation and the overall training process. In essence, the model interprets such large pixel values as a signal that is excessively strong or noisy, while its weights, initialized to small random values, struggle to converge. Without further transformation the pixel data will appear almost entirely black because the values are too small to represent any meaningful colour on most displays when interpreted as floats.

Furthermore, the black appearance is not a corruption of the image itself; it’s a misinterpretation. The image data is loaded correctly by `load_img`, and PIL stores it as integers correctly. The problem arises when the values are passed directly to a neural network or displayed without conversion. Most image rendering and display software will either expect values as integers between 0 and 255, or floating-point values between 0 and 1. If integer pixel values are interpreted as floats without division by 255 they will register as near-zero values on a floating point scale. In the display process, this results in the appearance of a black, or near-black image.

To correct this, the critical step is to scale the pixel values by dividing each value by 255 before passing the data to the model or visualizing it as an image. This brings the values into the 0-to-1 range, making them interpretable by the network, display software, or other analysis tools. Often this conversion is done within a data preprocessing or data loading step in the model’s architecture.

Here are three practical examples illustrating this common issue and how it can be addressed:

**Example 1: Demonstrating the Problem**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume 'my_image.jpg' exists and is a valid image
image_path = 'my_image.jpg'

# Load the image
image = load_img(image_path)
image_array = np.array(image)

# Display image directly - will appear black or near-black
plt.imshow(image_array)
plt.title("Image Loaded Directly (Unscaled)")
plt.show()

print(f"Min pixel value: {image_array.min()}")
print(f"Max pixel value: {image_array.max()}")
```
In this example, we load the image using `load_img`, then we convert it to a NumPy array.  When `plt.imshow()` attempts to render the image directly, using the unscaled array data, it displays as a black image. Note that printing min and max pixel value reveals the image data is present but in the 0-255 range. The values are not within the expected range for `plt.imshow` when it expects float values.

**Example 2: Correcting the Issue with Scaling**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assume 'my_image.jpg' exists and is a valid image
image_path = 'my_image.jpg'

# Load the image
image = load_img(image_path)
image_array = np.array(image)

# Scale the pixel values to the 0-1 range
scaled_image_array = image_array / 255.0

# Display the scaled image
plt.imshow(scaled_image_array)
plt.title("Image Loaded and Scaled")
plt.show()

print(f"Min scaled pixel value: {scaled_image_array.min()}")
print(f"Max scaled pixel value: {scaled_image_array.max()}")
```
In this revised example, we divide every pixel value by 255, thus bringing the pixel values into the range of 0 to 1, represented as floats.  The result is the correct rendering of the image using `plt.imshow`. Print statements confirm that the scaling was successful and that values are now within the expected floating point range.

**Example 3: Integrating Scaling in a Preprocessing Function**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import load_img
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'my_image.jpg' exists and is a valid image
image_path = 'my_image.jpg'

def preprocess_image(image_path):
    # Load the image
    image = load_img(image_path)
    image_array = np.array(image, dtype='float32')
    # Normalize the image data
    scaled_image_array = image_array / 255.0
    # Add a batch dimension, if needed by your model
    batch_image = tf.expand_dims(scaled_image_array, axis=0)
    return batch_image

# Preprocess the image
processed_image = preprocess_image(image_path)

# Display using matplotlib, after removing the added batch dimension
plt.imshow(processed_image[0])
plt.title("Image Loaded, Scaled and Bached")
plt.show()

print(f"Min scaled pixel value: {processed_image.numpy().min()}")
print(f"Max scaled pixel value: {processed_image.numpy().max()}")
```
This third example shows how a preprocessing function can encapsulate the conversion process and provide the normalized image as a float tensor and also adds a batch dimension using tensorflow (note, other libraries, such as pytorch, offer similar functionality). This function prepares the image for direct use as input for a neural network. The image is displayed by extracting it using indexing and then calling `plt.imshow` after removing the batch dimension. Print statements confirm that the scaling was successful.

In conclusion, the issue of an image appearing black after loading with `load_img` is not a loading failure, but rather a consequence of an incorrect interpretation of pixel values that have not been scaled from their 0-255 integer representation to the 0-1 floating point range required by many models and display utilities. By simply dividing the pixel values by 255, the image can be correctly processed and displayed. The best practice approach to this problem is typically to perform scaling in a dedicated preprocessing function that prepares the data for model consumption.

To improve understanding of the underlying concepts I would recommend exploring the following resources. Firstly, research resources dedicated to image normalization and data preprocessing techniques within deep learning. Secondly, study documentation for image libraries, specifically Pillow (PIL) to understand how images are represented internally as pixel data. Thirdly, research the recommended preprocessing steps for popular pre-trained deep learning models. These resources will solidify the understanding of how pixel representation affects model training and visualisation.
