The core issue with PyTorch's `tensor.backward()` lies not in inherent dysfunction, but in the often-misunderstood interplay between computational graphs, gradient accumulation, and the requirement for leaf tensors.  My experience debugging complex neural network architectures has consistently highlighted this point:  `tensor.backward()` operates correctly within its defined constraints; problems arise from violating those constraints.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

`tensor.backward()` computes gradients of a scalar tensor with respect to leaf tensors in the computational graph.  Crucially, this function only operates on *scalar* tensors. The computational graph, implicitly constructed during the forward pass, tracks operations performed on tensors.  Each operation becomes a node in this graph, with tensors as edges.  Leaf tensors are tensors with `requires_grad=True` that have no incoming gradients; they're the starting points for gradient calculation.  When you call `tensor.backward()`, PyTorch performs automatic differentiation via backpropagation, traversing the graph from the input scalar tensor backward, accumulating gradients at each node along the way.  If the input to `tensor.backward()` isn't a scalar, an error is raised, as the gradient calculation isn't uniquely defined. This lack of a scalar output frequently causes confusion.  Further, if a tensor lacks `requires_grad=True`, it won't be included in the gradient computation.  Therefore, issues often stem from unintended creation of non-scalar tensors, or inadvertently setting `requires_grad=False` on tensors relevant to gradient calculation.  Finally, gradients are *accumulated*.  Subsequent calls to `tensor.backward()` add to existing gradients, a feature that can lead to incorrect results if not explicitly managed via `tensor.grad.zero_()`.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Correct Usage with Scalar Output**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
z = torch.dot(x, y)  # Dot product resulting in a scalar

z.backward()

print(x.grad)
print(y.grad)
```

This example demonstrates the correct usage.  `torch.dot()` produces a scalar `z`. The `backward()` call then successfully computes and assigns gradients to `x` and `y`. The gradients represent the partial derivatives of `z` with respect to `x` and `y`.  The output clearly reflects the expected gradient calculation. This is the foundation of PyTorch's automatic differentiation; any deviation from this fundamental structure invites problems.

**Example 2: Incorrect Usage - Non-Scalar Output**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
z = x * y  # Element-wise multiplication resulting in a vector

try:
    z.backward()
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

This will result in a `RuntimeError`. The element-wise multiplication produces a vector, not a scalar. `backward()` requires a scalar input to define a unique gradient.  This is a very common mistake I've encountered when transitioning from traditional gradient descent implementations to PyTorch's automatic differentiation system.  The error message explicitly points out the non-scalar output, which is a critical piece of information for debugging.

**Example 3:  Incorrect Usage - Gradient Accumulation and `requires_grad=False`**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=False) # Note: requires_grad=False
z = x * y

z.backward(torch.ones(3)) # Using gradient to allow for non-scalar
print(x.grad)

x.grad.zero_() #zero out the gradients

y2 = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
z2 = x*y2
z2.backward()
print(x.grad)
print(y2.grad)

```
This example demonstrates two important considerations. First, we use `torch.ones(3)` as a gradient argument to allow `z.backward()` to function properly when `z` is not a scalar. This approach is valid, but its usage should be understood.  Second, the code explicitly showcases gradient accumulation.  The first `backward()` call calculates the gradient of `z` with respect to `x`.  The subsequent `z2.backward()` call *adds* to the gradient of `x`.  The initial `x.grad.zero_()` call is essential to avoid this accumulation if we desire the gradient calculation for the second operation independently. The absence of this clear step is often the hidden cause behind unexpected gradient values.  Furthermore, notice that `y`'s gradient is not calculated since `requires_grad` is false. This highlights the necessity of setting `requires_grad=True` correctly for all tensors that are part of the computation whose gradients are needed.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation.  Dive into the sections on automatic differentiation and the computational graph.  Pay close attention to the fine print regarding the `requires_grad` flag and gradient accumulation.  Supplement this with a well-regarded deep learning textbook that comprehensively covers automatic differentiation; ensure it includes detailed explanations and practical examples.  Furthermore, understanding linear algebra and calculus at a level sufficient to understand vector and matrix differentiation is crucial.  Practice building and debugging smaller neural networks to solidify your understanding of the principles at play. Through such focused study and dedicated practice, you can become proficient in utilizing PyTorch's automatic differentiation capabilities effectively.
