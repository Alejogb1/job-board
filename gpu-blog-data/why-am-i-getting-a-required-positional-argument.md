The `required positional argument: 'num_features'` error typically arises when calling a function that expects a `num_features` argument, but the call omits it. This usually stems from a mismatch between the function definition and its invocation, often exacerbated by optional arguments preceding the required one.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale machine learning pipelines has highlighted the importance of meticulous argument handling.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Python interpreter raises this error when a function definition includes a positional argument without a default value, and the function is called without providing a value for that specific argument.  Positional arguments are those listed in the function definition without an equals sign (`=`) assigning a default value.  When a function is invoked, Python expects arguments to be provided in the order they are specified in the definition.  If a required positional argument is missing, the interpreter signals the error, indicating the missing parameter.

Consider a simplified example:

```python
def my_function(num_features, model_type="linear"):
    # Function body processing num_features and model_type
    print(f"Number of features: {num_features}, Model type: {model_type}")

# Correct call:
my_function(10)  # Output: Number of features: 10, Model type: linear

# Incorrect call, leading to the error:
my_function()  # Raises TypeError: my_function() missing 1 required positional argument: 'num_features'
```

The error arises in the second call because `num_features` is a required positional argument, and no value is provided during the function invocation.  The presence of the optional argument `model_type` does not alleviate this; Python strictly enforces the order and necessity of positional arguments.  The error message clearly specifies the missing parameter.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Function Call**

```python
def process_data(num_features, data):
    """Processes data based on the number of features."""
    #Simulate feature extraction
    processed_data = data[:num_features]
    return processed_data

my_data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# Correct call
processed_data = process_data(5, my_data)
print(processed_data) #Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


# Incorrect call resulting in the error:
try:
    processed_data = process_data(my_data) #Missing num_features
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Output: Error: process_data() missing 1 required positional argument: 'num_features'
```

This demonstrates the core problem.  The `process_data` function requires `num_features` as a positional argument. Omitting it directly causes the error. The `try-except` block is best practice for handling such exceptions gracefully in production code.


**Example 2:  Function with Multiple Arguments**

```python
def train_model(num_features, learning_rate, epochs, data, labels):
    """Trains a model with specified hyperparameters."""
    # Simulate model training
    print(f"Training model with {num_features} features, learning rate {learning_rate}, for {epochs} epochs.")
    # ... (Model training logic) ...
    return  "Model Trained"


my_data = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
my_labels = [0,1]

# Correct call
result = train_model(3, 0.01, 100, my_data, my_labels)
print(result)

# Incorrect call â€“ Missing num_features
try:
    result = train_model(0.01, 100, my_data, my_labels)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Output: Error: train_model() missing 1 required positional argument: 'num_features'

```

This example highlights that even with multiple arguments, the order and presence of required positional arguments are paramount. The error message precisely points to the missing `num_features` despite the presence of other arguments. This scenario is common in machine learning where multiple parameters define the training process.


**Example 3:  Nested Function Call**

```python
def preprocess(data, num_features):
    #Simulate preprocessing
    return data[:num_features]

def train_and_evaluate(num_features, data, model):
    preprocessed_data = preprocess(data, num_features)
    # ... (Training and Evaluation Logic) ...
    return "Model Trained and Evaluated"


my_data = [1,2,3,4,5]
my_model = "ExampleModel"


#Correct call
result = train_and_evaluate(3, my_data, my_model)
print(result)

# Incorrect call - Missing num_features in the outer function call
try:
    result = train_and_evaluate(my_data, my_model)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") #Output: Error: train_and_evaluate() missing 1 required positional argument: 'num_features'

```

This demonstrates that the error can propagate even when the missing argument is used within a nested function. The outer function `train_and_evaluate` is ultimately responsible for providing the missing `num_features` argument, not the inner function `preprocess`.  This emphasizes the need to thoroughly check argument passing across functions.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a more comprehensive understanding of function arguments and error handling in Python, I would suggest reviewing the official Python documentation on functions and exceptions.  Furthermore, a good introductory Python textbook will provide a thorough grounding in these concepts.  Advanced texts on software engineering and best practices would benefit those working on large projects where such errors can have a significant impact.  Careful attention to code style guides and employing static analysis tools can help prevent this type of error proactively.
