The primary hurdle in integrating a GitHub package with TensorFlow under Python 3.6 often stems from compatibility discrepancies between the package's dependencies, TensorFlow's version requirements, and the Python interpreter itself.  Python 3.6, while still supported for some libraries, is nearing its end-of-life, leading to potential conflicts with newer packages that leverage features introduced in later Python versions or rely on more recent TensorFlow APIs.  My experience working on large-scale machine learning projects has consistently highlighted this as a significant source of installation and runtime errors.  Addressing this requires a systematic approach to dependency management and version control.

**1.  Explanation of Common Issues:**

The core problem revolves around the intersection of three distinct environments: the Python interpreter, TensorFlow, and the external GitHub package.  Each has its own dependency requirements, specified through `requirements.txt` files, `setup.py` configurations, or environment files like `.yml` for tools like conda.  Conflicts can arise in several ways:

* **TensorFlow Version Incompatibility:** The GitHub package might require a specific TensorFlow version (e.g., TensorFlow 1.x or a particular minor release within a major version like 2.x) which might not be compatible with your existing TensorFlow installation or even installable on Python 3.6.  Attempting to install incompatible versions leads to import errors and runtime crashes.  This is particularly problematic given TensorFlow's evolution, with significant API changes between major releases.

* **Dependency Conflicts:** The package might depend on libraries that clash with existing packages in your environment.  For example, it could require a specific version of NumPy, SciPy, or CUDA toolkit which are already present but incompatible.  Package managers like pip attempt to resolve these conflicts, but often fail, resulting in unmet dependency errors.

* **Python 3.6 Limitations:** Python 3.6's age can result in missing features or different behavior compared to newer Python versions.  Some packages, especially those relying on recent Python language features or optimized libraries, might not function correctly or even compile under Python 3.6.  This is often the root cause of cryptic `ImportError` exceptions.

* **Build System Issues:** The GitHub package's build system (typically `setuptools` or `poetry`) might not be fully compatible with Python 3.6.  This can lead to build failures during installation, often manifesting as cryptic compiler errors.

* **Missing Build Tools:**  Correct installation frequently relies on the availability of appropriate compilers (like GCC or Clang) and build tools.  Absence of these during the build process leads to failed compilations, especially for packages involving C or C++ extensions.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Handling Dependency Conflicts with Virtual Environments:**

```python
# Create a virtual environment
python3.6 -m venv tf_env

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
source tf_env/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
tf_env\Scripts\activate

# Install TensorFlow (replace with the appropriate version)
pip install tensorflow==1.15.0

# Install the GitHub package (assuming it's named 'my_github_package')
pip install git+https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

*Commentary:* This demonstrates the critical use of virtual environments.  Each project should have its own isolated environment to prevent dependency clashes across multiple projects. This avoids unexpected behavior caused by conflicting library versions.  Specifying the TensorFlow version directly ensures compatibility.  The `git+https...` syntax installs directly from the GitHub repository.


**Example 2: Resolving Dependencies using `requirements.txt`:**

Assume the GitHub repository provides a `requirements.txt` file specifying dependencies.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment (as in Example 1)

# Install dependencies from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Commentary:*  This method leverages the package author's specified dependencies.  It ensures consistency between the author's development environment and the user's environment. However,  it still needs a properly constructed `requirements.txt` specifying compatible versions for Python 3.6 and the chosen TensorFlow version.


**Example 3:  Using `conda` for Environment Management:**

```bash
# Create a conda environment
conda create -n tf_env python=3.6

# Activate the environment
conda activate tf_env

# Install TensorFlow (check for available versions using `conda search tensorflow`)
conda install tensorflow==1.15.0

# Install the GitHub package (this might require adapting the command based on how the package is structured)
# Example if the package is a conda package
conda install -c conda-forge my_github_package
# Otherwise, if only a pip package is available
pip install git+https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

*Commentary:*  `conda` provides a more robust dependency management system compared to `pip` alone, particularly for scientific computing packages. It manages both Python packages and system-level dependencies (like BLAS and LAPACK libraries).  This can drastically simplify the installation process by automatically handling binary dependencies. However, ensuring availability of the package in a conda channel (`conda-forge` in this example) or using a `pip` installation within the conda environment might be necessary.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Python Packaging User Guide.  The TensorFlow documentation (especially the installation guide).  The official documentation for your chosen package manager (pip and conda).  A comprehensive guide on virtual environment management (including best practices for creating and activating them).  Documentation for your chosen build system (setuptools or poetry).   Finally, refer to the package's README file on GitHub for specific installation instructions.


Through diligent use of virtual environments, explicit dependency specifications, and a robust package manager like `conda`, the challenges of integrating GitHub packages with TensorFlow on Python 3.6 can be effectively mitigated. Remember to consult the relevant documentation for troubleshooting specific errors encountered during the process.  Ignoring these steps almost inevitably leads to frustrating and time-consuming debugging sessions. My experience suggests that proactively addressing compatibility issues prevents numerous downstream problems during development and deployment.
