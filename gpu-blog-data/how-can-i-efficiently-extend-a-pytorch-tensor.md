Efficiently extending a PyTorch tensor by its first and last elements requires careful consideration of memory management and computational cost.  My experience working on high-performance deep learning projects has shown that naive approaches, such as concatenation with repeated slicing, can lead to significant performance bottlenecks, especially when dealing with large tensors.  The optimal solution hinges on leveraging PyTorch's built-in functionalities to avoid unnecessary data copying.

**1. Explanation:**

The core issue lies in avoiding redundant operations. Directly concatenating the first and last elements multiple times using `torch.cat` involves creating intermediate tensors and repeated data copying. This becomes increasingly inefficient as tensor size grows.  A far more efficient approach involves creating a new tensor of the desired size upfront and then populating it with the original tensor's data along with strategically placed copies of the first and last elements. This minimizes data movement and maximizes performance.  Furthermore, we need to be mindful of the underlying data type of the tensor to ensure seamless type compatibility during the extension process.

The process can be broken down into the following steps:

a) **Determine the dimensions:** We need to calculate the size of the extended tensor based on the original tensor's shape.

b) **Create an empty tensor:** An appropriately sized tensor is created to hold the extended data. This utilizes the `torch.zeros()` or `torch.empty()` functions, pre-allocating space efficiently.  `torch.empty()` is generally preferred for slightly better performance in this scenario as it doesn't zero-initialize the memory.

c) **Populate the tensor:** The original tensor's data is copied into the newly created tensor, followed by placing copies of the first and last elements in their respective positions.  This utilizes indexing and assignment instead of repeated concatenation.

d) **Handle potential edge cases:** We must account for scenarios involving tensors with a single element, where the first and last elements are identical, to ensure correct behavior and avoid exceptions.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Basic Extension**

This example demonstrates the fundamental principle using a simple 1D tensor.

```python
import torch

def extend_tensor_basic(tensor):
    if tensor.numel() == 0:
        return torch.empty(0, dtype=tensor.dtype) #Handle empty tensor case

    extended_tensor = torch.empty(tensor.numel() + 2, dtype=tensor.dtype)
    extended_tensor[0] = tensor[0]
    extended_tensor[1:-1] = tensor
    extended_tensor[-1] = tensor[-1]
    return extended_tensor

tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=torch.float32)
extended_tensor = extend_tensor_basic(tensor)
print(f"Original Tensor: {tensor}")
print(f"Extended Tensor: {extended_tensor}")
```

This function first checks for an empty input tensor to avoid errors.  Then it creates an empty tensor two elements larger than the input.  It then efficiently copies the original data and places the first and last elements at the beginning and end.


**Example 2:  Multi-Dimensional Extension (along a specified axis)**

This example extends a multi-dimensional tensor along a specified axis.

```python
import torch

def extend_tensor_multidim(tensor, dim=0):
  if tensor.numel() == 0:
    return torch.empty(tensor.shape, dtype=tensor.dtype)

  extended_shape = list(tensor.shape)
  extended_shape[dim] += 2

  extended_tensor = torch.empty(extended_shape, dtype=tensor.dtype)
  extended_tensor.select(dim, slice(0,1))[:] = tensor.select(dim, 0)
  extended_tensor.select(dim, slice(1,-1))[:] = tensor
  extended_tensor.select(dim, -1)[:] = tensor.select(dim,-1)

  return extended_tensor

tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], dtype=torch.float32)
extended_tensor = extend_tensor_multidim(tensor, dim=0)
print(f"Original Tensor:\n{tensor}")
print(f"Extended Tensor:\n{extended_tensor}")

extended_tensor_dim1 = extend_tensor_multidim(tensor, dim=1)
print(f"Extended Tensor (dim=1):\n{extended_tensor_dim1}")

```

This function handles multi-dimensional tensors, taking the dimension (`dim`) as an argument to specify along which axis the extension should occur. It utilizes advanced indexing to efficiently copy data. The use of `select` improves readability and allows for clear specification of the target dimension.


**Example 3:  In-place Modification (for very large tensors)**

For extremely large tensors where minimizing memory allocation is paramount, in-place modification can provide a performance boost. However, this sacrifices readability and introduces the risk of unintended side effects if not handled carefully.

```python
import torch

def extend_tensor_inplace(tensor):
    if tensor.numel() == 0:
        return tensor #Nothing to do for empty tensor

    tensor.resize_(tensor.numel() + 2)
    tensor[-1] = tensor[-2].clone() #Deep copy to prevent issues.
    tensor[1:-1] = torch.roll(tensor, -1, dims=0)[1:] # Efficiently shifts elements

    return tensor

tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=torch.float32)
extended_tensor = extend_tensor_inplace(tensor)
print(f"Original Tensor: {tensor}")
print(f"Extended Tensor: {extended_tensor}")


```

This example employs `resize_`, which modifies the tensor in-place, and `roll` to efficiently shift elements. The clone operation is crucial to avoid unintended modifications to the original tensor's data.  However, using `resize_` directly changes the original tensor, which should be noted carefully.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of PyTorch's tensor manipulation capabilities, I would recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation.  Furthermore, a thorough understanding of NumPy array manipulation techniques proves beneficial, as many concepts translate directly to PyTorch.  Studying advanced indexing techniques within these frameworks is crucial for efficient tensor operations.  Finally, exploring resources on memory management in Python will help optimize the performance of your tensor operations, especially when working with large datasets.
