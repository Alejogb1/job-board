The behavior you're observing, where a tensor's shape changes unexpectedly on a subsequent call to a custom `call` function within a Keras model, almost certainly stems from stateful operations within the function itself or inconsistencies in input tensor handling.  This isn't an inherent property of Keras's `call` method; rather, it reflects a design choice within your model's architecture or a misunderstanding of tensor manipulation in the TensorFlow/PyTorch backend.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale NLP models highlights the importance of carefully examining the internal state of your tensors and ensuring deterministic behavior across function invocations.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `call` method in a Keras layer or model is crucial; it defines the forward pass computation.  Unlike standard Python functions, the `call` method operates within a computational graph, potentially involving operations that maintain internal state.  This state can manifest in various ways:

* **Internal Buffers:** Your `call` function might utilize temporary tensors or buffers. If these buffers are not properly cleared or reset after each call, they can influence the shape of subsequent computations. This is particularly relevant when using recurrent layers or custom layers implementing mechanisms like memory or accumulators.  A common oversight is forgetting to initialize these buffers before each `call`.

* **Dynamic Shapes:** If your input tensor shape is not consistently the same across calls, downstream operations depending on this shape might produce tensors with varying shapes. This necessitates careful dimension handling using TensorFlow's or PyTorch's shape manipulation functions.  The absence of explicit shape checks or the use of implicit broadcasting can lead to unpredictable results.

* **Layer State:** If your custom layer inherits from a stateful layer (like `LSTM` or `GRU`), then the internal state of that layer is preserved across calls. This intentional statefulness can cause shape changes if the input sequence length varies. This isn't a bug; it’s a designed characteristic.

* **Mutable Objects:** Using mutable objects (lists, dictionaries) as attributes within your custom layer and modifying them within the `call` method can also contribute to this problem. Each call modifies the state of these objects, indirectly affecting subsequent computations.  Immutable data structures (tuples) are preferable in such scenarios to prevent unintentional side effects.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Uninitialized Buffer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class StatefulLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(StatefulLayer, self).__init__()
        self.buffer = None

    def call(self, inputs):
        if self.buffer is None:  # Incorrect: Only initializes on the first call
            self.buffer = tf.zeros_like(inputs)
        self.buffer += inputs
        return self.buffer

model = tf.keras.Sequential([StatefulLayer()])
output1 = model(tf.ones((1, 5)))  # Shape: (1,5)
output2 = model(tf.ones((1, 5)))  # Shape: (1,5), but buffer is (2,5) in reality!

print(output1.shape)  # Output: (1, 5)
print(output2.shape)  # Output: (1, 5) - This is misleading! The internal state is wrong
```

This example demonstrates an uninitialized buffer. The `buffer` is only initialized once.  The correct approach would be to initialize the `buffer` within the `call` method itself, ensuring its shape aligns with the input for each invocation.


**Example 2: Dynamic Reshaping Without Checks:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class ReshapeLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs):
        # Problematic:  Assumes consistent input shape
        return tf.reshape(inputs, (1, -1))  

model = tf.keras.Sequential([ReshapeLayer()])
output1 = model(tf.ones((1, 5)))  # Shape: (1, 5)
output2 = model(tf.ones((2, 5)))  # Shape: (1, 10) - Shape changed due to implicit reshaping
print(output1.shape)  # Output: (1, 5)
print(output2.shape)  # Output: (1, 10)
```

Here, the layer implicitly reshapes based on the input.  Robust code should explicitly check and handle potential variations in input shape to prevent unexpected reshaping. Using `tf.shape` and conditional statements provides control.


**Example 3: Mutable Object as Attribute:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MutableLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MutableLayer, self).__init__()
        self.list_attr = []

    def call(self, inputs):
        self.list_attr.append(inputs.shape) # Modifying mutable attribute
        return inputs

model = tf.keras.Sequential([MutableLayer()])
output1 = model(tf.ones((2, 3)))
output2 = model(tf.ones((1, 4)))
print(output1.shape)  # (2, 3)
print(output2.shape)  # (1, 4) - shape is correct, but internal state is unintentionally modified.
print(model.layers[0].list_attr) # [(2, 3), (1, 4)] - Shows state change
```

This demonstrates the unintended side effects of modifying a list attribute within the `call` method.  Replacing the list with a tuple or employing a more suitable mechanism for storing layer history would solve this.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official TensorFlow documentation on custom layers and models.
* The TensorFlow guide on tensor manipulation and shape operations.
* A comprehensive textbook on deep learning architectures.  Pay close attention to chapters on custom layer implementation and recurrent neural networks.


Addressing the shape changes requires a systematic approach.  Carefully review your `call` function for any stateful operations, buffer usage, implicit shape manipulation, or modifications of mutable objects.  Use debugging tools (like print statements or debuggers) to trace the tensors’ shapes and values at various stages within the function's execution.  Always prioritize robust shape handling and ensure your model operates deterministically regardless of the input shape. This methodical approach will provide insight into the root cause and facilitate the development of robust and reliable custom layers.
