The direct concatenation of expressions within bracket notation is not inherently supported by most programming languages in the manner one might intuitively expect.  While brackets are extensively used for various operations—array indexing, dictionary access, function calls, and more—their primary function is not the string or expression concatenation commonly associated with operators like `+` or string interpolation features.  This misunderstanding frequently arises from a conflation of how brackets delineate sub-expressions within larger expressions and how separate expressions are joined to produce a combined result.  My experience debugging countless codebases over the years has repeatedly highlighted this distinction.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue lies in the semantic difference between evaluation and concatenation.  Brackets primarily control the *order* of operations; the interpreter or compiler evaluates the expression within the brackets *first*, before utilizing the resulting value in a broader context.  Concatenation, on the other hand, implies combining two or more separate entities into a single entity. While brackets can *contain* expressions that will subsequently be concatenated, the brackets themselves do not perform the concatenation.  The act of concatenation requires a dedicated operation—whether it be an explicit concatenation operator, a string formatting function, or implicit concatenation features specific to certain languages.

Let's clarify with a simple analogy: Imagine building with LEGO bricks. Brackets define a sub-assembly; you might build a complex car part within brackets, but you still need to use connectors (the equivalent of concatenation operators) to attach this sub-assembly to the rest of the car.  The brackets themselves don't join the parts; they just define how to build the individual components.

Therefore, attempting to directly concatenate expressions solely using brackets is typically a syntax error or, at best, yields unintended results, often a nested structure rather than a combined string or value. The correct approach necessitates utilizing the language's specific mechanisms for concatenation.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate the contrast between intended bracket usage and proper concatenation techniques in Python, JavaScript, and C++. I will focus on string concatenation, as it's the most frequent scenario where this misunderstanding occurs.


**Example 1: Python**

```python
# Incorrect: Attempting concatenation using brackets only.
# This will raise a TypeError.
expression1 = "Hello"
expression2 = "World"
result = [expression1, expression2]  # Creates a list, not a concatenated string.
print(result)  # Output: ['Hello', 'World']


# Correct: Using the '+' operator for string concatenation.
expression1 = "Hello"
expression2 = "World"
result = expression1 + " " + expression2
print(result)  # Output: Hello World

# Correct: Using f-strings (string interpolation) for more readable concatenation.
name = "Alice"
greeting = f"Hello, {name}!"
print(greeting) # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

**Commentary:** The first attempt in Python is fundamentally wrong.  It creates a list containing the two strings, not a concatenated string. The subsequent examples demonstrate the proper methods: the `+` operator for explicit concatenation, and f-strings for a more concise and readable alternative. I've encountered this exact error numerous times, especially among developers new to string manipulation in Python.


**Example 2: JavaScript**

```javascript
// Incorrect: Brackets are not concatenation operators in JavaScript.
let expression1 = "Hello";
let expression2 = "World";
let result = [expression1, expression2]; // Creates an array.
console.log(result); // Output: ['Hello', 'World']


// Correct: Using the '+' operator.
let expression1 = "Hello";
let expression2 = "World";
let result = expression1 + " " + expression2;
console.log(result); // Output: Hello World


// Correct: Using template literals for string interpolation.
let name = "Bob";
let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Bob!
```

**Commentary:** Similar to the Python example, JavaScript utilizes the `+` operator for explicit concatenation.  Template literals (` `` `) provide a cleaner, more expressive alternative to manually inserting variables into strings.  The failure to recognize the fundamental difference between array creation and string concatenation is a common source of bugs in JavaScript projects I have worked on.


**Example 3: C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  // Incorrect:  Attempting concatenation using brackets will not compile.
  // std::string expression1 = "Hello";
  // std::string expression2 = "World";
  // std::string result = [expression1, expression2]; // This is invalid syntax.


  // Correct: Using the '+' operator.
  std::string expression1 = "Hello";
  std::string expression2 = "World";
  std::string result = expression1 + " " + expression2;
  std::cout << result << std::endl; // Output: Hello World


  // Correct: Using string streams for more complex concatenation.
  std::stringstream ss;
  ss << "The value of pi is approximately " << 3.14159 << ".";
  std::string piString = ss.str();
  std::cout << piString << std::endl; // Output: The value of pi is approximately 3.14159.

  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:**  C++'s string concatenation relies on the `+` operator, analogous to Python and JavaScript.  However, C++ also offers `stringstreams`, a powerful tool for building strings from various data types, especially beneficial when concatenating numbers or other non-string values.  Failing to use the correct concatenation method in C++ often leads to compiler errors.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of string manipulation and expression evaluation, consult your chosen language's official documentation.  Pay close attention to sections covering operators, string formatting, and data structures.  Furthermore, a good introductory text on compiler design or interpreter design can help clarify the underlying mechanics of expression evaluation.  Finally, explore advanced programming texts focusing on data structures and algorithms to solidify your understanding of data manipulation.
