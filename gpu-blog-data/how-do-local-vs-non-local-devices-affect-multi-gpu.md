The performance disparity between local and non-local devices in multi-GPU processing stems fundamentally from the bandwidth limitations of the interconnect connecting the GPUs.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing applications across diverse hardware configurations, including clusters with both NVLink and Infiniband interconnects, has consistently highlighted this bottleneck. While advancements in interconnect technologies constantly push boundaries, the inherent latency and bandwidth differences remain a significant factor influencing scalability.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Multi-GPU processing relies on efficient data transfer between the GPUs involved.  Local devices, in this context, refer to GPUs directly connected via a high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnect such as NVLink (Nvidia's proprietary interconnect) or a comparable technology.  Non-local devices, conversely, are GPUs communicating across a slower interconnect, typically Ethernet or Infiniband, often involving network switches and increased physical distance.

The critical performance difference arises from the bandwidth characteristics. NVLink, for example, boasts significantly higher bandwidth compared to Infiniband, and both greatly surpass the capabilities of standard Ethernet connections.  When GPUs are local, data transfer occurs within a specialized, optimized pathway, resulting in minimal latency and high throughput. This allows for near-seamless data exchange during parallel computation phases, maximizing performance gains from parallelization.

Conversely, when using non-local devices, data transfer is subjected to the limitations of the chosen interconnect.  Higher latency and lower bandwidth introduce significant overheads.  Data transfer times can become the dominant factor, outweighing the computational speedups achieved by distributing the workload across multiple GPUs. This is particularly evident in applications with large datasets requiring extensive inter-GPU communication.  The increased latency manifests as idle time for individual GPUs waiting for data, effectively reducing the overall efficiency of parallel processing.  Furthermore, network congestion, common in shared cluster environments, can further exacerbate performance degradation for non-local devices.

The impact of locality also extends to memory access patterns.  Accessing data residing in the local GPU's memory is considerably faster than retrieving data from a remote GPU's memory.  Efficient memory management strategies, tailored to the specific interconnect, are crucial for optimizing performance across both local and non-local scenarios.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples utilize a simplified model for illustrative purposes. They focus on the core principles of data transfer and highlight the impact of locality.  Note that actual implementation would involve complex libraries like CUDA or ROCm and detailed hardware-specific optimizations.

**Example 1: Local GPU Communication (NVLink assumed):**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>

__global__ void kernel(float *data, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    // Perform computation on data - local memory access
    data[i] *= 2.0f;
  }
}

int main() {
  // ... (Memory allocation and data transfer to GPU 0) ...

  // Launch kernel on GPU 0
  kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(data, size);

  // ... (Data transfer back from GPU 0) ...

  return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:**  This example demonstrates a simple computation performed entirely on a single GPU (GPU 0). No inter-GPU communication is involved, hence it showcases the optimal scenario where locality is inherent.  The performance is primarily limited by the GPU's computational capability and memory bandwidth.

**Example 2: Non-Local GPU Communication (Infiniband assumed):**

```cpp
#include <mpi.h> // MPI for inter-process communication

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
  int rank, size;
  MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
  MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

  // ... (Data partitioning across GPUs) ...

  if (rank == 0) {
      // Send data to other GPUs
      MPI_Send(data, data_size, MPI_FLOAT, 1, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
  } else if (rank == 1){
      // Receive data from GPU 0
      MPI_Recv(data, data_size, MPI_FLOAT, 0, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
      // ... Perform computation on received data ...
      // ... Send results back to GPU 0 ...
  }

  // ... (Data aggregation and finalization) ...

  MPI_Finalize();
  return 0;
}
```


**Commentary:**  This example utilizes MPI (Message Passing Interface) for communication between two GPUs (rank 0 and rank 1), simulating a non-local scenario. The `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Recv` functions handle the data transfer across the Infiniband interconnect. The performance is heavily influenced by the Infiniband bandwidth and latency.  Significant overhead is introduced due to the serialization and deserialization of data, and the inherent latency of the message passing system.

**Example 3: Hybrid Approach (Local and Non-Local GPUs):**

```cpp
// Combination of CUDA and MPI or similar libraries would be used here.

// ... (Data partitioning and initial distribution to local GPUs) ...
// ... (Local GPU computations using CUDA) ...
// ... (Data aggregation among local GPUs using efficient methods like CUDA streams and unified memory) ...
// ... (Data exchange with non-local GPUs via MPI) ...
// ... (Final aggregation and results) ...
```

**Commentary:** This example illustrates a more realistic scenario. It utilizes a hybrid approach, leveraging the high bandwidth of local interconnects for efficient communication among a subset of GPUs, while using a slower interconnect for communication with non-local GPUs.  This strategy aims to minimize the impact of slower interconnects by reducing the volume of data transferred across them.  Careful planning and optimization are crucial to balance local and non-local communication to achieve optimal performance.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official documentation for CUDA, ROCm, and MPI.  Furthermore, specialized literature on high-performance computing, particularly focusing on parallel programming and interconnect technologies, will provide valuable insights.  Exploring case studies and benchmark results analyzing multi-GPU performance across different hardware configurations will greatly enhance your understanding.  Lastly, familiarizing yourself with different memory management strategies within the context of multi-GPU systems is crucial for effective performance optimization.
