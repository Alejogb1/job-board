The most frequent reason for PyTorch model weights failing to update during training stems from an incorrectly configured optimizer or a lack of gradient calculation within the training loop.  I've personally debugged countless instances of this, often tracing the problem to subtle issues in how the optimizer interacts with the model's parameters or the backpropagation process.  A thorough examination of your optimizer setup, loss function, and gradient accumulation is crucial.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's automatic differentiation mechanism, crucial for training neural networks, relies on the computation graph it constructs. This graph tracks operations performed on tensors, enabling the efficient calculation of gradients using backpropagation.  When you call `.backward()` on a loss tensor, PyTorch traverses this graph, calculating gradients with respect to all tensors requiring gradient updates (those with `.requires_grad = True`).  These gradients are then used by the optimizer to adjust the model's weights using an update rule specific to the chosen optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD).

If the weights aren't updating, several issues could be at play:

* **Optimizer not applied:** The most basic oversight is forgetting to actually update the model's parameters using the optimizer's `step()` method.  This method applies the computed gradients to the model's weights.  Without this, gradients are calculated but never utilized to modify the model.

* **Incorrect optimizer configuration:**  Incorrect hyperparameters (learning rate, momentum, weight decay, etc.) can hinder or entirely prevent weight updates.  A learning rate that is too small might result in negligible weight changes, appearing as if no updates are occurring. Conversely, an excessively large learning rate can lead to instability and prevent convergence, potentially masking the absence of actual updates.

* **Gradient masking:** Gradients might be numerically zero or effectively zero due to issues in the model architecture, data preprocessing, or loss function. This can occur if the loss function is not sensitive to the model's parameters (e.g., a poorly scaled loss), if gradients vanish or explode during backpropagation (common in deep networks), or if the data itself lacks sufficient variance to drive significant gradient updates.

* **`requires_grad = False`:** If the model's parameters are not flagged as requiring gradients (`requires_grad = True`), PyTorch won't compute gradients for them, effectively freezing these parameters during training.  This is often used intentionally for certain layers (e.g., feature extractors), but unintended usage is a common source of error.

* **Incorrect data handling:** Issues with data loading or preprocessing can also lead to gradients that are either zero or numerically unstable. For instance, incorrect normalization or scaling can severely impact the gradient magnitude.  Similarly, bugs in data augmentation processes can introduce noise that obscures meaningful gradients.

* **Detached computation graph:**  Operations that detach tensors from the computation graph (e.g., `.detach()`, `.data`) prevent the flow of gradients.  Accidentally detaching tensors crucial for the loss calculation will effectively stop gradient propagation to the model parameters.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Missing Optimizer Step**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for epoch in range(10):
    inputs = torch.randn(64, 10)
    targets = torch.randn(64, 1)
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()  # Calculate gradients
    #optimizer.step() #MISSING STEP!
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

This code omits `optimizer.step()`, resulting in zero weight updates despite gradient calculation.  The loss remains unchanged across epochs.  The correct version requires adding `optimizer.step()` after `loss.backward()`.


**Example 2:  Zero Gradients due to Loss Function Scaling**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
criterion = nn.MSELoss() # Loss might be too small with specific data
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for epoch in range(10):
  inputs = torch.randn(64, 10) * 0.01 # Very small inputs
  targets = torch.randn(64, 1) * 0.01 # Very small targets
  outputs = model(inputs)
  loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")

```

Here, extremely small input and target values could lead to vanishing gradients.  Increasing the scale of the inputs/targets or using a more appropriate loss function (potentially with adjustments to better handle scale) is crucial.  The output is likely to demonstrate minimal or no change in loss.

**Example 3:  `requires_grad = False` unintentionally set:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(10, 5), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(5, 1))
for param in model[0].parameters():
  param.requires_grad = False #Accidentally frozen first layer

criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for epoch in range(10):
    inputs = torch.randn(64, 10)
    targets = torch.randn(64, 1)
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

In this instance,  `requires_grad` is incorrectly set to `False` for the parameters of the first linear layer. Consequently, only the second layer's weights will be updated, leading to limited model improvement.  Verifying that `requires_grad` is `True` for all trainable parameters is vital.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I'd recommend revisiting the PyTorch documentation on optimizers, specifically focusing on the nuances of each optimizer and their hyperparameter tuning.  Additionally, a deep dive into the automatic differentiation mechanisms within PyTorch would be beneficial.  Finally, a thorough understanding of backpropagation and the computation graph will significantly aid debugging.  Consulting advanced deep learning textbooks focusing on practical implementation details would be a valuable asset.  Pay particular attention to sections on debugging common training issues.
