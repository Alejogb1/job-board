The `MPI_Recv` function, by its nature, receives data into a buffer provided as an argument. It doesn't inherently offer a mechanism to directly specify an offset *within* that buffer where the incoming data should begin storage. Instead, the responsibility for handling buffer offsets rests with the programmer before and after the call to `MPI_Recv`. This means manipulating the provided buffer and type system, or using derived datatypes, are the key techniques to achieve the desired effect. I’ve dealt with this frequently when optimizing simulation codes involving complex data structures, where data isn’t always laid out contiguously.

The core idea is that `MPI_Recv` transfers data based on the provided pointer to the receive buffer and the data type specified. It treats the provided buffer as a contiguous block of memory where the receiving process stores data beginning at the provided pointer location. The "offset" concept, therefore, must be realized *prior* to calling the function by positioning the buffer pointer. Consider, for example, a scenario where one wants to receive data into the middle of an existing buffer. This isn't done with an `offset` parameter within `MPI_Recv`; it's achieved by using pointer arithmetic to offset the receiving buffer before passing it to the function. Alternatively, when receiving into more complex non-contiguous buffers, derived data types can also be beneficial for receiving data to specific locations within a memory structure.

Here's how we can address different use cases. First, if the receiving data is contiguous and we need to store the data into a memory location other than the beginning of the provided buffer, pointer arithmetic works quite effectively. I often encounter this when receiving partial updates to simulation fields. Let's demonstrate with an example.

```c
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);

    int rank, size;
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

    int buffer_size = 10;
    int *buffer = (int *)malloc(buffer_size * sizeof(int));

    if (buffer == NULL) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation error on rank %d.\n", rank);
      MPI_Abort(MPI_COMM_WORLD, 1);
    }

    int offset = 3; // Receive data starting at the 4th element
    int recv_count = 4; // Receive 4 integer values
    int *recv_buffer = buffer + offset; // Pointer arithmetic for offset
    int source_rank = 0;

    if (rank == 0) {
      // Sender process
        int send_data[4] = {10, 20, 30, 40};
        MPI_Send(send_data, recv_count, MPI_INT, 1, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
        
        // Initialize the entire buffer
        for (int i=0; i<buffer_size; ++i){
            buffer[i] = i;
        }
        printf("Sender buffer: ");
         for (int i=0; i<buffer_size; ++i){
          printf("%d ",buffer[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");


    } else if (rank == 1) {
      // Receiver process
        MPI_Recv(recv_buffer, recv_count, MPI_INT, source_rank, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);

        // Initialise the rest of the buffer for printing
        for (int i=0; i<buffer_size; ++i){
            if (i < offset || i >= offset + recv_count){
                buffer[i] = 0;
            }
        }
        
        printf("Receiver buffer: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < buffer_size; ++i) {
            printf("%d ", buffer[i]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    free(buffer);
    MPI_Finalize();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the sender (rank 0) transmits an array of four integers to the receiver (rank 1). On the receiving end, the offset is set to `3`, creating a `recv_buffer` that points to the fourth element in the allocated memory. `MPI_Recv` then deposits the received integers beginning at that location, thereby achieving an offset receive into an existing memory buffer. It is crucial to ensure that the `recv_count` and `offset` do not exceed the buffer bounds. Failing to ensure this will lead to a memory access error during the `MPI_Recv` operation.

Now, consider scenarios where the received data isn't contiguous, which I regularly encounter in simulations using structured grids. Here, we can’t simply rely on pointer arithmetic; we'd need derived datatypes to specify the layout for efficient data transfer and placement into specific memory locations. The following example demonstrates the use of derived datatypes for receiving into a non-contiguous array structure.

```c
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);

    int rank, size;
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

    int rows = 5;
    int cols = 5;
    int **matrix = (int **)malloc(rows * sizeof(int*));
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        matrix[i] = (int*)malloc(cols * sizeof(int));
        if (matrix[i] == NULL) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation error on rank %d.\n", rank);
            MPI_Abort(MPI_COMM_WORLD, 1);
        }
    }

    int recv_row_start = 1; // Receive starting at row 1
    int recv_row_count = 3; // Receive 3 rows
    int recv_col_count = 2; // Receive 2 columns
    MPI_Datatype blocktype;

    // Create a sub-array type.
    int sizes[2] = {rows, cols};          // Overall matrix dimensions
    int subsizes[2] = {recv_row_count, recv_col_count}; // Dimensions of the sub-block
    int starts[2] = {recv_row_start, 0};   // Starting position of the sub-block
    MPI_Type_create_subarray(2, sizes, subsizes, starts, MPI_ORDER_C, MPI_INT, &blocktype);
    MPI_Type_commit(&blocktype);

    int source_rank = 0;

    if (rank == 0) {
        // Sender process
       int send_data[6] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60}; // Data to send for rows [1,3), cols [0,2)
        
        //Initialise entire array
        for (int i=0; i < rows; ++i){
            for (int j=0; j < cols; ++j){
                matrix[i][j] = i*cols+j;
            }
        }
         printf("Sender matrix:\n");
          for (int i=0; i<rows; ++i){
            for (int j=0; j < cols; ++j){
            printf("%d ", matrix[i][j]);
          }
        printf("\n");
      }

        MPI_Send(send_data, 1, blocktype, 1, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD); // Send data using sub-array
    } else if (rank == 1) {
        // Receiver process
        MPI_Recv(&matrix[0][0], 1, blocktype, source_rank, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);


        // Print entire matrix after the receive operation
        printf("Receiver matrix:\n");
          for (int i=0; i<rows; ++i){
            for (int j=0; j < cols; ++j){
            printf("%d ", matrix[i][j]);
            }
        printf("\n");
          }

    }
    MPI_Type_free(&blocktype);
        for (int i=0; i < rows; i++){
            free(matrix[i]);
        }
    free(matrix);
    MPI_Finalize();

    return 0;
}
```

Here, I’ve constructed a two-dimensional array (`matrix`). Instead of receiving the entire matrix, the goal is to receive only a sub-block of the matrix, specifically rows from index 1 to 3 (exclusive) and columns from 0 to 2 (exclusive). To accomplish this, we use `MPI_Type_create_subarray` to define a new datatype that describes this non-contiguous sub-array. The receiver passes the address of the start of the matrix, the number of blocks to receive which is 1 and the `blocktype` which defines the non-contiguous structure in memory to the MPI_Recv. `MPI_Recv` then automatically places data at the appropriate positions within the matrix according to the derived datatype. This is advantageous, since it handles the complex memory mapping for us.

Finally, when you are working with structured data types, for example C structs, `MPI_Type_create_struct` can allow one to create derived data types that match the structure of your data. This can provide an elegant way to receive data to specific locations within a structure. This is useful when dealing with simulation codes involving object structures, and where each process may be receiving different types of object data. This is demonstrated in the final example.

```c
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct {
    int id;
    double x;
    double y;
    double z;
} Particle;


int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);

    int rank, size;
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

    // create custom data type
    int blocklengths[4] = {1,1,1,1};
    MPI_Datatype types[4] = {MPI_INT, MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_DOUBLE, MPI_DOUBLE};
    MPI_Aint displacements[4];

    //Find the displacements of members using offsetof
    MPI_Aint base;
    MPI_Get_address(&(((Particle*)0)->id), &base);
    MPI_Get_address(&(((Particle*)0)->x), &displacements[1]);
    MPI_Get_address(&(((Particle*)0)->y), &displacements[2]);
    MPI_Get_address(&(((Particle*)0)->z), &displacements[3]);

    displacements[0] = 0;
    displacements[1] -= base;
    displacements[2] -= base;
    displacements[3] -= base;

    MPI_Datatype particle_type;
    MPI_Type_create_struct(4, blocklengths, displacements, types, &particle_type);
    MPI_Type_commit(&particle_type);

    Particle recv_particle;
    int source_rank = 0;

    if(rank == 0){
       // Sender process
        Particle send_particle;
        send_particle.id = 10;
        send_particle.x = 1.0;
        send_particle.y = 2.0;
        send_particle.z = 3.0;
        MPI_Send(&send_particle, 1, particle_type, 1, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

        printf("Sender particle: ID: %d, x: %f, y: %f, z: %f\n", send_particle.id, send_particle.x, send_particle.y, send_particle.z);

    }else if (rank == 1) {
      // Receiver process
      MPI_Recv(&recv_particle, 1, particle_type, source_rank, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);

      printf("Receiver particle: ID: %d, x: %f, y: %f, z: %f\n", recv_particle.id, recv_particle.x, recv_particle.y, recv_particle.z);

    }

    MPI_Type_free(&particle_type);
    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;

}
```

In this example, we've defined a `Particle` struct. `MPI_Type_create_struct` is employed to create a derived datatype that precisely maps the memory layout of the struct. This is done using the MPI\_Get\_address and offsetof macros to automatically detect the locations of each member in the struct, allowing us to specify the correct displacements for the struct members. Upon calling `MPI_Recv` with the derived type, MPI handles storage of the incoming data directly into the corresponding struct fields. This approach is particularly useful as code becomes more object oriented, and manual memory manipulation of struct members becomes difficult.

In summary, `MPI_Recv` does not directly handle offsets as parameters. Instead, one must use techniques such as pointer arithmetic, `MPI_Type_create_subarray` or `MPI_Type_create_struct` for complex data layouts to receive data at specific locations within a buffer.

For further study, consult MPI documentation and tutorials, the MPI standard documents, and books on parallel programming with MPI, particularly those covering derived datatypes. These provide a thorough explanation of the techniques mentioned above. Libraries specializing in parallel data structures and algorithms may offer abstraction layers that help manage these complexities, but they are built upon the foundations described here.
