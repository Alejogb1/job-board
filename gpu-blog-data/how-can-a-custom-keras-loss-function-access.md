Accessing a Keras model's internal state within a custom loss function requires careful consideration of TensorFlow's computational graph and the way Keras builds upon it. The core challenge is that loss functions operate on the *output* of the model and the true labels, not the intermediary activations or weights. However, through clever manipulation of the Keras functional API and a strategic understanding of TensorFlow's symbolic tensors, we can indirectly access this data. I’ve frequently encountered this requirement when implementing regularizations beyond standard L1/L2, particularly in scenarios involving self-supervised learning where the model's internal representations become critical for calculating the objective.

The direct output of a Keras model is a tensor; loss functions are intended to receive a tensor representing the model's predictions and a tensor representing the true labels, then reduce these into a scalar representing loss. This separation of concerns is deliberate. However, the functional API in Keras allows you to effectively create multi-output models. Instead of just one output tensor representing the prediction, you can designate any layer’s output as an output of the model, making it accessible for further manipulation. This forms the basis of our strategy: by designating the layer whose internal state we wish to access as an additional output, we can capture it in the output tensors which will be passed to the custom loss function.

Here’s a three-stage process I’ve found useful:

1.  **Modify the model to output the target layer's activations:** We’ll redefine the model using the functional API so that the target layer’s output becomes an additional output. This ensures the activation tensor becomes directly available during training.

2.  **Create a custom loss function that accepts the additional output:** The loss function should accept the standard `y_true` and `y_pred`, as well as the newly added activation tensor. You’ll need to modify the custom loss signature to accommodate this.

3.  **Calculate the custom loss using the added activation:** Within the loss function, perform the desired computation using this additional output and then combine it with the standard loss.

Here’s a code example demonstrating this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Example custom loss function
def custom_loss_with_activations(y_true, y_pred, activation_output, regularization_strength=0.1):
    """
    Calculates a loss based on y_true and y_pred and
    adds a regularization based on activation_output.

    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth tensor.
        y_pred: Model prediction tensor.
        activation_output: Activation tensor from a designated layer.
        regularization_strength: Strength of the activation based regularization.

    Returns:
        Scalar tensor representing the combined loss.
    """
    # Standard categorical crossentropy loss
    standard_loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)

    # Regularization term based on the activation
    regularization_term = tf.reduce_mean(tf.math.abs(activation_output)) * regularization_strength

    # Combine both losses
    combined_loss = standard_loss + regularization_term

    return combined_loss

# Example model definition using functional API
def build_model_with_activation_output(input_shape, num_classes, activation_layer_name='dense_intermediate'):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
    intermediate_layer = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', name=activation_layer_name)(x)
    outputs = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(intermediate_layer)
    
    # Multiple output to allow access the intermediate layer's output
    model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[outputs, intermediate_layer])
    return model

# Example data
input_shape = (10,)
num_classes = 5
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 28*28).astype('float32') / 255.0
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 28*28).astype('float32') / 255.0
y_test = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)
x_train = x_train[:100]
y_train = y_train[:100,:num_classes]
x_test = x_test[:100]
y_test = y_test[:100,:num_classes]


# Build and compile the model
model = build_model_with_activation_output(input_shape=x_train.shape[1:], num_classes=num_classes)
# Passing model and y_true and y_pred and the activation_output of the layer
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss_with_activations)

# Training the modified model
model.fit(x_train, [y_train, x_train], batch_size=32, epochs=2)
```

In this first example, the `build_model_with_activation_output` function now outputs two tensors: the standard prediction and the activation from the intermediate dense layer named `dense_intermediate`. The `custom_loss_with_activations` function receives these outputs (as it is implicitly passed to the `model.compile()` function), calculates the standard categorical cross-entropy loss, computes the mean of absolute values of the intermediate activation as regularization, and combines both. Key is that the output is passed in the `fit` call as a list of the main prediction and the intermediate output. This approach allows one to inject custom logic involving intermediate layer activations into the training process.

Here's a second example where we access the weights of a layer, rather than the output:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Example custom loss function to access layer weights
def custom_loss_with_weights(y_true, y_pred, weights, regularization_strength=0.1):
    """
    Calculates a loss based on y_true and y_pred and adds
    a regularization based on the layer's weights.

    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth tensor.
        y_pred: Model prediction tensor.
        weights: Weight tensor of a designated layer.
        regularization_strength: Strength of the weight based regularization.

    Returns:
        Scalar tensor representing the combined loss.
    """
    standard_loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
    
    # Regularization based on the weights.
    regularization_term = tf.reduce_sum(tf.math.abs(weights)) * regularization_strength

    combined_loss = standard_loss + regularization_term
    return combined_loss


# Custom layer to expose weights.
class ExposeWeightsDense(layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, activation=None, **kwargs):
        super(ExposeWeightsDense, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.activation = tf.keras.activations.get(activation)
        self.kernel = None
        self.bias = None

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                     initializer='glorot_uniform',
                                     trainable=True,
                                     name='kernel')
        self.bias = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                     initializer='zeros',
                                     trainable=True,
                                     name='bias')
        super(ExposeWeightsDense, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, inputs):
        output = tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel) + self.bias
        if self.activation:
           output = self.activation(output)
        return output
    
    def get_weights(self):
        return self.kernel

# Example model definition using functional API
def build_model_with_weight_output(input_shape, num_classes, weight_layer_name='dense_weights'):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
    intermediate_layer = ExposeWeightsDense(32, activation='relu', name=weight_layer_name)(x)
    outputs = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(intermediate_layer)
    
    # Added additional weight output
    model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[outputs, intermediate_layer.get_weights()])
    return model

# Example Data and parameters
input_shape = (10,)
num_classes = 5
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 28*28).astype('float32') / 255.0
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 28*28).astype('float32') / 255.0
y_test = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)
x_train = x_train[:100]
y_train = y_train[:100,:num_classes]
x_test = x_test[:100]
y_test = y_test[:100,:num_classes]

# Build and compile the model
model = build_model_with_weight_output(input_shape=x_train.shape[1:], num_classes=num_classes)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss_with_weights)


# Training the modified model
model.fit(x_train, [y_train,model.get_layer('dense_weights').kernel], batch_size=32, epochs=2)

```

In this example, we use a custom `ExposeWeightsDense` layer, which inherits from `keras.layers.Layer`. This layer exposes its weights, allowing us to use it as an output within the functional model. In this specific example, I’ve made the layer directly return its kernel through a custom method, and added a regularization term that considers these weights in the loss. The key modification here is retrieving weights through a model layer’s method, and then passing them in the fitting of the model in addition to the main prediction.

Finally, here’s an example that makes use of a custom function.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Example custom loss function with a custom function
def custom_loss_with_function(y_true, y_pred, intermediate_output, regularization_strength=0.1):
    """

        intermediate_output: Activation tensor from a designated layer.
        regularization_strength: Strength of the weight based regularization.

    Returns:
        Scalar tensor representing the combined loss.
    """
    standard_loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)
    
    # Custom regularization logic based on the intermediate layer's output
    regularization_term = custom_function(intermediate_output) * regularization_strength

    combined_loss = standard_loss + regularization_term
    return combined_loss

# Custom function operating on the activations.
def custom_function(activations):
    """
    Example of a custom function operating on the layer's activations.
    """
    mean_activation = tf.reduce_mean(tf.math.square(activations))
    return mean_activation


# Example model definition using functional API
def build_model_with_function_output(input_shape, num_classes, intermediate_layer_name='dense_intermediate'):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
    intermediate_layer = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', name=intermediate_layer_name)(x)
    outputs = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(intermediate_layer)
    
    # Added additional weight output
    model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=[outputs, intermediate_layer])
    return model

# Example data and parameters
input_shape = (10,)
num_classes = 5
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 28*28).astype('float32') / 255.0
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 28*28).astype('float32') / 255.0
y_test = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)
x_train = x_train[:100]
y_train = y_train[:100,:num_classes]
x_test = x_test[:100]
y_test = y_test[:100,:num_classes]


# Build and compile the model
model = build_model_with_function_output(input_shape=x_train.shape[1:], num_classes=num_classes)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss_with_function)

# Training the modified model
model.fit(x_train, [y_train, x_train], batch_size=32, epochs=2)
```

This last example encapsulates the regularization logic in a custom function called `custom_function`. This can be beneficial to keep the loss function readable, especially if you have more complex regularization logic. The model itself outputs the intermediary layer, which is then used as input for the custom function and incorporated into the loss. The principle remains the same: making an intermediary output available by modifying the output of the functional model.

For further reading, the official TensorFlow and Keras documentation is invaluable. Pay close attention to the sections concerning custom layers, functional API, and custom loss functions. Also, researching advanced regularization techniques and self-supervised learning frameworks would also be relevant. Finally, understanding the basics of TensorFlow's eager execution and graph building mechanisms can further aid in comprehending this topic.
