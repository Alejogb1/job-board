The `Tee-Object` cmdlet in PowerShell, while invaluable for capturing output to both the console and a file (or variable), inherently adds a trailing newline character to each output it passes along. This can introduce unwanted whitespace into output files and disrupt the integrity of data, especially when dealing with structured text or binary data streams. I've encountered this issue frequently, particularly when generating log files where consistent formatting is critical and when feeding the output of PowerShell processes into other systems that rely on precise input. Eliminating this behavior requires understanding `Tee-Object`'s processing pipeline and utilizing alternative approaches or targeted modifications of the output stream.

Fundamentally, `Tee-Object` behaves as an intermediary. It receives objects via the pipeline, writes a string representation of these objects to a specified location (file or variable), and then passes the original objects along the pipeline. The newline character insertion occurs specifically during the conversion of objects into strings when directing the output to the target. This behavior is built-in, so there isn't a direct switch to disable it. Instead, we must either bypass the stringification step or use alternative techniques to manage the output stream without the addition of trailing newlines. This often involves employing redirection and handling streams separately or manipulating the content after it's processed by `Tee-Object`.

One common method, especially effective for string-based output, is to capture the output of the pipeline in a variable *before* piping it to `Tee-Object`. Because the variable holds the objects in their raw form, they can then be converted into a string without the `Tee-Object` induced trailing newline, and then written to the target. This can be achieved with the `-NoNewLine` parameter when writing to a file, or no additional action is required when capturing the string to a variable.

For example:

```powershell
# Example 1: Using a variable for string-based output to a file
$output = "This is a test string." # Output pipeline here
$output | Out-File -FilePath "output.txt" -NoNewline
$output | Tee-Object -Variable TeeOutput
Write-Host "Tee Output: '$TeeOutput'" # Note: Variable captures with original newline
Get-Content output.txt

# output to console
#Tee Output: 'This is a test string.'
#This is a test string.
```

In the above example, we assign the string "This is a test string." to the `$output` variable. Then we write the content of the variable to a file without the trailing newline using `-NoNewline` switch on `Out-File` while `Tee-Object` outputs a variable with trailing newline intact. The `Write-Host` confirms that `$TeeOutput` captured the original output with newline. The `Get-Content` then confirms that the file is written without the additional trailing newline. This method works well when dealing with simple strings, as shown in this example, but it struggles with more complex objects as their direct string representation may be not be what you want.

When dealing with data that is not primarily string-based and requires specific formatting, such as data formatted by `Export-Csv` or other format commands, it is necessary to capture the output in the variable before streaming it to the file. For example, the default output of `Export-Csv` appends a trailing newline to each output line, which `Tee-Object` would further compound. In these cases, we must use a similar pre-capture approach and then use `Out-File` to write the data with the appropriate newlines (or lack thereof). Consider this example:

```powershell
# Example 2: Using a variable with objects and Export-Csv
$data = @(
    [PSCustomObject]@{ Name = "Item1"; Value = 10 },
    [PSCustomObject]@{ Name = "Item2"; Value = 20 }
)

$csvOutput = $data | Export-Csv -NoTypeInformation
$csvOutput | Out-File -FilePath "output.csv" -NoNewline

$csvOutput | Tee-Object -Variable TeeCsvOutput

Write-Host "Tee CSV Output:" $TeeCsvOutput
Get-Content output.csv

#output to console
#Tee CSV Output:
#"Name","Value"
#"Item1","10"
#"Item2","20"
# "Name","Value"
#"Item1","10"
#"Item2","20"
```

Here, we are exporting CSV data into a variable, and again using `Out-File` with `-NoNewline` to write to file. The output to file is as expected, and variable `TeeCsvOutput` contains the original text with the newlines included from `Export-Csv`. The content of `output.csv` is as desired without the added trailing newline from `Tee-Object`. This approach is flexible, since we can use any formatting command that we wish before saving to file, and so long as we use the `Out-File` cmdlet with the correct parameters, we will avoid appending the additional newline. This method requires that we store the entire pipeline output in memory first, which may be an issue with very large output sets.

Finally, if there is a need to process the output in the pipeline and *also* prevent the trailing newline, it may be necessary to redirect the stream while using a secondary `Tee-Object` to capture in a variable. This may be necessary if the original output needs to be piped to other commands, while the output to file should be newline free.

```powershell
# Example 3: Redirecting output with secondary Tee-Object

$inputString = "This is a piped string"

$inputString |
    & {
        $output = $_
        $output | Tee-Object -Variable teePiped
        Write-Host "Redirected Output:" $output
        $output
    } |
    Out-File -FilePath "output3.txt" -NoNewline

Write-Host "Tee Piped Output:" $teePiped

Get-Content output3.txt
#output to console
#Redirected Output: This is a piped string
#Tee Piped Output: This is a piped string
#This is a piped string
```

In this final example, the string `$inputString` is piped into an anonymous scriptblock `&{...}`. Inside the script block, it is captured into `$output`, piped through `Tee-Object` into a variable, and then also passed out of the scriptblock to be piped further downstream. Finally, the stream of text is piped to `Out-File` with `-NoNewline`. In this example, both the output to the console from the scriptblock and the file output show the string without an additional trailing newline. The `Tee-Object` output captured in `$teePiped` *does* contain the newline character. This demonstrates that `Tee-Object` inserts the newline on object to string conversion. This method allows further processing of the stream, while also storing the content in a variable with trailing newline, and finally writing it to a file without the additional newline.

In summary, `Tee-Object`'s default behavior of appending a trailing newline is a characteristic of its underlying design, and there is no direct parameter to disable this behaviour. However, through carefully constructing the PowerShell pipeline and utilizing redirection and capture variables, we can control when and how newlines are added, or avoided, with specific focus on output to file. The choice of which technique to use is largely dictated by how the data is generated, how it needs to be formatted, and whether we need to send the output to other commands simultaneously. Careful consideration of these factors and selecting the appropriate method can ensure that the output is as expected and avoids the unexpected addition of unwanted newline characters from `Tee-Object`.

For additional exploration of PowerShell techniques, I recommend examining the help documentation for `Out-File`, `Export-Csv`, and other data output cmdlets. Several online PowerShell forums and communities provide valuable insights into specific use cases and alternative solutions. The book "PowerShell in Action" offers comprehensive coverage of the PowerShell pipeline and data manipulation techniques, while the official Microsoft PowerShell documentation also provides useful references on this cmdlet's behavior.
