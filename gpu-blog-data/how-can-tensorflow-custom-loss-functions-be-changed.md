Dynamically altering TensorFlow custom loss functions during model fitting necessitates a nuanced understanding of TensorFlow's execution graph and the limitations imposed by eager execution versus graph mode.  My experience working on large-scale anomaly detection models highlighted the critical need for this capability;  we required the loss function to adapt based on the evolving data distribution observed during training.  Simply put, a static loss function proved insufficient for our evolving data characteristics.  This necessitates a strategy that moves beyond simple function assignment and incorporates a mechanism for conditional loss function selection within the training loop.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The key challenge lies in TensorFlow's computational graph.  In graph mode, the entire computation is defined before execution, limiting runtime modification.  Eager execution offers more flexibility but requires careful management to avoid performance bottlenecks.  Therefore, instead of directly changing the loss function object itself during fitting, we manipulate a control variable that determines which loss function is called within the training step. This variable can be updated based on various criteria, such as epoch number, validation metrics, or even internal model states. The loss function itself remains unchanged; rather, we conditionally invoke different loss functions based on the control variable's value.  This approach avoids the overhead of rebuilding the computational graph repeatedly.

For instance, one might want to switch from a mean squared error (MSE) loss to a Huber loss after a certain number of epochs to mitigate the effect of outliers that become more apparent as training progresses. Or, perhaps validation performance on a specific metric triggers a change to a more robust loss function.  The choice depends entirely on the specific application and the desired training behavior.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Epoch-Based Loss Function Switching:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def mse_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred))

def huber_loss(y_true, y_pred, delta=1.0):
  error = y_true - y_pred
  abs_error = tf.abs(error)
  quadratic = tf.minimum(abs_error, delta)
  linear = abs_error - quadratic
  return 0.5 * tf.square(quadratic) + delta * linear

def custom_training_loop(model, X_train, y_train, epochs):
  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
  for epoch in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(X_train)
      if epoch < epochs // 2:  # Switch after half the epochs
        loss = mse_loss(y_train, predictions)
      else:
        loss = huber_loss(y_train, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}, Loss: {loss.numpy()}")


# Example usage:
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,)), tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)])
custom_training_loop(model, tf.random.normal((100, 10)), tf.random.normal((100,1)), epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates a simple switch between MSE and Huber loss based on the current epoch.  This is a straightforward method, particularly useful when a predetermined schedule for loss function changes is known beforehand. The clarity and readability are paramount for maintainability.


**Example 2: Validation Metric-Based Switching:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (mse_loss and huber_loss functions from Example 1) ...

def custom_training_loop(model, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, epochs, threshold=0.1):
  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
  loss_function = mse_loss  # Initialize with MSE
  for epoch in range(epochs):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(X_train)
      loss = loss_function(y_train, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    val_predictions = model(X_val)
    val_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_val - val_predictions)) # Example validation metric
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}, Train Loss: {loss.numpy()}, Val Loss: {val_loss.numpy()}")

    if val_loss > threshold and loss_function == mse_loss:  # Switch to Huber if validation loss exceeds threshold
      loss_function = huber_loss
      print("Switching to Huber Loss.")

# Example usage (requires X_val and y_val):
# ... similar to Example 1, but with X_val and y_val passed to the function ...
```

Here, the loss function dynamically switches to the Huber loss only if the validation loss surpasses a predefined threshold.  This adapts the training process based on the model's generalization performance, addressing potential overfitting issues indicated by a diverging training and validation loss.  The explicit condition ensures clarity and facilitates debugging.


**Example 3:  Internal Model State-Based Switching (Advanced):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (mse_loss and huber_loss functions from Example 1) ...

class DynamicLossModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    super(DynamicLossModel, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
    self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    self.loss_switch = tf.Variable(0.0, trainable=False) # Control Variable

  def call(self, inputs):
    x = self.dense1(inputs)
    return self.dense2(x)

  def train_step(self, data):
    x, y = data
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y_pred = self(x)
        if self.loss_switch < 0.5:  # Example condition based on a learned parameter
            loss = mse_loss(y, y_pred)
        else:
            loss = huber_loss(y, y_pred)
        
        # Update loss_switch based on some internal model state or other criteria (example below is illustrative)
        self.loss_switch.assign(tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y - y_pred)))

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, self.trainable_variables)
    self.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, self.trainable_variables))
    return {"loss": loss}


#Example usage
model = DynamicLossModel()
model.compile(optimizer='adam')
model.fit(tf.random.normal((100, 10)), tf.random.normal((100, 1)), epochs=10)
```

This example leverages a custom training step within a subclass of `tf.keras.Model`. The `loss_switch` variable acts as a control mechanism updated within the training loop.  The condition is more complex, potentially reacting to an internal model parameter or other computed metrics, making this approach more flexible and adaptive. This approach demonstrates higher-level control and a more sophisticated use of TensorFlow's mechanisms.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on custom training loops, custom layers, and eager execution, are essential.  Furthermore, resources focusing on advanced TensorFlow techniques and model customization would be beneficial.  Finally, exploring research papers related to adaptive learning rates and dynamic loss functions will offer valuable insights into the design space.  Understanding gradient-based optimization algorithms is crucial for comprehending the impact of loss function changes on the training process.
