TensorFlow's GPU utilization hinges on proper configuration, primarily through specifying the visible devices.  My experience troubleshooting GPU allocation issues across numerous projects, including large-scale image recognition models and time-series forecasting systems, has consistently highlighted the importance of explicit device placement within the TensorFlow graph.  Ignoring this often leads to unexpected CPU execution, significantly impacting performance.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow, by default, attempts to leverage available GPUs. However, multi-GPU systems often present challenges.  If you have multiple GPUs installed, TensorFlow might inadvertently assign your code to an unintended device, leading to suboptimal performance or even errors. To ensure your TensorFlow 2.0 code runs on a *specific* GPU, you must explicitly instruct TensorFlow which device to utilize. This involves setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable or programmatically selecting the device within your Python code.

The `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable allows you to restrict the GPUs TensorFlow can "see." By setting it to a specific GPU index (starting from 0), you force TensorFlow to only use that designated GPU.  This is a crucial first step for controlling GPU allocation.  Programmatic device placement, discussed later, offers finer-grained control within the TensorFlow graph.  The choice between these methods depends on the complexity of your application and the level of control required.  For simple scenarios, environment variable manipulation suffices.  For more complex situations involving multiple devices or conditional GPU usage, programmatic control is preferred.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable:**

This approach is the simplest and often sufficient for controlling which GPU is used. Before launching your Python script, set the environment variable using your operating system's command line.  Replace `0` with the index of your desired GPU.  Remember to check your system's GPU configuration (e.g., using `nvidia-smi`) to identify the correct index.

```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python your_tensorflow_script.py
```

This command tells TensorFlow to only consider GPU 0.  Any attempt to utilize other GPUs within `your_tensorflow_script.py` will result in an error or default to CPU execution.  This method is especially useful for quick testing and deploying to environments where programmatic control is less convenient. I've employed this frequently for rapid prototyping and debugging on my personal workstation with multiple GPUs.


**Example 2: Programmatic Device Placement using `tf.device`:**

This offers more precise control, allowing you to specify the GPU for individual operations or parts of your graph.  This is essential when dealing with models requiring distribution across multiple GPUs or when optimizing resource allocation within a complex computational graph.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Specify the GPU device
gpu_device = '/GPU:0' # Replace 0 with the desired GPU index

with tf.device(gpu_device):
    # Create your TensorFlow operations here.
    a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
    b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)

    # Perform other operations

    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        result = sess.run(c)
        print(result)
```

This code snippet explicitly places the matrix multiplication operation (`tf.matmul`) on GPU 0.  The `tf.device` context manager ensures that all operations within its scope are executed on the specified device.  Note the use of `tf.compat.v1.Session` which might be necessary depending on your TensorFlow version;  this code is compatible with older versions where `tf.Session` was used.  In newer versions you can use `tf.function` for improved performance and more automatic device placement.


**Example 3:  Handling Potential GPU Unavailability with Error Handling:**

Robust code should gracefully handle scenarios where the specified GPU might be unavailable.  This involves checking for GPU availability before attempting operations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpu_device = '/GPU:0'

try:
    with tf.device(gpu_device):
        # TensorFlow operations
        a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0])
        b = tf.constant([3.0, 4.0])
        c = tf.add(a, b)
        with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
            result = sess.run(c)
            print(f"Result on {gpu_device}: {result}")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error: Could not access {gpu_device}: {e}")
    # Fallback to CPU or alternative handling
    with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
        # Perform operations on CPU
        c = tf.add(a,b)
        with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
            result = sess.run(c)
            print(f"Fallback to CPU: {result}")
```

This example includes error handling to catch `RuntimeError` exceptions that might occur if the specified GPU is unavailable (e.g., due to driver issues or resource conflicts). It then falls back to using the CPU.  This is crucial for production systems where unexpected errors should be gracefully managed.  During my work on a large-scale recommendation system, this error handling proved invaluable in preventing unexpected crashes.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For more in-depth understanding of TensorFlow's device management, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, particularly the sections on GPU usage and device placement.  Furthermore, exploring advanced topics like multi-GPU strategies (e.g., using `tf.distribute.Strategy`) will prove beneficial for scaling your models.  Finally, reading about CUDA programming and NVIDIA's cuDNN library will provide valuable context on GPU-accelerated computations.  Reviewing examples in official TensorFlow tutorials and community-contributed code samples is also highly recommended.  These resources provide deeper insights into managing GPU resources effectively, which is fundamental for optimizing TensorFlow performance.
