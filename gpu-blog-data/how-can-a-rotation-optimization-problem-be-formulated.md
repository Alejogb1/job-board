Rotation optimization is frequently encountered in computer vision and robotics, often requiring efficient and robust solutions.  My experience working on spacecraft attitude determination systems highlighted the limitations of simpler iterative methods for handling noisy sensor data and the need for a more sophisticated approach.  Ceres Solver, with its robust nonlinear least-squares capabilities, provides a powerful framework for tackling this precisely.  The core concept lies in formulating the rotation optimization as a minimization problem, where the cost function represents the error between observed and predicted measurements, and the optimization variables are the rotation parameters.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The essence of formulating a rotation optimization problem for Ceres Solver involves defining a cost function that quantifies the discrepancy between measured data and a model parameterized by a rotation. This cost function is then minimized using Ceres's robust optimization algorithms.  The choice of rotation representation significantly impacts the problem's formulation and solver efficiency.  Common representations include rotation matrices, quaternions, and Euler angles, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.  Quaternions are generally preferred due to their compactness, avoidance of gimbal lock, and efficient manipulation within the Ceres framework.

A typical cost function might involve comparing the rotated version of a point or vector with its corresponding measured counterpart. For example, consider a scenario involving point correspondences between two coordinate frames. We have a set of 3D points {**p**<sub>i</sub>} in one frame and their corresponding points {**q**<sub>i</sub>} in another frame.  The goal is to estimate the rotation **R** that aligns these point sets optimally. The cost function for a single point pair could be defined as:

`cost = || **q**<sub>i</sub> - **R** **p**<sub>i</sub> ||Â²`

This represents the squared Euclidean distance between the measured point **q**<sub>i</sub> and the rotated point **R** **p**<sub>i</sub>.  The overall cost function would then be the sum of squared errors across all point pairs.  This sum-of-squares structure is particularly amenable to Ceres Solver's least-squares minimization capabilities.  However, for robust outlier rejection, one could employ a more sophisticated cost function, such as a robust loss function (e.g., Huber loss, Tukey loss) to mitigate the influence of erroneous measurements.

Ceres Solver requires defining the cost function and its Jacobian (the matrix of partial derivatives).  The Jacobian describes how changes in the rotation parameters affect the cost function, guiding the optimization process.  Analytic Jacobians, derived mathematically, are generally preferred for efficiency. However, Ceres also supports automatic differentiation, a valuable feature for complex cost functions where manual derivation is cumbersome or error-prone.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Rotation using Quaternions and Automatic Differentiation:**

```c++
#include <ceres/ceres.h>
#include <ceres/rotation.h>

struct RotationError {
  RotationError(const Eigen::Vector3d& p, const Eigen::Vector3d& q) : p_(p), q_(q) {}

  template <typename T>
  bool operator()(const T* quaternion, T* residuals) const {
    T q[4];
    q[0] = quaternion[0];
    q[1] = quaternion[1];
    q[2] = quaternion[2];
    q[3] = quaternion[3];

    Eigen::Map<const Eigen::Quaternion<T>> quat(q);
    Eigen::Map<Eigen::Vector3<T>> residual(residuals);
    residual = quat * p_.cast<T>() - q_.cast<T>();
    return true;
  }

 private:
  Eigen::Vector3d p_;
  Eigen::Vector3d q_;
};

int main() {
  // ... (Point data initialization) ...

  ceres::Problem problem;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < point_pairs.size(); ++i) {
    ceres::CostFunction* cost_function =
        new ceres::AutoDiffCostFunction<RotationError, 3, 4>(
            new RotationError(point_pairs[i].first, point_pairs[i].second));
    problem.AddResidualBlock(cost_function, nullptr, quaternion);
  }

  // ... (Solver options and solving) ...
  return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward implementation using automatic differentiation.  The `RotationError` struct defines the cost function, leveraging Eigen for vector and quaternion manipulation.  `ceres::AutoDiffCostFunction` automatically computes the Jacobian.


**Example 2:  Rotation with Huber Loss for Robustness:**

```c++
#include <ceres/ceres.h>
#include <ceres/rotation.h>

// ... (RotationError struct as before) ...

int main() {
  // ... (Point data initialization) ...

  ceres::Problem problem;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < point_pairs.size(); ++i) {
    ceres::CostFunction* cost_function =
        new ceres::AutoDiffCostFunction<RotationError, 3, 4>(
            new RotationError(point_pairs[i].first, point_pairs[i].second));
    problem.AddResidualBlock(cost_function, new ceres::HuberLoss(1.0), quaternion);
  }

  // ... (Solver options and solving) ...
  return 0;
}
```

This modification incorporates a `ceres::HuberLoss` function. This makes the solution more robust to outliers compared to the previous example. The `1.0` parameter controls the Huber loss function's sensitivity.


**Example 3:  Manual Jacobian Calculation for Efficiency:**

```c++
#include <ceres/ceres.h>
#include <ceres/rotation.h>

struct RotationError {
  // ... (Constructor as before) ...

  template <typename T>
  bool operator()(const T* quaternion, T* residuals, T* jacobians) const {
    // ... (Quaternion multiplication and residual calculation as before) ...

    // ... (Manual Jacobian calculation using derivative formulas) ...
    return true;
  }
  // ... (Private members as before) ...
};

int main() {
  // ... (Point data initialization) ...

  ceres::Problem problem;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < point_pairs.size(); ++i) {
    ceres::CostFunction* cost_function =
        new ceres::DynamicAutoDiffCostFunction<RotationError>(new RotationError(point_pairs[i].first, point_pairs[i].second));
        cost_function->AddParameterBlock(4);
        cost_function->SetNumResiduals(3);
    problem.AddResidualBlock(cost_function, nullptr, quaternion);
  }
  // ... (Solver options and solving) ...
  return 0;
}
```

This example showcases manual Jacobian calculation for improved efficiency, especially beneficial for computationally expensive cost functions. Note the use of `ceres::DynamicAutoDiffCostFunction` which allows for flexible number of parameters and residuals. The Jacobian calculation itself (omitted for brevity) would involve applying the chain rule to the quaternion multiplication and residual calculation.  This requires a thorough understanding of quaternion derivatives.
