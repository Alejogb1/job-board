The prevalence of sparse tensors in PyTorch stems directly from the computational advantages they offer when dealing with high-dimensional data containing a significant number of zero-valued elements.  My experience working on large-scale recommender systems solidified this understanding.  Processing dense matrices representing user-item interactions, where the majority of entries signify a lack of interaction (and thus are zero), quickly becomes computationally infeasible without leveraging sparse representations.  PyTorch's `SparseTensor` class provides a mechanism to efficiently store and manipulate this type of data, avoiding the overhead associated with storing and processing numerous zero values.  This efficiency translates directly to reduced memory consumption and faster computation times, critical for many machine learning applications.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

A sparse tensor is a data structure optimized for tensors where the majority of elements are zero.  Unlike dense tensors, which store every element, sparse tensors only store the non-zero elements and their corresponding indices. This drastically reduces memory usage, particularly beneficial when dealing with high-dimensional data prevalent in natural language processing, graph neural networks, and recommender systems, among others.  The storage format typically employed involves three arrays: one for the values of the non-zero elements, and two others representing their row and column indices (or higher-dimensional equivalents).  PyTorch's `SparseTensor` class encapsulates this efficient representation and provides methods for efficient operations like matrix multiplication, addition, and other tensor manipulations adapted for sparse data.  Failing to utilize this structure when appropriate can lead to significant performance bottlenecks and memory errors, especially when working with datasets exceeding available RAM.

The choice of sparse tensor representation within PyTorch is not arbitrary.  Different sparse formats exist, each with its own trade-offs regarding storage efficiency and computational cost.  PyTorch’s implementation likely reflects a carefully considered balance between these factors.  For instance, the Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) or Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) formats are common choices, offering good trade-offs for certain operations.  PyTorch's internal representation might employ one of these or a variation optimized for its internal workings and hardware acceleration.  This internal implementation detail is generally abstracted away from the user, allowing for a consistent interface regardless of the underlying storage format.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Creating and manipulating a SparseTensor:**

```python
import torch

# Create a sparse tensor from a dense tensor
dense_tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 3]])
sparse_tensor = torch.sparse_coo_tensor(dense_tensor.nonzero(), dense_tensor.nonzero().flatten(), dense_tensor.shape)

# Accessing values (requires converting to dense format for non-zero element value access)
dense_representation = sparse_tensor.to_dense()
print(f"Dense representation:\n{dense_representation}")

# Performing basic operations
sparse_tensor_2 = torch.sparse_coo_tensor([[0, 1], [1, 0]], [4, 5], [2, 2])
result = torch.sparse.add(sparse_tensor, sparse_tensor_2)
print(f"Result of addition:\n{result.to_dense()}")

```

This example demonstrates the creation of a `SparseTensor` from a dense tensor and showcases basic operations. Note the conversion to dense format to access individual element values.  The direct manipulation of indices and values within the sparse representation is less intuitive and often unnecessary for common operations.  The `torch.sparse` module is key for handling these tensors.


**Example 2:  Sparse matrix multiplication:**

```python
import torch

# Define two sparse matrices
sparse_matrix_A = torch.sparse_coo_tensor([[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]], [1, 2, 3], [3, 3])
sparse_matrix_B = torch.sparse_coo_tensor([[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]], [4, 5, 6], [3, 3])

# Perform sparse matrix multiplication
result = torch.sparse.mm(sparse_matrix_A, sparse_matrix_B)

print(f"Result of sparse matrix multiplication:\n{result.to_dense()}")

```

This example highlights a crucial advantage: efficient multiplication of sparse matrices.  Directly multiplying dense equivalents would involve many unnecessary multiplications with zero, leading to significant performance degradation.  `torch.sparse.mm` optimizes this operation for sparse inputs.


**Example 3:  Handling large-scale data:**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np

# Simulate large sparse data (avoiding actual creation due to memory constraints)
num_rows = 100000
num_cols = 50000
num_non_zeros = 1000000 # only 0.02% of the data is non-zero

# Generate random indices for non-zero elements
row_indices = np.random.randint(0, num_rows, num_non_zeros)
col_indices = np.random.randint(0, num_cols, num_non_zeros)
values = np.random.rand(num_non_zeros)

#Create sparse tensor
large_sparse_tensor = torch.sparse_coo_tensor(torch.LongTensor([row_indices, col_indices]), torch.FloatTensor(values), [num_rows, num_cols])

#Further processing (demonstrative purposes only –  actual operations dependent on the task)
#Example: compute sum of non-zero elements
sum_of_non_zeros = large_sparse_tensor.sum()
print(f"Sum of non-zero elements: {sum_of_non_zeros}")

```
This example simulates the creation and manipulation of a significantly larger sparse tensor.  The focus is on demonstrating how `SparseTensor` allows for handling datasets that would be impractical with dense representations.  Generating the actual data isn't done due to memory limitations but shows how sparse tensors are essential for handling such scenarios.  The specific operations performed would depend on the application.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation on sparse tensors provides a comprehensive guide.  Thorough study of linear algebra, especially concerning sparse matrix operations, is highly beneficial.  Any textbook on advanced linear algebra or numerical computation would be suitable. A book dedicated to large-scale data processing and efficient algorithms is invaluable.  Familiarity with data structures and algorithms is crucial for understanding the underpinnings of sparse tensor representations and their efficiency.
