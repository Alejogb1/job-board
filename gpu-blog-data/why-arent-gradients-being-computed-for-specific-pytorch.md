The absence of computed gradients for specific PyTorch variables typically stems from one of two primary sources:  the variable's `requires_grad` attribute being set to `False`, or a disruption in the computational graph's connectivity.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on large-scale neural network training, particularly when employing techniques like weight sharing or conditional computation within custom layers.  Let's examine the underlying mechanisms and solutions.

**1.  `requires_grad` Attribute:**

The core of PyTorch's automatic differentiation lies in its ability to track operations performed on tensors.  Each tensor possesses a `requires_grad` attribute, a boolean flag indicating whether gradients should be computed for it during backpropagation.  If this flag is `False`, PyTorch will bypass the tensor during gradient calculation, resulting in a zero gradient or, more subtly, a disconnect in the computation graph.  This is a common cause of missing gradients, often inadvertently introduced when creating or manipulating tensors.

**2. Computational Graph Disconnections:**

PyTorch constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the sequence of operations. Gradients are computed via backpropagation, traversing this graph from the loss function back to the input variables.  A disconnect in this graph, often due to operations that detach tensors from the computational graph, prevents gradient flow to specific variables.  This can happen through explicit detachment using functions like `torch.no_grad()` or implicit detachment arising from certain operations or data types.  These detachments can be unintentional, particularly in complex model architectures.


**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Incorrect `requires_grad` Setting:**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=False) # Crucial error: requires_grad=False
y = x + 2
z = y * y
z.backward()

print(x.grad)  # Output: None, gradients won't be computed for x

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True) #Corrected
y = x + 2
z = y * y
z.backward()

print(x.grad) # Output: tensor([4., 8., 12.])
```

In the first part of this example, the `requires_grad` attribute is explicitly set to `False` for `x`. This prevents the computation of gradients with respect to `x` during backpropagation, hence `x.grad` remains `None`.  The corrected section demonstrates that setting `requires_grad=True` enables gradient computation.  This simple example highlights the critical role of this attribute.


**Example 2:  `torch.no_grad()` Context Manager:**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x + 2

with torch.no_grad():  # Detachment within this block
    z = y * y

z.backward()

print(x.grad) # Output: None. Gradient flow is disrupted.

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x + 2
z = y * y
z.backward()

print(x.grad) # Output: tensor([4., 8., 12.])

```

Here, the `torch.no_grad()` context manager temporarily disables gradient tracking.  Any operations within this block are performed without affecting the computation graph, leading to a disconnect and preventing gradient computation for `x`.  Removing the context manager restores gradient computation. This situation is subtle, and requires careful attention to code flow, especially within complex custom layers or training loops.



**Example 3:  In-place Operations and Gradient Accumulation:**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x.clone() # Create a copy to avoid in-place operations
y.add_(2)  # Equivalent to y = y + 2, but potentially disrupts gradient flow in some situations.

z = y * y
z.backward()
print(x.grad) # Output: likely None or unexpected values if add_ is problematic.

x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x + 2
z = y * y
z.backward()

print(x.grad) # Output: tensor([4., 8., 12.])
```

While not always the cause, in-place operations (`+=`, `-=`, etc.) using methods ending with an underscore (`_`) can sometimes interfere with gradient accumulation, particularly when combined with specific optimizers or custom autograd functions.  Though technically allowed, they often introduce complexities best avoided for clarity and reliable gradient computation.  The corrected section replaces the in-place addition with a standard addition operation, which avoids these potential complications.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation, focusing on the sections on automatic differentiation and computational graphs.  Further exploration into the source code of PyTorch's autograd engine will illuminate the intricacies of gradient computation.  Finally, reviewing advanced tutorials on implementing custom autograd functions can provide valuable insights into the complexities of managing gradients in non-standard scenarios.  Understanding these concepts will resolve most gradient computation issues.  The key is to meticulously trace the flow of your tensors and ensure that `requires_grad` flags are correctly set, and in-place operations are used judiciously, if at all.
