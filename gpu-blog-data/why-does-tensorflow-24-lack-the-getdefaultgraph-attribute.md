TensorFlow 2.x's removal of `tf.get_default_graph()` is a fundamental shift driven by the eager execution paradigm.  My experience migrating large-scale production models from TensorFlow 1.x to 2.x highlighted this change as a crucial architectural difference.  The implicit global graph management inherent in TensorFlow 1.x, reliant on `tf.get_default_graph()`, is intentionally absent in TensorFlow 2.x to promote a more intuitive, Pythonic workflow.  This wasn't simply a matter of code cleanup; it represents a paradigm shift towards improved performance and debugging capabilities.

**1. Explanation: The Eager Execution Paradigm**

TensorFlow 1.x operated primarily in a graph-building mode.  Operations were defined, forming a computational graph that was then executed.  `tf.get_default_graph()` provided access to this globally defined graph, allowing developers to manipulate operations and tensors within it.  This approach, while powerful, introduced complexities, especially in debugging and managing concurrent graph constructions within a single Python session.  The implicit graph management often led to unexpected behavior, particularly in multi-threaded environments.

TensorFlow 2.x, by contrast, prioritizes *eager execution*.  Operations are executed immediately upon definition, mirroring standard Python execution flow.  This eliminates the need for an explicit global graph, drastically simplifying the development process and enhancing debugging capabilities.  While some operations still construct graphs under the hood (especially with `tf.function`), the explicit management of a global graph is removed.  This change simplifies the mental model for developers accustomed to standard Python and removes a frequent source of subtle bugs.

The removal of `tf.get_default_graph()` is directly tied to this shift. In eager execution, there's no default graph waiting to be retrieved; operations are executed immediately, and their results are immediately available.  Attempting to use `tf.get_default_graph()` in TensorFlow 2.x results in an error, accurately reflecting the absence of a global graph structure.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate the differences in how graph construction and execution were handled in TensorFlow 1.x and how they're addressed in TensorFlow 2.x.

**Example 1: TensorFlow 1.x (Graph Mode)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1.x
sess = tf.Session()
with sess.as_default():
    a = tf.constant(5)
    b = tf.constant(10)
    c = tf.add(a, b)
    print(sess.run(c)) # Output: 15

    # Accessing the graph
    graph = tf.get_default_graph()
    print(graph) # Prints the default graph object
    sess.close()

```

This example showcases the typical TensorFlow 1.x workflow.  A session is explicitly created, and the graph is implicitly managed. `tf.get_default_graph()` provides access to this graph, allowing inspection or manipulation.  Note the explicit session management and the reliance on `sess.run()` for execution.


**Example 2: TensorFlow 2.x (Eager Execution)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 2.x (Eager Execution)
tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution() # Disabling Eager Execution for comparison only.  Generally not recommended
a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(10)
c = tf.add(a, b)
print(c) # Tensor("Add:0", shape=(), dtype=int32)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(c)) # Output: 15

# Attempting to access the graph (will raise an error in true eager mode)
# graph = tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph()  # Commenting this out to avoid error
# print(graph)

tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph()
```

Here, we illustrate that directly printing 'c' does not give the result 15, but the tensor object itself. This is because eager execution evaluates the result immediately. The session is only needed to display the result in this mode.  Attempting to retrieve the default graph (`tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph()`) would be deprecated in TensorFlow 2.x and is typically omitted.  Note the comment that removes the problematic call, since, in true eager mode, it would raise an error.  The `tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()` line is included for illustrative purposes only;  it disables eager execution to demonstrate a near-equivalent to the 1.x example and should be avoided in typical TensorFlow 2.x workflows.  `tf.compat.v1.reset_default_graph()` is also a remnant of TensorFlow 1.x and would not be necessary in a pure eager context.


**Example 3: TensorFlow 2.x with `tf.function`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def my_function(x, y):
  return x + y

a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(10)
c = my_function(a, b)
print(c) # Output: tf.Tensor(15, shape=(), dtype=int32)

#  No graph retrieval needed or possible in this context.
```

This showcases how graph-like behavior can be achieved in TensorFlow 2.x using `tf.function`.  The function is compiled into a graph, improving performance for repeated calls.  However, there's no global graph; the graph is associated with the specific `tf.function`.  Accessing a "default graph" remains unnecessary and inappropriate.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the guides on eager execution and `tf.function`, should be consulted.  Further, reviewing materials on the architectural changes between TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x, specifically regarding session management and graph construction, will provide a deeper understanding of the motivation behind the removal of `tf.get_default_graph()`.  Examining examples and tutorials that demonstrate TensorFlow 2.x best practices with eager execution will solidify the understanding.  Finally, books and online courses focusing on TensorFlow 2.x and its best practices are valuable for practical experience.
