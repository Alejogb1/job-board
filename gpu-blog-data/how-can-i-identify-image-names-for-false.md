The core challenge in identifying image names associated with false positives and false negatives lies in the inherent ambiguity of the term "false."  It presupposes a ground truth, a definitive labeling against which the model's predictions are compared.  Without a precisely defined ground truth dataset, pinpointing the specific images responsible for these classification errors becomes highly problematic.  In my experience building robust image classification systems for medical diagnostics, this issue is paramount and requires a careful, multi-step approach.

**1. Ground Truth Establishment and Error Analysis:**

The first, and often most overlooked, step is establishing a reliable ground truth.  This necessitates a meticulous annotation process involving domain experts.  For example, in my work with radiological images, experienced radiologists reviewed and labeled images to create a gold standard against which our deep learning modelâ€™s predictions were measured.  Simple agreement amongst annotators isn't sufficient; robust inter-rater reliability metrics (e.g., Cohen's Kappa) should be used to gauge the consistency of the annotation process and identify potential ambiguities within the annotation guidelines themselves.  Inconsistencies in ground truth directly translate to uncertainty in identifying false positives and negatives.

Once a reliable ground truth is established, a comparative analysis between the model's predictions and the ground truth labels is essential.  This analysis should go beyond simple accuracy metrics.  Confusion matrices provide a visual representation of the model's performance, highlighting the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.  Furthermore, calculating precision and recall for each class within the classification problem provides a more granular understanding of the model's performance on different categories.  Low precision indicates a high rate of false positives, while low recall signifies a high rate of false negatives.

This analysis often identifies classes with disproportionately high false positive or false negative rates.  This information serves as a valuable starting point for investigating specific images contributing to these errors.

**2. Code Examples for Error Identification:**

Let's illustrate this with Python code, focusing on extracting image names associated with misclassifications.  I'll assume the existence of a prediction array (`predictions`) and a ground truth array (`ground_truth`), both containing numerical class labels corresponding to the images in a directory.  I'll further assume that `image_names` is a list of strings representing image file names.

**Example 1: Identifying False Positives:**

```python
import numpy as np

def find_false_positives(predictions, ground_truth, image_names, class_label):
    """Identifies images incorrectly classified as a specific class (false positives)."""
    false_positives = []
    for i, (pred, gt) in enumerate(zip(predictions, ground_truth)):
        if pred == class_label and gt != class_label:
            false_positives.append((image_names[i], pred, gt))
    return false_positives

#Example Usage
predictions = np.array([1, 0, 1, 0, 1])
ground_truth = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1])
image_names = ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg", "image4.jpg", "image5.jpg"]
fp = find_false_positives(predictions, ground_truth, image_names, 1)
print(fp) #Output will be list of tuples (image name, predicted label, actual label) for class label 1.
```

This function iterates through predictions and ground truth, identifying instances where the model predicted a specific class (`class_label`), but the actual label was different. The function returns a list of tuples, each containing the image name and its predicted and actual labels.


**Example 2: Identifying False Negatives:**

```python
import numpy as np

def find_false_negatives(predictions, ground_truth, image_names, class_label):
    """Identifies images incorrectly classified as NOT belonging to a specific class (false negatives)."""
    false_negatives = []
    for i, (pred, gt) in enumerate(zip(predictions, ground_truth)):
        if pred != class_label and gt == class_label:
            false_negatives.append((image_names[i], pred, gt))
    return false_negatives

# Example Usage (same as above, but different function)
fn = find_false_negatives(predictions, ground_truth, image_names, 1)
print(fn) # Output will be list of tuples (image name, predicted label, actual label) for class label 1.
```

This function is analogous to the previous one but targets false negatives by identifying instances where the model failed to predict the correct class (`class_label`).


**Example 3: Visualization using Matplotlib:**

For a more visual approach,  Matplotlib can be used to display the images associated with false positives and negatives.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg

def visualize_errors(false_positives, image_dir):
    """Displays images associated with false positives."""
    for image_name, pred, gt in false_positives:
        img = mpimg.imread(image_dir + "/" + image_name)
        plt.imshow(img)
        plt.title(f"Image: {image_name}, Predicted: {pred}, Actual: {gt}")
        plt.show()

# Example Usage (assuming image_dir contains the images)
visualize_errors(fp, "path/to/images")
```

This function takes the output from `find_false_positives` (or `find_false_negatives`) and uses Matplotlib to display each misclassified image along with its predicted and actual labels.  This provides a visual context for understanding the model's errors.  Similar visualization can be adapted for false negatives using `fn`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of these concepts, I recommend consulting texts on machine learning and pattern recognition.  Specifically, delve into chapters covering model evaluation metrics, confusion matrices, and techniques for analyzing classification errors.  Exploring resources dedicated to deep learning frameworks (like TensorFlow or PyTorch) will provide further practical insights into building and evaluating image classification models.  Finally, reviewing publications on specific application areas (like medical imaging) will highlight best practices and challenges in handling false positives and negatives within a specific domain.  Understanding the nuances of the application area is critical to interpreting the results of your model evaluation and identifying the root causes of errors.  These resources will provide a comprehensive foundation for addressing the challenges of identifying and understanding image classification errors.
