Implementing LSTM layers with multiple cells in PyTorch involves a nuanced understanding of the underlying architecture and how PyTorch's `nn.LSTM` module handles sequence processing.  My experience developing time-series forecasting models for financial applications has highlighted the crucial distinction between multiple *cells* within a single LSTM layer and stacking multiple LSTM layers sequentially.  The question frequently conflates these concepts.  A single LSTM layer inherently processes the input sequence with a fixed number of hidden units, often referred to as cells, operating in parallel at each time step.  Stacking layers, on the other hand, creates a deeper network where the output of one layer feeds into the next.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `nn.LSTM` module in PyTorch expects an input tensor of shape (seq_len, batch_size, input_size).  The `input_size` parameter determines the dimensionality of the input at each time step.  The `hidden_size` parameter defines the number of cells (hidden units) within the LSTM layer. This `hidden_size` dictates the dimensionality of the hidden state (h) and cell state (c), both of which have a shape of (num_layers * num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size). The `num_layers` parameter controls the depth of the network, stacking multiple LSTM layers. `num_directions` specifies whether to use a bidirectional LSTM (2) or a unidirectional LSTM (1). Therefore, increasing the `hidden_size` parameter increases the number of cells *within* a single LSTM layer, whereas increasing `num_layers` adds further LSTM layers to the network.

It's crucial to avoid misinterpreting the term "cells."  Each cell within a layer is a self-contained recurrent unit performing computations independently, but they share the same input at each time step.  Increasing the number of cells doesn't imply a sequential processing of the input within the layer itself; rather, it expands the computational capacity of the layer to learn more complex representations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Single LSTM Layer with Multiple Cells:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

input_size = 3  # Dimensionality of input features
hidden_size = 128 # Number of cells within the LSTM layer
num_layers = 1 # Single LSTM layer
seq_len = 100 # Length of input sequence
batch_size = 64 # Batch size

lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
input_seq = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, input_size)

output, (hn, cn) = lstm(input_seq)

# output shape: (batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)
# hn shape: (num_layers * num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)
# cn shape: (num_layers * num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)

print(output.shape)
print(hn.shape)
print(cn.shape)
```

This example demonstrates a single LSTM layer with 128 cells.  The `hidden_size` parameter directly controls this. The output tensor reflects the hidden state at each time step, which has dimensionality equal to `hidden_size`.


**Example 2: Stacked LSTM Layers with Multiple Cells:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

input_size = 3
hidden_size = 64 # Cells per layer
num_layers = 2 # Two stacked LSTM layers
seq_len = 100
batch_size = 64

lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
input_seq = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, input_size)

output, (hn, cn) = lstm(input_seq)

# output shape: (batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)
# hn shape: (num_layers * num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)
# cn shape: (num_layers * num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size)

print(output.shape)
print(hn.shape)
print(cn.shape)
```

This example showcases two stacked LSTM layers, each with 64 cells.  Notice that the final output still has a `hidden_size` of 64.  The stacking increases the network's representational power; the information flow is sequential through the layers.


**Example 3:  LSTM with Different Hidden Sizes per Layer (Advanced):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

input_size = 3
hidden_sizes = [64, 128]  # Different hidden sizes for each layer
num_layers = len(hidden_sizes)
seq_len = 100
batch_size = 64

lstm_layers = []
lstm_layers.append(nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_sizes[0], 1, batch_first=True))
for i in range(num_layers - 1):
    lstm_layers.append(nn.LSTM(hidden_sizes[i], hidden_sizes[i+1], 1, batch_first=True))

lstm_model = nn.ModuleList(lstm_layers)
input_seq = torch.randn(batch_size, seq_len, input_size)
output = input_seq
for lstm_layer in lstm_model:
  output, _ = lstm_layer(output)

# output shape: (batch_size, seq_len, hidden_sizes[-1])

print(output.shape)
```

This demonstrates a more complex architecture where each LSTM layer can have a different number of hidden units, showcasing flexibility in network design.  This example requires careful management of the input and output shapes across different layers.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* PyTorch documentation on the `nn.LSTM` module.
* A comprehensive textbook on deep learning (covering recurrent neural networks in detail).
* Research papers on LSTM architectures and applications.


In conclusion, the key to implementing LSTM layers with multiple "cells" (hidden units) in PyTorch is understanding and appropriately manipulating the `hidden_size` parameter within the `nn.LSTM` module. Increasing `hidden_size` increases computational capacity within a single layer, while stacking layers through `num_layers` constructs a deeper network with sequential information flow.  Carefully consider the architecture's complexity when designing models involving multiple layers and cells to achieve the desired level of representation power and avoid overfitting.  Remember to select appropriate hyperparameters through experimentation and validation on relevant datasets.
