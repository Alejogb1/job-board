PyTorch, being a framework for tensor manipulation, doesn’t inherently provide a direct output constraint to only the integers 0, 1, and 2.  Instead, this behavior must be achieved programmatically, typically during or immediately after the forward pass of a neural network. My own experience involves developing classification networks, and I regularly encounter the need to limit output ranges and convert to categorical values. Several techniques are available, each with its advantages and disadvantages in terms of performance and the specific problem context.

The most fundamental approach involves applying an activation function followed by a discretization step.  Given a continuous-valued output from a network, we need to map it to our target set {0, 1, 2}.  Common activation choices include ReLU, which forces values to be non-negative, though it does not directly restrict them to our desired integers. Similarly, Sigmoid maps values between 0 and 1. Therefore, simple activation function alone is insufficient. Post-activation steps are crucial. One such step is rounding combined with a clamping or flooring operation.

To clarify, the process usually goes like this: The neural network produces an output tensor, which typically has float values. This tensor is passed through an activation function (e.g., ReLU). Then we take these continuous outputs, round them to the nearest integer, and subsequently clamp these integers to lie within the desired range of [0, 2] using the `torch.clamp` function. Clamping is important because rounding alone could produce values outside the allowed range, especially given initial random weights. Alternatively, if the neural network produces a scalar output (in the sense of a single number instead of a tensor), a simple comparison operation to set it to 0, 1, or 2 based on threshold is possible. Finally, if the final layer of your network is set up to output three values, each value can be treated as the logit of each class. One can then use argmax function to get a class value between 0, 1 and 2.

Here are three code examples to illustrate these approaches:

**Example 1: Rounding and Clamping Post-ReLU**

This example assumes that a previous network layer has produced a tensor with values that need to be constrained. We will perform a ReLU activation (for non-negative values) and then round, finally clamping the resultant values.

```python
import torch

def constrain_output_relu_clamp(output_tensor):
    """Constrains the output tensor to 0, 1, or 2 after ReLU."""
    relu_output = torch.relu(output_tensor) # ensure values are positive or zero.
    rounded_output = torch.round(relu_output)  #Round to nearest integers.
    clamped_output = torch.clamp(rounded_output, min=0, max=2) #Clamp to specified range.
    return clamped_output

#Example Usage
output = torch.tensor([[-2.5, 0.5, 3.1], [0.1, 1.8, 5.4]]) #Sample Tensor
constrained_output = constrain_output_relu_clamp(output)
print(constrained_output)

#Output: tensor([[0., 1., 2.], [0., 2., 2.]])
```

In this first example, I explicitly demonstrated rounding and then clamping the output to the [0, 2] range.  ReLU ensures that negative values become zero before rounding.  This method is relatively straightforward, but note that gradient information may be lost as a result of rounding.

**Example 2: Thresholding a Scalar Output**

This example assumes the neural network produces a single (scalar) floating-point value as output, which will be converted to a class label based on predefined thresholds.

```python
import torch

def constrain_scalar_output(scalar_output, thresholds = [0.5,1.5]):
    """Constrains a scalar output to 0, 1, or 2 based on thresholds."""
    if scalar_output < thresholds[0]:
        return torch.tensor(0)
    elif scalar_output < thresholds[1]:
        return torch.tensor(1)
    else:
        return torch.tensor(2)

# Example Usage
scalar_output_val = torch.tensor(1.1)
constrained_scalar_output = constrain_scalar_output(scalar_output_val)
print(constrained_scalar_output)

#Output: tensor(1)
scalar_output_val = torch.tensor(2.8)
constrained_scalar_output = constrain_scalar_output(scalar_output_val)
print(constrained_scalar_output)
#Output: tensor(2)
scalar_output_val = torch.tensor(0.2)
constrained_scalar_output = constrain_scalar_output(scalar_output_val)
print(constrained_scalar_output)
#Output: tensor(0)
```

Here, I used a series of comparisons to assign a 0, 1, or 2 to the scalar output, which is suitable when the network directly outputs a single value that can be categorized. This method is simple to understand and implement, but it isn’t suitable for multi-dimensional output tensors. This is suitable if the network is specifically set up to provide a scalar output representing your desired discrete value via implicit modeling.

**Example 3: Using Argmax on Logits**

In this example, it's assumed the final layer of the network outputs three logits (pre-probabilities) which can be interpreted as scores for the classes 0, 1, and 2. The argmax function then identifies the class with the highest score.

```python
import torch
def constrain_logits_output(logits):
  """Converts logits to class labels 0, 1, or 2 using argmax."""
  return torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)

# Example usage
logits_output = torch.tensor([[1.2, 3.4, 0.5], [-0.2, 2.1, 0.8]])
constrained_logits_output = constrain_logits_output(logits_output)
print(constrained_logits_output)
#Output: tensor([1, 1])
logits_output = torch.tensor([[10.2, 3.4, 0.5], [-0.2, 2.1, 5.8]])
constrained_logits_output = constrain_logits_output(logits_output)
print(constrained_logits_output)
#Output: tensor([0, 2])

```

This approach uses the `torch.argmax` function to convert logits to the class with highest score. This method is useful in classification scenarios where the network is explicitly learning probabilities. The key here is having the output layer of your model producing three outputs (logits), one for each class. `argmax` then transforms these logits into the respective class indices (0, 1, or 2). Note, this method directly selects a single output from the three, instead of forcing a continuous output into a set.

Choosing the appropriate method depends on the details of the task and how the neural network is configured.  When dealing with a classification task, the logits based approach is frequently employed. Post-processing is most appropriate for a regressive neural network. Scalar output works best if your model learns to produce a single value which implicitly represents your desired integer.

For further understanding of these and similar topics, the official PyTorch documentation is the best starting point. Additional resources include books on deep learning using PyTorch, and research articles related to discrete output spaces in neural networks. Consider consulting books on “Deep Learning with PyTorch” and "Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning". Exploring publications from venues such as NeurIPS, ICML and ICLR focusing on discrete latent variable models and similar approaches, can provide more advanced techniques for handling discrete outputs in the context of neural network design. The documentation from PyTorch itself contains the most up to date information about the functions and tensors, and is crucial for all PyTorch projects.
