TensorFlow's utilization of the CPU instead of the intended GPU, despite a designated GPU configuration, often stems from a cascading series of environment and configuration mismatches, rather than a single, glaring fault. Over several projects involving large-scale image processing and deep learning, I've encountered several common points where this issue arises. Understanding the interaction between TensorFlow, CUDA, and the system's drivers is paramount to resolving this.

The primary culprit is typically an incorrect or incomplete CUDA toolkit installation and configuration. TensorFlow, especially versions built before TensorFlow 2.10, relies heavily on CUDA and cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) for GPU acceleration. If these libraries are not present, incorrectly installed, or mismatched with the installed TensorFlow version, the program will silently fall back to the CPU. There is no explicit error that states "CUDA not found"; rather, TensorFlow just defaults to CPU execution. Furthermore, the version of CUDA and cuDNN must be specifically compatible with the TensorFlow version used. TensorFlow typically specifies a limited range of compatible CUDA and cuDNN versions on its official website. Failing to adhere to this versioning requirement is the most common error leading to CPU fallback.

Another crucial aspect is the proper driver installation for the specific GPU. A generic graphics driver provided by the operating system is usually sufficient for displaying basic graphics, but it lacks the necessary CUDA APIs that TensorFlow requires. Therefore, installing the correct NVIDIA driver for the particular GPU model is a prerequisite. Moreover, having multiple NVIDIA drivers, especially older ones, can cause conflicts and hinder TensorFlow from recognizing the GPU. A clean install with only the correct driver is vital.

Further complexity arises from TensorFlow's internal device placement logic. Even if CUDA is correctly installed, TensorFlow may still opt for the CPU if the code hasn't explicitly specified the use of a GPU device. When working in a multi-GPU environment, it is especially important to target specific GPUs to avoid resource contention and CPU fallback. TensorFlow utilizes a specific naming convention for GPUs, often expressed as `/device:GPU:0`, `/device:GPU:1`, and so on. This explicit identification is necessary for the system to recognize and utilize the desired GPU.

Let's examine three code examples that illustrate common pitfalls and their solutions. The first example demonstrates how TensorFlow typically selects a device without explicit configuration, leading to CPU use when CUDA isn't properly setup.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# This is a simple operation to check device placement
a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], name='a')
b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], name='b')
c = a + b

# Print the device assigned to each tensor
print(f"Tensor 'a' is located on: {a.device}")
print(f"Tensor 'b' is located on: {b.device}")
print(f"Tensor 'c' is located on: {c.device}")

# Run the operation to see the device in use
with tf.Session() as sess:
  result = sess.run(c)
  print(f"Result: {result}")
```

This example, when executed with an improperly configured CUDA environment, usually shows the tensors as being placed on the CPU, identified as something like `/device:CPU:0`. The simple addition will still execute, just not using GPU acceleration. The output would show a placement on `CPU:0`, even if a GPU is present.

Now let's look at how to explicitly specify a GPU. Here's an example showing how to use the TensorFlow device placement mechanism to force an operation onto a designated GPU:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Manually set device to GPU:0. Assume only one GPU is present
with tf.device('/device:GPU:0'):
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], name='a')
    b = tf.constant([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], name='b')
    c = a + b

print(f"Tensor 'a' is located on: {a.device}")
print(f"Tensor 'b' is located on: {b.device}")
print(f"Tensor 'c' is located on: {c.device}")


with tf.Session() as sess:
  result = sess.run(c)
  print(f"Result: {result}")
```
By placing the tensor creation and operation within a `tf.device` context manager, I'm explicitly telling TensorFlow to use the first GPU found. This would, under proper environment configuration, output `/device:GPU:0` for the tensor placements, demonstrating that the code is correctly utilizing the GPU. If no GPU is detected, TensorFlow will raise an error indicating that no such device exists. It is paramount that CUDA and the correct drivers are in place for this code to run without throwing a device error and successfully using GPU acceleration.

Lastly, hereâ€™s an example that shows how to verify that TensorFlow has recognized any GPUs on the system, which can be a diagnostic measure.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')

if gpus:
  print("GPUs are available:")
  for gpu in gpus:
     print(gpu)
  # Enable GPU usage on demand, avoid pre-allocating all memory
  tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[0], True) #use first GPU
else:
  print("No GPUs are available.")
```
This example checks the available GPU devices and prints them. When the output lists a GPU device, it is a positive indication that the system and TensorFlow setup are correctly identifying the GPU. If 'No GPUs are available' is output, then the previous reasons should be investigated. The `tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth` function in this example sets the memory allocation policy to only use the minimum required GPU memory as needed. This prevents TensorFlow from claiming all GPU memory upon initialisation, leading to potential conflicts with other processes on the same GPU. This is a good practice to avoid memory overflow.

To summarize, diagnosing and resolving issues related to CPU instead of GPU usage in TensorFlow often involves a methodical examination of the installed software components and TensorFlow configuration. Correct CUDA and cuDNN installations that match the installed TensorFlow version, paired with the correct NVIDIA graphics drivers are paramount to preventing this. Additionally, using TensorFlow's explicit device placement mechanisms is crucial to force operations onto a designated GPU. Verifying the available devices before any operation to diagnose issues is a good habit.

For more information and guidance, I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation. The CUDA toolkit and cuDNN documentation from NVIDIA provides in depth instructions for installation and specific version compatibility. These resources, while not providing direct solutions for any single problem, give you all the relevant information to establish a functional GPU processing environment. Furthermore, exploring the NVIDIA developer website can be extremely useful as it contains further resources such as driver details, troubleshooting articles and a user forum.
