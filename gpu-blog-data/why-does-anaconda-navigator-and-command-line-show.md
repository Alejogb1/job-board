The discrepancy between the TensorFlow version reported by Anaconda Navigator and the command line stems from differing environment activation states.  Anaconda Navigator operates within its own context, often displaying the TensorFlow version associated with the base environment or a specific environment if explicitly selected within its interface. The command line, however, reflects the TensorFlow version active in the currently activated conda environment.  This difference, frequently observed during project development, underscores the importance of meticulous environment management.  My experience working on large-scale machine learning projects, particularly those involving distributed TensorFlow deployments, has highlighted the critical need for understanding and controlling these environment specifics.

**1.  Explanation of the Discrepancy**

Anaconda Navigator provides a graphical user interface for managing conda environments.  It presents a user-friendly overview of installed packages within each environment. However, it doesn't inherently activate an environment; it simply displays its contents.  Conversely, the command line relies on the `conda activate` command to activate a specific environment.  Activating an environment modifies the system's PATH variable, making the executables and libraries within that environment accessible.  Therefore, when you run `python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"` on the command line, Python executes the TensorFlow version found within the *currently activated* environment.  If no environment is activated, it defaults to the base environment.  If the base environment and a separate environment (e.g., one dedicated to a specific TensorFlow version) contain different TensorFlow installations, you'll see a disparity between the Navigator's display and the command line output.

This is not a bug, but a feature reflecting Anaconda's environment management philosophy.  By separating environment management (Navigator) from environment activation (command line), Anaconda provides a more granular control over the development process. This enables simultaneous management of multiple projects with potentially conflicting dependency versions without affecting one another.  This design choice, while subtle, is crucial for avoiding dependency conflicts and maintaining project reproducibility.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

**Example 1: Confirming the Base Environment Version**

```python
import sys
import subprocess

try:
    process = subprocess.run(['conda', 'env', 'list'], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
    print("Currently active conda environments:\n", process.stdout)
    process = subprocess.run(['python', '-c', 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)'], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
    print("\nTensorFlow version in base (or currently active) environment:", process.stdout.strip())
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    print("TensorFlow is not installed in the current environment.")

```

This script uses `subprocess` to interact with the command line. It first lists all conda environments to verify which one is active.  Then, it runs the `python` command to print the TensorFlow version.  The `try-except` block handles potential errors like the absence of TensorFlow or conda command failure. This robust approach is essential in automated scripts or CI/CD pipelines.

**Example 2: Activating a Specific Environment**

```bash
conda activate tensorflow_env  # Replace tensorflow_env with your environment name
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
conda deactivate
```

This demonstrates explicitly activating a named environment (`tensorflow_env`) before checking the TensorFlow version.  The `conda deactivate` command is crucial for returning to the previous environment, preventing confusion in subsequent operations.  Always remember to deactivate when finished to avoid unintentional use of the wrong environment. Consistent use of activation/deactivation is paramount for reproducibility and project stability.

**Example 3:  Creating and Using an Environment with a Specific TensorFlow Version**

```bash
conda create -n tf_specific_version python=3.9 tensorflow==2.10.0  # Specify Python version and TensorFlow version
conda activate tf_specific_version
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
conda deactivate
```

This example highlights the creation of a new environment (`tf_specific_version`) with a precisely specified TensorFlow version (2.10.0 in this case). This approach is recommended when precise version control is required to avoid compatibility issues.  This is particularly important for collaborative projects, ensuring all team members work with the same versioned dependencies.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

Consult the official Anaconda documentation for detailed explanations of environment management.  Review the TensorFlow documentation for version-specific installation instructions and compatibility notes.  Familiarize yourself with the conda command line interface, focusing on environment creation, activation, deactivation, and package management commands.  Explore the use of `environment.yml` files for reproducible environment configurations.  Understanding these resources is vital for effectively managing multiple projects with diverse dependencies.  Proficient use of these tools is key to avoiding the common pitfalls of dependency conflicts and version mismatches.  This is particularly relevant when integrating TensorFlow into broader software projects.  In my own experience, mastery of these techniques substantially reduced the debugging time spent resolving environment-related conflicts. Through diligent application of these principles,  I have streamlined my workflow significantly, enhancing productivity and reliability.
