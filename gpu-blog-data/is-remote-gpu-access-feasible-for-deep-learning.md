Remote GPU access for deep learning tasks, while offering considerable flexibility, introduces complexities not typically encountered with local GPU setups. The core challenge lies in optimizing data transfer and communication latency between the remote GPU server and the client machine, particularly when dealing with the large datasets and iterative model training prevalent in deep learning. Iâ€™ve spent the last five years navigating these issues as part of a distributed research team, and the experience makes it clear that while feature-parity with a local GPU is not guaranteed, close approximations are achievable with careful planning.

Fundamentally, the viability of remote GPU access rests on the network's bandwidth and latency characteristics, along with the efficiency of the chosen remote access mechanisms. A local GPU directly accesses system memory via high-speed buses (e.g., PCIe), which provide extremely low latency and high bandwidth. This direct access allows for rapid data loading and model updates, crucial for the iterative nature of deep learning workflows. Remote access, on the other hand, introduces an intermediary: the network. Even with high-speed connections, the network's physical limitations impose delays, particularly during large batch data transfers for training. Therefore, the practical feasibility hinges on minimizing these delays and optimizing for remote execution.

There are primarily two approaches for accessing remote GPUs: directly using remote shell access and executing computations via a remote server, or using a remote execution platform that encapsulates the remote execution environment. In both scenarios, the primary goal is to minimize network interactions by doing as much processing as possible remotely.

In the direct remote access paradigm, I use SSH or similar protocols to connect to a server, transferring the necessary data, and executing the learning task. This method provides flexibility but can be cumbersome when dealing with complex environments or frequent model iterations. Here is an example demonstrating a common use case:

```python
import subprocess

# Set remote server details.
SERVER_ADDRESS = "user@remote_server_ip"
REMOTE_PATH = "/path/to/your/remote/project"
LOCAL_PATH = "/path/to/your/local/project"

# Rsync to sync local to remote.
rsync_command = f"rsync -avz {LOCAL_PATH} {SERVER_ADDRESS}:{REMOTE_PATH}"
subprocess.run(rsync_command, shell=True, check=True)

# Form the command for remote execution.
remote_command = f"ssh {SERVER_ADDRESS} 'cd {REMOTE_PATH} && python train.py'"

# Execute remotely.
subprocess.run(remote_command, shell=True, check=True)
```

This Python script exemplifies a workflow to execute the `train.py` script on a remote server, after synchronizing the local project folder using `rsync`. The `subprocess.run` calls are used to manage the command execution and ensure that any errors during the execution on the remote server are captured for better handling. Crucially, the python script encapsulates two key operations: copying the data to the remote location, and then executing the training on the remote machine. It is critical to execute the training operation on the remote machine, avoiding large data transfer when performing gradient descent, for example.

The second approach uses a remote execution platform, such as TensorFlow Serving, SageMaker, or similar services, which often abstract away the complexities of direct remote execution. These platforms offer features like load balancing, resource management, and model deployment. Here's a simplified conceptual example using TensorFlow Serving:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow_serving.apis import predict_pb2
from tensorflow_serving.apis import prediction_service_pb2_grpc
import grpc

# Configure the server address and stub.
SERVER_ADDRESS = 'localhost:8500' # Replace with your serving address
channel = grpc.insecure_channel(SERVER_ADDRESS)
stub = prediction_service_pb2_grpc.PredictionServiceStub(channel)


def predict_data(data_input):
    # Create prediction request.
    request = predict_pb2.PredictRequest()
    request.model_spec.name = 'your_model_name' #Replace with your model name
    request.model_spec.signature_name = 'serving_default'

    # Prepare input tensors.
    input_tensor = tf.make_tensor_proto(data_input, dtype=tf.float32)
    request.inputs['input_name'].CopyFrom(input_tensor) # Replace with your input tensor name

    # Call the prediction API.
    result = stub.Predict(request, timeout=10.0)
    
    # Process prediction result
    output_tensor = tf.make_ndarray(result.outputs['output_name']) # Replace with your output tensor name
    return output_tensor
    
# Example usage.
input_data = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] # Example input
prediction = predict_data(input_data)
print("prediction:", prediction)
```

In this example, I am sending inference queries to a TensorFlow Serving instance. The client code does not require knowledge of the underlying training architecture or the location of the model. This is an advantage when deploying trained models. A crucial benefit is avoiding large data transfer, as the model is already loaded on the server and inference only sends the necessary input and receives the output.

However, if remote training is required on such a platform, the system would likely need a managed environment that automatically syncs code and data, similar to the `rsync` approach above, but handled internally by the platform. The following example builds on the previous one, and conceptually outlines how to request a remote training job on such a platform:

```python
import json
import requests
# Define the remote training endpoint
REMOTE_ENDPOINT = "http://remote-platform.com/train" #Replace with training endpoint

# Set up training configuration
training_config = {
    "model_name": "my_new_model",
    "dataset_location": "s3://your/bucket/dataset.csv",
    "training_script": "train.py",
    "hyperparameters": {"epochs": 20, "batch_size": 64}
}
# Send the request to start the training job.
response = requests.post(REMOTE_ENDPOINT, json=training_config)
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("training initiated successfully, job id", response.json()["job_id"])
else:
    print("training initiation failed with", response.status_code, response.text)

# Further logic to monitor progress of the remote job can be added
```
This example shows how a platform could be abstracted by REST API, where the training job is initiated by specifying the model name, the data, the script, and the hyperparameters, with minimal local setup required by the client. The `requests.post` performs the remote execution call, offloading the training to a managed server.

The feasibility of remote GPU access also depends heavily on dataset sizes. I often find myself relying on cloud-based object storage solutions, which are coupled with the remote computation resources. This allows for data to reside closer to the GPU, minimizing data transfer over the network and alleviating bottlenecks associated with constantly transferring large datasets. Another strategy is pre-processing the data on the remote server or utilizing data compression techniques before transferring it, further reducing network load and transfer time.

In summary, achieving comparable performance to a local GPU requires a robust network infrastructure, efficient data management strategies, and optimized remote execution techniques. Remote access might not completely mirror the responsiveness and immediacy of a local GPU setup due to inherent network latency, however, with careful planning and utilization of the appropriate technologies, remote GPU access becomes not only feasible but also a cost-effective and scalable approach for deep learning tasks, particularly when access to specialized hardware resources is necessary for complex projects.

For further study on network optimizations, consult resources on distributed systems and networking concepts like TCP/IP, RDMA, and network caching. Books and publications that cover deep learning at scale, including discussions on various cloud platform features, are valuable resources for designing and implementing such solutions. Publications from academic groups that specialize in high performance computing and distributed training are also useful for staying at the cutting edge of these research areas.
