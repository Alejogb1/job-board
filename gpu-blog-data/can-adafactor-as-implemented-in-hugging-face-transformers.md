Adafactor's adaptive learning rate mechanism, specifically its decomposition of the update into a row-wise and a column-wise component, isn't inherently constrained by model architecture. It's a drop-in replacement for other optimizers like Adam or SGD in many frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers, which is where my experience primarily lies. I've spent the last two years fine-tuning various models for time-series anomaly detection using transformers, and a substantial portion of that involved experimenting with different optimizers. My observation is that while Adafactor *can* technically be used with ResNet and MAML architectures, the practical implications and performance considerations demand a more nuanced understanding.

The core compatibility lies in how optimizers interface with model gradients during backpropagation. All models, regardless of their internal structure, produce gradients with respect to their trainable parameters. Adafactor, in turn, utilizes these gradients to adjust the learning rates for each parameter. The implementation within Hugging Face's `transformers` library adheres to this general principle, allowing seamless substitution for an existing optimizer. Thus, at a fundamental programming level, Adafactor is compatible with any model that produces gradients.

However, simply plugging Adafactor into ResNet or MAML doesn’t guarantee superior performance, or even stable training. ResNet, known for its skip connections and convolutional layers, often benefits from momentum-based optimizers, such as AdamW. Adafactor’s characteristic per-parameter learning rate decomposition, specifically its lack of momentum, can sometimes lead to oscillations during training of deep CNNs like ResNet. While it may eventually converge, the path to convergence might be longer or more erratic. I have witnessed this first-hand when switching from AdamW to Adafactor for image classification tasks using ResNet-based backbones, observing initially higher validation loss fluctuations before eventual, sometimes marginal, gains.

MAML, or Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, introduces further complexity. It trains models to be meta-learners, enabling them to quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal data. MAML fundamentally involves two phases: an inner loop update for adapting to a specific task, and an outer loop update that refines the meta-learner’s parameters. Adafactor can be used within both loops. However, the nuances of meta-learning, specifically the need for precise control over inner loop updates, might make using Adafactor tricky. Adafactor's decaying learning rate might interfere with the inner loop adaptation process by not providing a consistent learning rate for tasks with differing magnitudes of update. This inconsistency could degrade the meta-learner’s ability to quickly adjust to new tasks and even hinder the stability of meta-training itself. In my experience, the convergence of meta-learning algorithms can be particularly susceptible to the choice of optimizer, particularly the specific behaviour of any optimizer's adaptive learning rate.

Let’s look at specific code examples using `transformers`. For ResNet, imagine a scenario using a pre-trained ResNet from the `torchvision` library that I’ve adapted for a sequence modeling task. We can show how to instantiate Adafactor.

```python
import torch
import torchvision.models as models
from transformers import Adafactor
from torch import nn

# Assume 'resnet_model' is initialized with a ResNet model.
resnet_model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Modifying the output to match a task. Imagine using a sequence output.
num_classes = 10
resnet_model.fc = nn.Linear(resnet_model.fc.in_features, num_classes)


# Instantiate Adafactor using the model's parameters.
optimizer = Adafactor(
    resnet_model.parameters(),
    scale_parameter=True,
    relative_step=False,
    warmup_init=False,
    lr=0.001
)

# Sample usage for training, where 'outputs' is a loss value
# outputs = model(inputs)
# loss = loss_fn(outputs, labels)
# loss.backward()
# optimizer.step()
# optimizer.zero_grad()
```

In this snippet, `Adafactor` is initialized with `resnet_model.parameters()`. This demonstrates the direct substitutability of Adafactor. The `scale_parameter`, `relative_step`, and `warmup_init` arguments are specific to Adafactor, and require careful tuning depending on the specific task and model. I’ve observed that `scale_parameter=True` can often help with initial convergence in situations where learning rates need to adjust more rapidly, particularly with pre-trained parameters. The `lr` setting would require experimentation, as I’ve generally found smaller initial learning rates are often advisable when employing Adafactor compared to Adam variants. `relative_step=False` is a default, while sometimes using `relative_step=True` can yield better results when the training dataset is not very large.

For MAML, using Adafactor requires specifying separate optimizers for the inner and outer loops. This makes it more complex, and again highlights the potential issues with Adafactor's inherent decaying learning rate. Here is a highly simplified example. I have encountered similar structure during some of my research into applying MAML-based meta-learning to time series forecasting models:

```python
import torch
from torch import optim
from torch.nn import Linear, Module # Assume other modules are defined elsewhere


class MetaLearner(Module):

    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
      super().__init__()
      self.lin1 = Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
      self.lin2 = Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.lin1(x)
        return self.lin2(x)

# Sample usage assuming model, loss_fn, tasks, and adaptation data are defined elsewhere
meta_model = MetaLearner(input_dim=5, hidden_dim=10, output_dim=1)
inner_lr = 0.01
outer_lr = 0.001
# Inner optimizer is not Adagrad in this example, but is still used as a reference
inner_optimizer = optim.SGD(meta_model.parameters(), lr=inner_lr)
outer_optimizer = Adafactor(meta_model.parameters(), lr=outer_lr)


num_inner_steps = 5

for task in tasks: # Pseudo-code for MAML training
    # Clone parameters to be used for inner loop optimization
    params = [p.clone() for p in meta_model.parameters()]
    for step in range(num_inner_steps):
        # Calculate inner loop loss
        adapted_outputs = meta_model(task["adaptation_data_inputs"])
        loss = loss_fn(adapted_outputs, task["adaptation_data_labels"])

        # Update inner loop parameters
        inner_optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        inner_optimizer.step()

    # Calculate the outer loop loss. This usually utilizes different set of data from the tasks
    # Get outer loop loss
    query_outputs = meta_model(task["query_data_inputs"])
    outer_loss = loss_fn(query_outputs, task["query_data_labels"])
    outer_optimizer.zero_grad()
    outer_loss.backward()
    outer_optimizer.step()

```
In this simplified example, we see that the inner loop can be using an SGD optimizer, and Adafactor optimizer is used for meta updates. A key consideration is that the `inner_optimizer` and `outer_optimizer` interact with the same meta-model parameters. The outer loop update, facilitated by Adafactor, adjusts the meta-model based on the inner loop performance across different tasks. I want to emphasize that this example is deliberately simplified. It shows how Adafactor can be part of the meta-optimization process.

A final important example, demonstrating a possible, *incorrect* and common approach to using optimizers with Meta-learning frameworks, is shown below. Here the parameters of the model are directly mutated during the inner loop, and the outer loop is optimized against the same parameters. This will break the back propagation process.

```python
import torch
from torch import optim
from torch.nn import Linear, Module # Assume other modules are defined elsewhere

class MetaLearner(Module):

    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
      super().__init__()
      self.lin1 = Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
      self.lin2 = Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.lin1(x)
        return self.lin2(x)

# Sample usage assuming model, loss_fn, tasks, and adaptation data are defined elsewhere
meta_model = MetaLearner(input_dim=5, hidden_dim=10, output_dim=1)
inner_lr = 0.01
outer_lr = 0.001

inner_optimizer = optim.SGD(meta_model.parameters(), lr=inner_lr)
outer_optimizer = Adafactor(meta_model.parameters(), lr=outer_lr)


num_inner_steps = 5

for task in tasks: # Pseudo-code for MAML training
    # Inner loop with incorrect parameter modifications
    for step in range(num_inner_steps):
        adapted_outputs = meta_model(task["adaptation_data_inputs"])
        loss = loss_fn(adapted_outputs, task["adaptation_data_labels"])
        inner_optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        inner_optimizer.step()

    # Outer loop is then optimized against the modified parameters
    query_outputs = meta_model(task["query_data_inputs"])
    outer_loss = loss_fn(query_outputs, task["query_data_labels"])
    outer_optimizer.zero_grad()
    outer_loss.backward()
    outer_optimizer.step()
```

Here, the critical mistake is not creating a copy of the meta-model parameters before the inner-loop updates. The inner loop directly modifies the `meta_model` parameters, and the outer loop is effectively optimizing based on parameters that have been "pre-updated". This results in a loss of proper gradient tracking and breaks the underlying MAML algorithm, and is an example of poor practice in this kind of situation. Using this approach, the MAML algorithm would be very unlikely to converge.

In summary, Adafactor can be technically used with ResNet and MAML architectures within the Hugging Face Transformers ecosystem. However, its lack of momentum compared to, say, AdamW, may necessitate careful tuning and experimentation. For ResNet, consider that AdamW or similar optimizers are often better suited out-of-the-box. For MAML, the potential inconsistencies of learning rate decay of Adafactor within inner-loop optimizations may require more careful selection of learning rates and the number of inner loop optimization steps. For further information, research into topics such as "optimization algorithms", and "meta-learning" will be very useful. Also, studying and reproducing the results of recent papers published in AI/ML conferences on applying optimization to specific architectures will help solidify your understanding. Finally, the documentation of any deep learning framework you are using, such as pytorch and transformers, will be vital to your success.
