Memory access patterns significantly impact GPU performance, a crucial fact often overlooked when porting CPU-centric code. Improper memory handling can negate the benefits of parallel processing by creating bottlenecks, turning what should be a speedup into a significant slowdown. I have personally encountered this many times, particularly when transitioning from numerical analysis libraries optimized for serial execution to parallel GPU-based implementations. Ensuring code execution on the GPU instead of the CPU requires careful management of both computational tasks and data movement.

The core principle involves offloading computations to the GPU's parallel processing architecture. This typically entails defining the code that will execute on the GPU, known as a 'kernel,' and moving the necessary data to the GPU's dedicated memory. Execution on the GPU is not automatic; it requires specific library calls and careful data management. Commonly, this is achieved using libraries such as CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs or OpenCL for a broader range of devices, including both GPUs and CPUs. Iâ€™ve found that direct programming against these APIs offers the most control, but higher-level abstractions such as libraries wrapping these offer ease of use, albeit potentially at the cost of some performance optimization flexibility. When working with tensor operations, frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch also internally manage this transfer, allowing users to write primarily in Python or similar higher level languages.

To begin, one must select an appropriate framework or library. For this response, I'll focus on a CUDA-based example. CUDA provides a C/C++ API for writing GPU kernels. The process is generally as follows: allocate memory on the GPU, transfer input data from host (CPU) memory to the allocated GPU memory, launch the kernel which operates on the data residing on the GPU, transfer result data from the GPU memory back to the host memory, and finally, free the allocated GPU memory.

The following C++ code outlines a simple vector addition operation, where two input vectors of equal size are added element-wise, and the result is stored in a third vector. This illustrates the typical steps: host allocation, data transfer to the device, kernel launch and execution, data transfer back to the host and deallocation.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// CUDA kernel
__global__ void vectorAdd(float *a, float *b, float *c, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}

int main() {
  int size = 1024;
  size_t byteSize = size * sizeof(float);

  // 1. Host memory allocation and initialization
  float *h_a = new float[size];
  float *h_b = new float[size];
  float *h_c = new float[size];
  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    h_a[i] = static_cast<float>(i);
    h_b[i] = static_cast<float>(i * 2);
  }

  // 2. Device memory allocation
  float *d_a, *d_b, *d_c;
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_a, byteSize);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_b, byteSize);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_c, byteSize);

  // 3. Host to Device data transfer
  cudaMemcpy(d_a, h_a, byteSize, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
  cudaMemcpy(d_b, h_b, byteSize, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

  // 4. Kernel launch
  int threadsPerBlock = 256;
  int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
  vectorAdd<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, size);
  cudaDeviceSynchronize(); // Wait for kernel to complete

  // 5. Device to Host data transfer
  cudaMemcpy(h_c, d_c, byteSize, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

  // 6. Verification and Cleanup
  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    if (h_c[i] != h_a[i] + h_b[i]) {
        std::cerr << "Error at index " << i << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
  }
  std::cout << "Vector addition successful" << std::endl;

  //7. Free device memory
  cudaFree(d_a);
  cudaFree(d_b);
  cudaFree(d_c);

  //8. Free host memory
  delete[] h_a;
  delete[] h_b;
  delete[] h_c;

  return 0;
}
```

In this example, `__global__` denotes that `vectorAdd` is a kernel function executed on the GPU. `blockIdx.x`, `blockDim.x`, and `threadIdx.x` provide unique coordinates for each parallel thread, enabling each thread to compute a portion of the overall task. `cudaMalloc` is used for allocating memory on the GPU, `cudaMemcpy` handles data transfer between CPU and GPU memories, and `cudaFree` releases the GPU allocated memory. The number of blocks and threads determines the degree of parallelism and needs to be carefully set to optimize performance. `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` ensures that all GPU operations finish before the results are copied back to the host. It's crucial to handle CUDA error codes, usually using `cudaGetLastError()`, for robust production code, but this was omitted for brevity.

Moving to a more high-level approach, consider the same task using Python with PyTorch. PyTorch uses CUDA behind the scenes for GPU calculations. This example will also allocate memory on the GPU.

```python
import torch

size = 1024

# 1. Create tensor on the CPU
h_a = torch.arange(size, dtype=torch.float)
h_b = torch.arange(size, dtype=torch.float) * 2

# 2. Move tensors to the GPU
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    d_a = h_a.to(device)
    d_b = h_b.to(device)
    # 3. Perform operation on GPU
    d_c = d_a + d_b
    # 4. Move result to CPU
    h_c = d_c.to(torch.device("cpu"))
else:
    print("CUDA not available, using CPU")
    h_c = h_a+h_b

# 5. Verification
if torch.all(h_c == h_a + h_b):
    print("Vector addition successful")
else:
    print("Error in vector addition.")
```

Here, `torch.cuda.is_available()` checks for GPU support. `to(device)` transfers the tensor to the device (CPU or GPU), and element-wise addition is done implicitly using the overloaded `+` operator. The benefit here is the simplicity of the code compared to the CUDA example, but the user has less explicit control. Furthermore, PyTorch will utilize the GPU transparently if available, without requiring the user to specify kernel details. However, under the hood, it is still executing highly-optimized GPU kernels.

Finally, Tensorflow offers very similar capabilities. This example will mirror the previous PyTorch example, with only minor syntactic differences.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

size = 1024

# 1. Create tensor on the CPU
h_a = tf.range(size, dtype=tf.float32)
h_b = tf.range(size, dtype=tf.float32) * 2

# 2. Move tensors to the GPU
if tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'):
    device = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')[0]
    with tf.device(device.name):
      d_a = tf.identity(h_a)
      d_b = tf.identity(h_b)
      # 3. Perform operation on GPU
      d_c = d_a + d_b
      # 4. Move result to CPU
      h_c = d_c.numpy()
else:
    print("GPU not available, using CPU")
    h_c = (h_a + h_b).numpy()

# 5. Verification
if (h_c == (h_a + h_b).numpy()).all():
    print("Vector addition successful")
else:
    print("Error in vector addition.")

```

The crucial point to note here is the utilization of `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` to verify GPU availability and the `with tf.device(device.name):` context manager to direct computation to the GPU device.  `tf.identity` is used to force the tensors to be created within the device scope. Unlike PyTorch, there's no `to(device)` method; instead, TensorFlow utilizes the device context manager for this purpose. Tensor operations are then executed on the GPU transparently. The `.numpy()` call is needed to return data to the host as a NumPy array. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch benefit from an extensive ecosystem of optimized kernels and functions, simplifying development.

For further study, I would recommend exploring books covering CUDA programming, such as the "CUDA Programming: A Developer's Guide to Parallel Computing with GPUs" by Shane Cook, or the official CUDA documentation for in-depth understanding. For higher-level usage of frameworks, the official PyTorch and TensorFlow websites provide exceptional tutorials and documentation that I have used extensively over the past several years for both research and development projects. Furthermore, papers on GPU optimization techniques, while not directly coding tutorials, provide useful insight into memory access strategies which will aid in performance debugging. These theoretical underpinnings aid in understanding *why* certain approaches lead to performance improvements. While a robust understanding of the underlying architectures might not always be necessary for basic usage of these frameworks, it is crucial when optimizing code for performance. Ignoring the underlying architecture of the GPU can easily lead to inefficient and slower than CPU code.
