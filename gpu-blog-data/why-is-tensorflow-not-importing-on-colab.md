TensorFlow import failures in Google Colab typically stem from environment inconsistencies, specifically conflicting package versions or missing dependencies.  My experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous projects, involving both eager execution and TensorFlow 2.x deployments, indicates that the root cause is rarely a fundamental system problem.  Instead, it usually involves a misconfiguration within the Colab environment's Python interpreter and its associated package management.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The Colab environment provides a virtual machine (VM) instance with a pre-configured Python environment. While convenient, this pre-configuration isn't always aligned with the specific TensorFlow version and associated library requirements of a given project.  This discrepancy is the most common source of import errors.  TensorFlow relies on several supporting packages, including NumPy, CUDA (if using GPU acceleration), and possibly others depending on specific TensorFlow features utilized (e.g., TensorFlow Datasets, TensorFlow Hub).  If these dependencies are missing, incompatible, or improperly installed, TensorFlow will fail to import.  Furthermore, Colab's runtime environments are ephemeral; restarting the runtime effectively resets the environment to its initial state, obliterating any custom package installations performed during a previous session.

Another potential cause is the simultaneous presence of multiple TensorFlow installations – perhaps via different package managers (pip, conda) – leading to version conflicts.  The Python interpreter can't determine which TensorFlow installation to prioritize, resulting in an import failure.  Finally, while less frequent, a corrupted Colab runtime can contribute to the issue. This scenario often manifests as broader system problems beyond just the TensorFlow import.

The systematic approach I've developed involves verifying the environment's integrity and explicitly managing dependencies using a consistent package manager.  This approach eliminates ambiguity and improves reproducibility across different Colab sessions.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Verifying Installation and Dependencies Using `pip`**

```python
!pip show tensorflow  # Checks if TensorFlow is installed and displays its version and other details

!pip list | grep numpy  # Checks if NumPy is installed; crucial for TensorFlow

!pip freeze > requirements.txt  # Saves a snapshot of all installed packages for reproducibility

try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
    print("TensorFlow imported successfully.")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"TensorFlow import failed: {e}")
    #  At this point, troubleshoot missing dependencies based on the error message.
    #  Common solutions include: !pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```

This example first uses shell commands within Colab (prefixed with `!`) to examine the installed packages.  `pip show tensorflow` provides detailed information about the TensorFlow installation, while `pip list | grep numpy` checks for NumPy.  Capturing the current environment's package list into `requirements.txt` is crucial for later recreation of this precise environment. The `try-except` block attempts TensorFlow's import and gracefully handles failures, providing informative error messages for easier debugging.

**Example 2:  Resolving Version Conflicts with a Virtual Environment (venv)**

```python
!python3 -m venv tf_env  # Creates a virtual environment named 'tf_env'

!source tf_env/bin/activate  # Activates the virtual environment

!pip install tensorflow==2.11.0  # Installs a specific TensorFlow version

try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
    print("TensorFlow imported successfully within the virtual environment.")
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"TensorFlow import failed: {e}")
    # Inspect the error message for detailed information about the failure.
```

This approach tackles version conflicts by utilizing Python's built-in `venv` module to create an isolated virtual environment.  Installing TensorFlow within this environment ensures that it doesn't clash with any globally installed packages, resolving potential conflicts.  The specified version (`2.11.0`) can be replaced with the required TensorFlow version.


**Example 3:  Handling GPU Acceleration (CUDA)**

```python
!apt-get update -qq
!apt-get install libcusparse10-10 libcudnn8-dev -y

# Install TensorFlow with GPU support.  The specific package name might vary
# depending on the TensorFlow version. Check TensorFlow's documentation for
# the appropriate package.
!pip install tensorflow-gpu

try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
    print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"TensorFlow import failed: {e}")
    # Check GPU availability and CUDA/cuDNN versions using Colab's system information.
```

This example addresses GPU-related issues.  It begins by updating the system packages, then installs essential CUDA libraries (`libcusparse10-10`, `libcudnn8-dev`).  It then proceeds to install the GPU-enabled TensorFlow package. The code subsequently checks for GPU availability using TensorFlow's built-in functions.  This verifies the successful installation and configuration of TensorFlow with GPU support.  Note that the specific CUDA and cuDNN versions should be checked against TensorFlow's compatibility guidelines.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation; the Google Colab documentation; a comprehensive Python package management guide;  a tutorial on Python virtual environments.  These resources provide in-depth information about TensorFlow installation, Colab's environment management, and Python package management best practices.  They are invaluable for resolving complex issues and mastering the intricacies of setting up TensorFlow within Colab.  Thoroughly reviewing error messages, exploring relevant stack overflow posts, and understanding the interplay between system packages, Python packages, and the Colab environment is crucial for successfully resolving import failures.
