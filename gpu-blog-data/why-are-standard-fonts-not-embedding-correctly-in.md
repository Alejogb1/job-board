The core issue with font embedding in QPdfWriter within Qt 6.0.0, as I've experienced, stems from a subtle change in the underlying font handling mechanism compared to earlier Qt versions.  While Qt 5 often relied on system-level font configuration and implicit embedding behavior, Qt 6 emphasizes explicit font management and requires more direct intervention to guarantee correct font embedding in generated PDF documents.  This is particularly evident when dealing with standard system fonts, where the absence of explicit embedding instructions leads to fallback mechanisms that often result in incorrect or missing fonts in the final PDF.  This isn't a bug, per se, but a consequence of the architectural shift towards a more robust and portable font rendering pipeline.


My experience, working on a large-scale document generation application using Qt, highlighted this transition. Initially, upgrading to Qt 6.0.0 resulted in significant PDF generation failures; documents rendered with default system fonts showed missing or substituted glyphs, rendering text illegible.  After extensive debugging and testing, the solution centered on explicitly embedding fonts within the QPdfWriter's context using Qt's font and document handling functionalities.

The correct approach involves three key steps: font identification, font selection, and explicit embedding instructions during PDF generation. Let's examine this process with concrete examples.


**1.  Font Identification and Selection:**

This stage involves accurately identifying the target font and ensuring it's available within the application's environment. We need to obtain the font family name correctly, as minor variations can lead to discrepancies.  Using `QFontDatabase` is crucial for this.


```cpp
#include <QFontDatabase>
#include <QFont>
#include <QDebug>

// ... within your function ...

QFontDatabase db;
QStringList fonts = db.families();
QString targetFontName = "Times New Roman"; // Or any other standard font name

bool fontFound = false;
for (const QString& font : fonts) {
    if (font.compare(targetFontName, Qt::CaseInsensitive) == 0) {
        fontFound = true;
        break;
    }
}

if (!fontFound) {
    qDebug() << "Error: Target font not found!";
    // Handle the error appropriately – perhaps use a fallback font.
    return;
}

QFont targetFont(targetFontName);
```


This code snippet iterates through available font families.  Crucially, it performs a case-insensitive comparison to account for potential inconsistencies between the font's actual name and the name we expect.  Error handling is essential, preventing silent failures which are far more difficult to diagnose.  Remember to replace `"Times New Roman"` with the actual name of the font you intend to use.  Checking `QFontDatabase::isBitmapFont(QFontDatabase::addApplicationFontFromData(...))` can ensure the font isn't a bitmap font, which generally doesn't embed well.



**2.  Setting the Font in QPdfWriter:**

Once the font is identified,  it must be explicitly selected for the QPdfWriter. This is not implicit; simply having the font available in the system is insufficient.



```cpp
#include <QPdfWriter>
#include <QPainter>

// ... continued from previous example ...

QPdfWriter pdfWriter("output.pdf");
pdfWriter.setPageSize(QPagedPaintDevice::A4); // Or your desired page size

QPainter painter(&pdfWriter);
painter.setFont(targetFont); // Explicitly set the font.  Crucial for embedding.
painter.drawText(100, 100, "This text should use the embedded font.");
painter.end();
```


Here, `painter.setFont(targetFont)` is paramount. This explicitly instructs the painter to use the `targetFont` for rendering, making it highly likely to be embedded.  The lack of this instruction was the source of my initial problems.


**3.  Advanced Embedding Techniques (For Specific Needs):**

In situations demanding fine-grained control, such as embedding only specific subsets of a font, or handling complex OpenType features, direct manipulation of font data might be required.  This typically involves using lower-level APIs that provide access to font data streams.



```cpp
#include <QPdfWriter>
#include <QPainter>
#include <QDataStream> // For advanced font handling

// ... more complex scenario... (Illustrative, requires further research based on specific font and embedding needs)

// Assume 'fontData' holds the font data as QByteArray obtained through platform-specific APIs.

QPdfWriter pdfWriter("output.pdf");
// ... other settings ...

// (This section is illustrative and may require adjustments based on PDF library specifics)
pdfWriter.insertFont(fontData, "MyCustomFont"); // Hypothetical function – check QPdfWriter documentation
// ... use the font 'MyCustomFont' within the painter ...
```

This advanced example highlights the necessity for detailed examination of font data and the potential need to utilize platform-specific functionalities (beyond the scope of standard Qt).  Direct manipulation of font data often requires a deep understanding of font formats (like TrueType or OpenType) and the target PDF library's capabilities for font embedding.  This is less common but essential in edge cases where font subsetting is needed to minimize file size or to embed custom font subsets.



**Resource Recommendations:**

Qt documentation on QPdfWriter and QPainter;  the official documentation on font handling within Qt; a comprehensive guide on PDF standards (especially regarding font embedding); textbooks on digital typography and font technologies.  These resources are crucial to fully understand the complexities of font embedding.  Remember to meticulously check the documentation for your specific version of Qt, as implementation details may vary across versions.


In summary, correctly embedding standard fonts within QPdfWriter in Qt 6 requires explicit font selection and setting using `QFontDatabase` and `QPainter`.  The upgrade from Qt 5 introduced a shift in font management requiring developers to move away from implicit font handling.  The examples provided illustrate the fundamental steps involved, but more advanced techniques are needed for complex font management scenarios.  Always consult relevant documentation for your Qt version to avoid compatibility issues.
