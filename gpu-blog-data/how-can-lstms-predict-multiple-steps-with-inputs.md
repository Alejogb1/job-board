Predicting multiple steps with LSTMs where both inputs and outputs have varying shapes requires a careful consideration of input formatting and output handling.  My experience working on time series forecasting for high-frequency trading data, specifically order book dynamics, heavily involved precisely this challenge.  The key lies in appropriately vectorizing the input data and utilizing a suitable output layer architecture to accommodate the varying output shapes.  We cannot simply feed an LSTM a sequence of arbitrarily shaped tensors and expect it to perform well; careful preprocessing and architectural choices are paramount.


**1.  Data Preprocessing and Input Formatting:**

The first and most crucial step is to standardize the input data.  Irregular input shapes directly hinder the LSTM's ability to learn temporal dependencies.  Consider a scenario where we're predicting multiple financial indicators (price, volume, bid-ask spread) at varying frequencies.  The input might be a sequence of feature vectors, where each vector's dimensionality differs depending on the available data at each timestamp.

To address this, I found employing a maximum feature dimension, padding with zeros, and utilizing masking particularly effective.  This approach ensures that each input timestep is represented by a tensor of consistent dimensionality.  If a particular feature is missing at a given timestep, its corresponding entry in the feature vector is padded with a zero.  The LSTM then learns to ignore these padded values through the use of a masking layer.  This masking layer prevents the padded zeros from influencing the learned representations.

Another effective strategy, particularly beneficial when dealing with significantly different feature counts across timesteps, involves using variable-length sequences and dynamic computation.  However, this approach requires careful consideration of the computational cost.  For scenarios involving very large datasets and substantial variation in input shapes, this strategy might be computationally prohibitive and the zero-padding approach would be preferable.


**2. Output Layer Design for Varying Output Shapes:**

Predicting multiple steps with varying output shapes necessitates a flexible output layer architecture.  A naive approach of using a single dense layer for each prediction step would fail to accommodate the shape variations.  Instead, I recommend leveraging the power of multiple output heads, each specialized for a specific prediction type and shape.

Each output head can be a separate dense layer or a more sophisticated architecture depending on the nature of the prediction.  For example, if predicting a vector of continuous values, a dense layer with the appropriate output dimension suffices.  If predicting categorical variables, a softmax activation followed by argmax operation can be employed.  This approach allows for independent predictions, tailored to the specific output shape for each timestep.


**3. Code Examples:**

Below are three illustrative examples showcasing different scenarios and the corresponding code implementation in Python using TensorFlow/Keras.  These examples highlight the core concepts discussed earlier â€“ input standardization and multiple output heads.


**Example 1:  Zero-padding for fixed-length inputs:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data: sequences of varying lengths with feature vectors
data = [
    np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 0], [6, 0, 0]]),
    np.array([[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]),
    np.array([[13, 14, 15, 16], [17, 18, 19, 0]])
]

# Find max feature dimension
max_features = max(len(x[0]) for x in data)

# Pad sequences
padded_data = np.array([np.pad(x, ((0, 0), (0, max_features - len(x[0]))), 'constant') for x in data])

# Create mask
mask = np.array([[1 if i < len(x[0]) else 0 for i in range(max_features)] for x in data])

# Define model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Masking(mask_value=0, input_shape=(None, max_features)),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3) #Example: Predicting 3 features
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(padded_data, np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]), epochs=10) # Example Target data needs to be adapted according to your predictions
```

This example uses zero-padding to create fixed-length input sequences and a masking layer to ignore padded values. The dense layer at the end handles the prediction.


**Example 2:  Multiple Output Heads for Varying Output Shapes:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Define the model with multiple outputs
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=[output_layer_1, output_layer_2]) #output_layer_1 and 2 have different shapes

#Compile the model with separate losses for each output
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss={'output_layer_1':'mse', 'output_layer_2':'categorical_crossentropy'}) #adapt loss function

#Train the model
model.fit(x_train, {'output_layer_1': y_train_1, 'output_layer_2': y_train_2}, epochs=10)
```

This example demonstrates the use of multiple output heads, allowing for distinct predictions with varying shapes.  The `compile` function supports different loss functions for each output head.  Note that this requires structuring your target data accordingly.


**Example 3:  Combining Masking and Multiple Heads:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Assume input_layer is defined similarly as example 1
output_head_1 = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64)(masked_input)
output_head_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)(output_head_1)  #Output shape 1

output_head_2 = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(32)(masked_input) # different LSTM for different predictions
output_head_2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax')(output_head_2) #Output shape 2

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=[output_head_1, output_head_2])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=['mse', 'categorical_crossentropy'])
model.fit(padded_data, [y_train_1, y_train_2], epochs=10) #y_train_1, y_train_2 are the target outputs for each head

```

This example combines both techniques: zero-padding with masking for consistent input dimensionality and multiple output heads for different output shapes, even using different LSTM layers for each prediction task.



**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of LSTMs and sequence modeling, I suggest reviewing standard machine learning textbooks covering deep learning.  Furthermore, the official documentation for TensorFlow/Keras provides comprehensive guides on model building and training.  Finally, exploring research papers on time series forecasting with LSTMs will offer further insight into advanced techniques and architectural variations.  Examining works that address irregularly sampled time series data will be particularly relevant to the problem at hand.
