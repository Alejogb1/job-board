The feasibility of running YOLOv4 on a GTX 950 hinges critically on the specific variant of YOLOv4 and the targeted inference performance. I've encountered scenarios where such a configuration is borderline acceptable for low-resolution, real-time scenarios, but generally it's a struggle. The GTX 950, while adequate for basic gaming and some older CUDA-accelerated tasks, presents significant limitations when used with modern, computationally intensive object detection networks like YOLOv4. Let me elaborate on my experience, code, and resources in this regard.

The central issue lies in the GTX 950's limited computational resources. Its 768 CUDA cores and 2GB of GDDR5 memory are dwarfed by the requirements of YOLOv4, especially its larger variants. The architecture, while supporting CUDA, is older, meaning it's optimized for different types of workloads than those demanded by deep learning. This leads to several practical problems. The most immediate will be slow inference speeds, sometimes falling below one frame per second, even on simple scenes. Another, often overlooked challenge, is memory. YOLOv4 models, particularly the full-size versions, can easily exceed the 2GB of memory available, leading to frequent swapping to system memory, which exponentially slows down the process.

When deploying YOLOv4, it's crucial to differentiate between its various configurations. I've found significant differences between the standard YOLOv4, YOLOv4-tiny, and custom trained variants. The standard YOLOv4, due to its depth and complexity, poses the greatest challenge to the GTX 950. YOLOv4-tiny, on the other hand, presents a more attainable target but requires balancing detection accuracy with processing time. With custom models, the potential for optimization is significantly higher. If the task demands only a limited number of classes, a tailored lightweight model will often perform better than general-purpose pre-trained models.

Let's illustrate these points with some code examples. My experiences are based on utilizing the Darknet framework, which was the primary framework used for the original YOLOv4 research. In these examples, I focus on the basic elements related to inference, the practical implementations of which have differed between projects:

**Example 1: Basic Inference with Standard YOLOv4 Configuration**

This demonstrates the fundamental steps required for loading the model and performing inference in a minimal context. In practice, I would never try this on a GTX 950 without further modifications.

```python
import cv2
import darknet

# Configure Darknet
network, class_names, class_colors = darknet.load_network(
    "cfg/yolov4.cfg",
    "yolov4.weights",
    "data/coco.data"
)

# Load a sample image
image = cv2.imread("test_image.jpg")
image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
image_resized = cv2.resize(image_rgb, (darknet.network_width(network), darknet.network_height(network)), interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)

# Perform Inference
detections = darknet.detect_image(network, class_names, image_resized)

# Process detections
for label, confidence, bbox in detections:
  x, y, w, h = bbox
  x1, y1 = int(x - w / 2), int(y - h / 2)
  x2, y2 = int(x + w / 2), int(y + h / 2)
  cv2.rectangle(image, (x1,y1), (x2, y2), (255, 0, 0), 2)
  cv2.putText(image, f"{label}: {confidence:.2f}", (x1,y1 - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (255, 0, 0), 2)

cv2.imshow("Detection Result", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
This code segment highlights the basic process: model loading, image resizing, performing detection, and drawing bounding boxes. Running this directly on a GTX 950 without further adjustments typically yields extremely slow results. The crucial part for performance is the `darknet.detect_image` function and it's here that bottlenecks typically occur.  The detection time here on this hardware is typically around a second per image at a minimum.

**Example 2: YOLOv4-Tiny Inference**

This example demonstrates the same basic inference flow but uses the YOLOv4-tiny model, which is significantly lighter and potentially suitable for more limited hardware.

```python
import cv2
import darknet

# Configure Darknet for YOLOv4-tiny
network, class_names, class_colors = darknet.load_network(
    "cfg/yolov4-tiny.cfg",
    "yolov4-tiny.weights",
    "data/coco.data"
)

# Load and resize image, perform inference
image = cv2.imread("test_image.jpg")
image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
image_resized = cv2.resize(image_rgb, (darknet.network_width(network), darknet.network_height(network)), interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)
detections = darknet.detect_image(network, class_names, image_resized)

# Process detections and draw
for label, confidence, bbox in detections:
  x, y, w, h = bbox
  x1, y1 = int(x - w / 2), int(y - h / 2)
  x2, y2 = int(x + w / 2), int(y + h / 2)
  cv2.rectangle(image, (x1,y1), (x2, y2), (255, 0, 0), 2)
  cv2.putText(image, f"{label}: {confidence:.2f}", (x1,y1 - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (255, 0, 0), 2)


cv2.imshow("Detection Result", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
The difference here lies in the specified model configuration and weights, which define YOLOv4-tiny. In my experience, the performance jump is noticeable, though it can still be marginal without further optimizations.  It's more in the range of 200-500ms per image which can be used for real-time use, but in very constrained conditions.

**Example 3: Configuration-Based Optimization**

This is not directly runnable code but outlines the essential steps I take when dealing with such hardware limitations. Instead of modifying the algorithm itself, modifying the configuration of Darknet's .cfg files offers some advantages.

```
[net]
# Testing
batch=1
subdivisions=1
width=416    // Reducing input size
height=416
channels=3
momentum=0.9
decay=0.0005
angle=0
saturation=1.5
exposure=1.5
hue=.1
learning_rate=0.001
burn_in=1000
max_batches = 500200
policy=steps
steps=400000,450000
scales=.1,.1

... other network layers...
```

The key changes here include reducing the `width` and `height` to 416 or smaller (this is the resolution of input image passed to the model) and setting batch and subdivisions to 1, effectively ensuring we process only one image at a time. Modifying the learning rate, scales, or even the network structure, can be an iterative process. These modifications have a direct impact on memory usage and computational load during inference. This section requires some advanced knowledge of deep learning and the Darknet configuration files.

In my practical use, I have found that the following resources are valuable:

*   **General Deep Learning Textbooks:** Books covering convolutional neural networks and object detection provide the theoretical background for understanding what specific parts of YOLOv4 are computationally demanding.
*   **Darknet Documentation and Forums:** The Darknet community provides a lot of technical information and example configurations that have proven helpful.
*   **Papers on Neural Network Optimization:** Academic papers that discuss techniques to optimize deep learning models for limited resource deployments are an important resource for the more technically demanding tasks.
*   **CUDA Documentation:** In understanding the limitations and capabilities of the GPU, documentation from CUDA is a necessity.

In conclusion, while technically *possible* to run YOLOv4 on a GTX 950, particularly the YOLOv4-tiny variant, acceptable performance levels necessitate careful optimization and understanding of the underlying limitations. Real-time use is generally unlikely for the full model and only attainable with the "tiny" configuration under specific constraints.  In the end, it's often wiser to use a more suitable system when deploying a solution in production. The key takeaway is that such a configuration is constrained by the hardware, and trade-offs between detection speed and accuracy are essential.
