TensorFlow 1.4's compatibility with Jupyter Notebook hinges on the correct installation and configuration of both components, specifically concerning Python version compatibility and potential conflicts with other libraries.  My experience working on several large-scale machine learning projects during the TensorFlow 1.x era involved extensive interaction with Jupyter Notebook, so I can speak to the nuances involved.  TensorFlow 1.4 itself wasn't inherently incompatible, but achieving seamless integration required careful attention to several interdependent factors.

**1.  Explanation of Compatibility and Potential Issues:**

TensorFlow 1.4, released in 2017, was designed to function within Python 2.7 and 3.3-3.6 environments. Jupyter Notebook's functionality relies heavily on its kernel's ability to execute Python code.  Therefore, the core compatibility question boils down to whether your Jupyter Notebook kernel uses a Python version supported by TensorFlow 1.4.  If a mismatch occurs—for example, using a Python 3.7 kernel with TensorFlow 1.4—you'll encounter errors during import or execution.

Furthermore, conflicts with other libraries represent another potential hurdle.  If you've installed packages that have conflicting dependencies with TensorFlow 1.4, or if you've used a package manager like pip in a way that creates conflicting library versions across different environments, then Jupyter Notebook might fail to correctly load TensorFlow 1.4 within its kernel.  This is often manifested as `ImportError` exceptions, indicating that TensorFlow's core modules cannot be found or initialized.  In my experience, managing virtual environments with tools like `venv` or `conda` proved crucial in mitigating such issues.  Carefully planned and isolated environments prevent unintentional conflicts between project dependencies.

Another subtle issue stems from the kernel's configuration within Jupyter Notebook. If the kernel points to a Python interpreter that doesn't have TensorFlow 1.4 installed, or if the interpreter's path is incorrectly specified, the notebook will be unable to leverage TensorFlow.  Verifying both the Python version and the presence of TensorFlow within the selected kernel's environment is critical.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Successful TensorFlow 1.4 Import in a Compatible Jupyter Notebook Environment:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print(tf.__version__)  # Verify TensorFlow 1.4 is loaded correctly

# Basic TensorFlow operation
session = tf.Session()
a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(10)
c = a + b
print(session.run(c))
session.close()
```

*Commentary:* This example shows a successful import and execution of a simple TensorFlow operation. The `print(tf.__version__)` line is crucial for verification; it should output `1.4.0` or a similar version number. The successful execution of the addition operation indicates that TensorFlow is functioning correctly within the Jupyter Notebook environment. I've explicitly included the `session.close()` call as a best practice in TensorFlow 1.x, though resource management is automatically handled by Python garbage collection in later versions.

**Example 2: Handling a Potential `ImportError`:**

```python
try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    print(tf.__version__)
    # TensorFlow code here...
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Error importing TensorFlow: {e}")
    print("Ensure TensorFlow 1.4 is installed in the correct Python environment.")
```

*Commentary:*  This example demonstrates error handling.  The `try-except` block gracefully handles potential `ImportError` exceptions that might occur if TensorFlow 1.4 isn't installed or configured properly in the Jupyter kernel's environment.  The error message guides the user toward troubleshooting steps, emphasizing the importance of environment management. This is a debugging technique I frequently used, especially when collaborating on projects with differing development environments.

**Example 3: Checking Kernel and Python Version:**

```python
import sys

print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")

# Further checks could be added here to specifically check for TensorFlow 1.4
# within the current Python environment, but this is system-specific and
# requires additional checks beyond the scope of this response.  Checking the
# Jupyter Notebook kernel's settings would be more useful.
```

*Commentary:* This code snippet focuses on verifying the Python version active within the Jupyter Notebook's kernel.  While it doesn't directly confirm TensorFlow 1.4's presence, it's a critical first step.  A mismatch between the Python version used by the kernel and the version compatible with TensorFlow 1.4 is a common cause of incompatibility.  More sophisticated checks, potentially involving probing the system's path variables to locate TensorFlow libraries, could be added, but they would be highly system-dependent.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow 1.x documentation.  The TensorFlow installation guide should be thoroughly reviewed, focusing on specific instructions for Python 2.7 and Python 3.x environments.  Pay close attention to any compatibility notes or warnings mentioned there.   A comprehensive guide on virtual environment management, either using `venv` or `conda`, would be helpful.  Understanding how to create and manage isolated Python environments is paramount for successfully working with various package versions, including TensorFlow 1.4 and related libraries.  Finally, reviewing the Jupyter Notebook documentation to understand kernel selection and management will solidify your understanding of the interplay between the notebook interface and your underlying Python interpreter.  Proficiently utilizing these resources should resolve most TensorFlow 1.4 compatibility concerns in a Jupyter Notebook setting.
