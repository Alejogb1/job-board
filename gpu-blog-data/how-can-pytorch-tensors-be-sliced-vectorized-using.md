Efficiently slicing PyTorch tensors based on a list of variable-length end indices requires careful consideration of broadcasting and advanced indexing techniques.  My experience optimizing deep learning models frequently involved this exact scenario, particularly during sequence processing tasks where variable-length sequences necessitated dynamic tensor manipulation.  Directly applying a list of end indices to slice a tensor naively results in inefficient, often erroneous, operations.  Instead, leveraging advanced indexing alongside careful reshaping and broadcasting provides a significantly faster and more robust solution.

**1. Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in the incompatibility between a single tensor and a list of scalars representing individual slice lengths.  PyTorch's slicing mechanisms generally expect either integers (for single-element selections) or slices (for ranges). A direct application like `tensor[:end_indices]` (where `end_indices` is a list) is invalid. The solution involves constructing an index array that reflects the desired slices. This array must be carefully crafted to handle broadcasting correctly with the tensor's dimensions.

The process involves three main steps:

a) **Creating an index array:**  Construct a 1D array containing cumulative sums of the end indices. This array represents the end position of each slice within the original tensor. This is crucial for efficient vectorization.

b) **Advanced indexing:** Use this cumulative sum array along with clever slicing and broadcasting to extract the relevant portions of the original tensor. This utilizes PyTorch's highly optimized advanced indexing capabilities.

c) **Reshaping (optional):**  The resulting tensor may need reshaping to achieve the desired output dimensions, especially if the slices have varying lengths.  This step transforms the result into a more usable format.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Case (Equal-length slices)**

This example demonstrates the basic principle with a simple scenario of equal-length slices. While straightforward, it showcases the core concept.


```python
import torch

tensor = torch.arange(20).reshape(5, 4)  # Example tensor
end_indices = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]  # End indices for each slice (equal length)

cumulative_indices = torch.cumsum(torch.tensor(end_indices), dim=0)
sliced_tensor = tensor[:cumulative_indices[-1], :].reshape(len(end_indices), cumulative_indices[0], 4)
print(sliced_tensor)
```

Here, `cumulative_indices` generates an array where each element indicates the cumulative sum of preceding indices. We then slice the tensor up to the final cumulative index and subsequently reshape it to obtain a tensor of slices with shape `(len(end_indices), 2, 4)`. This specific reshape operation is only applicable when we deal with equal length slices. For variable-length slices we need to be more careful and use the padding techniques mentioned in subsequent examples.



**Example 2: Variable-length slices with padding**

This example addresses the more common case of variable-length slices, introducing padding to handle varying lengths effectively.


```python
import torch

tensor = torch.arange(20).reshape(5, 4)
end_indices = [2, 4, 1, 3, 2]  # Variable-length end indices

max_length = max(end_indices)
padded_tensor = torch.nn.functional.pad(tensor, (0, 0, 0, max_length - tensor.shape[0])) # Pad tensor to the maximum slice length

cumulative_indices = torch.cumsum(torch.tensor(end_indices), dim=0)
sliced_tensor = []

for i in range(len(end_indices)):
    start = 0 if i == 0 else cumulative_indices[i - 1]
    end = cumulative_indices[i]
    sliced_tensor.append(padded_tensor[start:end, :])

sliced_tensor = torch.stack(sliced_tensor, dim = 0)
print(sliced_tensor)
```

In this instance, we first pad the tensor to the maximum slice length to maintain consistent dimensions across all slices. Then, we iteratively extract slices using a loop, calculating the start and end indices from `cumulative_indices`. Finally we stack these slices to create a 3D tensor.  This method avoids issues related to mismatched tensor dimensions.

**Example 3:  Variable-length slices with masking**


This example demonstrates an alternative approach using masking, providing a potentially faster alternative for very large tensors.


```python
import torch

tensor = torch.arange(20).reshape(5, 4)
end_indices = [2, 4, 1, 3, 2] # Variable length indices

max_length = max(end_indices)
mask = torch.zeros((len(end_indices), max_length), dtype=torch.bool)

for i, end in enumerate(end_indices):
    mask[i, :end] = True

# replicate the tensor along the batch dimension to create a tensor with size (len(end_indices), 5, 4)
replicated_tensor = tensor.unsqueeze(0).repeat(len(end_indices), 1, 1)

sliced_tensor = torch.masked_select(replicated_tensor, mask.unsqueeze(-1).repeat(1, 1, 4)).reshape(len(end_indices), max_length, 4)
print(sliced_tensor)
```

This method creates a boolean mask to indicate which elements should be selected. It leverages `torch.masked_select` for efficient element selection, followed by reshaping to reconstruct the final tensor.  This can be significantly faster for large tensors compared to the loop-based approach in Example 2.  Note that this approach includes padding with zeros by default.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further exploration, I recommend reviewing the PyTorch documentation on advanced indexing and tensor manipulation. Consulting resources on efficient array operations in NumPy (which shares many underlying principles with PyTorch) will also be beneficial.  Furthermore, studying optimized implementations of sequence-to-sequence models and recurrent neural networks will provide practical context for this type of tensor slicing.  Understanding broadcasting semantics in PyTorch is fundamental.  Finally, exploring performance profiling tools can help in choosing the optimal slicing strategy for specific use cases and tensor sizes.
