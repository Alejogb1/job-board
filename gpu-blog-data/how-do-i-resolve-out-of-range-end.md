The "Out of range: End of sequence" error during multi-GPU TensorFlow 2.0 training typically stems from an imbalance in data distribution across the available GPUs.  My experience troubleshooting this, particularly when working on large-scale image classification projects involving datasets exceeding several terabytes, points to inconsistencies in the dataset partitioning or the data pipeline's interaction with the multi-GPU strategy.  This isn't simply a matter of dataset size; the problem arises from how TensorFlow distributes data iterators and handles the batching process across multiple devices.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The error manifests because a particular GPU attempts to access a data element beyond the allocated portion of the dataset.  This occurs when the `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline, which feeds data to the training process, doesn't distribute the data evenly or account for the potential for uneven batch sizes at the end of an epoch.  The most common scenarios include:

* **Uneven dataset splitting:** If the dataset isn't divisible by the number of GPUs, the last GPU might receive a smaller dataset portion than others, leading to premature exhaustion of its data iterator.  This is exacerbated when using strategies like `MirroredStrategy`, which replicates the model on each GPU and distributes data accordingly.

* **Data pipeline bottlenecks:** Inefficiencies in the data preprocessing pipeline can cause delays in data delivery to some GPUs. If one GPU finishes processing its portion of the data significantly faster than others, it will attempt to fetch more data, encountering the "out of range" error.  This is often overlooked, particularly when dealing with complex image augmentation or on-the-fly data transformations.

* **Incorrect batch size handling:**  Specifying a batch size that doesn't evenly divide the dataset size can result in a smaller final batch on some GPUs.  This final, smaller batch can cause issues if the training loop doesn't handle this variability gracefully.

* **Dataset shuffling:** While beneficial for model generalization, shuffling large datasets can introduce unexpected variations in the data distribution across GPUs, particularly if the shuffling isn't perfectly synchronized across devices.  This can lead to subtle imbalances that manifest only during multi-GPU training.


Addressing this requires careful consideration of the data pipeline, batch size selection, and the chosen multi-GPU strategy.  Ensuring even distribution of data and robust handling of potential edge cases are crucial.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Correct Data Distribution with `tf.data.Dataset.shard`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_dataset(filepath, batch_size, num_gpus):
  dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(filepath)  # Assuming filepath is a list of filepaths
  dataset = dataset.shard(num_gpus, tf.distribute.get_replica_context().replica_id_in_sync_group)  # Essential for even distribution
  dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE) # Preprocessing step, make sure this is efficient
  dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size, drop_remainder=True) # drop_remainder avoids uneven batch sizes at the end
  dataset = dataset.prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
  return dataset

# ... rest of the training code using MirroredStrategy or other strategy ...
```

This example uses `tf.data.Dataset.shard` to divide the dataset evenly among the GPUs. `drop_remainder=True` ensures that all GPUs receive batches of the same size, eliminating the possibility of a smaller final batch. `tf.data.AUTOTUNE` optimizes the data pipeline for performance.  Crucially, the `replica_id_in_sync_group` ensures each GPU receives its assigned shard.  This approach directly addresses the problem of uneven dataset splitting.


**Example 2:  Handling potential data pipeline bottlenecks:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def preprocess_function(filepath):
  # ... Image loading and augmentation ...
  image = tf.io.read_file(filepath)
  image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image, channels=3)
  # ... other preprocessing steps ...
  return image, label # Assuming you have a label associated with each image

# ...Within your tf.data.Dataset pipeline:
dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE).cache() #caching improves performance
```

This example demonstrates efficient data preprocessing. `num_parallel_calls=tf.data.AUTOTUNE` allows TensorFlow to optimize the number of parallel calls to `preprocess_function`, preventing bottlenecks.  Adding `.cache()` can significantly speed up repeated epochs by caching the processed data in memory or on disk. The effectiveness of caching depends on dataset size and available memory.

**Example 3:  Robust Batch Size Selection and Iteration Management:**

```python
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
  model = create_model()
  optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

  def training_step(inputs, labels):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      predictions = model(inputs, training=True)
      loss = compute_loss(predictions, labels)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss

  dataset = create_dataset(filepaths, BATCH_SIZE, len(strategy.extended.worker_devices))

  for epoch in range(NUM_EPOCHS):
    for batch in dataset:
      per_replica_loss = strategy.run(training_step, args=(batch[0], batch[1])) #Distribute the training step
      loss = strategy.reduce(tf.distribute.ReduceOp.MEAN, per_replica_loss, axis=None) #Aggregate loss for logging
      # ... Logging and other operations ...
```

This demonstrates a more robust training loop using a `MirroredStrategy`.  The `strategy.run` distributes the `training_step` across GPUs. The loss is aggregated using `strategy.reduce` to provide a single loss value for each batch.  The critical aspect here is the handling of the dataset iteration within the `for` loop; the `create_dataset` function (shown in Example 1) is responsible for preventing the generation of uneven batches, making this loop robust.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on distributed training, specifically focusing on the `tf.distribute` API and the different multi-GPU strategies (MirroredStrategy, MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy, etc.), is essential.  Furthermore, I found exploring the TensorFlow Datasets library, including its mechanisms for efficient data sharding and preprocessing, highly beneficial.  Finally, understanding the nuances of data pipeline optimization, particularly the use of `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`, is crucial for preventing performance bottlenecks that could trigger this error.  Reviewing articles and tutorials on efficient data loading in TensorFlow is highly recommended.  Careful attention to error handling and logging throughout the training process will aid in pinpointing the source of the issue in more complex scenarios.
