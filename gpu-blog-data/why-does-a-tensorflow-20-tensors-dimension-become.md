In TensorFlow 2.0, a tensor's dimension can become `None` after operations like `tf.gather` or `tf.boolean_mask` primarily because these operations inherently produce a result with a dynamic shape. This dynamism arises from the variable nature of the indices or boolean masks used to select elements, which makes static determination of the output shape impossible at graph construction time. I've encountered this behavior numerous times, particularly when building models involving variable-length sequences or masked inputs, and understanding the root cause is critical for debugging and efficient model construction.

The core issue lies in the way TensorFlow handles shape inference during graph construction. During this phase, TensorFlow attempts to determine the shape of every tensor, enabling optimizations and memory allocation. Operations like `tf.gather` and `tf.boolean_mask` operate based on runtime-determined inputs—the `indices` tensor in the case of `tf.gather`, and the `mask` tensor in the case of `tf.boolean_mask`. The sizes of these inputs, and therefore, the size of the output tensor in at least one dimension, are not known until execution time. Consequently, TensorFlow cannot statically infer the size of the resulting dimension, and it assigns a `None` value to that dimension. The implications are that when the actual value is required for computations, it will need to be computed on each call of the function. This can be expensive in performance-critical cases, but is the price for flexibility.

Consider `tf.gather`. This operation collects slices from a tensor at specified indices. The output's primary dimensions are directly related to the length of the `indices` tensor, which is usually dynamic, hence `None`. The number of gathered elements depends on the values within the index tensor which are not available during static shape inference. Let’s assume I have a tensor representing embeddings and I use tf.gather to retrieve embeddings corresponding to token ids:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

embeddings = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]) # shape (4, 2)
token_ids = tf.constant([1, 3, 0]) # shape (3,)

gathered_embeddings = tf.gather(embeddings, token_ids)
print(gathered_embeddings.shape) # Output: (3, 2)

unknown_token_ids = tf.Variable(initial_value=[2,0,1,1], dtype=tf.int32)
dynamic_gathered_embeddings = tf.gather(embeddings, unknown_token_ids)
print(dynamic_gathered_embeddings.shape) # Output: (None, 2)

```

In the first example, `token_ids` is a constant, so the output shape is statically known as (3, 2). The number of elements being gathered (3) is determined statically. However, if `token_ids` is a `tf.Variable`, the length (and therefore output shape) is not statically determined.  In the second example, `unknown_token_ids` is a variable, and consequently TensorFlow cannot know what the size of this variable might be at compile time and the first dimension is set to None. Therefore, while the second dimension, which is inherited from the embedding size, remains statically inferable, the first dimension becomes `None` due to the dynamic nature of the indices. This also holds true for placeholder tensors.

A similar phenomenon occurs with `tf.boolean_mask`. This operation selects elements from a tensor based on a boolean mask of matching dimensionality. The resulting tensor’s shape will depend on the number of `True` values in the mask, which is, again, inherently dynamic. Consider this example where I might mask a set of sequence embeddings based on whether a mask contains valid values.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

embeddings = tf.constant([
    [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]],
    [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]],
    [[13, 14], [15, 16], [17, 18]]
]) # Shape: (3, 3, 2)
mask = tf.constant([
    [True, False, True],
    [False, True, True],
    [True, True, False]
]) # Shape: (3, 3)

masked_embeddings = tf.boolean_mask(embeddings, mask)
print(masked_embeddings.shape) # Output: (6, 2)

dynamic_mask = tf.Variable(initial_value=[
    [True, True, False],
    [True, False, True],
    [False, True, True]
], dtype=tf.bool)

dynamic_masked_embeddings = tf.boolean_mask(embeddings, dynamic_mask)
print(dynamic_masked_embeddings.shape) # Output: (None, 2)

```

When the mask is a constant, like `mask`, the shape of the output of `tf.boolean_mask` can be inferred; in this case it's (6,2). However, the dynamic mask, `dynamic_mask` creates an output shape with a dynamic first dimension that can be modified by future calculations.

To clarify further, this `None` dimension does not signify that the size is truly unknown during execution, but rather that it cannot be determined during the static analysis phase. During runtime, the size of this dimension will be computed based on the actual `indices` or `mask` values, but this runtime determination does not back propagate to the graph structure. If I wanted to convert the dynamic shape to a fixed shape, that is possible, but that would require a computation during runtime.

Finally, let's look at a case where I use tf.where to extract elements, which behaves very similar to boolean_mask, by only returning the elements where the mask is `True`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

values = tf.constant([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
], dtype = tf.int32)

mask = tf.constant([
    [True, False, True],
    [False, True, False],
    [True, False, True]
], dtype = tf.bool)

indices = tf.where(mask)
print(indices.shape) # Output (5,2)
extracted_values = tf.gather_nd(values, indices)
print(extracted_values.shape) # Output (5,)


dynamic_mask = tf.Variable([
    [True, True, False],
    [True, False, True],
    [False, True, True]
], dtype=tf.bool)

dynamic_indices = tf.where(dynamic_mask)
print(dynamic_indices.shape) # Output (None, 2)
dynamic_extracted_values = tf.gather_nd(values, dynamic_indices)
print(dynamic_extracted_values.shape) # Output (None,)
```

In this case `tf.where` will extract the indices where the mask is true. As the length of the indices tensor will vary based on the number of `True` values in the mask, both dimensions of the `dynamic_indices` will become dynamic. We can use these dynamic indices to gather from `values`, resulting in a dynamic output.

It is important to note that having dimensions set to `None` does not mean an error occurs. The program will function correctly, but there may be performance implications as further computations cannot benefit from static shape information, and will have to perform computations at each call. Operations down the line will not have the correct shape if dimensions are not known beforehand.

To manage situations where dynamic shapes are problematic, the following techniques are often employed. Firstly, `tf.ensure_shape` can enforce that a dynamic dimension matches an expected static shape. This is useful for catching bugs. Secondly, `tf.shape` can obtain the actual shape of the tensor, and use that to perform additional calculations. Be mindful that while this can give information about the tensor during runtime, it will not change the static graph representation. Lastly, when working with variable-length sequences, padding and masking is a common technique. Padding can be used to make all sequences the same length, which means that the dimensions will be statically known, while the mask can be used to ignore values which have been padded, thus ensuring correctness.

For further information, I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on tensor shapes, the documentation for the `tf.gather` and `tf.boolean_mask` ops, and the TensorFlow guides dealing with dynamic tensor shapes and ragged tensors. Furthermore, resources explaining graph construction and eager execution will also provide a deeper insight into shape inference. Finally, working through tutorials that deal with sequence processing in TensorFlow can provide hands-on experience dealing with dynamically shaped tensors.
