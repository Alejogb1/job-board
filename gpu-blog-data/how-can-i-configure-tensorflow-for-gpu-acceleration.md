TensorFlow's GPU acceleration hinges on the correct installation and configuration of CUDA and cuDNN, alongside appropriate TensorFlow build selection.  My experience troubleshooting this on numerous projects, particularly involving large-scale image processing, underscores the importance of meticulously verifying each component's compatibility.  Failure to do so frequently results in CPU-bound execution, negating the performance benefits of a GPU.

**1. System Prerequisites and Driver Installation:**

Before initiating TensorFlow installation, the underlying system must meet specific requirements. This includes possessing a compatible NVIDIA GPU with sufficient memory (compute capability 3.5 or higher is generally recommended for optimal performance with newer TensorFlow versions).  Crucially, the proprietary NVIDIA driver must be installed.  I've found that using the official NVIDIA drivers, obtained directly from the NVIDIA website and tailored to your specific GPU model and Ubuntu version, consistently yields the best results, avoiding conflicts arising from PPA repositories.  Successfully installing the driver necessitates rebooting the system.  After the reboot, verifying the driver installation through the command `nvidia-smi` is essential.  This command should display information about your GPU, including driver version and compute capability, confirming successful installation.   Incorrect driver installation is the single most common source of GPU acceleration failures.

**2. CUDA Toolkit Installation:**

Next, the CUDA Toolkit must be installed.  This provides the necessary libraries and tools for GPU programming.  I advise downloading the appropriate CUDA Toolkit version from the NVIDIA website that explicitly supports your GPU and driver version.  Incorrect version pairings are a frequent source of errors.  The installation process usually involves running a `.run` file; meticulously following the on-screen instructions is vital. During installation, ensure that you correctly specify the installation directory.  Post-installation, adding the CUDA bin directory to your system's PATH environment variable is paramount.  This is typically achieved by editing your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file, adding lines similar to:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:$PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
```

Remember to replace `/usr/local/cuda` with the actual CUDA installation path if it differs.  Source your configuration file (`source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`) for these changes to take effect. Verifying the installation can be done by running `nvcc --version`, which should output the CUDA compiler version.

**3. cuDNN Installation:**

cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) provides highly optimized routines for deep learning operations. Obtain the cuDNN library from the NVIDIA website, ensuring compatibility with your CUDA Toolkit version.  cuDNN is typically distributed as a compressed archive.  Extract its contents and copy the relevant libraries (cuDNN headers, libraries, and samples) to the appropriate directories within your CUDA installation.  The NVIDIA documentation provides precise instructions for this step. The exact path will vary depending on your CUDA installation. You will typically need to copy the `lib` files into the `lib64` directory, the `include` files into the `include` directory, and may need to create a `cudnn` subdirectory under the `include` directory for more organized storage.

**4. TensorFlow Installation:**

With CUDA and cuDNN configured, TensorFlow installation can proceed.  I highly recommend using pip to install the GPU-enabled version.  The crucial aspect is selecting the correct TensorFlow wheel file.  Employing the wrong wheel can lead to CUDA and cuDNN incompatibility issues.  The command often takes this form:

```bash
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==<version>
```

Replace `<version>` with a compatible version number, checking the official TensorFlow website for the most recent stable version supporting your CUDA and cuDNN configurations. I generally avoid using `sudo` unless absolutely necessary, to prevent potential permission problems.

**Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic GPU Verification:**

This code snippet verifies TensorFlow's GPU usage.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

if len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) > 0:
    print("TensorFlow is using GPU.")
else:
    print("TensorFlow is NOT using GPU.")
```

This will output the number of GPUs detected and a confirmation of GPU usage.  Failure here indicates a problem in the preceding steps.

**Example 2: Simple GPU-accelerated Matrix Multiplication:**

This demonstrates a straightforward computation on the GPU.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):  # Specifies GPU device
    a = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1024, 1024), dtype=tf.float32)
    b = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1024, 1024), dtype=tf.float32)
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)

print(c)
```

This performs matrix multiplication leveraging GPU acceleration.  If the code runs successfully without errors and demonstrates significantly faster computation than a CPU-only equivalent, then GPU acceleration is operational.

**Example 3:  Keras Model with GPU Usage:**

This showcases GPU usage within a Keras model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

model = keras.Sequential([Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
                         Dense(10, activation='softmax')])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Ensure the model runs on GPU
with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
  model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1) # Replace x_train and y_train with your data.
```

This demonstrates using Keras, a high-level API, to perform model training on the GPU. The `with tf.device('/GPU:0'):` block explicitly assigns the model training to the GPU. Monitoring GPU usage during training is crucial to confirm its operation.


**Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official NVIDIA CUDA and cuDNN documentation. Review the TensorFlow documentation, focusing on the GPU installation and configuration sections.  Explore the TensorFlow tutorials for examples demonstrating GPU usage.  Furthermore, familiarizing yourself with the NVIDIA developer resources will prove invaluable in troubleshooting potential issues.  These resources provide detailed instructions and explanations that resolve many common configuration problems.
