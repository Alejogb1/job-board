Filtering numerical data from files is a common task, and efficiency is paramount when dealing with large datasets.  My experience working on high-frequency trading systems highlighted the critical need for optimized file processing; millisecond delays could translate to significant financial losses.  Therefore, understanding the interplay between file I/O, data parsing, and filtering techniques is crucial.  The optimal approach depends heavily on the file format and the size of the dataset.


**1.  Explanation of Filtering Techniques**

The fundamental challenge lies in efficiently reading the numerical data from the file, parsing each value to ensure it's a number and not corrupted data, and then applying the filtering criterion (in this case, numbers greater than 100).  Inefficient methods could involve loading the entire file into memory, which is impractical for very large files.  More scalable approaches leverage iterative processing, reading and processing the data line by line or chunk by chunk. This minimizes memory usage and allows for handling files exceeding available RAM.

There are several ways to achieve this, depending on the programming language and file format:

* **Line-by-line processing:** This method reads one line at a time from the file.  Each line is parsed, the numerical value is extracted, and a conditional check determines whether the number exceeds 100. This approach is memory-efficient and suitable for most file sizes.

* **Chunk-by-chunk processing:**  For extremely large files, reading the entire file line by line might still be slow.  A more efficient approach is to read the file in chunks of a defined size.  Each chunk is processed, filtering the numbers within, and then discarded before loading the next chunk. This significantly reduces the memory footprint.

* **Specialized libraries:**  Libraries designed for data manipulation and file processing often provide optimized functions for these tasks. These libraries often incorporate techniques like memory mapping, which allows for direct access to the file's contents in memory, bypassing the need for explicit reads and writes.  This can lead to significant speed improvements, especially for larger datasets residing on slower storage.

The choice of approach hinges on factors like file size, available memory, and the desired level of performance.  While line-by-line processing is sufficient for moderately sized files, chunk-by-chunk processing is necessary for very large files to avoid memory exhaustion.  Leveraging specialized libraries often leads to the most efficient solution.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate different approaches using Python, assuming the file `numbers.txt` contains one number per line.

**Example 1: Line-by-line processing with basic file I/O**

```python
def filter_numbers_line_by_line(filepath):
    """Filters numbers greater than 100 from a file line by line."""
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
            filtered_numbers = [int(line.strip()) for line in f if int(line.strip()) > 100]
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filepath}' not found.")
        return []
    except ValueError:
        print(f"Error: Non-numeric value encountered in '{filepath}'.")
        return []
    return filtered_numbers

filepath = "numbers.txt"
filtered_numbers = filter_numbers_line_by_line(filepath)
print(f"Numbers greater than 100: {filtered_numbers}")
```

This code directly uses Python's built-in file handling capabilities.  It iterates through each line, converts it to an integer (error handling included for non-numeric values), and applies the filter condition.  The `try...except` block handles potential errors, ensuring robustness.

**Example 2: Chunk-by-chunk processing for large files**

```python
def filter_numbers_chunk_by_chunk(filepath, chunk_size=1024):
    """Filters numbers greater than 100 from a file chunk by chunk."""
    filtered_numbers = []
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
            while True:
                chunk = f.readlines(chunk_size)
                if not chunk:
                    break
                for line in chunk:
                    try:
                        num = int(line.strip())
                        if num > 100:
                            filtered_numbers.append(num)
                    except ValueError:
                        print("Warning: Skipping non-numeric value.")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filepath}' not found.")
        return []
    return filtered_numbers

filepath = "numbers.txt"
filtered_numbers = filter_numbers_chunk_by_chunk(filepath)
print(f"Numbers greater than 100: {filtered_numbers}")

```

This example demonstrates chunk-by-chunk processing.  The `readlines(chunk_size)` method reads a specified number of lines at a time, significantly reducing memory usage for large files.  Error handling is included to gracefully skip invalid lines.

**Example 3: Utilizing NumPy for numerical array operations (for files with space-separated numbers)**

```python
import numpy as np

def filter_numbers_numpy(filepath):
    """Filters numbers greater than 100 from a file using NumPy."""
    try:
        data = np.loadtxt(filepath)
        filtered_numbers = data[data > 100]
        return filtered_numbers.tolist() # Convert back to standard list for output.
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: File '{filepath}' not found.")
        return []
    except ValueError:
        print(f"Error: Non-numeric value or invalid file format encountered.")
        return []

filepath = "numbers.txt" # Assumes space-separated numbers in file.
filtered_numbers = filter_numbers_numpy(filepath)
print(f"Numbers greater than 100: {filtered_numbers}")

```

This example leverages NumPy's vectorized operations.  `np.loadtxt` efficiently loads the numerical data into a NumPy array.  The filtering operation `data[data > 100]` is highly optimized, making it significantly faster for large datasets compared to line-by-line processing.  Note that this method requires the file to have a specific format (e.g., space-separated numbers).


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further learning, I would suggest consulting texts on data structures and algorithms, focusing on file I/O and efficient sorting/filtering techniques.  A good book on advanced Python programming would also be beneficial, especially regarding memory management and optimized library usage.  Finally, exploring documentation for libraries like NumPy and Pandas, commonly used for numerical and data manipulation tasks, would be invaluable.  Understanding the complexities of operating systems and file systems will also provide a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics of file access.
