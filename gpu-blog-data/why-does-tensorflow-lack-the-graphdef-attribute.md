TensorFlow, as a framework, evolved significantly between its 1.x and 2.x versions, fundamentally altering its computational graph representation and execution. The absence of a readily accessible `GraphDef` attribute in TensorFlow 2.x stems directly from this architectural shift away from static graphs and towards eager execution. In TensorFlow 1.x, the computational process revolved around defining a static, global computation graph via the `tf.Graph` class. This graph, represented by `GraphDef`, was a protocol buffer containing the nodes and edges describing the operations and data flow. A session was then initiated to execute this predefined graph. In contrast, TensorFlow 2.x defaults to eager execution, where operations are performed immediately upon invocation, similar to NumPy. This dynamic paradigm eliminates the necessity for an explicit graph object accessible through a `GraphDef` attribute.

The static graph approach of TensorFlow 1.x, while offering potential optimizations, introduced complications for debugging and intuitive coding. The requirement to first define and then execute the graph could be less transparent, particularly for newcomers. The graph's definition, modification, and execution were distinct phases, making tracing intermediate values or debugging complex models more cumbersome. Furthermore, the serial nature of graph construction often resulted in verbose code and non-intuitive interactions with NumPy. Consequently, TensorFlow 2.x prioritizes ease of use, flexibility, and direct feedback through eager execution.

Eager execution bypasses the need to construct and optimize a static graph before execution. When a TensorFlow operation is called in eager mode, it executes instantly, returning the result. This shift has a profound effect on how TensorFlow is used. GraphDef, as a representation of a static graph, is therefore largely irrelevant within this paradigm. While the underlying TensorFlow runtime still utilizes optimized execution, the graph is no longer a user-facing concept.

It's crucial to understand that while the `GraphDef` attribute is gone, aspects of graph representation still exist within TensorFlow 2.x, particularly when utilizing `tf.function`. Decorating a Python function with `tf.function` triggers tracing; TensorFlow analyzes the function's operations and generates an optimized, graph-based representation. However, this graph representation is internal to the TensorFlow runtime and not directly exposed to the user through a `GraphDef` object. This mechanism facilitates both eager execution and static graph optimization, allowing for the best of both paradigms.

To illustrate this, let's examine three code examples, comparing the approaches in TensorFlow 1.x and how similar concepts are handled in 2.x.

**Example 1: Graph Definition and Execution (TensorFlow 1.x)**

```python
# TensorFlow 1.x
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
tf.disable_v2_behavior()

graph = tf.Graph()
with graph.as_default():
  a = tf.constant(2.0)
  b = tf.constant(3.0)
  c = tf.add(a, b)

# Accessing GraphDef
graph_def = graph.as_graph_def() 
# Code to serialize or inspect graph_def goes here

with tf.Session(graph=graph) as sess:
    result = sess.run(c)
    print("Result:", result) # Output: Result: 5.0
```

In this 1.x example, a `tf.Graph` is explicitly created, and the operations are defined within its context. The `graph.as_graph_def()` method yields the protocol buffer representation, `graph_def`, allowing inspection or serialization. The computation `c` can be accessed from a session where its value is evaluated using `sess.run(c)`. This explicit graph creation and execution was the standard approach in TensorFlow 1.x.

**Example 2: Equivalent Operation in TensorFlow 2.x (Eager Execution)**

```python
# TensorFlow 2.x
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(2.0)
b = tf.constant(3.0)
c = a + b  # or c = tf.add(a, b)

print("Result:", c.numpy()) # Output: Result: 5.0

# Attempt to access GraphDef will raise AttributeError
# try:
#  graph_def = c.graph.as_graph_def() # AttributeError: 'EagerTensor' object has no attribute 'graph'
# except AttributeError as e:
#   print(e)
```
In this TensorFlow 2.x example, using eager execution, the operations are performed immediately when defined. The result is immediately available; `c` is an EagerTensor. Critically, thereâ€™s no explicit graph object that could be associated with a `GraphDef`. Attempting to access graph definition via `c.graph.as_graph_def()` will lead to an `AttributeError`, clearly demonstrating the absence of the associated `graph` attribute.

**Example 3: Utilizing `tf.function` for Graph Optimization in TensorFlow 2.x**

```python
# TensorFlow 2.x with tf.function
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def add_numbers(x, y):
  return x + y

a = tf.constant(2.0)
b = tf.constant(3.0)

result = add_numbers(a, b)

print("Result:", result.numpy()) # Output: Result: 5.0

#Attempting to access GraphDef on the function will fail because the function is a wrapper
#try:
#    graph_def = add_numbers.get_concrete_function(a,b).graph.as_graph_def() #AttributeError: 'ConcreteFunction' object has no attribute 'graph'
#except AttributeError as e:
#    print(e)

# Accessing GraphDef from the concrete function would still not give the user an accessible GraphDef object directly, 
# instead it only gives back the concrete function's graph.

```

Here, `@tf.function` decorates `add_numbers`, inducing graph tracing. When `add_numbers` is invoked, TensorFlow executes the traced graph internally. While a graph is created behind the scenes for optimization, it's not exposed directly via a `GraphDef`.  This graph creation and optimization happen under the hood without direct user interaction and hence the graph can only be accessed through the concrete function with no direct access to the `GraphDef`. Even attempting to acquire the `GraphDef` using the concrete function will fail because the return object is a `ConcreteFunction` instead of the function itself. This clearly illustrates that the `GraphDef` object, so prominent in 1.x, no longer serves as the key, user-facing interaction point.

In summation, the removal of the `GraphDef` attribute signifies a shift in the framework's core architecture. It's not simply the removal of a feature but a fundamental change in how TensorFlow represents and executes computation. This change was driven by the desire to offer a more intuitive and flexible user experience with eager execution.  While low-level graph optimizations are still in place via `tf.function` and the internal TensorFlow runtime, the explicit, user-facing manipulation of graph objects via `GraphDef` has been supplanted by a more dynamic and immediate computational model.

For further understanding of the evolution of TensorFlow, several resources can prove beneficial. I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, which thoroughly covers the changes introduced in version 2. The "TensorFlow 2.0 Migration Guide" provides specific insights into the architectural changes. Further, research publications related to the design decisions behind TensorFlow 2.x, particularly focusing on eager execution, can offer deeper context. Articles from researchers who actively develop and maintain the framework can also prove invaluable in understanding the shift from static graph construction to the current dynamic approach. Finally, exploring online courses that cover both TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x can highlight the practical differences and provide real-world examples of how to handle different approaches to computation in deep learning.
