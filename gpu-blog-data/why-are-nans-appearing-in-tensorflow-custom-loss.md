NaNs appearing during TensorFlow custom loss function training typically stem from numerical instability within the loss calculation itself.  In my experience debugging such issues across numerous projects—from large-scale image classification to complex reinforcement learning environments—the root cause frequently lies in undefined mathematical operations, such as division by zero or the logarithm of a non-positive value.  Addressing this necessitates a careful examination of the loss function's implementation and a systematic approach to identifying and mitigating these numerical pitfalls.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue is that TensorFlow, like most numerical computation libraries, handles undefined operations by producing NaN (Not a Number) values. These NaNs propagate through subsequent calculations, rapidly corrupting the entire training process.  Gradients become undefined, optimizer updates become erratic, and ultimately, the model's weights diverge to meaningless values.  The appearance of NaNs isn't merely an aesthetic problem; it indicates a fundamental flaw in the loss function's design or implementation.

Identifying the source requires a systematic debugging approach.  Firstly, meticulously review the mathematical expressions within your loss function. Look for potential sources of numerical instability. Common culprits include:

* **Division by zero or near-zero values:**  This often arises when calculating metrics like precision or recall, where denominators can become extremely small or zero.  Robust implementations incorporate safeguards to handle these cases gracefully.

* **Logarithm of non-positive values:**  The natural logarithm (and other logarithmic functions) is undefined for non-positive inputs. This frequently appears in likelihood-based losses, where probabilities (which should be between 0 and 1) might unexpectedly become zero or negative due to numerical precision errors or bugs in the model's prediction mechanism.

* **Exponentiation of large values:** Exponentiating large numbers can lead to overflow errors, resulting in `inf` (infinity) values, which then interact to produce NaNs.

* **Unexpected `inf` values:** Infinity values, while different from NaNs, can equally disrupt calculations and propagate to NaNs.  They typically arise from overflows or divisions by zero.

Secondly, consider the data itself.  Outliers or malformed data points can easily trigger these unstable operations. Data preprocessing and validation steps are crucial in preventing these scenarios.  A robust loss function should be resilient to noisy or anomalous inputs.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Handling Division by Zero**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def safe_divide(numerator, denominator, epsilon=1e-7):
  """Performs a numerically stable division."""
  return tf.divide(numerator, tf.maximum(denominator, epsilon))

def my_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  precision = safe_divide(tf.reduce_sum(y_true * y_pred), tf.reduce_sum(y_pred))
  # ... rest of the loss calculation ...
  return # ... complete loss function ...
```

This example demonstrates a safe division using `tf.maximum` to prevent division by zero.  The `epsilon` value acts as a small constant to avoid excessively small denominators, maintaining numerical stability.  This approach prevents NaNs from occurring when the denominator approaches zero.  Replacing a simple division with this function can resolve many NaN issues.


**Example 2: Handling Logarithms of Non-positive Values**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  probabilities = tf.clip_by_value(y_pred, 1e-7, 1.0 - 1e-7) # Clip to avoid log(0)
  loss = -tf.reduce_mean(y_true * tf.math.log(probabilities) + (1 - y_true) * tf.math.log(1 - probabilities))
  return loss
```

This demonstrates a common scenario:  the use of `tf.clip_by_value` to prevent taking the logarithm of zero or one.  Clipping ensures that probabilities remain within a safe range (excluding 0 and 1), preventing NaN production.  Note the use of a small `epsilon` to avoid values too close to 0 or 1, mitigating potential numerical issues.


**Example 3: Debugging with `tf.debugging.check_numerics`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def my_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  with tf.control_dependencies([tf.debugging.check_numerics(y_pred, "y_pred contains NaN or Inf")]):
    # ... Loss calculation ...
    return loss
```

This example employs `tf.debugging.check_numerics` to explicitly check for NaNs and infinities within the `y_pred` tensor.  The `control_dependencies` ensures this check executes before the loss calculation.  During training, this will raise an exception if NaNs or infinities are detected, pinpointing the precise location within the loss function where the problem originates.  This is an invaluable debugging technique.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on numerical stability and debugging.  Additionally, exploring resources on numerical methods and linear algebra, paying particular attention to error propagation and handling of edge cases, is highly beneficial.  Finally, a deep understanding of probability and statistics, especially related to probability distributions used in your model, proves invaluable.  These combined will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the source of errors in the loss function calculation.  Remember that careful analysis and structured debugging are key to resolving such issues.
