Ragged tensors, by their very definition, possess variable lengths along one or more dimensions, which directly complicates standard sampling procedures employed with uniformly shaped tensors. Standard techniques like index-based random sampling assume a fixed shape, thus necessitating a modified approach to handle the irregular nature of ragged tensors. Having implemented custom data loading pipelines for a variety of NLP tasks involving sequences of varying lengths, I've encountered this challenge frequently, and effective solutions revolve around combining indexing with appropriate masking.

Fundamentally, sampling a ragged tensor necessitates understanding its underlying structure. Each ragged dimension is defined by a set of row splits, indicating the start and end indices of sub-tensors within the flattened data. The core challenge is that a single, uniform sampling index cannot address all elements equitably across the varied row lengths. Consequently, we must generate indices relative to each row individually and then reconstruct the resulting ragged tensor. This process involves two critical steps: selecting row indices and sampling within those rows.

My typical approach involves first generating a set of random row indices. This part is relatively straightforward and can be accomplished via the random integer functionality offered by most deep learning libraries. However, we are dealing with a ragged tensor, so it's not enough to just have an index. Instead, we must sample the sub-tensors within these rows. Let us assume that we desire to perform a simple random sampling of the ragged tensor. First we need to identify where the rows begin and end, based on the `row_splits`. Then we need to select a number of samples from those indices. The final step is the reconstruct the tensor into the ragged format. In most practical applications, I have found that the uniform selection method works well. The other method involves weighted selection, where each row can be given different selection probability. But, for demonstration, I will stick with uniform selection method.

Let's explore this with several examples using TensorFlow, a framework I'm most comfortable with due to its robust ragged tensor support:

**Example 1: Uniform Sampling of Rows and Elements**

This example demonstrates how to sample a subset of rows from the ragged tensor and then sample randomly from each of those rows. This method assumes all rows are equally likely to be selected. The key part is to construct a new set of row splits based on our randomly sampled rows. Then we need to re-index and create the final ragged tensor.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def ragged_uniform_sampling(ragged_tensor, num_rows_to_sample, num_elements_per_row):
    """Samples rows and elements uniformly from a ragged tensor."""
    row_splits = ragged_tensor.row_splits
    num_rows = len(row_splits) - 1
    row_indices = tf.random.uniform(shape=[num_rows_to_sample], minval=0, maxval=num_rows, dtype=tf.int32)
    row_indices = tf.sort(row_indices) # Ensure indices are sorted for reconstruction

    sampled_row_splits = tf.gather(row_splits, row_indices)
    sampled_row_splits = tf.concat([[0], tf.gather(row_splits, row_indices+1)], axis=0)
    sampled_row_splits = tf.math.cumsum(sampled_row_splits, axis=0)

    output_rows = tf.TensorArray(dtype=ragged_tensor.dtype, size=0, dynamic_size=True)
    current_idx = 0

    for i in tf.range(num_rows_to_sample):
      start = row_splits[row_indices[i]]
      end = row_splits[row_indices[i]+1]
      row_length = end - start

      num_to_take = tf.minimum(num_elements_per_row, row_length)
      element_indices = tf.random.uniform(shape=[num_to_take], minval=0, maxval=row_length, dtype=tf.int32)
      element_indices = tf.sort(element_indices)
      
      row_values = tf.gather(ragged_tensor.flat_values[start:end], element_indices)
      output_rows = output_rows.write(current_idx,row_values)
      current_idx+=1
    
    output_ragged_tensor = tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_splits(
        values=output_rows.concat(),
        row_splits=sampled_row_splits[:-1]
    )

    return output_ragged_tensor

# Example Usage:
rt = tf.ragged.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4], [5, 6], [7,8,9,10]])
sampled_rt = ragged_uniform_sampling(rt, num_rows_to_sample=2, num_elements_per_row=2)
print(sampled_rt)
```

In the code, we first sample the row indices, sort them, and retrieve the corresponding `row_splits` based on these new indices. It constructs new row splits by cumulatively summing them. We iterate over the sampled rows to select element indices relative to each row. Finally, it creates a new ragged tensor from the extracted values and the new row splits. The output is a ragged tensor of a specified size and elements from the original.

**Example 2: Weighted Sampling of Rows**

In this example, we introduce a weighted row sampling mechanism, where each row has a different probability of being sampled. In specific use cases, especially when the data has imbalance across rows, this can be useful. The probabilities can be computed ahead of time or dynamically.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def ragged_weighted_sampling(ragged_tensor, num_rows_to_sample, weights, num_elements_per_row):
    """Samples rows from a ragged tensor with given weights."""
    row_splits = ragged_tensor.row_splits
    num_rows = len(row_splits) - 1
    row_indices = tf.random.categorical(tf.math.log([weights]), num_rows_to_sample)[0]
    row_indices = tf.sort(row_indices)

    sampled_row_splits = tf.gather(row_splits, row_indices)
    sampled_row_splits = tf.concat([[0], tf.gather(row_splits, row_indices+1)], axis=0)
    sampled_row_splits = tf.math.cumsum(sampled_row_splits, axis=0)

    output_rows = tf.TensorArray(dtype=ragged_tensor.dtype, size=0, dynamic_size=True)
    current_idx = 0

    for i in tf.range(num_rows_to_sample):
      start = row_splits[row_indices[i]]
      end = row_splits[row_indices[i]+1]
      row_length = end - start

      num_to_take = tf.minimum(num_elements_per_row, row_length)
      element_indices = tf.random.uniform(shape=[num_to_take], minval=0, maxval=row_length, dtype=tf.int32)
      element_indices = tf.sort(element_indices)
      
      row_values = tf.gather(ragged_tensor.flat_values[start:end], element_indices)
      output_rows = output_rows.write(current_idx,row_values)
      current_idx+=1
    
    output_ragged_tensor = tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_splits(
        values=output_rows.concat(),
        row_splits=sampled_row_splits[:-1]
    )

    return output_ragged_tensor

# Example usage
rt = tf.ragged.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4], [5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10]])
weights = [0.1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2]
sampled_rt = ragged_weighted_sampling(rt, num_rows_to_sample=2, weights=weights, num_elements_per_row=2)
print(sampled_rt)
```

In this code, the main change is the use of `tf.random.categorical` to sample rows based on the specified `weights`. This function samples based on the provided log probabilities. The rest of the process follows the same approach as Example 1 to sample from each row.

**Example 3: Sampling with fixed row length**

Sometimes the goal is to sample a uniform set of rows each with the same size. In this case, we need to sample the rows as in example 1. But before returning, we must pad/truncate all of the sub-tensors to the same length. This is common when creating batch for transformer model that can not easily accommodate inputs of varying size.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def ragged_fixed_length_sampling(ragged_tensor, num_rows_to_sample, target_length):
    """Samples rows and pads/truncates sub-tensors to a fixed length."""
    row_splits = ragged_tensor.row_splits
    num_rows = len(row_splits) - 1
    row_indices = tf.random.uniform(shape=[num_rows_to_sample], minval=0, maxval=num_rows, dtype=tf.int32)
    row_indices = tf.sort(row_indices)

    output_rows = tf.TensorArray(dtype=ragged_tensor.dtype, size=0, dynamic_size=True)
    current_idx = 0

    for i in tf.range(num_rows_to_sample):
        start = row_splits[row_indices[i]]
        end = row_splits[row_indices[i] + 1]
        row_values = ragged_tensor.flat_values[start:end]
        
        row_length = end - start

        if row_length < target_length:
          padding_length = target_length - row_length
          padding = tf.zeros(shape=[padding_length], dtype = ragged_tensor.dtype)
          row_values = tf.concat([row_values, padding], axis=0)
        elif row_length > target_length:
          row_values = row_values[:target_length]

        output_rows = output_rows.write(current_idx,row_values)
        current_idx+=1

    output_tensor = output_rows.stack()

    return output_tensor
    

# Example Usage:
rt = tf.ragged.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4], [5, 6], [7,8,9,10]])
sampled_tensor = ragged_fixed_length_sampling(rt, num_rows_to_sample=2, target_length=3)
print(sampled_tensor)
```

This code sample uses a uniform method of selecting the rows. It then truncates or pads to ensure all rows are of the same length before constructing a tensor from them. This method is often used for batching. It assumes the data to be of a numerical type.

These examples cover the basic sampling strategies Iâ€™ve employed. When selecting a method, consideration should always be given to the specific application and the underlying distribution of the data within the ragged tensor. Efficient sampling will be highly influenced by how the data is structured and stored.

For further study, I recommend consulting documentation on advanced indexing of ragged tensors, focusing on techniques for efficient gathering and scattering operations within a ragged structure. Additionally, research papers focusing on efficient data loading techniques for sequence-based models provide insights into common practices. These resources can expand knowledge beyond the simple sampling techniques I've discussed, providing a holistic view of ragged tensor manipulations.
