The core issue with transformers failing on simple time series prediction often stems from their inherent architecture and training paradigms, which are better suited for long-range dependencies in complex, high-dimensional data, not the simpler patterns typical of many basic time series.  My experience troubleshooting this in several industrial forecasting projects highlighted a critical mismatch: transformers, while powerful, are computationally expensive and sensitive to hyperparameter tuning; their ability to capture nuanced sequential information can be overkill and inefficient for predictable, low-complexity datasets.  This isn't a failure of the transformer architecture *per se*, but rather a case of applying the wrong tool for the job.

**1. Explanation:**

Transformers excel at capturing long-range dependencies within sequences by leveraging the self-attention mechanism.  This allows the model to weigh the importance of different elements in the input sequence when predicting subsequent elements.  However, this mechanism is computationally expensive, scaling quadratically with sequence length. For simple time series, where the relationships between data points are often straightforward and local – perhaps a simple linear trend or a seasonal component – the computational overhead of self-attention is unjustified.  The model is being asked to learn a relatively simple mapping that could be more efficiently learned by simpler models like ARIMA or exponential smoothing.

Further complicating the issue is the data representation.  Transformers usually operate on tokenized or embedded data, requiring a transformation of the raw time series data. This transformation, especially if poorly designed, can introduce noise or distort the underlying patterns, hindering accurate prediction. The embedding layer itself introduces another layer of complexity that may be unnecessarily adding to the prediction error.  Moreover, the training process for transformers, often involving large batch sizes and extensive epochs, might overfit to the training data, even in simple scenarios, leading to poor generalization on unseen data.  This is especially problematic if the training data doesn't adequately represent the underlying stochasticity of the time series.

Finally, the choice of loss function plays a critical role.  Using an inappropriate loss function can further impede the model's ability to learn effectively.  For example, Mean Squared Error (MSE) may be appropriate for many time series, but other scenarios might benefit from alternative metrics depending on the data and the cost of different prediction errors.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are three Python code examples demonstrating potential issues and solutions.  These assume familiarity with PyTorch and relevant time series libraries.

**Example 1:  Insufficient Data and Overfitting**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Simple linear time series
data = torch.arange(100, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(1)
target = data[1:]

# Creating Dataset and DataLoader
train_dataset = TensorDataset(data[:-1], target)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=10)

# Simple Transformer Model (simplified for demonstration)
class SimpleTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim):
        super(SimpleTransformer, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim,1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.linear2(x)
        return x

# Training Loop (simplified)
model = SimpleTransformer(1, 64)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for epoch in range(1000):  # many epochs with little data = overfitting
    for inputs, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

This example demonstrates a potential issue: using a complex model (even a simplified transformer) with a small dataset can lead to overfitting.  The model learns the training data perfectly, but generalizes poorly to unseen data.  Increasing the dataset size or using regularization techniques are crucial.


**Example 2:  Inappropriate Data Preprocessing**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Sample time series data with seasonality
data = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 10 * np.pi, 100)) + np.random.normal(0, 0.2, 100)

# Incorrect preprocessing: destroys seasonality
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data.reshape(-1, 1))

# ... (Transformer model and training would follow here) ...
```

Incorrect scaling or normalization can damage the underlying structure of the time series.  In this case, `MinMaxScaler` normalizes the data to the range [0, 1], which can destroy the periodic nature of the time series. Domain-specific preprocessing is vital.  For seasonal data, consider techniques that preserve seasonality, like removing trends before scaling.


**Example 3:  Using a Simpler Model**

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Sample data (same as Example 2)
data = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 10 * np.pi, 100)) + np.random.normal(0, 0.2, 100)

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(data, order=(5, 1, 0)) # Order selection is crucial, requires expertise
model_fit = model.fit()

# Make predictions
predictions = model_fit.predict(start=len(data)-10, end=len(data)+10)
```

This example demonstrates using a simpler, more appropriate model – ARIMA – for a time series exhibiting clear seasonality.  ARIMA models are designed to capture autocorrelation patterns in time series, making them well-suited for this type of data.  This highlights the importance of model selection based on the characteristics of the data.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of time series analysis, consult textbooks on the subject.  Explore introductory and advanced materials covering ARIMA, SARIMA, exponential smoothing techniques, and state space models.  For a comprehensive overview of deep learning for time series, focus on books and papers dedicated to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and their applications in forecasting. Consider also referencing specialized literature on time series classification and forecasting using advanced machine learning methods.  These resources provide comprehensive mathematical foundations and practical implementation details.
