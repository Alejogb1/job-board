Keras's flexibility extends beyond GPU acceleration; its core functionality remains potent even on CPU-bound systems.  My experience optimizing Keras models for resource-constrained environments, particularly during my work on a low-power embedded vision project, underscores this point.  While GPU acceleration dramatically improves training speed, particularly for deep networks, leveraging Keras effectively on CPUs solely involves strategic model design, efficient data handling, and careful consideration of library configurations.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

The perception that Keras inherently *requires* a GPU stems from the prevalence of GPU-accelerated training in deep learning.  However, the Keras API itself is agnostic to the underlying hardware.  The backend engine, such as TensorFlow or Theano, handles the computational workload.  If no GPU is detected, these backends automatically fall back to CPU computation.  This transition is seamless from a Keras perspective; the code remains unchanged.  Performance degradation is the primary consequence.  Training time will significantly increase, and the feasibility of training complex models within acceptable timeframes might be compromised.  However, for smaller models, data preprocessing, model inference, and even training on smaller datasets remain entirely viable using only CPU resources.

The key lies in optimization strategies.  For CPU training, focusing on efficient data preprocessing, leveraging smaller batch sizes to reduce memory demands, and selecting appropriate model architectures are crucial for maintaining reasonable training times.  Strategies like model quantization and pruning, usually employed for deployment to resource-constrained devices, can also benefit CPU-based training by reducing computational load.  Furthermore, utilizing TensorFlow's `tf.config.set_visible_devices` allows for explicit control over device allocation, ensuring Keras solely utilizes the available CPU cores.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Simple Sequential Model Training on CPU**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Verify CPU usage
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

# Define a simple sequential model
model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model (optimizer choice impacts CPU performance)
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate sample data (replace with your actual data)
x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 784)
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000), num_classes=10)

# Train the model (adjust epochs and batch_size for CPU performance)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

This example demonstrates a basic sequential model trained on randomly generated data.  The `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` line verifies the absence of GPUs.  The choice of optimizer (`adam` in this case) and batch size significantly affects CPU performance.  Experimentation with different optimizers (e.g., `SGD`) and smaller batch sizes (e.g., 16 or even 8) is recommended for CPUs.

**Example 2:  Data Preprocessing for CPU Efficiency**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Data augmentation (can be CPU intensive; adjust parameters carefully)
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True
)

# Generate batches of preprocessed data on-the-fly
train_generator = datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'path/to/your/images',
    target_size=(64, 64),
    batch_size=16,
    class_mode='categorical'
)

# Use train_generator in model.fit() instead of directly passing x_train and y_train.
# model.fit(train_generator, ...)
```

Efficient data preprocessing is paramount.  This example shows image augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator`.  However, extensive augmentation can be CPU-intensive.  Careful selection of augmentation parameters and batch size is vital.  Consider alternatives like pre-processing the entire dataset beforehand and saving it to disk if augmentation proves too demanding.

**Example 3:  Using a Smaller Model Architecture**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define a smaller CNN model
model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train as in Example 1.
model.compile(...)
model.fit(...)
```

This demonstrates a smaller Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  Reducing the number of layers, filters, and neurons within layers minimizes the computational demands.  Smaller models are inherently faster to train on CPUs, even with increased training epochs.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

*   **TensorFlow documentation:**  Deep dive into optimizer choices and performance tuning within the TensorFlow framework.
*   **Keras documentation:**  Understand the different Keras backends and how to configure them.
*   **"Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet:**  Provides a comprehensive understanding of Keras and model design principles.
*   **Online forums and communities:**  Engage with experienced Keras users to seek advice on CPU optimization strategies.


In summary, while a GPU significantly accelerates Keras training, productive development and deployment remain possible on CPU-only systems.  Strategic optimization techniques involving data preprocessing, model architecture selection, and efficient use of Keras and TensorFlow functionalities are key to mitigating the performance difference.  Remember to always profile your code to identify bottlenecks and tailor your optimization strategies accordingly. My own practical experience confirms that CPU-based Keras development is a viable path, demanding a more considered approach, but ultimately yielding functional and valuable results.
