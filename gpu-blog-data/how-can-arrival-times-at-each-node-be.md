The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) fundamentally hinges on minimizing the total distance traveled, not directly providing arrival times at each node.  While PuLP, a Python-based linear programming modeler, excels at optimization based on minimizing objective functions, incorporating explicit time constraints and deriving precise arrival times requires a slight shift in problem formulation.  My experience implementing routing solutions in large-scale logistics networks has shown that this involves extending the base TSP model to incorporate time windows and travel durations as crucial constraints and variables.

The core approach involves augmenting the standard TSP formulation with time-related variables.  We introduce a variable representing the arrival time at each node and constrain these times based on travel durations and any predefined time windows. This transforms the problem from a pure distance minimization into a constrained optimization problem that considers both distance and time.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The standard TSP uses a binary decision variable `x[i, j]` indicating whether the salesman travels directly from node `i` to node `j`.  To incorporate arrival times, we need a continuous variable `t[i]` representing the arrival time at node `i`.  The objective function remains minimization of total distance, but we now introduce constraints:

* **Travel Time Constraints:** The arrival time at node `j` (`t[j]`) must be greater than or equal to the arrival time at node `i` (`t[i]`) plus the travel time from `i` to `j` (`d[i, j]`). This is expressed as:  `t[j] ≥ t[i] + d[i, j]` for all `(i, j)` where `x[i, j] = 1`.  This constraint ensures that the arrival time respects the travel duration.

* **Time Window Constraints (Optional):**  If time windows are present for each node,  represented by `[a[i], b[i]]` (arrival allowed between `a[i]` and `b[i]`), we add constraints: `a[i] ≤ t[i] ≤ b[i]` for all nodes `i`. This ensures that the salesman arrives within the specified time window.

* **Departure Time at the Depot (Origin):** The arrival time at the starting node (depot, often node 0) is typically set to 0: `t[0] = 0`. This provides a base for calculating subsequent arrival times.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate the implementation using PuLP, illustrating the core concepts described above.  Each example builds upon the previous one, increasing complexity.


**Example 1: Basic TSP with Arrival Times (No Time Windows)**

```python
from pulp import *

# Problem Data (replace with your actual data)
nodes = range(5)
distances = {
    (0, 1): 10, (0, 2): 15, (0, 3): 20, (0, 4): 25,
    (1, 0): 10, (1, 2): 35, (1, 3): 25, (1, 4): 30,
    (2, 0): 15, (2, 1): 35, (2, 3): 30, (2, 4): 20,
    (3, 0): 20, (3, 1): 25, (3, 2): 30, (3, 4): 15,
    (4, 0): 25, (4, 1): 30, (4, 2): 20, (4, 3): 15
}

# Create the problem
prob = LpProblem("TSP_with_Times", LpMinimize)

# Decision variables
x = LpVariable.dicts("x", [(i, j) for i in nodes for j in nodes if i != j], 0, 1, LpBinary)
t = LpVariable.dicts("t", nodes, 0, None, LpContinuous)

# Objective function (minimize total distance)
prob += lpSum([distances[i, j] * x[i, j] for i in nodes for j in nodes if i != j]), "Total Distance"

# Constraints
# 1. Each node is visited exactly once (except depot which is implicitly handled)
for i in nodes:
    prob += lpSum([x[i, j] for j in nodes if i != j]) == 1
for j in nodes:
    prob += lpSum([x[i, j] for i in nodes if i != j]) == 1

# 2. Time constraints
for i in nodes:
    for j in nodes:
        if i != j:
            prob += t[j] >= t[i] + distances[i, j] - 100000*(1-x[i,j]) #Big M method for handling only active arcs

# 3. Set departure time from depot to 0
prob += t[0] == 0


prob.solve()
print("Status:", LpStatus[prob.status])
print("Total Distance:", value(prob.objective))
for i in nodes:
    print(f"Arrival Time at Node {i}: {value(t[i])}")

```

**Example 2:  Incorporating Time Windows**

This example adds time window constraints.  Note the `time_windows` dictionary defining the allowed arrival time intervals for each node.

```python
#... (Problem data from Example 1) ...
time_windows = {
    0: [0, float('inf')],  # Depot: any time
    1: [10, 20],
    2: [15, 25],
    3: [20, 30],
    4: [25, 35]
}

#... (Decision variables from Example 1) ...

#... (Objective function from Example 1) ...

# Constraints (modified to include time windows)
#... (Constraints 1 and 2 from Example 1) ...

# 3. Time window constraints
for i in nodes:
    prob += t[i] >= time_windows[i][0]
    prob += t[i] <= time_windows[i][1]


#... (Solve and print results as in Example 1) ...
```

**Example 3: Handling Subtours (using MTZ subtour elimination)**

The Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) formulation effectively prevents subtours, a common issue in TSP implementations.  This example integrates MTZ with the time constraints.

```python
#... (Problem data and time windows from Example 2) ...

# Decision variables (adding u variables for MTZ)
x = LpVariable.dicts("x", [(i, j) for i in nodes for j in nodes if i != j], 0, 1, LpBinary)
t = LpVariable.dicts("t", nodes, 0, None, LpContinuous)
u = LpVariable.dicts("u", nodes, 0, len(nodes), LpInteger) #MTZ variables


#... (Objective function from Example 1) ...

# Constraints
# 1. Each node is visited exactly once (as before)
#... (Constraints 1 from Example 1) ...

# 2. Time constraints (as before)
#... (Constraints 2 from Example 2) ...

# 3. Time window constraints (as before)
#... (Constraints 3 from Example 2) ...

# 4. MTZ subtour elimination constraints
for i in nodes:
    for j in nodes:
        if i != j and i != 0 and j != 0:
            prob += u[i] - u[j] + len(nodes) * x[i, j] <= len(nodes) - 1

#5. Departure time from depot to 0 (as before)
#... (Constraints 3 from Example 1) ...

#... (Solve and print results as in Example 1) ...

```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding of linear programming and the TSP, I recommend consulting textbooks on operations research and combinatorial optimization.  Specifically, search for resources covering network flow problems, integer programming, and the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation.  PuLP's documentation provides detailed information on the library's capabilities and usage.  Familiarizing yourself with different constraint programming techniques will enhance your ability to model and solve complex optimization problems effectively.  Reviewing examples of TSP implementations in other languages, like C++ using specialized solvers, can offer comparative insights into algorithm efficiency.
