The discrepancy between a Docker image containing the correct source code and exhibiting incorrect execution stems primarily from the containerized environment’s runtime context, specifically its interactions with the build process and underlying file systems. My experience troubleshooting such issues has repeatedly highlighted that focusing solely on the source code within the image is insufficient; we must also examine how that code was layered, how the entrypoint is configured, and how changes made at runtime might be obscuring the expected behavior.

The core problem frequently lies in the difference between the image’s filesystem *as constructed at build time* and its state when a container is launched. Docker images consist of layers, each representing an instruction from the `Dockerfile`. Changes to files, package installations, or environment variable settings are all captured in these layers. Crucially, layers are immutable; once built, a layer cannot be modified. When a container is launched from an image, it starts with a read-only version of this layered filesystem and creates a thin, writable layer on top. Any changes the application makes during runtime occur in *this* writable layer. This explains why simply “inspecting” an image with `docker run --rm -it image bash` might not reveal the source of a problem – the running container's state diverges from the image itself.

Therefore, issues where the wrong code is executed often manifest in the following common scenarios:

**1. Caching Issues During Image Builds:** Docker builds leverage caching to accelerate the process. If a layer isn't updated – either due to changes in the Dockerfile instructions or changes in the context – Docker will reuse a cached version of that layer. If the source code changes but the `COPY` instruction's source path hasn't changed, Docker might use the cached, old source code layer, resulting in an image that seemingly has the “correct” code based on later inspection. Let’s say we have a Python application with `app.py`:

```python
# app.py - Initial version
print("Hello, World!")
```

And a simple Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY app.py .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

We build this with `docker build -t my-app .`. Now, let's modify `app.py`:

```python
# app.py - Modified version
print("Hello, Container!")
```

If we simply run `docker build -t my-app .` again, Docker, seeing no change in the `COPY` instruction’s source, often reuses the cached layer where `app.py` was `print("Hello, World!")`. The resultant image will still run the old version. The fix is to invalidate the cache by making a cosmetic change to the Dockerfile or using `--no-cache` during build. This forces Docker to re-evaluate the instructions, including the source file copying.

**2. Incorrect `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` Instructions:** Docker's `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions define how a containerized application starts. A misconfigured entrypoint or command can lead to the execution of a script different from the intended application, even if that correct application is present within the image. Imagine our Python application lives in a subdirectory `src` and the `Dockerfile` is in the root:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY src .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

This will result in `FileNotFoundError` because `app.py` isn't directly in `/app`. We would need to either correct the command to `CMD ["python", "src/app.py"]` or copy the file structure into the container correctly using `COPY src src/`. Another common error is overwriting the `CMD` via command-line arguments when launching the container.

Let's examine a more complex example. Suppose we are launching a Node.js application packaged via `npm`.  Here’s a common `Dockerfile` with an error:

```dockerfile
FROM node:16

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Assuming `package.json` specifies `"start": "node index.js"`, you’d expect `index.js` to run. However, if the `WORKDIR` is forgotten, the `npm install` is executed in the wrong context and all `node_modules` will not be present where the app expects them. This error won’t immediately be obvious when inspecting the image and examining `index.js`, thus creating the appearance of incorrect execution despite correct source. The correct Dockerfile should explicitly set the working directory and copy source into the correct location with `COPY . .`.

**3. Changes Made at Runtime Overwriting Expected Code:** As noted, the container writes changes in a separate layer. While this is expected, it can lead to subtle issues. If, for instance, the containerized application generates or overwrites configuration or code files during runtime, what we inspect from the image will be *different* from what we see during its run.

Let's consider a scenario where a Java application within the Docker container dynamically generates a configuration file based on environment variables:

```java
// Configuration.java - simplified
public class Configuration {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String configValue = System.getenv("CONFIG_VALUE");
        // This part simulates a file write
        System.out.println("Config file was updated with: " + configValue);
    }
}
```

The Dockerfile looks like this:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN javac Configuration.java

CMD ["java", "Configuration"]
```

We build this, and run with `docker run -e CONFIG_VALUE=from_env my-java`. If the application were to create and write to a `configuration.properties` file based on `CONFIG_VALUE`, subsequent runs (assuming the container persists) would use the *overwritten* file, despite the original version being in the image. If a new run uses a different environment variable and is not persistent, we would see a different behaviour. This is not because the image has the wrong code, but that the runtime environment has changed. Similarly, if the running application directly overwrites portions of its own code (this is admittedly very unusual), this effect would be indistinguishable from having the wrong code.

**Recommended Resources:**

To further understand and mitigate these issues, I suggest examining in detail documentation on the following concepts: Dockerfile best practices (especially focusing on layer caching and instruction order), Docker’s build process (including the use of contexts), container lifecycle,  the difference between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` and their impact on application execution, and container persistence, including how changes are persisted at runtime. Specific resources covering Docker debugging techniques and best practices for handling environment variables during containerized application startup should also be examined. Furthermore, understanding how Docker volumes interact with container filesystems is critical to troubleshooting similar issues. While tooling like `dive` can provide a visual layer breakdown of images, a solid conceptual understanding will prove far more valuable.

In conclusion, when encountering instances where a Docker image appears to execute incorrect code, a holistic investigation of the entire build process, entrypoint definitions, and potential runtime side-effects is essential. Focusing solely on the source code’s presence within the image is frequently insufficient and often leads down incorrect diagnostic paths.
