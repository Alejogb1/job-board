The absence of gradients when using `tf.optimizers.Adam.minimize` stems fundamentally from a misunderstanding of the optimizer's role and TensorFlow's execution model.  `tf.optimizers.Adam.minimize` doesn't *provide* gradients; it *utilizes* them.  The gradients are computed independently, usually through TensorFlow's automatic differentiation capabilities, and then passed to the optimizer for weight updates.  In my experience debugging large-scale neural networks, this distinction has been crucial in resolving numerous training-related issues.  The optimizer itself is merely a mechanism for applying these pre-calculated gradients, not a generator of them.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's `GradientTape` context manager is the key to understanding gradient computation.  `tf.GradientTape` records operations performed within its scope.  When `tape.gradient` is called, it uses the recorded operations to compute the gradients of a target tensor with respect to source tensors (typically model variables). These computed gradients are then supplied to `tf.optimizers.Adam.minimize`. The optimizer doesn't intrinsically know how to calculate gradients; itâ€™s designed to apply optimization algorithms (like Adam) based on pre-computed gradient information.

Failure to see gradients often arises from one of three scenarios:

a) **Incorrect Tape Usage:** The most common error is placing the model's forward pass outside the `GradientTape` context. The tape must record the operations that generate the loss function which is subsequently used to compute gradients.

b) **Persistent=False (Default):**  `GradientTape`'s default `persistent` parameter is `False`. This means the tape is deleted after the gradients are computed. Attempting to access gradients after exiting the tape's context will result in an error.

c) **Gradient Masking:**  Certain operations (like `tf.stop_gradient`) deliberately prevent gradient computation for specific tensors. This is often used in techniques like adversarial training or when certain parts of the model shouldn't be trained.  This isn't an error, but rather an intentional design choice.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Define optimizer
optimizer = tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

# Sample data
x = tf.random.normal((100, 10))
y = tf.random.normal((100, 1))

# Training loop
for i in range(100):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(x)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(predictions - y)) # Mean Squared Error

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: Loss = {loss.numpy()}")

```

This example correctly uses `GradientTape` to compute gradients and then applies them using the optimizer.  The `zip` function pairs the computed gradients with the model's trainable variables, ensuring correct weight updates. The loss is calculated and printed for monitoring purposes.  Crucially, the model's forward pass is within the `GradientTape` context, allowing proper gradient recording.


**Example 2: Incorrect Tape Usage (Common Error)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (model and optimizer definition as in Example 1) ...

for i in range(100):
    predictions = model(x) # Forward pass OUTSIDE GradientTape!
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(predictions - y))

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables) #This will likely be None
    # ... (rest of the training loop) ...
```

This code demonstrates a typical mistake.  The forward pass is executed *before* the `GradientTape` context.  Consequently, the `tape` doesn't record the necessary operations to compute the gradients of `loss` with respect to the model's variables.  `tape.gradient` will likely return `None` or raise an error, leading to the impression that no gradients are being provided.


**Example 3: Demonstrating `tf.stop_gradient`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (model and optimizer definition as in Example 1) ...

# Let's assume a scenario where we want to stop gradients for a specific layer
for i in range(100):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        intermediate_output = model.layers[0](x) # Output from the first layer
        stopped_output = tf.stop_gradient(intermediate_output) # Stops gradient flow here
        final_output = model.layers[1](stopped_output)
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(final_output - y))

    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    #Gradients for the first layer will be None, only the second layer will update.
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: Loss = {loss.numpy()}")
```

Here, we illustrate `tf.stop_gradient`.  The gradient calculation for the first layer is explicitly prevented. While gradients are still *computed*, they are effectively nullified for a specific part of the model.  This results in only the second layer's weights being updated during training.  This isn't a failure, but a deliberate control mechanism.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, especially sections related to `GradientTape`, automatic differentiation, and optimizers, should be your primary resource.  Furthermore,  carefully studying the source code of established TensorFlow model implementations (like those found in TensorFlow Hub or Keras applications) can provide invaluable insights into best practices.  Finally,  reviewing materials on the backpropagation algorithm and the mathematical underpinnings of gradient descent will solidify your understanding of the underlying principles.  These sources, combined with diligent debugging, will equip you to effectively address issues concerning gradient computation in TensorFlow.
