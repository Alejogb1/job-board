The crucial detail concerning VoiceOver's language handling with `aria-live` regions and differing page languages lies in its reliance on the `lang` attribute inheritance and its interpretation within the accessibility tree.  VoiceOver doesn't directly inherit the `lang` attribute from the parent element for `aria-live` regions; instead, it prioritizes the attribute present on the `aria-live` element itself.  This often leads to unexpected behavior if not explicitly managed.  My experience working on multilingual accessibility projects for financial institutions has highlighted this frequently.  Overcoming this requires careful structuring of the HTML and, in some cases, careful JavaScript manipulation.


**1. Clear Explanation**

The VoiceOver screen reader, when encountering `aria-live` regions, constructs an accessibility tree reflecting the structure of the page.  This tree is used to determine how to render the content audibly.  Each node in this tree has associated properties, including language information. If an `aria-live` element doesn't have a `lang` attribute explicitly set, VoiceOver will attempt to infer it.  This inference process can be unreliable, especially across language boundaries.  With the page's `lang` set to `nl` (Dutch), VoiceOver might use Dutch for all content *unless* overridden on the `aria-live` element.  Therefore, the solution involves setting the `lang` attribute of the `aria-live` element to the desired language for VoiceOver announcement. This will then override the implicit inheritance from the parent element that has `lang="nl"`.

To ensure consistent VoiceOver announcements in a specific language, regardless of the surrounding page language, the `lang` attribute *must* be explicitly declared within the `aria-live` region.  This attribute directly instructs VoiceOver on the appropriate language for text synthesis.  Furthermore, ensuring semantic correctness by using appropriately localized content within the `aria-live` region is crucial for accuracy and user experience.  Simply changing the `lang` attribute without properly translating the content will result in the correct language being read but with nonsensical text.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Correct Implementation**

```html
<div lang="nl">
  <p>Dit is een Nederlandse zin.</p>
  <div aria-live="assertive" lang="en">
    <p>This is an English announcement.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Nog een Nederlandse zin.</p>
</div>
```

This example demonstrates the correct approach. The main content is in Dutch (`lang="nl"`).  The `aria-live` region, however, is explicitly set to English (`lang="en"`). VoiceOver will announce "This is an English announcement" in English, regardless of the surrounding Dutch text.


**Example 2: Incorrect Implementation Leading to Dutch Announcements**

```html
<div lang="nl">
  <p>Dit is een Nederlandse zin.</p>
  <div aria-live="assertive">
    <p>This is an English announcement.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Nog een Nederlandse zin.</p>
</div>
```

Here, the `aria-live` region lacks a `lang` attribute.  VoiceOver might default to the parent's language (Dutch), announcing "This is an English announcement" in Dutch, leading to a broken user experience.  This is precisely the issue the original question is addressing.


**Example 3: JavaScript-based Dynamic Language Switching (Advanced)**

```javascript
function updateLiveRegionLanguage(languageCode) {
  const liveRegion = document.getElementById('liveRegion');
  liveRegion.setAttribute('lang', languageCode);
  //  Update the content of the live region with localized text here if needed.
}


// Example usage:  Switching to English
updateLiveRegionLanguage('en');


// HTML structure
<div lang="nl" id="mainContent">
  <p>Dit is een Nederlandse zin.</p>
</div>
<div id="liveRegion" aria-live="assertive" lang="nl"></div>

```

This example demonstrates a more complex scenario where the language of the `aria-live` region might need to change dynamically based on user actions or other events. The JavaScript function `updateLiveRegionLanguage` allows for programmatic control over the `lang` attribute of the `aria-live` region.  It's crucial to ensure corresponding content updates alongside language changes to maintain accuracy.  Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual localization handling.  This approach is especially relevant for applications that require changing the language during runtime.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further in-depth understanding, I recommend consulting the official W3C specifications for ARIA, specifically the sections on `aria-live` and the `lang` attribute.  Furthermore, studying the Apple accessibility guidelines for VoiceOver will provide a clearer picture of how VoiceOver interprets these attributes.  Thoroughly investigating the accessibility APIs offered by your target platform will help in building robust, accessible applications. Finally, testing with various screen readers and users with disabilities is essential to validate the effectiveness of your implementation.  Remember that rigorous testing, including user feedback, is crucial for ensuring true accessibility.
