TensorFlow 2.3's hybrid execution model, allowing both eager and graph (non-eager) execution, presents unique challenges.  My experience troubleshooting these issues, primarily stemming from projects involving large-scale image classification and time-series forecasting, highlights a critical point: inconsistent context management is the root cause of most errors.  The problem arises when operations intended for eager execution are inadvertently integrated into a graph context, or vice-versa, leading to inconsistencies in variable creation, tensor handling, and operation scheduling.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's eager execution computes operations immediately, providing interactive debugging capabilities.  Conversely, graph execution compiles a computational graph before execution, optimizing performance for larger models and deployments.  In TensorFlow 2.3, the default is eager execution.  However, certain functionalities, like `tf.function` (a crucial tool for performance optimization), create a graph context.  Errors manifest when code assumes a consistent execution mode throughout, ignoring the implicit shifts between eager and graph execution.  These inconsistencies can lead to:

* **`AttributeError`**:  This commonly arises when attempting to access attributes of tensors within a `tf.function` that are not properly defined within the graph context.  For example, attempting to access a variable's gradient outside of a `tf.GradientTape` context within a `tf.function` will fail.

* **`TypeError`**:  Type mismatches can occur when eager and graph tensors interact, particularly when implicitly converting between NumPy arrays and TensorFlow tensors.  The graph execution environment has stricter type constraints.

* **`ValueError`**:  These often indicate shape mismatches or other inconsistencies between tensors created in different execution modes.  For instance, attempting to concatenate a tensor created eagerly with one created within a `tf.function` might fail if the shapes are not compatible within the graph execution context.

* **Unexpected behavior**: Subtler problems involve incorrect variable initialization or updating. If a variable is modified in eager execution but not reflected in the corresponding graph, the graph may operate on stale data.


Resolving these necessitates careful control of the execution context.  Always explicitly define the scope of eager and graph operations to avoid unintended interactions.  Leveraging `tf.function` judiciously and understanding its implications is vital.  Furthermore, using appropriate debugging techniques, like printing tensor shapes and types at various points, is key to pinpointing the source of errors.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Incorrect usage of variables within `tf.function`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

v = tf.Variable(0.0)

@tf.function
def add_one():
  v.assign_add(1.0)  # This works correctly
  print(v.numpy())  # This might produce an error outside eager context

add_one()
print(v.numpy()) # This will print 1.0

#But the following will likely raise an error
@tf.function
def incorrect_usage():
  v = tf.Variable(1.0) #new variable, only within scope of tf.function
  return v

incorrect_usage()
print(v.numpy()) # This likely throws an error, as the outer 'v' is different from inside the function
```

**Commentary:** The `add_one` function demonstrates the correct way to modify a variable within a `tf.function`. The variable `v` is defined outside the function, and its modification is reflected correctly.  The `incorrect_usage` function, however, defines a new variable `v` locally, thereby not affecting the outer `v`. This highlights the critical aspect of variable scope management.


**Example 2: Type mismatch between Eager and Graph execution:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

@tf.function
def graph_op(x):
  return tf.cast(x, tf.float32) #Ensures it's a Tensorflow float

eager_tensor = tf.constant(np.array([1,2,3]), dtype=tf.int32)
graph_tensor = graph_op(eager_tensor)

print(graph_tensor.dtype) #tf.float32
print(eager_tensor.dtype) #tf.int32

combined = tf.concat([eager_tensor, graph_tensor], axis=0) #Raises error without type conversion
```

**Commentary:** This illustrates a type mismatch. `eager_tensor` is an integer tensor, while the output of `graph_op`, `graph_tensor`, is explicitly cast to a float. Attempting to concatenate them directly without explicit type conversion will likely raise a `TypeError`.  Always ensure type consistency when combining tensors from different execution contexts.

**Example 3: Shape mismatch due to implicit broadcasting:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def graph_op(x):
  return x + tf.constant([1.0, 2.0])  #Broadcasting might fail

eager_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
graph_tensor = graph_op(eager_tensor)

print(graph_tensor) #Broadcasting is likely to work
eager_tensor2 = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0])
graph_tensor2 = graph_op(eager_tensor2) # This might raise ValueError if not carefully handled

print(graph_tensor2) #Could cause ValueError if the shape isn't managed correctly

```

**Commentary:** Broadcasting, while convenient, can lead to unexpected shape mismatches if not carefully managed. In this example, adding a rank-1 tensor to a rank-2 tensor within a `tf.function` might work due to implicit broadcasting.  However, ensuring explicit shape compatibility before combining tensors from different execution modes is the best practice for avoiding `ValueError` exceptions.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on `tf.function`, automatic control dependency, and variable management, are crucial.  Beyond that, books focusing on TensorFlow 2.x internals and advanced topics provide deeper insights into execution control.   Furthermore,  reviewing the TensorFlow source code related to the execution engine can be illuminating for advanced debugging and understanding the underlying mechanisms.  Finally, utilizing a robust debugger, such as the one integrated within most IDEs, alongside print statements for intermediate tensor information, is essential for effectively diagnosing these types of errors.
