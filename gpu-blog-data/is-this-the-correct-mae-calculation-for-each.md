The provided MAE calculation, while superficially correct, suffers from a critical flaw stemming from the aggregation method when dealing with data subsets.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues in large-scale regression model evaluations, particularly within the context of geographically partitioned datasets for a national weather prediction model, highlights this oversight.  The problem lies not in the individual MAE computation for each subset, but in the subsequent merging of these individual results to obtain an overall MAE.  Simply averaging subset MAEs, a common mistake, introduces a bias dependent on the size of each subset.

The correct approach involves calculating the MAE across the entire dataset, then optionally calculating subset MAEs for analysis but *not* averaging those subset MAEs to represent overall performance.  The average of individual subset MAEs will accurately reflect the average error *within each subset*, but it will not accurately reflect the overall average absolute error across the entire dataset.  This is because subsets with more data points will disproportionately influence the average of the subset MAEs, giving them undue weight in the overall error assessment.  A large subset with a small error will artificially lower the averaged MAE, masking potentially high error in smaller subsets.

Let me clarify with a breakdown and code examples.  Assume we have a dataset containing predictions (`y_pred`) and true values (`y_true`).  We partition this dataset into three subsets: A, B, and C.

**1. Correct MAE Calculation:**

The accurate method calculates the MAE for the entire dataset in a single step. This avoids the bias introduced by averaging subset MAEs weighted by subset size.

```python
import numpy as np

def mae_calculation(y_true, y_pred):
    """Calculates the Mean Absolute Error (MAE)."""
    return np.mean(np.abs(y_true - y_pred))

# Example Data
y_true = np.array([10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 32, 35, 38, 40, 42, 45])
y_pred = np.array([11, 10, 16, 17, 19, 23, 24, 27, 31, 30, 34, 39, 41, 40, 46])

#Overall MAE
overall_mae = mae_calculation(y_true, y_pred)
print(f"Overall MAE: {overall_mae}")


# Subset division (for illustrative purposes;  in a real application, this would be determined by your data partitioning logic)
subset_A_true = y_true[:5]
subset_A_pred = y_pred[:5]
subset_B_true = y_true[5:10]
subset_B_pred = y_pred[5:10]
subset_C_true = y_true[10:]
subset_C_pred = y_pred[10:]

# Subset MAEs (for informational purposes only; not to be averaged)
mae_A = mae_calculation(subset_A_true, subset_A_pred)
mae_B = mae_calculation(subset_B_true, subset_B_pred)
mae_C = mae_calculation(subset_C_true, subset_C_pred)

print(f"MAE Subset A: {mae_A}")
print(f"MAE Subset B: {mae_B}")
print(f"MAE Subset C: {mae_C}")

```

This code first calculates the overall MAE and then calculates the MAE for each subset. Notice that the subset MAEs are only for analysis and are *not* averaged.  The overall MAE provides the accurate metric for evaluating model performance.



**2. Incorrect MAE Calculation (Averaging Subset MAEs):**

This demonstrates the flawed approach of averaging subset MAEs, highlighting its inaccuracy.

```python
import numpy as np

# ... (same mae_calculation function and example data as above) ...

# Subset MAEs (as calculated above)
# ...

# Incorrect averaging of subset MAEs
incorrect_mae = np.mean([mae_A, mae_B, mae_C])
print(f"Incorrectly Averaged MAE: {incorrect_mae}")

```

This code showcases the incorrect method, where the average of the individual subset MAEs (`incorrect_mae`) is calculated.  This value will likely differ from the true overall MAE, depending on the relative sizes of subsets A, B, and C.

**3. Weighted Average of Subset MAEs (Still Incorrect for Overall Performance):**

Even a weighted average, while improving on the simple average, does not represent the true overall MAE. The weighting by subset size is an attempt to correct the bias, but it is still an indirect approach prone to error propagation.

```python
import numpy as np

# ... (same mae_calculation function, example data, and subset MAEs as above) ...

# Subset sizes
size_A = len(subset_A_true)
size_B = len(subset_B_true)
size_C = len(subset_C_true)
total_size = size_A + size_B + size_C

# Weighted average of subset MAEs
weighted_mae = (mae_A * size_A + mae_B * size_B + mae_C * size_C) / total_size
print(f"Weighted Average MAE: {weighted_mae}")
```

This example demonstrates a weighted average calculation, giving each subset MAE a weight proportional to its size. While closer to the true MAE than the unweighted average, it remains an indirect calculation and may still deviate from the true overall MAE due to accumulated rounding errors and the underlying methodology. The best approach remains a direct calculation across the entire dataset.


**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of MAE and its applications, I suggest consulting standard statistical textbooks focusing on regression analysis and model evaluation.  Refer to the documentation for your chosen numerical computation library (e.g., NumPy, SciPy) for details on their respective functions for calculating mean absolute error.  Finally, explore academic papers on model evaluation metrics within your specific domain for nuanced considerations and advanced techniques.  A thorough understanding of these resources will equip you to handle complex scenarios and avoid pitfalls such as those highlighted above.  Remember, always prioritize direct, unambiguous calculations over indirect methods prone to biases and inaccuracies.
