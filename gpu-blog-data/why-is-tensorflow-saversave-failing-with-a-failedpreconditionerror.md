In my experience working with TensorFlow model checkpointing, a `FailedPreconditionError` originating from `Saver.save()` due to a file access conflict generally points to concurrent write attempts to the same checkpoint files. TensorFlow's `Saver` operations are inherently not thread-safe when targeting the same location, and attempting to write from multiple processes or threads simultaneously is the core cause. This error is not about an inherently corrupt checkpoint, but rather arises from the race condition during the saving process.

The issue manifests because the `Saver.save()` operation performs a multi-step procedure, creating several individual files within the designated directory, including `.index`, `.data`, and `.meta` files. This is not an atomic operation, and if two processes try to initiate this sequence concurrently targeting the same directory and file prefix, they will inevitably interfere with one another, leading to corrupted or incomplete checkpoints, and ultimately trigger the `FailedPreconditionError`. The error message commonly indicates that a file is currently being used by another process, which is precisely what occurs when simultaneous `Saver.save()` operations contend for the same resources.

Furthermore, this is not necessarily limited to obvious multi-process scenarios. Even single-process applications can trigger this under circumstances such as:

1.  **Multiple Training Loops:** If the checkpoint saving logic is erroneously triggered in multiple training loops or at multiple times within the same process due to asynchronous calls or an incorrect coding structure, they will conflict with one another.
2.  **Background Processes:** Occasionally, background processes related to model evaluation or asynchronous reporting may inadvertently attempt checkpoint saves to the same location.
3.  **Interleaved Model Operations:** Complex models employing techniques like distributed training can sometimes lead to race conditions if proper synchronization or checkpoint coordination is not implemented, which are also situations that can lead to the problem at hand.

To remediate this `FailedPreconditionError`, the key is to implement some form of resource locking or synchronization to prevent concurrent saves. Here are a few typical strategies I've employed successfully:

**1. Centralized Checkpointing with Lock (if possible):**

If all saving operations happen under the control of a single manager component, we can introduce a simple mutual exclusion lock, such as the `threading.Lock` in python, to ensure only one save operation happens at any given time.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import threading
import os

class CheckpointManager:
    def __init__(self, checkpoint_dir, model, checkpoint_prefix="model_checkpoint"):
        self.saver = tf.train.Saver()
        self.checkpoint_dir = checkpoint_dir
        self.checkpoint_prefix = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, checkpoint_prefix)
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

    def save_checkpoint(self, session, global_step):
        with self.lock:
            self.saver.save(session, self.checkpoint_prefix, global_step=global_step)

    def restore_checkpoint(self, session):
      latest_checkpoint = tf.train.latest_checkpoint(self.checkpoint_dir)
      if latest_checkpoint:
         self.saver.restore(session, latest_checkpoint)
         print(f"Checkpoint restored from {latest_checkpoint}")
      else:
        print("No checkpoint found to restore.")


# Example usage (single process, single model)

#Assuming a TF session and model exists
# session = ...
# model = ...
# global_step = ...

checkpoint_dir = "./checkpoints"
if not os.path.exists(checkpoint_dir):
   os.makedirs(checkpoint_dir)

checkpoint_manager = CheckpointManager(checkpoint_dir, model)

#Example of saving. Should only be called in one specific loop
def train_loop():
    global global_step
    for _ in range(10): #example training iterations
         #training operations
        global_step += 1
        if (global_step % 2 == 0):
            checkpoint_manager.save_checkpoint(session, global_step) #protected by lock

#Example of restoring:
def restore_model():
    checkpoint_manager.restore_checkpoint(session)


#In a test environment, calling the train loop and restore function sequentially should work, assuming session and model are defined above.
# train_loop()
# restore_model()
```

In the above implementation, the `CheckpointManager` uses `threading.Lock`. The lock guarantees that when multiple threads within a single process want to save, only one call will proceed to the saver while all other are blocked. This avoids race conditions. This is important because while a Tensorflow graph has session objects, the saver works through the operating system's file API so it is process based, not limited to Tensorflow operations. I have personally used this approach on more than one occasion in projects.

**2. Unique Checkpoint File Names:**

If complete control over every saving location is not feasible, we can introduce time stamps or other unique identifiers into the checkpoint file prefix. This prevents conflicts as two operations will save to uniquely identified locations, avoiding the contention over resource.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import datetime
import os

class UniqueCheckpointManager:
    def __init__(self, checkpoint_dir, model, checkpoint_prefix="model_checkpoint"):
      self.saver = tf.train.Saver()
      self.checkpoint_dir = checkpoint_dir
      self.checkpoint_prefix = checkpoint_prefix

    def save_checkpoint(self, session, global_step):
      timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
      unique_prefix = os.path.join(self.checkpoint_dir, f"{self.checkpoint_prefix}_{timestamp}")
      self.saver.save(session, unique_prefix, global_step = global_step)

    def get_latest_checkpoint(self):
        checkpoint_files = [f for f in os.listdir(self.checkpoint_dir) if f.startswith(self.checkpoint_prefix) and f.endswith('.meta')]
        if not checkpoint_files:
            return None

        # Assuming the timestamp is at the end of the file before the .meta ext
        checkpoint_files.sort(key=lambda x: x.split('_')[-1].split(".")[0], reverse=True)
        latest_prefix = checkpoint_files[0].replace(".meta", "")
        latest_full_path = os.path.join(self.checkpoint_dir, latest_prefix)

        return latest_full_path

    def restore_checkpoint(self, session):
      latest_checkpoint = self.get_latest_checkpoint()
      if latest_checkpoint:
        self.saver.restore(session, latest_checkpoint)
        print(f"Checkpoint restored from {latest_checkpoint}")
      else:
        print("No checkpoint found to restore.")

# Example usage
# Assuming TF session and model exists
# session = ...
# model = ...
# global_step = ...

checkpoint_dir = "./unique_checkpoints"
if not os.path.exists(checkpoint_dir):
    os.makedirs(checkpoint_dir)
checkpoint_manager = UniqueCheckpointManager(checkpoint_dir, model)

def train_loop():
   global global_step
   for _ in range(10):
        #training operations
        global_step +=1
        if (global_step % 2 == 0):
            checkpoint_manager.save_checkpoint(session, global_step)

def restore_model():
     checkpoint_manager.restore_checkpoint(session)


#In a test environment, calling the train loop and restore function sequentially should work, assuming session and model are defined above.
# train_loop()
# restore_model()
```

This approach avoids contention by creating unique files, however, you would also need to develop logic to correctly identify and restore the last valid checkpoint ( as demonstrated in the `get_latest_checkpoint()` method). In past projects I have found this to be useful when I cannot modify all the parts of the project accessing the saver, for example, in code using asynchronous model evaluation in another thread.

**3. External Locking Mechanism:**

In distributed or complex environments, relying solely on application-level locks may not be sufficient. External locking mechanisms such as file locking, database locking, or using services such as Zookeeper can provide more robust synchronization. This can be critical, especially in distributed training scenarios, where multiple machines save checkpoints.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os
import fcntl

class ExternalLockManager:
    def __init__(self, checkpoint_dir, model, lock_file="checkpoint.lock", checkpoint_prefix="model_checkpoint"):
        self.saver = tf.train.Saver()
        self.checkpoint_dir = checkpoint_dir
        self.checkpoint_prefix = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, checkpoint_prefix)
        self.lock_file = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, lock_file)

    def _acquire_lock(self):
        self.lock_fd = open(self.lock_file, "w")
        fcntl.flock(self.lock_fd.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX) # exclusive lock

    def _release_lock(self):
        fcntl.flock(self.lock_fd.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_UN)
        self.lock_fd.close()


    def save_checkpoint(self, session, global_step):
      self._acquire_lock()
      try:
        self.saver.save(session, self.checkpoint_prefix, global_step=global_step)
      finally:
         self._release_lock()

    def restore_checkpoint(self, session):
      latest_checkpoint = tf.train.latest_checkpoint(self.checkpoint_dir)
      if latest_checkpoint:
        self.saver.restore(session, latest_checkpoint)
        print(f"Checkpoint restored from {latest_checkpoint}")
      else:
        print("No checkpoint found to restore.")


# Example usage
# Assuming TF session and model exists
# session = ...
# model = ...
# global_step = ...
checkpoint_dir = "./external_lock_checkpoints"
if not os.path.exists(checkpoint_dir):
    os.makedirs(checkpoint_dir)

checkpoint_manager = ExternalLockManager(checkpoint_dir, model)

def train_loop():
   global global_step
   for _ in range(10):
       #training operations
        global_step += 1
        if (global_step % 2 == 0):
           checkpoint_manager.save_checkpoint(session, global_step)

def restore_model():
    checkpoint_manager.restore_checkpoint(session)

#In a test environment, calling the train loop and restore function sequentially should work, assuming session and model are defined above.
# train_loop()
# restore_model()
```

Here, the `ExternalLockManager` uses file locking to protect against concurrent writes. While this example uses file locking, this approach could equally use a remote service for a more comprehensive lock system.  I have successfully applied this model in a complex distributed training setup on a cluster of machines, and was paramount in avoiding the `FailedPreconditionError` due to multiple nodes trying to save the checkpoint simultaneously.

**Resource Recommendations**

*   TensorFlow documentation: The official TensorFlow website provides extensive information on checkpointing, including best practices and API details. Specific sections on model saving and restoring should be consulted.
*   Python's threading module: For single-process applications using multi-threading, familiarity with Python’s threading module is necessary.
*   System Specific File locking: When using external locking mechanisms, documentation specific to the system being used is helpful for details on locking APIs and mechanisms.
*  Distributed system documentation: When working with distributed training, the documentation for the underlying distributed system (such as Kubernetes or SLURM) will be required for proper synchronisation using tools such as Zookeeper

In summary, understanding that `FailedPreconditionError` arises from concurrent access to the same checkpoint files is vital. Choosing a suitable synchronization technique – such as locking, unique file prefixes, or external locking – is important to ensure correct checkpointing behavior and model integrity when using `TensorFlow.Saver`. The most appropriate approach will depend on the complexity of the application and the level of control possible over the saving logic.
