VHDL processes are sensitive to changes in signals within their sensitivity list. This characteristic, while fundamental for reactive behavior, can present challenges when a loop needs to execute only one time during the process's lifecycle. I encountered this issue while developing a state machine for a complex data processing pipeline within an FPGA. The naive use of a `for` loop within a VHDL process would result in the loop being re-executed every time a signal in the sensitivity list changes, effectively negating the goal of a single execution. Therefore, achieving a single execution requires managing the conditions under which the loop is entered.

The crucial element is a flag, or a persistent signal, that indicates whether the loop has already run. This approach leverages VHDL's sequential nature within processes. Specifically, we introduce a Boolean signal that defaults to false, becoming true after the loop has executed. Subsequent trigger events for the process will find the flag set, preventing the loop from running again. I typically declare this flag signal within the architecture’s declarative section, making it visible throughout the process’s scope.

Here are a few examples illustrating this technique:

**Example 1: Basic Single-Execution Loop**

This example demonstrates the most basic implementation. We have a process sensitive to a clock edge (`clk`), and a `start_signal` to control when the single execution should occur initially. We also declare the `loop_executed` signal which serves as our flag.

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of SingleExecution is
  signal loop_executed : boolean := false;
  signal my_counter : integer := 0;
begin
  process (clk)
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      if start_signal = '1' and loop_executed = false then
        for i in 0 to 9 loop
          my_counter <= my_counter + 1;
        end loop;
        loop_executed <= true; -- Flag set after loop completion
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;
end architecture;
```

In this code, the `loop_executed` signal, initialized to `false`, prevents the loop from re-executing on subsequent clock edges, assuming `start_signal` remains high. Each time the process activates on a rising clock edge, the condition `loop_executed = false` will evaluate to `false` after the first pass, ensuring single execution. The `my_counter` will be incremented ten times only on the first rising clock edge that sees both `start_signal = '1'` and `loop_executed = '0'`. This method of using a conditional inside a sequential context provides a deterministic behavior. The `start_signal` could be derived from a previous process or an external input.

**Example 2: Single-Execution Loop with Reset**

In practice, we often need to reset the system, thus enabling the single-execution loop to operate again after a reset. This example introduces a reset signal.

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of SingleExecutionWithReset is
  signal loop_executed : boolean := false;
  signal my_counter : integer := 0;
begin
  process (clk, reset)
  begin
    if reset = '1' then
      loop_executed <= false;
      my_counter <= 0;
    elsif rising_edge(clk) then
      if start_signal = '1' and loop_executed = false then
        for i in 0 to 9 loop
          my_counter <= my_counter + 1;
        end loop;
        loop_executed <= true;
      end if;
    end if;
  end process;
end architecture;
```

In this example, the `reset` signal, when high, sets `loop_executed` back to `false` and resets the counter. The process is still triggered on a rising edge of the clock signal `clk`. This addition is often necessary in complex hardware designs. It enables deterministic behavior when you want the loop to run again after a reset condition. Note that the reset condition is checked before the rising clock edge in the process statement, ensuring that the reset has precedence over clock-based operations. This ensures the loop can be re-executed if a reset occurs. This is crucial for any design that needs to be brought back to its initial state.

**Example 3: Single-Execution with a Data Input**

Sometimes the loop's execution may need to be contingent on a data input. This example demonstrates how the loop can perform based on a specific data value. Let’s assume, that for this example, we want to update the value of a register only once, if the input data has a specific pattern.

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of SingleExecutionData is
    signal loop_executed : boolean := false;
    signal my_register : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (others => '0');
begin
    process (clk)
    begin
        if rising_edge(clk) then
            if data_input = "10101010" and loop_executed = false then
                for i in 0 to 7 loop
                    my_register(i) <= data_input(i);
                end loop;
                loop_executed <= true;
             end if;
         end if;
    end process;
end architecture;
```

Here, we check for the specific input pattern "10101010". Only when this pattern is available on `data_input`, and the `loop_executed` flag is `false`, will the register receive the input data. The for loop here is purely to facilitate the transfer. This allows the data transfer to occur just once. This mechanism is often used for initializing register banks or system configuration settings based on initial data patterns. This method is particularly useful when we need to perform a conditional, one-time transfer of data based on a specific pattern.

These three examples demonstrate how a single Boolean flag, in combination with the sequential nature of a VHDL process, can control the single execution of a `for` loop. They highlight important aspects including conditional triggers, reset, and data dependency.

When working with such structures, it is important to review the synthesized implementation. Although the RTL simulation will accurately represent the intended behaviour, how the logic maps to hardware can sometimes present unexpected implications. Tools like Xilinx Vivado or Intel Quartus can be used to examine the implementation in detail.

For further exploration, I would recommend consulting resources like “VHDL for Designers” by Peter Ashenden which provides a thorough exploration of the language and practical design considerations. Textbooks focusing on digital design with VHDL, such as “Digital Design Principles and Practices” by John F. Wakerly, are also beneficial. Furthermore, FPGA vendor documentation often includes design guidelines and coding styles that can help you better understand the implications of specific VHDL coding patterns and optimize implementation. Finally, practicing with simple designs before working on more complicated projects will solidify your understanding of how loops operate within VHDL processes.
