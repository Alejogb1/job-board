The erratic behavior observed when attempting to print the Nth line from a Windows text file often stems from inconsistent line ending character handling.  My experience troubleshooting similar issues across diverse scripting languages and file formats points to this as the primary culprit. Windows traditionally uses Carriage Return + Line Feed (\r\n) as its line ending sequence, while Unix-like systems use only Line Feed (\n).  Failure to account for this difference, especially when dealing with files originating from multiple sources or platforms, leads to inaccurate line counting and consequently, incorrect retrieval of the Nth line.

**1. Explanation:**

The core problem lies in how different programming languages and their associated libraries interpret line endings.  When a program reads a file, it parses the byte stream into lines based on its understanding of line termination. If the file contains a mixture of \r\n and \n, a naive approach assuming only one type will inevitably miscount lines. For instance, if the program expects \n and encounters a \r\n, it might interpret the \r as part of the previous line, leading to an off-by-one error, or worse, completely corrupt line indexing.  Further complications arise when dealing with files containing embedded carriage returns within a line but not followed by a line feed; the program will then treat these as separate lines, skewing the line count dramatically.

This issue is amplified when working with large files. Manually inspecting every line becomes infeasible, requiring robust and reliable automated solutions. The choice of programming language and its built-in file handling capabilities heavily influence how easily this problem can be addressed.  In my experience, languages offering finer-grained control over file reading operations, such as low-level I/O functions, generally provide a more robust solution compared to higher-level abstractions that may abstract away line ending details.

The solution hinges on using a method that explicitly handles both \r\n and \n line endings.  This often involves reading the file byte-by-byte or using functions explicitly designed to handle multiple line endings seamlessly.  Furthermore, error handling is crucial.  The program must be capable of gracefully handling unexpected file formats or corrupted data without crashing or producing inaccurate results.

**2. Code Examples:**

Here are three code examples demonstrating different approaches to reading the Nth line, each tackling line ending inconsistencies with varying levels of sophistication:

**Example 1: Python (using `splitlines()` with `universal_newlines`)**

```python
def get_nth_line(filepath, n):
    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r', newline='') as f:  # newline='' handles different line endings
            lines = f.readlines()
            if 0 < n <= len(lines):
                return lines[n-1].rstrip('\r\n') # rstrip removes trailing line endings
            else:
                return None # Handle out-of-bounds index
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return None  # Handle file not found

filepath = "my_file.txt"
n = 5
nth_line = get_nth_line(filepath, n)
if nth_line:
    print(f"Line {n}: {nth_line}")
else:
    print(f"Line {n} not found or file error.")

```

This Python example leverages the `newline=''` parameter in the `open()` function, which instructs Python to automatically handle different line endings. `splitlines()` then correctly splits the file into lines regardless of line ending styles.  The `rstrip()` method removes any trailing line endings, ensuring consistent output.  Error handling is included for file not found and index out-of-bounds scenarios.


**Example 2: C++ (manual line ending handling)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

std::string getNthLine(const std::string& filepath, int n) {
    std::ifstream file(filepath, std::ios::binary); // Open in binary mode to avoid automatic line ending conversion

    if (!file.is_open()) {
        return ""; // Handle file opening errors
    }

    std::string line;
    int lineCount = 0;
    while (std::getline(file, line, '\n')) { // Read lines with \n as delimiter.
        lineCount++;
        if (lineCount == n) {
            // Handle \r at the end if exists
            if (!line.empty() && line.back() == '\r') {
                line.pop_back();
            }
            return line;
        }
    }

    return ""; // Handle line not found
}


int main() {
    std::string filepath = "my_file.txt";
    int n = 5;
    std::string nthLine = getNthLine(filepath, n);
    if (!nthLine.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Line " << n << ": " << nthLine << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Line " << n << " not found or file error." << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This C++ example demonstrates a more manual approach.  The file is opened in binary mode to prevent automatic line ending conversion by the standard library. The code iterates through lines using `std::getline`, explicitly specifying `\n` as the delimiter. It then checks for trailing `\r` characters and removes them.  Again, error handling is integrated for robustness.

**Example 3: PowerShell (using `Get-Content` with `-Raw`)**

```powershell
function Get-NthLine {
    param(
        [string]$FilePath,
        [int]$LineNumber
    )

    try {
        $content = Get-Content -Path $FilePath -Raw
        $lines = $content -split "`r`n" #Split on CRLF, handles both \r\n and \n
        if ($LineNumber -gt 0 -and $LineNumber -le $lines.Count) {
            return $lines[$LineNumber - 1]
        } else {
            return $null
        }
    }
    catch {
        return $null
    }
}

$filepath = "my_file.txt"
$n = 5
$nthLine = Get-NthLine -FilePath $filepath -LineNumber $n
if ($nthLine) {
    Write-Host "Line $($n): $($nthLine)"
} else {
    Write-Host "Line $($n) not found or file error."
}
```

PowerShell's `Get-Content -Raw` reads the entire file content as a single string, avoiding potential line ending misinterpretations during initial reading.  The `-split "`r`n"` operation splits the content into lines based on \r\n, which handles both \r\n and \n line endings correctly.  Error handling is again incorporated to manage file access issues and invalid line numbers.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of file I/O operations in various programming languages, consult the official documentation for your chosen language.  Textbooks on operating systems and file systems will provide context on line ending conventions and their historical development.  Advanced topics like character encoding and Unicode handling are relevant when working with internationalized text files.  Finally, referring to best practices for exception handling and robust error management in your chosen programming language will ensure the reliability of your code.
