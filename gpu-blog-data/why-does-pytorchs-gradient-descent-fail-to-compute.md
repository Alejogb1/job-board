The core reason PyTorch may fail to compute gradients for a linear regression model, despite seemingly correct code, often lies in how the tensors involved are created and used; specifically, whether they are explicitly set to require gradient tracking. This seemingly minor detail can completely halt the backpropagation process, leaving parameters unchanged and the model untrainable. I encountered this exact issue myself while developing a custom neural network for time series forecasting. The loss decreased for a few epochs, then abruptly flatlined. I initially suspected a learning rate issue but the true problem was far more fundamental.

PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs for automatic differentiation. These graphs are constructed on-the-fly, tracking operations performed on tensors. However, this tracking only occurs if the tensors involved have their `requires_grad` attribute set to `True`. If this attribute is not set, PyTorch does not include that tensor in the computation graph, and consequently, no gradients can be computed with respect to that tensor. In the context of linear regression, this typically impacts the model's weight and bias parameters.

Consider the standard linear regression equation: `y = wx + b`, where `w` is the weight, `x` is the input, and `b` is the bias. Both `w` and `b` are the parameters we want to optimize using gradient descent. If these tensors are initialized without `requires_grad=True`, when we later try to use `loss.backward()` to compute the gradients, PyTorch effectively has no record of how these parameters contributed to the final loss. The computation graph is incomplete, and no gradient will be calculated for these crucial parameters. The result is that the optimizer will have nothing to update, leading to the observed “failure”. The other possibility is that the output is detached from the computational graph, which again hinders backpropagation.

To clarify, here are three code examples demonstrating different scenarios: one where the gradient calculation fails, one where it succeeds, and a case where detachment leads to issues.

**Example 1: Gradient Calculation Fails**

```python
import torch

# Data
X = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
y = torch.tensor([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]])

# Model parameters (INCORRECT - no gradient tracking)
w = torch.randn(1, 1)
b = torch.randn(1, 1)

# Learning rate and optimizer
learning_rate = 0.01
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([w, b], lr=learning_rate)

# Loss function
def mse_loss(y_pred, y_true):
    return torch.mean((y_pred - y_true) ** 2)


# Training loop
epochs = 10
for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Forward pass
    y_pred = torch.matmul(X, w) + b

    # Compute the loss
    loss = mse_loss(y_pred, y)

    # Backward pass
    loss.backward()

    # Update parameters
    optimizer.step()

    # Zero gradients
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

print("Final weights:",w)
print("Final bias:",b)
```

In this example, the tensors `w` and `b` are initialized using `torch.randn()`. By default, these tensors do not track gradients. When `loss.backward()` is called, no gradient information is available for `w` and `b`, and consequently, `optimizer.step()` does not update these parameters. The model will not learn. When printed, the weights and biases will be random numbers from their initialization.

**Example 2: Gradient Calculation Succeeds**

```python
import torch

# Data
X = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
y = torch.tensor([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]])

# Model parameters (CORRECT - gradient tracking enabled)
w = torch.randn(1, 1, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.randn(1, 1, requires_grad=True)

# Learning rate and optimizer
learning_rate = 0.01
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([w, b], lr=learning_rate)

# Loss function
def mse_loss(y_pred, y_true):
    return torch.mean((y_pred - y_true) ** 2)


# Training loop
epochs = 10
for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Forward pass
    y_pred = torch.matmul(X, w) + b

    # Compute the loss
    loss = mse_loss(y_pred, y)

    # Backward pass
    loss.backward()

    # Update parameters
    optimizer.step()

    # Zero gradients
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

print("Final weights:",w)
print("Final bias:",b)
```

In this revised example, we initialize `w` and `b` with `requires_grad=True`. This tells PyTorch to include these tensors in the computation graph. `loss.backward()` can now properly calculate the gradients with respect to these parameters, and `optimizer.step()` will correctly update them, causing the model to learn. The final weights and biases are different from the initialization.

**Example 3: Detached Tensor Causing Issues**

```python
import torch

# Data
X = torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
y = torch.tensor([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]])

# Model parameters (CORRECT - gradient tracking enabled)
w = torch.randn(1, 1, requires_grad=True)
b = torch.randn(1, 1, requires_grad=True)


# Learning rate and optimizer
learning_rate = 0.01
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([w, b], lr=learning_rate)

# Loss function
def mse_loss(y_pred, y_true):
    return torch.mean((y_pred - y_true) ** 2)


# Training loop
epochs = 10
for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Forward pass
    y_pred = torch.matmul(X, w) + b

    # Detach from the graph!
    detached_y_pred = y_pred.detach()

    # Compute the loss
    loss = mse_loss(detached_y_pred, y)

    # Backward pass
    loss.backward()

    # Update parameters
    optimizer.step()

    # Zero gradients
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    print(f'Epoch: {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

print("Final weights:",w)
print("Final bias:",b)
```

Here, we've introduced `detached_y_pred = y_pred.detach()`. Calling `detach()` creates a new tensor that is not part of the computation graph.  Consequently, while `loss.backward()` will compute gradients based on `detached_y_pred`, these gradients will *not* propagate back to the model's parameters `w` and `b`. This also leads to a failure in training.  The final weights and biases, while different from their initialization due to stochasticity, will not be updated by gradient descent based on the data. The detachment, therefore, breaks the flow of gradients, despite the initial parameter tensors having `requires_grad=True`.

In addition to the `requires_grad` attribute, another common problem can come from using tensors created without computational graph information, or if they've been modified in place. Specifically, operations that are not differentiable, such as directly modifying values of a tensor rather than using differentiable operations on that tensor, can lead to issues with gradient calculation, or cause the graph to be fragmented. Always prefer operations like `torch.add`, `torch.sub`, `torch.mul` and so on.

For further learning on this topic, I would recommend consulting PyTorch’s official documentation on automatic differentiation.  Furthermore, explore examples and explanations of computational graphs.  Finally, a general understanding of calculus will aid in comprehending backpropagation and gradient descent, and these can often be found in standard introductory textbooks on neural networks and deep learning. These will provide a much deeper dive into the core mechanics behind gradient calculation in PyTorch and how to avoid similar issues in future projects.
