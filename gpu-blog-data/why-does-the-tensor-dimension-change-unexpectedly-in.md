Unexpected tensor dimension changes in PyTorch after network processing stem primarily from a mismatch between the expected input shape and the actual operation performed by the network layers.  This often manifests as subtle errors, easily overlooked during initial implementation but surfacing as baffling dimension discrepancies during runtime.  In my experience debugging various deep learning models, this has been the root cause more often than not, frequently masked by seemingly unrelated error messages.

The core issue lies in the implicit and explicit assumptions about tensor shapes within the model architecture. PyTorch, unlike some other frameworks, doesn't always explicitly throw an error for subtle shape mismatches; instead, it may perform broadcasting or other operations that lead to unexpected results, only revealing the problem when examining the output dimensions. This is particularly true when dealing with convolutional layers, pooling operations, and especially when integrating custom layers or functions within the broader network.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The problem manifests in several ways. First, incorrect input dimensions: If your input tensor doesn't match the expected input shape of the first layer (often defined implicitly through convolutional kernels or explicitly in linear layers), the subsequent layers will receive tensors with incorrect dimensions, cascading the error through the entire network. Second, incorrect layer configurations:  Incorrectly specifying kernel sizes, strides, padding, or output channels in convolutional or pooling layers will directly affect the output tensor shape.  Third, issues with reshaping or view operations: Improper use of `view`, `reshape`, `squeeze`, or `unsqueeze` operations within the network – for instance, forgetting to account for batch size – can unexpectedly alter tensor shapes mid-process.  Finally, inconsistencies between batch normalization, dropout, and other layers can also contribute, especially if batch size dynamics aren't appropriately managed.  It is crucial to carefully examine the dimensions at every stage of the network, starting from the input, to systematically track the evolution of the shape throughout the forward pass.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Input Dimensions to a Convolutional Layer:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple convolutional layer
conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)

# Incorrect input: Expecting (batch_size, channels, height, width)
input_tensor = torch.randn(10, 16, 32, 32)  # Incorrect channel dimension
output_tensor = conv_layer(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape) # This will produce an output, but the shape will likely be incorrect.

# Correct input
correct_input = torch.randn(10, 3, 32, 32)
correct_output = conv_layer(correct_input)
print(correct_output.shape) # This will yield the expected shape (10, 16, 32, 32)
```

This example highlights the importance of correctly specifying the `in_channels` parameter in the `nn.Conv2d` layer.  The code explicitly shows how a mismatch between the expected number of input channels and the actual input leads to an output with unexpected and likely incorrect dimensions.  Debugging this involves carefully checking the data loaders to ensure correct image preprocessing and channel ordering.


**Example 2:  Improper Use of Reshape Operation:**

```python
import torch

input_tensor = torch.randn(10, 64, 4, 4)

# Incorrect reshape operation: forgetting batch size
incorrect_reshape = input_tensor.reshape(-1, 16, 16) # Incorrect shape. batch size lost
print(incorrect_reshape.shape)

# Correct reshape operation
correct_reshape = input_tensor.reshape(10, -1, 16)
print(correct_reshape.shape)  # This yields the correct reshaped tensor retaining batch size.
```

This showcases a common error: forgetting to account for the batch dimension when using `reshape`. The correct approach explicitly preserves the batch size (dimension 0) while reshaping the remaining dimensions to meet the needs of a subsequent layer, such as a fully connected layer.


**Example 3:  Inconsistency between Pooling and Fully Connected Layers:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 8 * 8, 10) # Incorrect input dimension to the fully connected layer

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(self.conv1(x))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 8 * 8)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

net = MyNetwork()
input_tensor = torch.randn(10, 3, 32, 32)
output = net(input_tensor)
print(output.shape) # Potential dimension mismatch

#Corrected code (assuming 2x2 max pooling, 3x3 convolution, and padding = 1)
class CorrectedNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CorrectedNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 16 * 16, 10) #corrected input dimension for fully connected layer

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(self.conv1(x))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 16 * 16)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

net2 = CorrectedNetwork()
input_tensor = torch.randn(10, 3, 32, 32)
output2 = net2(input_tensor)
print(output2.shape) #Expected correct output
```

This example demonstrates the crucial connection between the output shape of a convolutional and pooling layer and the input shape of a subsequent fully connected layer.  Failing to correctly calculate the size of the flattened feature map after pooling leads to an incorrect input dimension for the fully connected layer, resulting in another shape mismatch.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend reviewing the PyTorch documentation extensively, paying close attention to the sections on convolutional layers, pooling operations, and tensor manipulation functions.  Further, working through practical tutorials focusing on building and debugging convolutional neural networks will prove incredibly beneficial.  Finally, thoroughly examining and understanding the shape attributes of each tensor at different stages of the network using print statements is a crucial debugging strategy.  A systematic approach using print statements after every layer allows you to precisely identify the point of shape divergence.  This, coupled with a deeper understanding of how each layer transforms the tensor dimensions, is essential for effectively diagnosing and resolving these issues.
