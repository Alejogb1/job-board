The `amd64_is_imm32 (disp)` assertion failure encountered within an Unreal Engine dev container, specifically during build processes involving cross-compilation or shader compilation, typically points to an issue with immediate values exceeding the 32-bit limit within generated assembly code for the AMD64 architecture. This problem isn’t related to any inherent flaw within the Unreal Engine itself, but arises due to inconsistencies between the compiler toolchain used within the container and the target architecture’s assumptions about the size of immediate values when creating instruction operands.

I've personally encountered this frustrating error across numerous projects, usually after modifying our build pipeline or upgrading to a newer version of the container image. The core issue originates when compiler generated assembly includes displacement values (the 'disp' in the error message refers to this displacement) that require more than 32 bits to represent the address offset. While modern x86-64 architecture supports 64-bit addressing, instructions often encode these offsets as 32-bit signed integers for efficiency, limiting the range to +/- 2GB. If a compiler attempts to encode an offset beyond this range, the assertion failure will trigger within an Unreal Engine specific code block designed to confirm immediate values stay within bounds. This check is present as a protective measure during shader compilation and low-level code generation when Unreal Engine attempts to handle target platform specific nuances during rendering.

To address this error, we must focus on adjusting how the compiler and linker handle address generation in relation to the generated assembly. It is not typically caused by the source code itself, rather, by how it is translated into machine instructions. Several potential solutions exist depending on the root cause that needs careful examination:

**1. Reconfigure Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Position Independent Code (PIC):**

The primary culprit is typically an over-reliance on large address spaces, which when combined with code positions, create large displacements. If ASLR is enabled for all compiled components (executables and dynamic libraries) within the container, the resulting virtual addresses can spread over a wider 64-bit range. Similarly, compiled objects generated as Position Independent Code (PIC) rely on relative addressing, often introducing larger displacements as code relocates during load time. Reducing this range can help, especially if ASLR is only critical for production environments.

   **Code Example 1 (CMake): Modifying CMake build flags:**

   ```cmake
   # Inside CMakeLists.txt, within your build configuration section
   if(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "GNU")
      set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -fno-pie")
      set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -no-pie")
      set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS} -no-pie")
   endif()

   if(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "Clang")
        set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -fno-pie")
        set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -no-pie")
        set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS} -no-pie")
   endif()

   # Optional. If still having problems, try disabling address space layout randomization completely
   # set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -fno-aslr")
   # set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -Wl,-no-as-needed")
   ```

   *Commentary:* This code snippet adjusts the compiler flags in CMake to disable PIC and ASLR for both GNU and Clang compilers, assuming the container environment is compatible with these changes. The `-fno-pie` flag disables Position Independent Executables, forcing generation of code that is not reliant on runtime address relocation, whereas `-no-pie` forces the linker to not generate PIE executables. Disabling ASLR completely using `-fno-aslr` is an even more severe solution and should be considered only as a last resort, as it reduces the security of the final build. The appropriate flags will vary depending on the compiler in use.

**2. Address Compiler and Linker Optimizations:**

Aggressive compiler optimizations, particularly function inlining and link-time optimizations (LTO), can inadvertently cause the same displacement issue by moving code across larger address ranges. Consider reducing the level of optimization or disabling LTO for specific modules, especially during development, to mitigate this. Furthermore, the order of libraries passed to the linker can also result in differing memory layouts, in some situations moving the relative addresses around can remedy the issue.

   **Code Example 2 (Custom Build Script): Adjusting clang compiler flags and LTO:**

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # Example build script to modify flags for clang
    # Assumes an output directory and input list of source files
    OUTPUT_DIR="./build"
    SOURCE_FILES=$(find ./src -name "*.cpp")
    CLANG_PATH=$(which clang++)

    if [ -z "$CLANG_PATH" ]; then
        echo "Error: clang++ not found."
        exit 1
    fi


    for FILE in $SOURCE_FILES; do
       BASENAME=$(basename $FILE .cpp)
       $CLANG_PATH -c -o $OUTPUT_DIR/$BASENAME.o $FILE \
          -O2 -fno-inline -flto=thin
    done

    # Linking
    $CLANG_PATH -o $OUTPUT_DIR/my_executable $OUTPUT_DIR/*.o -flto=thin
    ```

    *Commentary:* This bash script iterates through all `*.cpp` source files within the src folder, then compiles each into a `.o` object file. Then the `.o` object files are compiled into the final `my_executable` binary. Notably, compilation flags, including `-O2` which sets optimisation level 2, `-fno-inline` which disables inlining, and `-flto=thin` which applies thin LTO is added. The final linking step uses the `-flto=thin` flag, to attempt to resolve any linker issues caused by LTO, whilst still retaining some optimisations. This approach reduces some of the pressure caused by large displacements. This example showcases clang compiler options, GCC may need modified options to achieve a similar effect. This example assumes a very simple project, and would require modification to suit more complex project requirements.

**3. Check Library Dependencies and Versioning:**

In rare circumstances, mismatches between versions of compiled libraries or dependencies, particularly ones with platform specific dependencies can result in unusual address layouts. Ensuring the container environment uses versions of all third-party libraries compatible with the target platform, and specifically the compiler toolchain is of critical importance. This is why it is important to adhere to project requirements on dependency versions, to maintain consistent builds between development and target environments.

   **Code Example 3 (Dockerfile): Pinning Library Versions**

   ```dockerfile
   # Assuming a Debian-based container
   FROM ubuntu:latest

   # Update package list
   RUN apt-get update

   # Install dependencies
   RUN apt-get install -y \
         build-essential \
         cmake \
         git \
         python3

   # Pin specific versions of packages
   RUN apt-get install -y \
         libssl-dev=1.1.1f-1ubuntu2 \
         libz-dev=1:1.2.11.dfsg-2ubuntu1 \
         libstdc++-10-dev=10.3.0-17ubuntu1

    # Set up workdir and copy source
    WORKDIR /app
   COPY . .
   ```

   *Commentary:*  This Dockerfile example illustrates pinning specific versions of essential packages during the image build process.  Specifically, `libssl-dev`, `libz-dev`, and `libstdc++-10-dev` are versioned. Version locking can help alleviate issues that may arise from dependency incompatibilities, in turn potentially reducing the number of large displacements. While this example is not directly related to shader compilation, the concept is similar. The build system, including compilation and linking should operate on locked versions to ensure consistency. It also highlights that you may need to perform package version locking in your development container to reduce the issue.

These are the primary steps to address the `amd64_is_imm32 (disp)` error. The root cause can vary, requiring a systematic approach. Start by addressing the ASLR and PIC settings, which in my experience are the most frequent contributors to this problem. Subsequently, carefully examine compiler optimization strategies, library dependency versions and finally compiler and linker settings. In more complex scenarios, one may need to utilise a combination of these techniques to solve the issue. Always revert to standard practices if any of the above solutions cause downstream issues.

For more details on compiler flags, it's worthwhile to refer to the documentation for the specific compiler used, as well as related documentation regarding linker behaviour. Resources detailing specifics of address space layout, position independent code and code optimisation will help with diagnosing and fixing these types of build issues. Finally, a good grasp of the Unreal Engine build system architecture is invaluable for debugging issues at the compiler and link layer.
