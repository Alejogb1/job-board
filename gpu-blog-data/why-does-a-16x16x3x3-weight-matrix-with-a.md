The discrepancy arises from a misunderstanding of convolutional layer operation, specifically concerning the interplay between kernel size, input channels, output channels, and the implicit grouping mechanism.  My experience working on high-resolution image classification models, particularly those involving depthwise separable convolutions, has highlighted this point repeatedly. The key fact is that the number 16 in your weight matrix description refers to the *output* channels, not the number of channels processed independently.

A convolutional layer operates by sliding a kernel (the weight matrix) across the input feature map.  The kernel's depth (3 in your case) must match the number of input channels.  The crucial point is that each kernel *produces one* output channel.  Therefore, a single kernel with a depth of 3 processes all three input channels concurrently to generate a single value in the output feature map.  This process is then repeated for each spatial location within the input.  The number of output channels is determined by the number of kernels used.  Grouping modifies this process but doesn't change the fundamental principle.

In your example, you have a 16x16x3x3 weight matrix. This signifies:

* **16:** The number of *output* channels.  This means you have 16 distinct kernels, each producing one output channel.
* **16:** The spatial dimensions of each kernel (16x16). This is somewhat unusually large for a standard convolutional layer, suggesting a specific architectural design choice potentially aimed at capturing large-scale spatial patterns.
* **3:** The number of input channels the kernel operates on (matching the depth of your input, 16x64x222x222).  This implies the network processes three input channels simultaneously within each kernel operation.
* **3:** The number of input channels the kernel operates on.  Redundant information; this matches the depth aspect already specified.

The input size of 16x64x222x222 indicates:

* **16:**  This is likely a batch size, representing 16 independent input images being processed concurrently.
* **64:** The number of input channels.
* **222x222:** The spatial dimensions of each input image.

With a single group, each of the 16 kernels processes all 64 input channels. The 3 in your weight matrix description does *not* refer to a group count but matches the three input channels actually used for processing by each kernel.  A common misconception is to confuse the kernel depth (3) with the grouping factor. They are distinct concepts.

Let's clarify with code examples:

**Example 1: Standard Convolution (No Grouping)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input: Batch, Channels, Height, Width
input_tensor = torch.randn(16, 64, 222, 222)

# Convolutional layer: 16 output channels, 3 input channels, 16x16 kernel
conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=64, out_channels=16, kernel_size=(16, 16), groups=1)

# Forward pass
output_tensor = conv_layer(input_tensor)

# Output shape: Batch, Output Channels, Height, Width
print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: torch.Size([16, 16, 207, 207])
```

This example demonstrates a standard convolution. The output channels (16) directly correspond to the number of kernels. Each kernel processes all 64 input channels. The output size is reduced due to the large kernel size.

**Example 2: Depthwise Convolution (Implicit Grouping)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

input_tensor = torch.randn(16, 64, 222, 222)

depthwise_conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=64, out_channels=64, kernel_size=(16,16), groups=64)

output_tensor = depthwise_conv(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape) #Output: torch.Size([16, 64, 207, 207])

```

This illustrates a depthwise convolution, where each kernel processes only *one* input channel. Here, the `groups` parameter equals the number of input channels, creating an implicit grouping.  The output channel count matches the input channel count.  The concept is crucial for understanding the distinction from standard convolution.

**Example 3:  Convolution with Grouping (Explicit Grouping)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

input_tensor = torch.randn(16, 64, 222, 222)

grouped_conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=64, out_channels=32, kernel_size=(16, 16), groups=2)

output_tensor = grouped_conv(input_tensor)
print(output_tensor.shape) #Output: torch.Size([16, 32, 207, 207])

```

This shows explicit grouping.  The input channels are split into two groups (64/2 = 32), and the 32 output channels are generated by 32 kernels, each only processing 32 of the input channels.


In conclusion, your weight matrix defines 16 output channels, each generated by a separate kernel which processes all 64 input channels. The 3 in your weight matrix represents the number of input channels that each kernel is designed to process.  Understanding the role of the `groups` parameter and the fundamental operation of a convolutional kernel is paramount to avoid this confusion.

For further study, I recommend consulting standard deep learning textbooks, focusing on chapters dedicated to convolutional neural networks and their architectural variations.  Pay particular attention to the mathematical formulation of convolution and the impact of hyperparameters like kernel size and grouping on the output dimensions.  Exploring the documentation of deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow will also prove beneficial.
