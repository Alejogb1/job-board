Directly, a 2D array cannot be directly inputted into a `Conv2D` layer within common deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. These layers expect a 4D tensor as input, formatted as `(batch_size, height, width, channels)`, representing multiple images with their color channels. The key is understanding this required input shape and how to manipulate your 2D data to conform.

My experience working with image-based time series data often involved converting single channel 2D data (like elevation maps or temperature grids) into a suitable format for processing by a `Conv2D` layer. The challenge stems from the layer's designed assumption that it is processing images, thus the batch and channel dimensions are critical. When presented with raw 2D arrays, the transformation becomes necessary.

The necessary steps involve reshaping your 2D data and adding the required dimensions. First, a 2D array can be reshaped into a 3D array by adding a channel dimension. For example, a 2D array of shape `(height, width)` can be reshaped to `(height, width, 1)` representing a single-channel image. Next, this 3D array needs a batch dimension prepended to it, resulting in a 4D array of shape `(1, height, width, 1)`. A common way to achieve this is through framework specific operations like `numpy.expand_dims` or `torch.unsqueeze`.

Let's illustrate this process through code examples, using both Numpy and PyTorch frameworks.

**Example 1: Using Numpy and TensorFlow**

Here's a demonstration using Numpy for array manipulation and TensorFlow for the Conv2D layer:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'my_2d_array' is a numpy array
height = 64
width = 64
my_2d_array = np.random.rand(height, width)

# Reshape to add the channel dimension (height, width, 1)
reshaped_3d_array = np.expand_dims(my_2d_array, axis=-1)

# Add the batch dimension (1, height, width, 1)
input_4d_array = np.expand_dims(reshaped_3d_array, axis=0)

# Verify the shape
print(f"Original 2D array shape: {my_2d_array.shape}")
print(f"Reshaped 4D array shape: {input_4d_array.shape}")

# Now the 4D array can be used as input to a Conv2D layer:
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), input_shape=(height, width, 1))

# Convert the numpy array to a tensor
input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(input_4d_array, dtype=tf.float32)

# Pass the tensor through the layer
output = conv_layer(input_tensor)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

In this code, we first define a sample 2D numpy array. We utilize `np.expand_dims` twice, first to add the channel dimension making it a 3D array, then to add the batch dimension making it a 4D array that the TensorFlow Conv2D layer can understand. Finally we create an input tensor of the proper type and pass it through the layer. The `input_shape` argument in the layer initialization is crucial to ensure the layer is properly configured.

**Example 2: Using PyTorch**

Here is the same process implemented using the PyTorch framework:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Assume 'my_2d_array' is a numpy array
height = 64
width = 64
my_2d_array = np.random.rand(height, width)

# Convert numpy to torch tensor
my_2d_tensor = torch.tensor(my_2d_array, dtype=torch.float32)


# Add channel dimension (height, width, 1)
reshaped_3d_tensor = torch.unsqueeze(my_2d_tensor, dim=0) # Note: Pytorch uses dim instead of axis

# Add batch dimension (1, height, width, 1)
input_4d_tensor = torch.unsqueeze(reshaped_3d_tensor, dim=0) # We add dim 0 again

# Verify the shape
print(f"Original 2D array shape: {my_2d_array.shape}")
print(f"Reshaped 4D tensor shape: {input_4d_tensor.shape}")

# Now the 4D tensor can be used as input to a Conv2D layer
conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=1, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3)

# Pass the tensor through the layer
output = conv_layer(input_4d_tensor)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```
This example mirrors the TensorFlow approach, but using PyTorch's tensor operations. We use `torch.unsqueeze` to add dimensions. Crucially, we must define the input and output channels in `nn.Conv2d`, setting `in_channels` to 1, reflecting our single-channel input data. The output shape from the convolution operation is provided, demonstrating how these dimensions have been processed. Note the use of `dim` instead of `axis` when using PyTorch.

**Example 3: Handling Multiple 2D Arrays (Batching)**

Often, we might have multiple 2D arrays to process. We need to organize these into a batch dimension:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume we have 10 such 2D arrays
num_arrays = 10
height = 64
width = 64

# Create a list of 2D arrays
list_of_2d_arrays = [np.random.rand(height, width) for _ in range(num_arrays)]

# Reshape each array and stack
reshaped_arrays = [np.expand_dims(arr, axis=-1) for arr in list_of_2d_arrays]
batch_input = np.stack(reshaped_arrays, axis=0)

# Verify the shape
print(f"Shape of batch input: {batch_input.shape}")

# Create conv layer
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), input_shape=(height, width, 1))

# Convert to tensor
input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(batch_input, dtype=tf.float32)

# Pass tensor through the layer
output = conv_layer(input_tensor)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")

```

In this example, we generate a list of 2D arrays. After adding the channel dimension using `np.expand_dims` for each array, we use `np.stack` to combine all 3D arrays along a new axis (axis=0) to create the batch dimension. The resultant shape is `(num_arrays, height, width, 1)`. Consequently, a batch of 2D arrays can now be efficiently processed by the convolution layer.  The rest of the process is the same, except a batch of images are processed.

These examples highlight the transformation process, and the required shape for input into a Conv2D layer.

For further exploration of concepts I have used, I recommend consulting the following resources:

*   **Numpy Documentation:** The official documentation provides comprehensive coverage of array manipulation, especially functions like `expand_dims` and `stack`.
*   **TensorFlow Documentation:** The TensorFlow documentation for Keras layers provides detailed explanations on `Conv2D` layers, input shapes, and tensor manipulation.
*   **PyTorch Documentation:** PyTorch's documentation offers details on `torch.unsqueeze` and other tensor manipulation functions, as well as the `nn.Conv2d` module.
*   **Deep Learning Textbooks:** Many foundational deep learning textbooks provide thorough background on convolution layers, tensor manipulations, and data preparation strategies for these tasks.

Understanding the input requirements of deep learning layers, particularly the dimension expectations of `Conv2D` is critical for effective implementation. It is never about sending in raw data, but preparing that data into the correct format for the model. The common error I have seen is an incorrect manipulation of dimension, which this response addresses.
