Memory copies to and from the GPU, specifically those orchestrated using `cudaMemcpy` with host memory, typically exhibit blocking behavior with respect to subsequent kernel launches. This constraint arises from the architectural design of CUDA and how it schedules operations on the device. I've encountered this limitation frequently when optimizing complex data pipelines in my parallel computation work, and a deep dive into the CUDA execution model clarifies the issue.

The core issue lies in how the CUDA runtime handles data transfers and kernel execution. When `cudaMemcpy` is invoked, it initiates a data transfer operation on the CUDA stream. This transfer is asynchronous in the sense that the call returns immediately to the host thread, but the actual copy operation is not truly parallel to subsequent computations until the copy is finished. Specifically, the CUDA runtime schedules the memcpy operation on the copy engine, a dedicated hardware unit distinct from the streaming multiprocessors (SMs) that execute kernels. However, the CUDA runtime maintains a dependency order on operations scheduled on the same stream. By default, kernel launches are dependent on operations initiated before them on a stream. Thus, a kernel launch, even if it could theoretically use the compute resources while the copy is ongoing, will be held back from starting until the memcpy is completed.

The underlying mechanism is the sequential execution imposed by CUDA streams. When operations are submitted to the same stream, they are processed in the order they were added. This mechanism ensures data consistency and correctness. The runtime is designed to wait until the data copy is done. If the kernel were to access the data before the memcpy was fully complete, the kernel will either be operating on old data or incomplete data. This can lead to incorrect computation and data corruption.

I’ve spent significant debugging time on situations where I had incorrectly assumed the copy operation was truly out of the way. Let’s consider practical implementations to clarify this constraint.

**Example 1: Blocking Behavior on the Default Stream**

The following C++ snippet with CUDA code demonstrates the blocking nature of a `cudaMemcpy` followed by a kernel launch, all on the default stream (stream 0).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Kernel to add 1 to each element of the device array
__global__ void add_one_kernel(int *d_array, int size) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < size) {
        d_array[idx] += 1;
    }
}

int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    int h_array[size];
    int *d_array;

    // Initialize host array
    for(int i=0; i<size; ++i) {
        h_array[i] = i;
    }

    // Allocate device memory
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_array, size * sizeof(int));

    // Transfer data to device
    cudaMemcpy(d_array, h_array, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Launch kernel, this will wait for the memcpy to complete
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    add_one_kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_array, size);

    // Transfer results back to host
    cudaMemcpy(h_array, d_array, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Cleanup
    cudaFree(d_array);

    // Output the results
    for(int i=0; i<10; ++i){
        std::cout << h_array[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, I’ve created a simple array and transferred it from the host to the device using `cudaMemcpy`. Subsequently, a kernel `add_one_kernel` increments each element. The key takeaway is that the kernel launch will not begin before the `cudaMemcpy` is entirely finished, even though resources are potentially idle. This behavior is due to the implicit synchronization enforced on the default stream.

**Example 2: Attempted Overlap with Explicit Streams (Fails)**

Let's try to overlap the `cudaMemcpy` with kernel launch using explicit streams. The following demonstrates why the first kernel still can't overlap even if we try to use streams:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Kernel to add 1 to each element of the device array
__global__ void add_one_kernel(int *d_array, int size) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < size) {
        d_array[idx] += 1;
    }
}

int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    int h_array[size];
    int *d_array;
    cudaStream_t stream1;

    // Initialize host array
    for(int i=0; i<size; ++i) {
        h_array[i] = i;
    }

    // Allocate device memory
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_array, size * sizeof(int));

    // Create a stream
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);

    // Transfer data to device on stream1
    cudaMemcpyAsync(d_array, h_array, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream1);

    // Launch kernel on stream1. This will still wait for the memcpy on the same stream to complete.
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    add_one_kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, 0, stream1>>>(d_array, size);

    // Transfer results back to host on stream1
    cudaMemcpyAsync(h_array, d_array, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream1);

    // Wait for stream1 to complete
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1);

    // Cleanup
    cudaFree(d_array);
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);

    // Output the results
    for(int i=0; i<10; ++i){
        std::cout << h_array[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this modified code, I've introduced an explicit stream `stream1`, and employed `cudaMemcpyAsync` for asynchronous memory transfer. I also pass the stream as a parameter to the kernel launch. However, the fundamental constraint persists. The kernel launch, associated with the same stream, still waits for the preceding `memcpy` to conclude its operation. This highlights the ordering of operations within a given stream that CUDA maintains.

**Example 3: Overlap with Separate Streams and Subsequent Copy (Works)**

To achieve true overlap, memory copies from the host should be separated from kernel execution streams, especially on the first copy. The most efficient approach involves scheduling the initial host-to-device copy on the default stream, which, if no kernel is launched prior to it, has no dependency and can run to completion as soon as it is scheduled. Then, subsequent copies and kernels can overlap with the initial copy. If more than one kernel operation is necessary, this requires two streams. Here is an example where the initial memory copy is overlapped with a kernel:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Kernel to add 1 to each element of the device array
__global__ void add_one_kernel(int *d_array, int size) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < size) {
        d_array[idx] += 1;
    }
}
// Kernel to square the elements of the device array
__global__ void square_kernel(int *d_array, int size) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < size) {
        d_array[idx] = d_array[idx] * d_array[idx];
    }
}
int main() {
    int size = 1024;
    int h_array[size];
    int *d_array;
    cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;

    // Initialize host array
    for(int i=0; i<size; ++i) {
        h_array[i] = i;
    }

    // Allocate device memory
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_array, size * sizeof(int));

    // Create two streams
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);

    // Transfer data to device on the default stream. This runs immediately.
    cudaMemcpy(d_array, h_array, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Launch kernel on stream1. This will overlap with the first memcpy, since they are on different streams.
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
    add_one_kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, 0, stream1>>>(d_array, size);
    
    // Second kernel on stream2
    square_kernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, 0, stream2>>>(d_array, size);

    // Transfer results back to host on stream1
    cudaMemcpyAsync(h_array, d_array, size * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream1);

    // Wait for both streams to complete
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1);
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream2);


    // Cleanup
    cudaFree(d_array);
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);


    // Output the results
    for(int i=0; i<10; ++i){
        std::cout << h_array[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, I initiate the host-to-device copy, `cudaMemcpy`, without any explicit stream. This will be executed on the default stream, but since it is the first operation in that stream, it will complete as soon as scheduled without any dependencies. Then, I have two streams, and launch a kernel on each, effectively overlapping kernel computations and the initial memory copy. This shows how it is possible to overlap, as long as a copy isn't on the same stream as the initial kernel launch and doesn't have any other operations on that stream prior to the copy that would introduce a dependency.

For deeper insight into asynchronous CUDA operations, I recommend delving into the official CUDA Programming Guide. The guide details the precise semantics of `cudaMemcpy` and `cudaMemcpyAsync`. Furthermore, the CUDA Best Practices Guide offers guidance on efficient data transfer strategies and stream management. Additionally, the documentation on the `cudaStream_t` type is instrumental in understanding how to effectively leverage streams for concurrent operations. Utilizing these resources has greatly improved my understanding and performance tuning for CUDA applications.
