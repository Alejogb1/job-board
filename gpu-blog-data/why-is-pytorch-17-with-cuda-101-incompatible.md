The incompatibility between PyTorch 1.7 built with CUDA 10.1 and NVIDIA A100 Ampere GPUs, despite the forward compatibility claims of NVIDIA’s PTX architecture, stems from a crucial difference between compiler optimizations and the underlying hardware capabilities, a distinction that often trips up those used to older CUDA architectures. I've debugged similar issues on projects involving high-throughput inference pipelines, learning this the hard way.

The crux of the issue lies not directly within PTX itself, but rather in how PTX is used in PyTorch compiled binaries. PTX, or Parallel Thread Execution, is NVIDIA’s intermediate instruction set. When you compile CUDA code, the NVIDIA compiler (nvcc) transforms your high-level C++ CUDA code into PTX code. At runtime, a driver will then “just-in-time” (JIT) compile the PTX code to the specific instruction set of the target GPU. This is where the promise of forward compatibility comes from; any GPU architecture can, in theory, be targeted if the driver supports JIT compilation from the input PTX, assuming no hardware limitations. However, PyTorch doesn’t rely on this principle completely.

When you install a PyTorch version, it’s often pre-built with optimized compiled kernels targeting a specific CUDA architecture (compute capability). When building PyTorch 1.7 with CUDA 10.1, those kernels were primarily compiled with a set of instructions and optimizations targeting older architectures like Volta (compute capability 7.0, 7.5) and Turing (compute capability 7.5). These targeted architectures use a different set of instruction patterns and assumptions regarding memory access, thread management and hardware-specific optimizations compared to the Ampere architecture (compute capability 8.0, 8.6).

While the A100, based on Ampere, *can* theoretically JIT compile PTX code targeting older architectures like Volta (provided the driver supports it), doing so forfeits several Ampere-specific optimizations and features. The precompiled kernels within PyTorch 1.7 compiled with CUDA 10.1 will not take advantage of the full potential of the A100's architecture, leading to a performance bottleneck. Furthermore, some kernels might use instruction sequences that work fine on older GPUs, but are either less efficient or, in rare cases, result in undefined behaviour on Ampere. This might not cause a catastrophic crash, but can manifest in subtle issues like incorrect calculations or slow execution.

Essentially, PyTorch 1.7 binaries built with CUDA 10.1 lack precompiled kernels optimized for the A100 GPU. Instead, the driver will attempt JIT compilation of Volta/Turing-targeted PTX at runtime, resulting in suboptimal execution. The PTX compatibility guarantee is *technically* met, as it doesn't prevent execution entirely, but the user will not experience the performance expected from an A100 device.

Here are three simplified code examples to illustrate the situation, focusing on hypothetical kernel scenarios:

**Example 1: Basic Matrix Multiplication**

```python
# PyTorch 1.7 kernel hypothetically compiled for Volta (Compute Capability 7.0)
# and translated to PTX optimized for Volta:

# Volta PTX (simplified and not actual PTX)
#.reg .f32  %f<3>;
#.reg .pred %p<1>;

  ld.global.f32   %f0, [%rax + %rbx];  // Load from global memory into register f0
  ld.global.f32   %f1, [%rcx + %rdx]; // Load from global memory into register f1
  mul.f32         %f2, %f0, %f1;      // Multiply
  st.global.f32  [%rsi + %rdi], %f2; // Store the result
```

This simplified representation shows loading two floating-point numbers, multiplying them, and then storing the result in global memory. This pattern, while valid on Ampere, might not utilize the hardware-specific matrix multiply-accumulate (MMA) operations that are readily available on the A100. If a kernel is compiled *specifically* for Ampere, this section would instead use MMA opcodes, resulting in much higher performance. The PyTorch 1.7 kernel, in this case, while functional, would not leverage these available features, and as such, would be underutilized on the A100.

**Example 2: Shared Memory Optimization**

```python
# PyTorch 1.7 kernel hypothetically compiled for Turing (Compute Capability 7.5) with specific shared memory usage
# and translated to PTX optimized for Turing:

#.reg .u64 %ptr<3>;
#.reg .u32 %i<1>;

  mov.u64  %ptr0, %r10;  // Get start address of shared memory allocation for this thread block
  add.u64 %ptr1, %ptr0, (%threadIdx.x * 4); // Offset for a given thread within the block
  ld.global.u32 %i0, [%r11 + %threadIdx.x]; //Load a 32-bit int from global memory
  st.shared.u32 [%ptr1], %i0; // Store into shared memory
  sync.threads; // Sync all threads
  // Further processing based on data in shared memory...
```

This example highlights shared memory access. Older GPUs might have limitations in terms of the size and access patterns to shared memory. Ampere has significantly improved shared memory capabilities, including larger shared memory per SM, and improved memory access patterns through features like asynchronous copy. A kernel optimized for the older architectures would not take advantage of these architectural improvements present on A100, and therefore would not optimally use resources.

**Example 3: Thread Block Management**

```python
# PyTorch 1.7 kernel targeting a specific thread block size often used on Volta
#  and translated to PTX optimized for Volta.

  // Specific thread block size configured for Volta (e.g., 32 x 32)
  // Kernel operations assuming a thread-block structure optimized for Volta
  // ...
  // These instructions might contain assumptions about warp size and scheduling
  // that may not align perfectly with Ampere's more complex and granular scheduling
  // This might cause an overhead while the scheduler attempts to adapt.
```

This final example shows a potential issue with the thread block configurations. When compiling for Volta or Turing, the PyTorch codebase may have made decisions about ideal thread block configurations. These configurations might not be optimal for A100 due to the changes in SM architecture and scheduling mechanism of Ampere, leading to inefficient resource utilization.

In all three scenarios, the PTX code *can* execute on Ampere, but they don't benefit from the A100's specific architectural strengths. The A100 has a different core architecture, new Tensor Cores, and improved memory management. The fundamental issue isn’t about PTX *compatibility*, it's about PTX *optimization*. Pre-compiled kernels are tailored for specific GPU compute architectures.

To address this, one must use PyTorch versions compatible with the target CUDA driver and GPU. Specifically, one should either compile PyTorch from source with CUDA 11 or later or install a pre-built PyTorch binary package that is specifically compiled against CUDA 11 or newer, and the associated NVIDIA driver, which targets compute capabilities 8.0 and 8.6 present in the A100.

For further study, I would recommend consulting the following resources: NVIDIA's CUDA Programming Guide, documentation from PyTorch regarding CUDA versions and support matrices, and documentation on GPU architectures such as Volta, Turing, and Ampere on the NVIDIA developer website. Thoroughly examining the details within those resources allows for a much clearer understanding of these complex topics.
