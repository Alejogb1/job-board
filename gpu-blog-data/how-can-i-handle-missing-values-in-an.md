Handling missing values in geospatial visualizations like Altair/Plotly choropleth maps requires a strategic approach that considers both data integrity and visual representation.  My experience working with large-scale demographic datasets highlighted the critical need for a nuanced strategy, moving beyond simple omission to methods that convey the absence of data effectively.  Inaccurate handling can easily lead to misinterpretations or biased visualizations.  The choice of method depends heavily on the nature of the missing data – is it Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), or Missing Not at Random (MNAR)?  Assuming we're dealing with primarily MCAR or MAR data for simplicity (a common assumption in many exploratory visualizations), three primary strategies stand out: data imputation, data filtering, and explicit visual representation of missingness.

**1. Data Imputation:** This involves replacing missing values with estimated values. Several methods exist, each with strengths and weaknesses. Simple imputation strategies include using the mean, median, or mode of the available data for the given variable.  However, these methods can distort the data distribution and are best suited only for exploratory analysis.  More sophisticated techniques, like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) imputation, can provide better estimations by considering the values of nearby data points.  For geographically referenced data, spatial interpolation methods (like kriging) might be appropriate, considering the spatial autocorrelation often present in such datasets.  The choice depends on the specific data characteristics and the level of bias tolerance.

**Code Example 1: Mean Imputation with Pandas and Altair**

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

# Load sample dataset (replace with your own)
source = data.us_10m.urs()

# Introduce missing values for demonstration
source['population'][source['id'] == 'ID'] = None  #Simulate missing population in Idaho

# Impute missing values using the mean
mean_pop = source['population'].mean()
source['population'].fillna(mean_pop, inplace=True)

# Create Altair choropleth
alt.Chart(source).mark_geoshape().encode(
    color='population:Q'
).project(
    type='albersUsa'
).properties(
    width=500,
    height=300,
    title='US Population (Mean Imputation)'
)
```

This example utilizes Pandas for imputation and Altair for visualization.  The `fillna()` method replaces missing population values with the mean population across all states.  Note the importance of choosing an appropriate dataset and handling potential errors associated with missing data.  I've encountered scenarios where improperly handled missing data caused unexpected behavior in the visualization libraries, emphasizing the importance of diligent data cleaning.


**2. Data Filtering:**  This approach involves removing data points with missing values entirely. While simple to implement, it reduces the dataset size and can lead to biased results if the missing data is not MCAR. This method is suitable when the percentage of missing data is relatively low and the impact on the analysis is acceptable.  However, careful consideration must be given to the potential loss of information and its subsequent effects on the interpretation of the visualization.

**Code Example 2: Data Filtering with Plotly and GeoPandas**

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import geopandas as gpd

# Load geospatial data (replace with your own)
geo_df = gpd.read_file("your_geospatial_data.shp")  # Replace with your shapefile

#Assume some 'value' column has missing data.
geo_df = geo_df.dropna(subset=['value'])


#Create Plotly Choropleth
fig = px.choropleth_mapbox(geo_df, geojson=geo_df.geometry, locations=geo_df.index, color='value',
                           mapbox_style="carto-positron", zoom=3, center = {"lat": 37.0902, "lon": -95.7129},
                           opacity=0.5,
                           labels={'value':'My Value'}
                          )
fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":0,"l":0,"b":0})
fig.show()
```

This example employs GeoPandas for geospatial data manipulation and Plotly for visualization. The `dropna()` function removes rows with missing values in the specified column ('value'). This approach is straightforward but potentially problematic if missingness is not random.  In my prior work, I’ve observed instances where this naive filtering introduced spurious patterns in the resulting map due to geographic clustering of the dropped observations.


**3. Explicit Visual Representation of Missingness:** This approach treats missing data as a distinct category, visualizing it as a separate color or pattern on the map.  This avoids data manipulation while clearly communicating the areas with missing information to the audience.  It emphasizes transparency and allows the viewer to understand the limitations of the data.  This strategy proves exceptionally useful in communicating uncertainty or data gaps.

**Code Example 3: Explicit Representation with Altair**

```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

# Load sample dataset (replace with your own)
source = data.us_10m.urs()

# Introduce missing values for demonstration (as in Example 1)
source['population'][source['id'] == 'ID'] = None

# Create a new column to indicate missingness
source['missing'] = source['population'].isnull().astype(int)

# Create Altair choropleth with separate color for missing values
alt.Chart(source).mark_geoshape().encode(
    color=alt.condition(
        alt.datum.missing == 1,
        alt.value('lightgray'),  # Color for missing values
        'population:Q'
    )
).project(
    type='albersUsa'
).properties(
    width=500,
    height=300,
    title='US Population (Missing Values Highlighted)'
)
```

Here, we create a new column (`missing`) to flag missing values. Altair's `alt.condition` function then assigns a distinct color ('lightgray' in this instance) to regions with missing data, highlighting the extent of missingness without altering the existing data.  This method prevents misrepresentation and encourages data transparency.  During a presentation to stakeholders, this method allowed for a much more honest and informative portrayal of the data’s limitations.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further study, I recommend exploring documentation for Pandas, Altair, Plotly, and GeoPandas.  Textbooks on data visualization and spatial statistics would also be beneficial.  Specific attention should be given to statistical methods for handling missing data, including imputation techniques and methods for assessing missing data mechanisms.  Finally, a strong understanding of geospatial data formats (like shapefiles) will be invaluable.
