The fundamental principle of chaining Keras models lies in the functional API, enabling a directed acyclic graph of layers rather than the rigid sequential structure of the `Sequential` API. This approach allows for complex architectures where the output of one model, or even specific layers within it, can serve as the input to another. My experience in developing complex audio processing pipelines has often relied on this method, especially when integrating pre-trained feature extraction models with custom classification networks.

Chaining, in essence, is the process of creating a new model where the input and output of constituent models are linked programmatically. This isn't achieved by simply appending models, but by treating them as functional units that transform input tensors into output tensors, allowing them to be combined flexibly. Let's break this down further:

Firstly, Keras models, when using the functional API, are essentially callable objects that accept tensors as input and return tensors as output. This makes them perfectly suited to be chained together. The key is to define the inputs to the overall system, feed them through your component models, and finally define the final output. Consider a scenario where you have a pre-trained feature extractor model (say, a convolutional network for image data) and then you intend to feed those features into a custom recurrent network for sequence analysis. Instead of retraining the feature extractor from scratch, you directly utilize it, chaining it with a new model.

The key lies in how you define your model's inputs and outputs, using Keras's `Input` layer to declare the expected input shapes. The output tensors from each model are then passed as input to the subsequent model. This provides an inherent flexibility: you can easily compose highly modularized pipelines, repurpose components, or perform intricate manipulations of intermediate layer outputs in sophisticated ways. You can think of each model as a block, interconnected by the flow of data through these tensors.

Here are a few examples demonstrating this:

**Example 1: Basic Feature Extraction and Classification**

Suppose we have a pre-trained model named `feature_extractor` and another model named `classifier`. The `feature_extractor` produces a flattened vector from image inputs, while the `classifier` then takes that vector and makes class predictions.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Assume feature_extractor and classifier are already defined
# For illustration, we'll create placeholder models

def create_feature_extractor(input_shape):
  inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
  x = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(inputs)
  x = layers.Flatten()(x)
  return keras.Model(inputs, x)

def create_classifier(input_dim, num_classes):
  inputs = keras.Input(shape=(input_dim,))
  x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(inputs)
  outputs = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)
  return keras.Model(inputs, outputs)


input_shape = (28,28, 1) # Example grayscale image input
num_classes = 10
feature_extractor = create_feature_extractor(input_shape)
classifier = create_classifier(32 * 26 * 26, num_classes)

# Chaining the models
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=input_shape) # Input layer for overall model
features = feature_extractor(input_layer)  # Output from the feature extractor becomes the input for the classifier
predictions = classifier(features)       # Final output from classifier

combined_model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=predictions)

combined_model.summary() # Print model structure to illustrate chain
```

In this example, we've created two placeholder models, a feature extractor (a single convolutional layer followed by flattening) and a basic classifier (two dense layers). The crucial point is that within the `combined_model`, the output tensor from `feature_extractor(input_layer)` is passed as the input to the `classifier`. We then use the `keras.Model` class, specifying the original input layer and final predictions as the input and output.  The `summary()` call allows visual inspection of the created layered structure.

**Example 2: Multi-Input Model**

Often you might require multiple inputs feeding into separate parts of the architecture which then converge and go through the subsequent layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define an input branch
def create_input_branch(input_shape, num_units):
  input_layer = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
  x = layers.Dense(num_units, activation='relu')(input_layer)
  return keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=x)


input_shape_1 = (100,)
input_shape_2 = (50,)

branch1 = create_input_branch(input_shape_1, 64)
branch2 = create_input_branch(input_shape_2, 32)

input_layer1 = keras.Input(shape=input_shape_1)
input_layer2 = keras.Input(shape=input_shape_2)

branch1_output = branch1(input_layer1)
branch2_output = branch2(input_layer2)


merged = layers.concatenate([branch1_output, branch2_output])
output = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(merged)

multi_input_model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_layer1, input_layer2], outputs=output)
multi_input_model.summary()
```

This demonstrates a situation with two distinct input streams. Both input shapes are specified, their respective branches, `branch1` and `branch2`, are built, and then using the `concatenate` layer, their output tensors are merged, and a final dense layer predicts a binary outcome. The final Keras Model accepts two input layers this time, which can be supplied during training and prediction.

**Example 3: Intermediate Layer Output as Input**

A more advanced example involves accessing the output of a specific layer within an existing model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers


def create_base_model(input_shape):
    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(inputs)
    x = layers.MaxPooling2D(2)(x)
    x = layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu')(x)
    x = layers.MaxPooling2D(2)(x)
    return keras.Model(inputs, x)

def create_additional_layer(input_shape, num_classes):
  inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
  x = layers.Flatten()(inputs)
  x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
  outputs = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)
  return keras.Model(inputs, outputs)



input_shape = (28,28,1)
base_model = create_base_model(input_shape)
additional_model = create_additional_layer((6,6,64),10) # Specify shape of the output from base_model

base_input = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)
base_output = base_model(base_input)
final_output = additional_model(base_output)

chained_model = keras.Model(inputs=base_input, outputs=final_output)
chained_model.summary()
```

In this example, `create_base_model` produces convolutional feature maps, which are then provided to `create_additional_layer`  as input via its `Input` layer. We extract the intermediate tensor `base_output`  and use it within the overall model as an input to another model, `additional_model`. This demonstrates how intermediate layers can be tapped.

Several resources offer comprehensive coverage on the functional API and more advanced model chaining techniques. The official TensorFlow Keras documentation is the primary source, and tutorials on custom layers and multi-input models available online are beneficial for more in-depth understanding of the functional paradigm. Also, exploring specific papers relating to deep learning architectures with unique compositions provides guidance in the use of chaining for particular application scenarios.  Reading and implementing example models from repositories that showcase best practices also enhance practical learning.   Understanding both the theoretical aspect of the functional API and practical examples allows for the development of intricate, modular, and reusable networks.
