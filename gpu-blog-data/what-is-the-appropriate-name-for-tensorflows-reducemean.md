The naming of TensorFlow's `tf.reduce_mean` function, while seemingly straightforward, reflects a subtle tension between mathematical precision and programming practicality.  My experience working on large-scale distributed training systems for image recognition highlighted the importance of understanding this nuance.  The function's name accurately describes its core operation, but  a more descriptive, albeit longer, name might enhance clarity for users less familiar with tensor operations.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The function `tf.reduce_mean` computes the mean (average) of elements across a given dimension or dimensions of a tensor.  A tensor, in the context of TensorFlow, is a multi-dimensional array.  The "reduce" prefix signifies that the function reduces the dimensionality of the input tensor.  The operation sums the elements along the specified dimension(s) and then divides by the number of elements summed.  Crucially, the choice of dimension(s) is specified by the `axis` argument.  Omitting the `axis` argument or setting it to `None` computes the mean across all elements of the tensor, resulting in a scalar value. This contrasts with functions like `tf.math.mean`, which operates only on a single tensor and doesn't explicitly reduce its dimensions.

The choice of "reduce" in the function name reflects the common pattern in array processing where operations collapse (or reduce) dimensions. This is consistent with other reduction functions found in NumPy, such as `numpy.sum`, `numpy.prod`, and `numpy.min`, furthering the conceptual consistency for those transitioning between libraries.

However, the potential for ambiguity arises when dealing with higher-dimensional tensors and different axis specifications. The term "mean" is unambiguous in its mathematical meaning but may not be as immediately clear to a programmer unfamiliar with the function's behavior when applied to multi-dimensional data.  A more descriptive name might explicitly highlight the dimensionality reduction, like `tf.reduce_mean_along_axis` or even a more verbose option detailing the behavior. While conciseness is valuable, the existing name leaves room for improvement in terms of immediate comprehension. In practice, I have seen instances where junior engineers misinterpret the output when the `axis` argument is not carefully considered.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate `tf.reduce_mean`'s behavior under different `axis` specifications. I've focused on illustrating scenarios that frequently cause confusion amongst developers newer to TensorFlow.

**Example 1: Averaging across all elements:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
mean_all = tf.reduce_mean(tensor)  # axis=None is implicitly used here

print(f"Mean across all elements: {mean_all.numpy()}") # Output: 2.5
```

This example demonstrates the simplest use case where `axis` is omitted; the function computes the mean of all elements in the tensor, yielding a scalar value.


**Example 2: Averaging along a specific axis:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
mean_rows = tf.reduce_mean(tensor, axis=0) # Mean of rows
mean_cols = tf.reduce_mean(tensor, axis=1) # Mean of columns

print(f"Mean of rows: {mean_rows.numpy()}") # Output: [2. 3.]
print(f"Mean of columns: {mean_cols.numpy()}") # Output: [1.5 3.5]
```

This example highlights the crucial role of the `axis` parameter.  By specifying `axis=0`, we compute the mean along each column (averaging rows), while `axis=1` computes the mean along each row (averaging columns). The output showcases the resultant dimensionality reduction.  This differentiation is where the name's conciseness may fall short; the explicit mention of 'axis' in a longer name would likely avoid some common errors observed during code reviews.

**Example 3: Averaging across multiple axes:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

tensor = tf.constant([[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], [[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]]])
mean_multiple_axes = tf.reduce_mean(tensor, axis=[0, 1])

print(f"Mean across axes 0 and 1: {mean_multiple_axes.numpy()}")  # Output: [4. 5.]
```

This example illustrates averaging across multiple axes simultaneously. Here, the mean is computed across both the first and second dimensions (axes 0 and 1), leaving a tensor representing the mean across the remaining dimension (axis 2).  The output clearly shows the effect of dimensionality reduction. More descriptive naming conventions would explicitly convey this behavior to developers less experienced with tensor manipulations.  I've seen numerous situations where the impact of multiple axes on the final shape was initially misunderstood, especially in complex model architectures.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a comprehensive understanding of tensor operations in TensorFlow, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  Supplement this with a strong understanding of linear algebra, focusing particularly on matrix operations and vector spaces.  A thorough grounding in NumPy will also prove invaluable given the close relationship between NumPy arrays and TensorFlow tensors.  Finally, working through practical examples and experimenting with different tensor shapes and axis specifications is essential for mastering these concepts.  The TensorFlow API documentation provides numerous examples to support practical learning.
