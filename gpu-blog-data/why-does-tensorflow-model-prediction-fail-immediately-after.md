TensorFlow model prediction failure immediately following successful training frequently stems from inconsistencies between the training and prediction data pipelines.  This isn't necessarily a model defect; rather, it's a mismatch in data preprocessing or input formatting.  In my experience troubleshooting production-level models at a large financial institution, this class of error accounted for a significant proportion of post-training deployment issues.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core issue lies in the discrepancies between how data is prepared during training and how it's presented during prediction.  TensorFlow, like other deep learning frameworks, is highly sensitive to the precise structure and format of input data.  Even minor differences, such as differing data types, missing features, unintended scaling, or the presence of unexpected values, can lead to immediate prediction failure. This failure often manifests as exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`, `InvalidArgumentError`) thrown by TensorFlow's internal operations, rather than a subtly incorrect prediction.

During training, a carefully constructed pipeline typically handles data loading, cleaning, preprocessing (e.g., normalization, standardization, one-hot encoding), and potentially feature engineering.  This entire pipeline needs to be meticulously replicated during the prediction phase. Any deviation – omitting a preprocessing step, using a different normalization constant, employing a different data type, or providing data with a different shape – will likely cause the prediction to crash.  Furthermore, the order of operations within the pipeline is crucial; an alteration in the order can result in unpredictable behavior.

Another significant contributor is the handling of missing values. The training pipeline might employ imputation (filling missing values with means, medians, or model-based predictions), or it might filter out rows with missing data.  If the prediction pipeline doesn't implement the same missing value handling strategy, inconsistencies will arise.  Similarly, categorical features require consistent encoding schemes (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding) between training and prediction.

Finally, ensure the input data's shape aligns with the model's expectations.  The model expects input tensors of a specific shape (number of dimensions, size of each dimension) derived from the training data.  Providing input with a different shape, even if the underlying data is valid, will invariably lead to an error.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Incorrect Data Type**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Training data (float32)
X_train = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=np.float32)
y_train = np.array([5.0, 7.0], dtype=np.float32)

# Model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(2,))
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)

# Prediction data (float64) - INCORRECT
X_pred = np.array([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]], dtype=np.float64)
predictions = model.predict(X_pred)  # This might throw an error

# Corrected prediction data (float32)
X_pred_correct = np.array([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]], dtype=np.float32)
predictions_correct = model.predict(X_pred_correct) # This should work.

```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates a common issue: using `float64` for prediction when the model was trained with `float32`.  TensorFlow might not implicitly cast the data type, resulting in a shape mismatch error.  Explicitly matching the data types during prediction is crucial.


**Example 2: Missing Preprocessing Step**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Training data with scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5,6]])
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
y_train = np.array([10, 20, 30])

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(2,))
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=100)

# Prediction data WITHOUT scaling - INCORRECT
X_pred = np.array([[7, 8], [9, 10]])
predictions = model.predict(X_pred) #Likely to fail or give incorrect results

#Corrected Prediction data WITH scaling
X_pred_scaled = scaler.transform(X_pred)
predictions_correct = model.predict(X_pred_scaled) # Should work correctly
```

**Commentary:** This example highlights the importance of applying the same preprocessing steps (here, `StandardScaler`) during prediction as during training.  Forgetting to scale the prediction data leads to erroneous results or even prediction failure. The `scaler.transform` method is crucial; using `scaler.fit_transform` again would be incorrect.

**Example 3:  Input Shape Mismatch**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Training data (2D array)
X_train = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
y_train = np.array([5, 6])

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(2,))
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100)

# Prediction data (1D array) - INCORRECT
X_pred = np.array([7, 8])
predictions = model.predict(X_pred) # Will likely fail due to shape mismatch

#Corrected Prediction Data (Reshaped to 2D)
X_pred_correct = np.array([X_pred]).reshape(1,-1)
predictions_correct = model.predict(X_pred_correct) #Should work

```

**Commentary:** This example showcases how an incorrect input shape (1D instead of 2D) during prediction, even with the correct number of features, can result in an error.  Ensuring dimensional consistency is vital; explicitly reshaping the prediction data as needed is essential for compatibility.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would recommend reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation on data preprocessing, specifically focusing on sections detailing input pipelines and data handling.  A thorough understanding of NumPy for array manipulation and data type management is also essential.  Finally, exploring best practices for model deployment and serialization in TensorFlow will provide valuable context on managing the consistency between training and prediction environments.  Careful attention to these aspects will significantly reduce the likelihood of post-training prediction failures.
