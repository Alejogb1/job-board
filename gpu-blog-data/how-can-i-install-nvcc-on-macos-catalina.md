My experience working with CUDA across various platforms, including resource-constrained environments, has frequently involved installing the CUDA toolkit even without a dedicated NVIDIA GPU present. This is a common requirement when developing CUDA applications on a macOS system that might serve as a build server or simply a development machine before deployment to a GPU-enabled target. The crux lies in understanding that the `nvcc` compiler, the core of the CUDA toolkit, can be installed independently of driver components and related libraries which necessitate a CUDA-capable GPU. Therefore, focusing on the toolkit alone is crucial in your scenario.

The CUDA toolkit, particularly the `nvcc` compiler, is primarily designed to compile CUDA code (written using the CUDA programming model and extensions) into target code for execution on an NVIDIA GPU. When a GPU isn't present, the compiled code can't execute, but `nvcc` remains necessary for building and cross-compiling. macOS provides its own mechanisms for GPU interaction, primarily through the Metal framework. Thus, the CUDA driver component of the installation package is superfluous when there is no NVIDIA GPU available. The key takeaway is to only install the compiler and related header files, avoiding any drivers or runtime libraries that expect a GPU.

Here's how I’d approach this on macOS Catalina 10.15.7:

1.  **Download the Correct CUDA Toolkit:** The NVIDIA CUDA toolkit offers downloads specific to various platforms and CUDA versions. Ensure that the chosen version is compatible with Catalina 10.15.7, particularly since Catalina doesn't support the latest CUDA versions. For example, CUDA 10.2 provides a good balance of functionality and operating system compatibility. The key is to download the ".dmg" installer.

2.  **Custom Installation:** During the installation process, you’ll reach a screen offering several customization options. This is where you can choose which components are installed. **Specifically, deselect the driver option.** You should generally select the "CUDA Toolkit" core components, including `nvcc`, and the necessary header files, and any relevant samples. This is what the installer will refer to in the text as “CUDA Development”. The “CUDA Runtime” can be deselect as this contains runtime libraries that require a GPU. The important thing is to only install what’s required for compiling, ignoring the GPU-specific components. This will prevent conflicts and prevent the installer from attempting to install incompatible drivers.

3.  **Verify the Installation:** Once the installation completes, verify the installation of `nvcc` by opening a terminal and running the command `nvcc --version`. This should output information about the installed `nvcc` compiler if the installation process was successful. It should reveal information such as the compiler version, build details, and compatibility level. If `nvcc` is not immediately accessible, you might need to add its directory path to your `$PATH` environment variable. This is usually located within the chosen installation path, often `/usr/local/cuda/bin`. I can provide more guidance on this if needed.

Here are three practical examples illustrating typical workflows after installing `nvcc` in this manner:

**Example 1: Simple Compilation**

Assume a basic CUDA file named `hello.cu`:

```c++
#include <iostream>

__global__ void hello_kernel() {
    printf("Hello from GPU thread %d\n", threadIdx.x);
}

int main() {
  hello_kernel<<<1, 10>>>();
  cudaDeviceSynchronize();
  std::cout << "Hello from the CPU!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

To compile this, I’d use the following command:

```bash
nvcc hello.cu -o hello
```

**Commentary:**
This command compiles `hello.cu` into an executable named `hello`. While this can't execute on the host machine lacking a GPU, the command demonstrates the core functionality of `nvcc` in producing an executable using CUDA extensions. Note that this compiled code is designed for a GPU architecture and will not produce expected output on the CPU.

**Example 2: Compilation with a specific architecture**

Assume the same `hello.cu` file, but we want to target specific NVIDIA compute architectures to verify the target generation:

```bash
nvcc -arch=sm_70 hello.cu -o hello_sm70
nvcc -arch=sm_86 hello.cu -o hello_sm86
```

**Commentary:**
In this example, we use the `-arch` flag to specify the target architecture to `sm_70` and `sm_86`, respectively. The `sm` prefix stands for “Streaming Multiprocessor”, and subsequent numbers denote the specific compute capability of that architecture. This illustrates the ability to generate binaries targetting different GPU architectures, even when a GPU is absent during the compilation stage. This is extremely useful when preparing to deploy to specific target GPUs in production environments.

**Example 3: Compilation with Additional Header Paths:**

Assume we are developing a more complex CUDA application that includes other CUDA header files (located within a non-standard directory) or custom header files.

Let's say our header file named `my_utils.h` is located in `/path/to/my/headers`:

```c++
#ifndef MY_UTILS_H
#define MY_UTILS_H

__device__ int add(int a, int b);

#endif
```

And our `add.cu` contains the implementation:
```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include "my_utils.h"

__device__ int add(int a, int b){
 return a+b;
}

__global__ void test_kernel(int *c){
    *c = add(1,2);
}
```

We would then compile this with the `-I` flag specifying the path to the headers

```bash
nvcc -I/path/to/my/headers add.cu -o add
```

**Commentary:**
This compilation step demonstrates the use of the `-I` flag to inform `nvcc` about the location of custom header files. The compiler needs this information to resolve the `#include "my_utils.h"` directive during compilation. This example shows that we can include custom headers and compile relatively complex code using the `nvcc` compiler, as if we had a GPU.

These examples show that `nvcc` can effectively compile CUDA code irrespective of the presence of an NVIDIA GPU. The compilation process generates an executable which can be later copied to a machine with an NVIDIA GPU and executed. This cross-compilation capability is extremely valuable in heterogeneous environments where development and deployment happen on different hardware.

For further resource recommendations, I advise that you consider the official NVIDIA CUDA documentation. The documentation covers all features and functionalities, providing detailed explanations and usage examples. It is the primary resource for understanding the CUDA API, and compiler options. Additionally, many books on CUDA are available, catering to both beginners and advanced programmers. These books often provide a more structured and educational approach to learning CUDA programming. Online forums and communities, such as Stack Overflow and Reddit’s r/CUDA, provide a wealth of experience from fellow developers; however, treat all advice you find online with an open mind and do not assume it is correct. I would also advise you to examine the samples contained within the CUDA toolkit installation, these samples illustrate practical usage of the CUDA API, and will form a solid base to build your own projects upon. Through studying the official documentation, sample code, and reading secondary books on the subject, you should find it relatively straightforward to install `nvcc` and progress in your GPU programming journey, even on machines without NVIDIA GPUs.
