The indefinite memory growth observed in Keras during training, especially with large datasets or complex models, stems primarily from the accumulation of intermediate tensors and computational graphs within TensorFlow's (or other backend's) session.  This isn't inherently a bug; rather, it's a consequence of the default behavior of eager execution and the automatic differentiation mechanisms employed for backpropagation.  My experience debugging similar issues in production-level image recognition models highlighted the crucial role of memory management practices within the framework.  I've found that failure to explicitly release unnecessary objects leads to this insidious memory leak.

**1. Explanation: The Role of Computational Graphs and Automatic Differentiation**

Keras, at its core, leverages a computational graph to define and execute the training process.  Each epoch involves a forward pass, where the model processes the data, and a backward pass, where gradients are calculated for optimization.  During these passes, TensorFlow (assuming TensorFlow backend) constructs a computational graph representing the operations.  Crucially, the default behavior is to retain these intermediate tensors and the graph itself in memory.  This is because TensorFlow's automatic differentiation relies on this retained information to compute gradients efficiently.  Without explicit memory management, these intermediate results accumulate over each epoch, resulting in the observed memory inflation.  This is exacerbated when dealing with large batch sizes or models with numerous layers and complex operations, leading to a substantial amount of data retained for gradient calculations.

Furthermore, the use of layers which maintain internal state, such as recurrent networks (LSTMs, GRUs), or layers involving caching mechanisms, contributes to the problem.  These layers retain previous computations and hidden states, further increasing memory consumption if not handled judiciously.  Finally, the use of custom layers or callbacks without proper attention to resource management can introduce additional memory leaks.  Over many epochs, this accumulation becomes significant, leading to the observed runaway memory consumption.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate how memory management can be improved in Keras.  These are adapted from solutions I developed to address similar problems encountered during the development of a large-scale NLP system.

**Example 1: Utilizing the `tf.function` Decorator (TensorFlow Backend)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras

@tf.function
def train_step(images, labels, model, optimizer):
  with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(images)
    loss = keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(labels, predictions)
  gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
  optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
  del tape #Explicitly delete the tape after use
  del gradients #Explicitly delete gradients
  del predictions #Explicitly delete predictions
  del loss #Explicitly delete loss

model = keras.models.Sequential(...) # Your model definition
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for images, labels in train_dataset:
        train_step(images, labels, model, optimizer)
```

**Commentary:** The `tf.function` decorator compiles the training step into a TensorFlow graph. This allows TensorFlow to optimize the execution and potentially reduce memory consumption.  Critically, the explicit deletion of the `tape`, `gradients`, `predictions`, and `loss` variables after their use ensures that they are released from memory, preventing accumulation over epochs.  This is crucial for mitigating memory bloat.


**Example 2:  Using `keras.backend.clear_session()`**

```python
import keras.backend as K

model = keras.models.Sequential(...) #Your model definition

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # ... training loop ...
    K.clear_session() #Clears the Keras session at the end of each epoch
```

**Commentary:** `keras.backend.clear_session()` releases resources held by the Keras session, including the computational graph and intermediate tensors.  Calling this at the end of each epoch helps to prevent memory buildup.  However, this approach is more aggressive and may impact training speed slightly due to the overhead of rebuilding the graph each epoch.  It's essential to benchmark its effect to ensure it doesn't negatively impact training performance outweighs the benefit.

**Example 3:  Reducing Batch Size and Utilizing Data Generators**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import keras

#Instead of loading the entire dataset into memory
train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_images, train_labels)).batch(batch_size)

model = keras.models.Sequential(...)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for images, labels in train_dataset:
        #Training step (as in Example 1 or similar memory-efficient approach)
```

**Commentary:** Processing the dataset in smaller batches significantly reduces the amount of data held in memory at any given time.  Using TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset` API to create a data generator allows the dataset to be loaded and processed in chunks. This dramatically mitigates the issue of loading a massive dataset into RAM and running into memory problems.  This is a preferable approach for very large datasets that don't fit into memory entirely.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further investigation into memory management in TensorFlow and Keras, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, focusing on sections regarding memory management and performance optimization.  Furthermore, a thorough understanding of graph execution and automatic differentiation within TensorFlow is highly beneficial.  Finally, review and become proficient with the `tf.data` API for efficient data loading and preprocessing.  These resources provide comprehensive information on advanced techniques and best practices.  The official Keras documentation is also essential. Studying its examples and tutorials will help to understand memory-efficient coding styles.
