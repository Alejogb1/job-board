TensorFlow 2.0 offers several methods for combining numerical features, a crucial preprocessing step influencing model performance. My experience working on large-scale fraud detection models underscored the importance of thoughtful feature engineering, particularly concerning numerical data interaction.  Ignoring potential synergistic effects between features can lead to suboptimal model accuracy and interpretability.  Therefore, the optimal approach hinges on the underlying data distribution and the intended model architecture.


**1. Feature Scaling and Transformation:** Before any combination, standardizing numerical features is paramount.  Features with vastly different scales can disproportionately influence models sensitive to magnitude, like distance-based algorithms.  Standard scaling (z-score normalization) centers the data around zero with unit variance, whereas min-max scaling confines values to a specific range (typically 0 to 1).  These transformations are essential to ensure features contribute equally to the model's learning process.  Failure to do so can lead to poor convergence and inaccurate predictions.

**2. Simple Arithmetic Combinations:**  The most straightforward approach involves creating new features using basic arithmetic operations. This method is computationally inexpensive and easy to implement, making it suitable for initial feature exploration.  Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can reveal hidden relationships. For instance, combining 'daily_transactions' and 'average_transaction_value' to generate a 'total_transaction_value' feature might capture a significant aspect of user spending patterns. This technique is particularly useful for linear models where interactions are not explicitly handled.  However, complex relationships might require more sophisticated techniques.


**3. Polynomial Feature Engineering:**  For non-linear relationships, generating polynomial features significantly enhances model capacity to capture higher-order interactions.  This technique expands the feature space by including combinations of existing features raised to various powers.  For example, combining features 'x' and 'y' can produce features like 'x²', 'y²', 'xy', 'x²y', and 'xy²'. This expands the model's ability to fit curves and surfaces, improving its accuracy in scenarios with non-linear dependencies.  However, an excessively high degree polynomial can lead to overfitting, necessitating careful regularization and cross-validation.


**4. Interaction Terms in Modeling:** Instead of explicitly creating new features, many models inherently handle feature interactions.  For instance, tree-based models like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines naturally capture non-linear relationships between variables during the tree construction process. The tree structure implicitly discovers and utilizes interaction effects without the need for manual feature engineering.  Similarly, neural networks can learn complex interactions through their layered structure and activation functions, often obviating the necessity for extensive preprocessing feature combination.  However, understanding the model's behavior regarding feature interaction remains crucial, even if implicitly handled.


**Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Simple Arithmetic Combinations (using NumPy)**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Sample Data
data = {'feature_a': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 
        'feature_b': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Arithmetic Combinations
df['sum'] = df['feature_a'] + df['feature_b']
df['difference'] = df['feature_a'] - df['feature_b']
df['product'] = df['feature_a'] * df['feature_b']
df['division'] = df['feature_a'] / df['feature_b']

print(df)
```

This example showcases creating new features by simply adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing existing features.  NumPy’s efficient array operations make this approach fast and suitable for large datasets.  The resulting DataFrame `df` now contains the original features and the newly created ones, readily usable for model training.


**Example 2: Polynomial Feature Engineering (using scikit-learn)**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
import numpy as np

# Sample Data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])

# Polynomial Features (degree 2)
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2, include_bias=False)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)

print(X_poly)
```

This code snippet leverages scikit-learn's `PolynomialFeatures` class. It transforms the input features `X` into a higher-dimensional space incorporating polynomial terms up to degree 2. The `include_bias=False` argument omits the constant term.  The resulting `X_poly` array contains the original features and their polynomial combinations.  The degree parameter controls the complexity, with higher degrees increasing the number of features and potential for overfitting.


**Example 3: Feature Combination within a TensorFlow Model**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Sample Data
features = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]])

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(2,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'), #Hidden layer processing features
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1) #Output layer
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

# Train the model (replace with your actual data)
model.fit(features, tf.constant([[10.0],[20.0],[30.0]]), epochs=10)

```

This example demonstrates implicit feature combination within a neural network. The input layer accepts two features.  The subsequent dense layers learn the complex relationships and interactions between them during the training process.  The architecture implicitly handles feature combination.  The model learns appropriate weights to capture the relevant interactions, eliminating the need for explicit feature engineering in this specific case.  However, this approach's effectiveness depends on the model's capacity and training data.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For further understanding, I suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, introductory machine learning textbooks covering feature engineering, and research papers on feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques.  Thorough familiarity with linear algebra and statistical concepts will enhance your understanding of feature interaction.  Exploring advanced techniques like kernel methods and tensor factorization will further broaden your skillset.  Experimentation with various approaches on your specific dataset is crucial to determine the most effective method.
