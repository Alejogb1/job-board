The predictive accuracy of a two-layer neural network in TensorFlow is highly dependent on numerous factors, including the complexity of the underlying data, the chosen activation functions, the size of the hidden layer, the optimization algorithm employed, and the quality and quantity of training data. It's a misconception to expect universally high accuracy; these models are tools with specific strengths and limitations, not magic bullets. In my experience, deploying such networks on various datasets—from image classification to time-series analysis—yields a spectrum of performance that necessitates careful design and evaluation.

A two-layer neural network, in its simplest form, refers to a network with an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer. The core mathematical operations involve weighted sums of the input features, application of activation functions, and a final transformation to generate predictions. This architecture can learn non-linear relationships between input and output variables, which is the primary advantage over single-layer models (e.g., linear regression). However, this architecture, while more potent than single-layer models, can struggle with extremely complex relationships due to its inherent limitations in depth. It is not, in general, as powerful as deeper architectures which can learn more abstract and nuanced features.

The accuracy is not a fixed parameter but rather a dynamic outcome. Under-fitting and over-fitting are common issues to be addressed. Under-fitting occurs when the model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the training data, resulting in poor generalization performance on unseen data. This might manifest when a linear activation function is used in the hidden layer for a problem requiring non-linear decision boundaries, or when the network is trained for too few epochs. Over-fitting, conversely, happens when the model learns the training data too well, including noise and random fluctuations, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data. This can arise with an excessive number of neurons in the hidden layer or insufficient training data to appropriately parameterize the model.

Let's consider a basic classification problem where we use a two-layer network for binary classification.

**Example 1: Basic Binary Classification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# Generate some synthetic data for demonstration
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 2) * 10 - 5 # 1000 samples, 2 features
y = np.where((X[:, 0]**2 + X[:, 1]**2) > 10, 1, 0)  # Circular decision boundary

# Split into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Normalize the input features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

This code demonstrates a typical setup for binary classification. A synthetic dataset with a circular decision boundary is generated. The input features are normalized to ensure efficient gradient descent. The model has a hidden layer with 16 neurons and a ReLU activation function and a final output layer with a sigmoid activation function to produce a probability for the binary classification. The Adam optimizer, a common choice in practice, is used. Training occurs over 100 epochs. The final accuracy is printed. Expect an accuracy around 85-95% for this example after multiple runs, but it’s sensitive to random weight initialization.

**Example 2: Impact of Hidden Layer Size**

The number of neurons in the hidden layer influences the model’s representational capacity. Let's adjust this and observe its impact, still using the same data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data (same as above)
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 2) * 10 - 5
y = np.where((X[:, 0]**2 + X[:, 1]**2) > 10, 1, 0)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)


# Model with a smaller hidden layer
model_small = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_small.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_small.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)
loss_small, accuracy_small = model_small.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test Accuracy (Small Hidden Layer): {accuracy_small:.4f}")


# Model with a larger hidden layer
model_large = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_large.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_large.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)
loss_large, accuracy_large = model_large.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test Accuracy (Large Hidden Layer): {accuracy_large:.4f}")
```

Here, two models are constructed. One uses a small hidden layer with only 4 neurons, and the other uses a larger hidden layer with 64 neurons. Typically, the larger hidden layer will provide a higher accuracy on the test set *provided the training data is sufficient.* If the data set is smaller, the larger network could lead to overfitting, resulting in lower generalization performance. This is a crucial consideration in practical application - it is important not to simply increase network size without evidence that it is beneficial.

**Example 3: Impact of Activation Function**

The activation function introduces non-linearity into the network. Let's compare ReLU with a linear activation (no non-linearity).

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# Generate synthetic data (same as above)
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 2) * 10 - 5
y = np.where((X[:, 0]**2 + X[:, 1]**2) > 10, 1, 0)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Model with ReLU activation in the hidden layer
model_relu = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_relu.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_relu.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)
loss_relu, accuracy_relu = model_relu.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test Accuracy (ReLU): {accuracy_relu:.4f}")


# Model with linear activation in the hidden layer
model_linear = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='linear', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_linear.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_linear.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, verbose=0)
loss_linear, accuracy_linear = model_linear.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test Accuracy (Linear): {accuracy_linear:.4f}")
```

The linear activation function significantly limits the model's ability to capture the non-linear decision boundary of the circular separation used in the data.  As such, the test set accuracy of the model with a ReLU activation in the hidden layer will be much higher, typically in the 85%-95% range, whereas the linear model will be much lower – often close to random chance (~50%).

In practice, to achieve satisfactory accuracy, one needs to systematically adjust hyper-parameters such as the size of the hidden layer, the learning rate of the optimizer, the batch size, and the number of training epochs. Regularization techniques like dropout can also improve generalization by preventing overfitting. Data augmentation can also be used to improve the robustness of predictions by exposing the model to different data variations.  Moreover, if a particular two-layer network structure fails to achieve desired accuracy, then increasing network complexity to a deeper model is often the next logical step.

For resources, consider textbooks like "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville, and online courses that delve into practical machine learning using TensorFlow or other libraries. Framework-specific documentation is also essential; TensorFlow’s official website offers a detailed API reference, tutorials, and guides.  Experimentation and careful analysis of performance using a held-out validation set is a key aspect of achieving strong performance in practice.
