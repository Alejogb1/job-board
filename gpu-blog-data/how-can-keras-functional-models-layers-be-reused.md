The core principle behind reusing layers in Keras functional models lies in the inherent graph structure they represent.  Unlike the sequential model, which linearly stacks layers, the functional API allows for the explicit definition of layer connections, enabling the construction of complex architectures and the efficient reuse of pre-trained or custom-designed components.  My experience working on large-scale image recognition projects has underscored the importance of this capability for managing model complexity and promoting code reusability.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The functional API's strength stems from its ability to treat layers as callable objects.  Once a layer is instantiated, it can be called multiple times within the same model, or even across different models. Each call to a layer creates a distinct instance within the model's computation graph, maintaining parameter independence. This means that weights learned during one part of the model don't affect another part, even if the same layer is used.  This characteristic distinguishes it from simply copying a layer's weights â€“  we are creating separate instances with the same architecture, hence enabling parallel or multi-branch pathways using identical processing modules.  Therefore, efficient reuse isn't merely about code brevity; it directly facilitates constructing networks with shared functionality yet differentiated parameters.

Crucially,  the reuse is not limited to simple layers. Custom layers, which encapsulate complex logic or operations, can also be reused seamlessly within the functional API. This significantly reduces code duplication and improves maintainability.  Furthermore, this approach facilitates modular design; changes in a reused layer automatically propagate throughout the model, eliminating the need for manual updates in various locations.  Careful consideration must, however, be given to whether sharing weights between instances is desired. While separate instances are the default, techniques such as layer sharing using shared weight matrices can be used to explicitly enforce weight sharing if it's a necessity within a specific model design.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Reusing a Convolutional Layer in a Multi-Branch Network:**

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Input, concatenate

# Define the convolutional layer
conv_layer = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')

# Define input tensor
input_tensor = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))

# Branch 1
x = conv_layer(input_tensor)  # First use of conv_layer
x = MaxPooling2D()(x)
x = Flatten()(x)
branch1_output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

# Branch 2
y = conv_layer(input_tensor)  # Second use of conv_layer, independent weights
y = MaxPooling2D((2,2))(y) # Different pooling size for branch 2
y = Flatten()(y)
branch2_output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(y)

# Concatenate outputs (optional)
merged = concatenate([branch1_output, branch2_output])
merged = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(merged)

# Create the model
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=merged)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

This example demonstrates reusing `conv_layer` in two separate branches. Despite using the same layer definition, each branch maintains its own set of weights.  Note how changing the pooling layer for the second branch is straightforward, highlighting the flexibility. The final layer concatenates branch outputs before feeding into a final classification layer, offering a more complex model than simply stacking layers sequentially.


**Example 2: Reusing a Custom Layer:**

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer, Input, Dense

class MyCustomLayer(Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=10, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.dense_layer = Dense(units, activation='relu')

    def call(self, inputs):
        return self.dense_layer(inputs)

# Instantiate the custom layer
custom_layer = MyCustomLayer(units=64)

# Input tensor
input_tensor = Input(shape=(100,))

# Branch 1
x = custom_layer(input_tensor)
x = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

# Branch 2
y = custom_layer(input_tensor) # Reusing custom layer
y = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(y)

# Model creation
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=[x, y])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

This example illustrates the reuse of a custom layer (`MyCustomLayer`). The custom layer encapsulates a dense layer. This approach allows for complex, reusable components, improving organization and maintainability.  Again, two independent instances of the layer are used, each with separate weights.

**Example 3:  Weight Sharing (Explicit):**

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Input, concatenate

# Define the convolutional layer
conv_layer = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')

# Define input tensor
input_tensor = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))

# Branch 1
x = conv_layer(input_tensor)
x = MaxPooling2D()(x)
x = Flatten()(x)
branch1_output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)


# Branch 2 (Sharing weights)
y = conv_layer(input_tensor) # Same instance of conv_layer, sharing weights
y = MaxPooling2D()(y)
y = Flatten()(y)
branch2_output = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(y)

# Create the model
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=[branch1_output, branch2_output]) #Separate outputs
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

This example demonstrates explicit weight sharing. Note that only one instance of `conv_layer` is defined and reused, making the weights shared between the two branches. In contrast to the previous examples, we now have two branches that influence one another.  This requires careful consideration of the network architecture's intended effect.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation itself provides extensive and comprehensive guides to the functional API and its capabilities.  Furthermore, exploring advanced topics within deep learning literature, particularly those covering multi-branch architectures and weight sharing, will provide a deeper understanding of the implications and potential of layer reuse within functional models.  Consider reviewing textbooks dedicated to deep learning architectures and model design for practical implementation examples and further theoretical grounding.  Finally, studying the source code of existing Keras models can be invaluable for gaining practical insights and seeing various reuse patterns implemented in different contexts.
