Predicting with a Keras model that accepts multiple inputs requires understanding the structure of your model and the data you provide to the `predict` method. I’ve encountered this frequently during projects involving multimodal data, like combining text and image features for classification tasks. The key is ensuring the input data is structured as a list or dictionary, mirroring how your model’s input layers are defined. `tf.keras.Model.predict`, unlike training methods like `fit`, doesn't implicitly understand mappings between differently shaped arrays and model inputs.

The fundamental concept revolves around the `Input` layers defined when constructing a Keras model using the Functional API. Each `Input` layer represents a single input stream into the model, even if multiple streams lead to a single output layer. When multiple `Input` layers are defined, the model expects an equivalent number of distinct input arrays during prediction. These arrays need to be provided in the specific order corresponding to the `Input` layers' declaration within the model architecture. The `predict` method processes these inputs without modifying their arrangement, so the structure you pass to it must precisely match what the model anticipates.

Let's examine this using several illustrative code examples. Consider a model designed to classify data based on two features: a numerical feature and a categorical feature represented as an embedding.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define Input layers
input_numeric = layers.Input(shape=(1,), name='numeric_input')
input_categorical = layers.Input(shape=(1,), name='categorical_input')

# Embedding layer for categorical feature
embedding_layer = layers.Embedding(input_dim=10, output_dim=8)(input_categorical)
embedding_flatten = layers.Flatten()(embedding_layer)

# Combine numeric and embedded categorical features
combined_features = layers.concatenate([input_numeric, embedding_flatten])

# Dense layers for classification
dense_layer = layers.Dense(16, activation='relu')(combined_features)
output_layer = layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')(dense_layer)

# Build the model
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input_numeric, input_categorical], outputs=output_layer)

# Example Input Data
numeric_data = tf.constant([[1.5], [2.7], [3.1]])
categorical_data = tf.constant([[0], [1], [2]])

# Predict
predictions = model.predict([numeric_data, categorical_data])

print(predictions)

```

In this first example, notice how we explicitly define two `Input` layers, `input_numeric` and `input_categorical`, each with its respective shape. The model expects input data as a list, where the first element of the list corresponds to the input of `input_numeric` and the second element to `input_categorical`. If we were to incorrectly pass a single tensor, like `model.predict(numeric_data)`, Keras would throw an error indicating a mismatch between the provided inputs and the model’s expected input structure. The structure of data during the prediction phase should mirror the structure defined when specifying the input layers. Also, notice how embedding was used with the categorical feature; this demonstrates how even preprocessed data must align to an input defined during the model's build.

Now, let's explore an example using named inputs. This is particularly useful when dealing with a greater number of inputs as it improves code readability and reduces the possibility of input order errors.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define Input layers with names
input_image = layers.Input(shape=(64, 64, 3), name='image_input')
input_text = layers.Input(shape=(100,), dtype=tf.int32, name='text_input')

# Convolutional layers for image input
conv_layers = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_image)
conv_layers = layers.MaxPool2D((2, 2))(conv_layers)
conv_layers = layers.Flatten()(conv_layers)

# Embedding layer for text input
embedding_text = layers.Embedding(input_dim=5000, output_dim=32)(input_text)
embedding_text = layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D()(embedding_text)

# Combine image and text features
combined_features = layers.concatenate([conv_layers, embedding_text])

# Dense layer and output
output_layer = layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')(combined_features)

# Build the model
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input_image, input_text], outputs=output_layer)

# Example Input Data
image_data = tf.random.normal((3, 64, 64, 3))
text_data = tf.random.uniform((3, 100), minval=0, maxval=4999, dtype=tf.int32)

# Predict using a dictionary
predictions = model.predict({'image_input': image_data, 'text_input': text_data})

print(predictions)

```

In this scenario, we assign names to the `Input` layers using the `name` parameter. This enables us to pass a dictionary to the `predict` method. The keys of the dictionary correspond to the names defined in the input layer. Using a dictionary is beneficial, especially with complex models using multiple inputs, ensuring that the correct array is assigned to the intended layer. This method avoids the need to remember the positional order of the input arrays. I generally prefer the named input style.

Finally, if your model has a more complex structure, for instance, a nested model with shared layers, you still follow the same input rule – each input layer requires an appropriate array in your input structure during prediction. The key is maintaining the consistency between the input shapes and the data format with the layer's definition.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers


# Shared encoder function
def build_encoder(input_shape, name_prefix):
    input_layer = layers.Input(shape=input_shape, name=name_prefix + '_input')
    x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_layer)
    encoded = layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(x)
    return tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=encoded)


# Build individual encoders
encoder1 = build_encoder(input_shape=(10,), name_prefix='encoder1')
encoder2 = build_encoder(input_shape=(20,), name_prefix='encoder2')

# Input layers for the main model
input1 = encoder1.input
input2 = encoder2.input


# Combine the encoded features
combined = layers.concatenate([encoder1.output, encoder2.output])

# Final layer
output = layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')(combined)

# Build the main model
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[input1, input2], outputs=output)

# Example input data
data1 = tf.random.normal((3, 10))
data2 = tf.random.normal((3, 20))

# Predict
predictions = model.predict([data1, data2])

print(predictions)

```

Here, although we use shared encoders and functional models, the main model expects a list of inputs, the same as before. The model.predict method receives a list whose element order corresponds to the input tensors defined when creating the model. The input structure mirrors the order in which input layers are provided to the `tf.keras.Model` constructor during model creation.

In practical situations, understanding these structures is crucial for proper deployment. Incorrect input structuring invariably leads to errors during inference. Pay careful attention to the shape of the tensors your model expects based on its defined inputs, and then structure the data you pass into `predict` accordingly. For comprehensive information on the Keras API, the official TensorFlow Keras documentation is an invaluable resource. Additionally, the books "Deep Learning with Python" by François Chollet and "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron, though not specific to the `predict` method, provide great depth into the practical usage of Keras models, and understanding the input requirements. Finally, exploring the TensorFlow examples on the official TensorFlow website can enhance understanding through practical application.
