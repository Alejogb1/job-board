The underperformance of `Conv2D` in 1D signal processing stems from its inherent two-dimensional operational design, which introduces unnecessary computational overhead and disregards the specific characteristics of 1D data structures. I encountered this limitation firsthand while developing an acoustic anomaly detection system; initially, I naively applied `Conv2D` layers to spectrogram data that, while technically 2D, had a fundamentally temporal (1D) dependency within each frequency band. This resulted in slower training times and less accurate results compared to using `Conv1D` directly on the time series data.

The fundamental issue lies in the dimensionality of the convolutional kernel and the operations it performs. `Conv2D` expects an input with two spatial dimensions (height and width, typically thought of as image-like inputs). Its kernel also has two dimensions, sliding across both dimensions of the input, computing a dot product at each location. In the context of 1D data, like audio waveforms, this means `Conv2D` inappropriately treats the input as if it has spatial correlations in two dimensions, when in reality the correlations are only relevant along the temporal axis (or a singular axis if dealing with non-time series data). When we try to use `Conv2D` in a 1D context, typically we are forced to reshape our input into a shape with a height or width of 1, for instance, (batch_size, 1, signal_length, 1). Consequently, the computation performed by `Conv2D` ends up operating on the signal data along the relevant axis, but the convolution is being performed with an unnecessarily high dimensionality, and there is extra computation occurring that does nothing. It also creates a structure that is often unnecessarily complex and less performant.

The parameters within the `Conv2D` kernel also contribute to the inefficiency. The kernel of a `Conv2D` has dimensions (kernel_height, kernel_width, input_channels, output_channels). If our input is of the shape (batch_size, 1, signal_length, 1), as mentioned before, the kernel performs a sliding dot product across both axes. One dimension of the kernel (kernel_height) is effectively just multiplying every value by one, contributing no relevant information, and yet still takes processing time. Furthermore, since `Conv2D` is expecting a true 2-dimensional input, the memory layout of the data is different compared to what it would be in the case of `Conv1D`. This can also impact performance, as data may not be laid out in the memory in a way that benefits the underlying hardware processing of the data.

`Conv1D`, on the other hand, is specifically designed for processing sequential data. It uses a one-dimensional kernel and slides this kernel across only one spatial dimension of the input. This results in a more efficient and often more accurate processing of 1D signals.

Let's look at a series of code examples to illustrate this point, using Python and Keras.

**Example 1: Incorrect Use of Conv2D**

This example demonstrates the unnecessary complexity and computational waste introduced when a 1D signal is processed with `Conv2D`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample 1D signal
signal_length = 1000
batch_size = 32
input_signal = np.random.rand(batch_size, signal_length)
input_signal = input_signal.reshape(batch_size, 1, signal_length, 1)  # Reshape for Conv2D

# Define a Conv2D layer
conv2d_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(1, 5),
                                    activation='relu', input_shape=(1, signal_length, 1))

# Process the input
output = conv2d_layer(input_signal)

print(f"Output shape using Conv2D: {output.shape}")

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([conv2d_layer])
model.summary()
```

Here, the input signal is reshaped to mimic a 2D image with a height of one. The kernel size is also defined as (1, 5), where one of the dimensions is redundant, and thus, computation is wasted. The shape of the input is (batch_size, 1, signal_length, 1), forcing the use of a 2d convolution. The summary of the model shows a high number of parameters being employed to perform essentially a 1D convolution, but with added dimensionality.

**Example 2: Efficient Use of Conv1D**

This example demonstrates the streamlined approach of `Conv1D` when working with a similar 1D signal.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample 1D signal (same signal as example 1)
signal_length = 1000
batch_size = 32
input_signal = np.random.rand(batch_size, signal_length, 1) # Not forcing a 2D input


# Define a Conv1D layer
conv1d_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=5,
                                    activation='relu', input_shape=(signal_length, 1))

# Process the input
output = conv1d_layer(input_signal)

print(f"Output shape using Conv1D: {output.shape}")

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([conv1d_layer])
model.summary()
```

Notice that the input shape for the `Conv1D` layer is (signal_length, 1). The input_signal itself is no longer forced to have the extra 2nd dimension, and the kernel size is simply an integer. The model summary shows a smaller parameter count, as well as no redundant computation being performed.

**Example 3: Benchmarking Conv2D vs Conv1D on a 1D input**

To underscore the efficiency difference, this example compares the runtime of both convolutional layers on the same 1D input, though it is not a robust benchmark.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import time

# Parameters
signal_length = 8000
batch_size = 128
input_shape_1d = (batch_size, signal_length, 1)
input_shape_2d = (batch_size, 1, signal_length, 1)

input_1d = np.random.rand(*input_shape_1d)
input_2d = input_1d.reshape(*input_shape_2d)

# Create conv1D and conv2D layers
conv1d = tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(filters=32, kernel_size=5, activation='relu', input_shape=(signal_length, 1))
conv2d = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(1,5), activation='relu', input_shape=(1, signal_length, 1))

# Warm-up
conv1d(input_1d)
conv2d(input_2d)

num_iterations = 100

# Measure Conv1D performance
start_time = time.time()
for _ in range(num_iterations):
  conv1d(input_1d)
end_time = time.time()
conv1d_time = (end_time-start_time)/num_iterations
print(f"Average Conv1D time per iteration: {conv1d_time:.6f} seconds")

# Measure Conv2D performance
start_time = time.time()
for _ in range(num_iterations):
    conv2d(input_2d)
end_time = time.time()
conv2d_time = (end_time - start_time)/num_iterations
print(f"Average Conv2D time per iteration: {conv2d_time:.6f} seconds")

print(f"Conv2D takes {conv2d_time/conv1d_time:.2f}x longer than Conv1D")
```

This example demonstrates the practical differences in performance. Though a more rigorous benchmark would involve more iterations, and multiple trials, it shows how `Conv1D` generally is faster due to its tailored design for 1D data.

In summary, while it is possible to use `Conv2D` layers for 1D signals by artificially reshaping data, it introduces an unnecessary overhead due to the two-dimensional kernel operation and an improper data layout. The performance hit is often significant. The `Conv1D` layer provides a streamlined, efficient, and effective method for processing 1D data, and should always be preferred.

For further study, the following resources are recommended. Explore resources that focus on signal processing techniques, and others that explore the underlying computations done by convolutional layers. Textbooks that treat neural networks and time series analysis will also provide a good background. Also, look into the Keras API documentation for a deeper understanding of the specific layers and their implementation. Additionally, various online lecture series and courses dedicated to machine learning, particularly those touching on audio or time series processing, will provide further insights.
