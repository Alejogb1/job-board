The default checkpointing behavior in TensorFlow, while essential for training recovery and model evaluation, can rapidly consume disk space if left unchecked, especially with Seq2Seq models that can be quite large. I’ve often encountered this issue when training sequence models, and maintaining only the most recent, say, three checkpoints is crucial for efficient resource management.

The core mechanism for managing checkpoints in TensorFlow revolves around the `tf.train.Checkpoint` and `tf.train.CheckpointManager` classes. Specifically, `CheckpointManager` offers the functionality required to limit the number of retained checkpoints. The `max_to_keep` argument within the `CheckpointManager` constructor directly addresses the need to constrain the total number of saved checkpoint files. This eliminates the manual deletion of older checkpoints which is highly error prone.

To implement this, I create a `tf.train.Checkpoint` instance that tracks all the objects I want to save – model weights, optimizer state, etc. Subsequently, I wrap this checkpoint within a `tf.train.CheckpointManager`. Within the `CheckpointManager` constructor, I set `max_to_keep` to 3. During training, after each checkpointable step, I call `CheckpointManager.save()`. `CheckpointManager` then intelligently handles the cleanup, ensuring that a maximum of three checkpoint files remain. Older files will be automatically deleted as newer ones are created.

Here are three code examples illustrating different scenarios for limiting checkpoints:

**Example 1: Basic Model and Optimizer Checkpointing**

This first example demonstrates the most common scenario – checkpointing the model weights and the optimizer. This is sufficient for restarting training from a specific point and continuing the learning process.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple model
class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)

model = MyModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Create a tf.train.Checkpoint instance
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(optimizer=optimizer, model=model)

# Create a CheckpointManager, setting max_to_keep to 3
checkpoint_dir = './checkpoints'
checkpoint_manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint, checkpoint_dir, max_to_keep=3)

# Training loop (simplified)
for step in range(10):
    # Fake data and training steps
    inputs = tf.random.normal((32, 784)) # Example input shape
    labels = tf.random.uniform((32,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)

    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(inputs)
        loss = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))


    # Save a checkpoint after every step
    save_path = checkpoint_manager.save()
    print(f"Checkpoint saved at {save_path} after step {step}")


    #Restore Example (For testing purposes)
    if step > 5:
        status = checkpoint.restore(checkpoint_manager.latest_checkpoint)
        print("Restored checkpoint")
        status.assert_consumed()

```

In this code:

-  A basic Keras Model is defined.
-  A standard `Adam` optimizer is used.
-  The `tf.train.Checkpoint` is initialized to track the model and the optimizer.
-  A `tf.train.CheckpointManager` is instantiated with `max_to_keep` set to 3.
-  A simplified training loop iterates 10 times. After each step, `checkpoint_manager.save()` saves a new checkpoint. `CheckpointManager` takes care of removing old checkpoints as needed.
- A basic restore process is added to verify the restoring of the checkpoint.
- The console output confirms checkpoint paths and successful restores, proving that only the last three checkpoints are retained.

**Example 2: Checkpointing with Additional Variables**

Here, I expand on the previous example by including a training step counter, a common necessity when restoring training state from a checkpoint. By also checkpointing this, I ensure that my training doesn't restart from step one when recovering from a crash.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Define the model (same as above)
class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)

model = MyModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()


# Initialize a step counter
step_counter = tf.Variable(0, dtype=tf.int64)

# Create a tf.train.Checkpoint instance, including the step counter
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(optimizer=optimizer, model=model, step=step_counter)

# Create a CheckpointManager, setting max_to_keep to 3
checkpoint_dir = './checkpoints_with_step'
checkpoint_manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint, checkpoint_dir, max_to_keep=3)

# Training loop (simplified)
for _ in range(10):
    # Increment the step counter
    step_counter.assign_add(1)

    # Fake training step
    inputs = tf.random.normal((32, 784))
    labels = tf.random.uniform((32,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)

    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(inputs)
        loss = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    # Save a checkpoint
    save_path = checkpoint_manager.save()
    print(f"Checkpoint saved at {save_path} at step {step_counter.numpy()}")

    # Restore example
    if step_counter > 5:
        status = checkpoint.restore(checkpoint_manager.latest_checkpoint)
        print("Restored checkpoint")
        status.assert_consumed()
        print(f"Restored step counter = {step_counter.numpy()}")
```
Key changes in this code:
-   `step_counter` variable has been introduced, which will be used to track the global training step.
-   This variable is included in the checkpoint list.
-   During the training, we increment the step counter.
-   After a training step and saving checkpoint, the value of the step counter is printed.
-   The restore process has been extended to include printing the restored `step_counter` variable.

**Example 3: Saving Model Variables with Custom File Names**

In some instances, you might require customized file naming patterns for your checkpoints. `CheckpointManager` by default produces numbered checkpoints. This section expands upon example 1 but shows how to create named checkpoint files.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

#Define the model (same as above)
class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.dense1(inputs)
        return self.dense2(x)

model = MyModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Create a tf.train.Checkpoint instance
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(optimizer=optimizer, model=model)

# Create a CheckpointManager, setting max_to_keep to 3
checkpoint_dir = './checkpoints_named'
checkpoint_manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint, checkpoint_dir, max_to_keep=3)

# Training loop (simplified)
for step in range(10):

    # Fake training data
    inputs = tf.random.normal((32, 784))
    labels = tf.random.uniform((32,), minval=0, maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)

    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(inputs)
        loss = tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(labels, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    # Custom file name
    checkpoint_name = f"checkpoint_step_{step}"

    save_path = checkpoint_manager.save(file_prefix = checkpoint_name)
    print(f"Checkpoint saved at {save_path}")
    #Restore Example (For testing purposes)
    if step > 5:
      status = checkpoint.restore(checkpoint_manager.latest_checkpoint)
      print("Restored checkpoint")
      status.assert_consumed()

```
- I set the `file_prefix` argument to `checkpoint_manager.save` function. The filename will have the prefix added, making it more descriptive.
- The checkpoint restore example works as previously.

Regarding resource recommendations for further investigation, the official TensorFlow documentation for `tf.train.Checkpoint` and `tf.train.CheckpointManager` is paramount. Deep understanding is gained by exploring the API reference and tutorials. Books focusing on deep learning with TensorFlow often contain detailed explanations of checkpoint management techniques. Finally, reviewing community forums and repositories on platforms such as GitHub is helpful to see the various ways that developers use the `CheckpointManager` for complex projects. These resources provide the theoretical and practical foundation for implementing efficient and reliable checkpointing practices in TensorFlow.
