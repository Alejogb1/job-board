The core difference in eigen::matrix inversion behavior between GCC and NVCC compilers stems from the underlying linear algebra libraries they utilize and their respective optimization strategies for different hardware architectures.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing (HPC) applications across these compilers has highlighted this discrepancy repeatedly. GCC, typically targeting CPUs, leverages highly optimized BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) implementations like OpenBLAS or Intel MKL, which are highly tuned for CPU cache hierarchies and instruction sets.  NVCC, on the other hand, compiles for NVIDIA GPUs, relying heavily on CUDA libraries and their highly parallel execution model.  This fundamental architectural difference directly impacts the performance and, in some edge cases, the numerical stability of matrix inversion routines.


**1. Explanation of Divergent Behavior:**

Eigen's versatility allows it to adapt to both CPU and GPU environments. When compiled with GCC, Eigen detects the available BLAS/LAPACK libraries and leverages their highly optimized routines for matrix operations, including inversion.  These libraries employ sophisticated algorithms like LU decomposition or Cholesky decomposition, often with pivoting strategies for numerical stability.  The choice of algorithm and its specific implementation details within the chosen BLAS/LAPACK library can influence the outcome, particularly for ill-conditioned matrices.  Minor variations in floating-point arithmetic, due to different compiler optimizations and underlying hardware, can also lead to slightly differing results.

When compiled with NVCC, Eigen's behavior shifts significantly.  It now utilizes CUDA libraries to perform computations on the GPU.  This involves offloading the matrix inversion calculation to the GPU, requiring data transfer between the host (CPU) and the device (GPU).  The CUDA libraries employed by Eigen will utilize algorithms optimized for parallel processing, often relying on block-wise operations and memory coalescing techniques to maximize throughput.  However, the inherent limitations of floating-point precision in GPU arithmetic, coupled with potential differences in error handling and exception management compared to CPU-based libraries, can lead to observable discrepancies in the results, especially when dealing with large matrices or those close to singularity.

Furthermore, the memory management strategy significantly impacts performance. CPU-based computations generally have low latency memory access, while GPU computations rely on efficient memory management to minimize latency and maximize parallelism.  Inefficient memory access patterns in the CUDA implementation can considerably slow down the inversion process, outweighing any potential speedup gained from parallelism.  This is why careful consideration of memory alignment and data structures is crucial when using Eigen with NVCC.  Lastly, the error handling mechanisms differ.  CPU-based BLAS/LAPACK implementations often provide more detailed error reporting, whereas CUDA's error handling might be less granular, potentially masking subtle numerical issues.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Matrix Inversion with GCC:**

```c++
#include <Eigen/Dense>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  Eigen::Matrix3d A;
  A << 1, 2, 3,
       4, 5, 6,
       7, 8, 10;

  Eigen::Matrix3d Ainv = A.inverse();
  std::cout << "Inverse (GCC):\n" << Ainv << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This simple example demonstrates a basic matrix inversion using Eigen compiled with GCC.  The compiler automatically links against the system's default BLAS/LAPACK library.  The output will depend on the specific library used, influencing the precision and potential rounding errors.

**Example 2: Matrix Inversion with NVCC (using Eigen's CUDA support):**

```c++
#include <Eigen/Dense>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  Eigen::Matrix3d A;
  A << 1, 2, 3,
       4, 5, 6,
       7, 8, 10;

  Eigen::Matrix3d Ainv = A.inverse();  // Eigen's CUDA support handles this differently
  std::cout << "Inverse (NVCC):\n" << Ainv << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This example is structurally identical, but compiled with NVCC.  Eigen's CUDA support (if enabled correctly during the build process) automatically utilizes CUDA libraries for the inversion.  The noticeable difference lies in the execution environment and the underlying linear algebra routines used. This code requires explicit CUDA support within the Eigen build configuration.

**Example 3:  Illustrating Potential Numerical Differences (with ill-conditioned matrix):**

```c++
#include <Eigen/Dense>
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

int main() {
  Eigen::Matrix2d A;
  A << 1.00001, 1,
       1, 1;

  Eigen::Matrix2d Ainv_gcc = A.inverse();
  // Compile with GCC and obtain Ainv_gcc

  Eigen::Matrix2d Ainv_nvcc = A.inverse();
  // Compile with NVCC and obtain Ainv_nvcc

  std::cout << std::setprecision(15);
  std::cout << "Inverse (GCC):\n" << Ainv_gcc << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Inverse (NVCC):\n" << Ainv_nvcc << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This example uses an ill-conditioned matrix, making subtle numerical differences more apparent. The outputs Ainv_gcc and Ainv_nvcc, obtained from separate compilations with GCC and NVCC respectively, might show small but measurable differences in their elements, reflecting the different underlying algorithms and floating-point arithmetic characteristics. The use of `std::setprecision(15)` highlights the potential for discrepancies in the lower-order digits.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The Eigen documentation: This provides comprehensive information on building Eigen with different compilers and utilizing its advanced features, including CUDA support.
*  A good linear algebra textbook:  A thorough understanding of matrix decomposition methods (LU, Cholesky, QR) and their numerical properties is essential to fully grasp the implications of different inversion implementations.
*  CUDA Programming Guide:  For understanding the CUDA programming model, memory management strategies, and optimizing performance on NVIDIA GPUs.
*  BLAS/LAPACK documentation:  To comprehend the intricacies of the underlying linear algebra libraries used by Eigen when compiled with GCC.


By carefully considering the compiler, the chosen linear algebra libraries, and the characteristics of the input matrix, one can effectively mitigate discrepancies and harness the power of both CPU and GPU platforms for efficient and numerically stable matrix inversions.  In my experience, understanding the trade-offs between speed and numerical precision is paramount, particularly in HPC applications involving extensive matrix computations.
