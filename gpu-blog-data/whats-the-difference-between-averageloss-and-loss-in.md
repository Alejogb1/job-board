The core distinction between `average_loss` and `loss` in TensorFlow Estimators lies in their aggregation behavior during training.  `loss` represents the per-example loss, while `average_loss` presents the mean loss across the entire batch. This seemingly minor difference is crucial for understanding training dynamics, model evaluation, and debugging.  My experience working on large-scale image classification models using TensorFlow Estimators highlighted this distinction numerous times, particularly when troubleshooting training instabilities and optimizing hyperparameters.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow Estimators, while largely superseded by the Keras approach, employed a specific structure for training and evaluation.  During each training step, the model processes a batch of data. For every example within that batch, the model generates a loss value reflecting the discrepancy between its prediction and the ground truth.  The `loss` tensor, accessible within the `model_fn`, captures these individual loss values for each example in the batch.  This tensor has a shape determined by the batch size.  Conversely, `average_loss` computes the arithmetic mean of these individual losses, collapsing the batch-wise loss values into a single scalar.

This averaging operation is performed automatically within the Estimator's training loop. This simplifies the monitoring of training progress as it provides a single, easily interpretable metric.  However, accessing the per-example loss (`loss`) offers a more granular view, enabling the identification of outliers or anomalies in the training data that might skew the average and negatively impact model generalization.  Furthermore, certain optimization algorithms might benefit from access to per-example gradients derived from the `loss` tensor rather than the averaged gradient from `average_loss`.

The availability of both metrics facilitates comprehensive monitoring and diagnosis.  Observing discrepancies between the distribution of `loss` values and the `average_loss` can indicate problematic data points, potential issues with the model architecture, or the need for more robust regularization techniques.  In my past projects, analyzing the distribution of `loss` often proved invaluable in detecting data corruption or labeling errors that might have gone unnoticed when only examining the `average_loss`.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Custom Estimator with Loss and Average Loss Calculation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
    # ... Model definition using tf.keras.layers ...
    predictions = model(features)

    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT:
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, predictions=predictions)

    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(labels, predictions)) #Per-example loss calculation not shown explicitly in this case due to the use of tf.reduce_mean already, but implicit in the cross-entropy calculation.
    average_loss = loss #In this simple example they are identical because of the explicit use of tf.reduce_mean in the loss calculation.

    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
        optimizer = tf.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=params['learning_rate'])
        train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss=loss, global_step=tf.compat.v1.train.get_global_step())
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, loss=loss, train_op=train_op)

    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.EVAL:
        eval_metric_ops = {
            "average_loss": tf.metrics.mean(average_loss),
        }
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, loss=loss, eval_metric_ops=eval_metric_ops)

estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=model_fn, params={'learning_rate': 0.001})
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates a straightforward implementation.  Note that while `loss` is explicitly defined, in this simplified case the average loss is implicitly calculated by `tf.reduce_mean`. The `tf.metrics.mean()` function further averages the loss over all batches during evaluation. A more sophisticated example would separate the per-example and batch-averaged loss calculations more distinctly.

**Example 2:  Illustrating the Difference with Per-Example Loss Calculation:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):
    # ... Model definition ...
    predictions = model(features)

    # Explicit per-example loss calculation
    loss_per_example = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(labels, predictions)

    # Batch average loss
    average_loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss_per_example)

    if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
        # ... training logic ...
        return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode, loss=loss_per_example, train_op=train_op)
    # ... evaluation and prediction logic ...
```

**Commentary:** Here, `loss_per_example` explicitly represents the loss for each example.  `average_loss` is then derived from this.  This clearly shows the difference in the tensor shapes; `loss_per_example` will have a shape equal to the batch size, while `average_loss` will be a scalar.  The `loss` argument to the `EstimatorSpec` in training mode could use either `loss_per_example` or `average_loss` depending on the optimizer's requirements.

**Example 3: Accessing Loss for Debugging:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... model_fn definition similar to Example 2 ...

if mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN:
  # ... training logic ...

  # Log the loss values for debugging:
  tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar('average_loss', average_loss)
  tf.compat.v1.summary.histogram('loss_per_example', loss_per_example) #To visualize the distribution of per-example losses

  # ... rest of the training logic ...
```

**Commentary:** This example highlights the usage of TensorFlow summaries to monitor both the `average_loss` and the distribution of `loss_per_example` during training. The histogram provides a visual representation of the per-example loss distribution, allowing for the identification of potential outliers or anomalies.  This is crucial for robust model development and debugging.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow's official documentation (prior to the Keras-centric shift);  books on deep learning with TensorFlow, specifically those covering the Estimator API;  research papers on loss functions and optimization techniques in deep learning.  Thorough understanding of the fundamentals of numerical optimization and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is also beneficial.
