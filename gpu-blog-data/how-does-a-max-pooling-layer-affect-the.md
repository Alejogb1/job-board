The number of feature channels remains unchanged after passing through a max pooling layer.  This is a crucial point often overlooked in initial understandings of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  My experience optimizing CNN architectures for image classification, particularly within the context of medical image analysis projects, has highlighted the importance of this distinction.  While the spatial dimensions of the feature maps are reduced, the depth – representing the number of feature channels – is preserved.

**1. Explanation**

A max pooling layer operates independently on each feature channel. Consider a feature map with dimensions *H* x *W* x *C*, where *H* and *W* represent the height and width, and *C* represents the number of channels.  Each channel contains a grid of feature values. The max pooling operation, typically with a 2x2 kernel and stride of 2, slides a window across each channel individually. For each window, it selects the maximum value within that window.  This process results in a downsampled feature map for that specific channel.  Crucially, the same operation is repeated for *each* of the *C* channels.  The output, therefore, retains *C* channels, but with reduced height and width dimensions.

To clarify the independence, imagine applying max pooling to a color image (RGB).  The red, green, and blue channels are processed separately.  The max pooling operation doesn't combine information across channels; it only operates within the confines of each individual channel. The result is a smaller image, but still with three color channels.  This parallel processing is fundamental to the operation and explains the channel preservation.  Any confusion often stems from a misunderstanding of the parallel nature of the operation across channels. The output dimensionality becomes (H/stride) x (W/stride) x C, assuming a square kernel with dimensions equal to the stride.  Padding can modify the output dimensions but doesn't affect the number of channels.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate this concept with three code examples using Python and a common deep learning library, PyTorch.  These examples showcase the channel preservation property under varying conditions.

**Example 1: Basic Max Pooling**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input tensor: 32x32 image with 64 channels
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 64, 32, 32)

# Define max pooling layer with kernel size 2x2 and stride 2
max_pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)

# Apply max pooling
output_tensor = max_pool(input_tensor)

# Print the shape of the output tensor
print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: torch.Size([1, 64, 16, 16])
```

This example demonstrates the fundamental behavior.  The input has 64 channels, and despite the downsampling, the output retains all 64 channels. The spatial dimensions are halved as expected.


**Example 2: Max Pooling with Padding**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input tensor: 32x32 image with 128 channels
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 128, 32, 32)

# Define max pooling layer with kernel size 2x2, stride 2, and padding 1
max_pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=1)

# Apply max pooling
output_tensor = max_pool(input_tensor)

# Print the shape of the output tensor
print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: torch.Size([1, 128, 16, 16])
```

Here, we introduce padding.  Padding adds extra pixels around the borders of the feature maps.  This can affect the output spatial dimensions, but – again –  the number of channels remains unchanged at 128. The padding ensures the output dimensions are still larger than what would be obtained without padding.


**Example 3:  Multiple Max Pooling Layers**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Input tensor: 64x64 image with 32 channels
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 32, 64, 64)

# Define two max pooling layers
max_pool1 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)
max_pool2 = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2)

# Apply max pooling sequentially
output_tensor = max_pool2(max_pool1(input_tensor))

# Print the shape of the output tensor
print(output_tensor.shape) # Output: torch.Size([1, 32, 16, 16])
```

This example shows that applying multiple max pooling layers sequentially still preserves the number of channels.  The spatial dimensions are reduced further, but the 32 channels are consistently carried through both operations.  This illustrates the channel-wise independence of the max pooling operation.  Each layer independently processes each channel, and applying multiple layers simply performs this process multiple times on the same set of channels.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of convolutional neural networks and max pooling, I recommend consulting standard textbooks on deep learning.  These texts usually provide detailed explanations of convolutional architectures, including the mathematical foundations of operations like max pooling.  Additionally, review papers focusing on CNN architectures for various applications offer valuable insights into practical applications and design considerations. Finally,  thoroughly reviewing the documentation for deep learning libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow is invaluable for practical implementation and understanding of the underlying functionalities.  Understanding the underlying mathematical concepts enhances the ability to interpret and debug code efficiently.  Furthermore, working through practical exercises and building your own CNNs will solidify this understanding.
