The core challenge in executing scripts from a GPU session lies not in the script itself, but in the efficient and correct transfer of data and the management of parallel processing resources within the GPU's memory space.  My experience developing high-throughput image processing pipelines for astronomical data taught me the crucial role of inter-process communication and optimized memory management in achieving this.  Neglecting these aspects often results in performance bottlenecks or outright failure.

The primary approach involves leveraging libraries designed for GPU computation, like CUDA or OpenCL, along with suitable programming languages such as C++, Python (with libraries like CuPy or Numba), or even specialized languages like OpenACC.  The script, whether written in Python, R, or another language, needs to interface with these libraries to offload computationally intensive tasks to the GPU. This is typically achieved through explicit calls to GPU-accelerated functions or by utilizing parallel processing frameworks that abstract away low-level GPU management.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The process broadly consists of three phases: data transfer, kernel execution, and data retrieval.  First, the necessary data from the script's context needs to be transferred from the CPU's main memory to the GPU's global memory. This transfer is often the primary performance bottleneck.  Second, the GPU executes the computation, which is typically structured as a *kernel*, a function optimized for parallel execution on many GPU cores.  Third, the results of the kernel execution are transferred back from the GPU's memory to the CPU's memory for further processing or output by the original script.

The efficiency hinges on minimizing data transfers.  Techniques like asynchronous data transfers and zero-copy memory mapping can significantly improve performance.  Careful consideration of data structures and memory alignment is also critical for optimal kernel performance.  For instance, using coalesced memory access patterns reduces memory access latency considerably.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: CUDA C++ for Matrix Multiplication**

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Kernel function for matrix multiplication
__global__ void matrixMultiply(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int width) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

    if (row < width && col < width) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int k = 0; k < width; ++k) {
            sum += A[row * width + k] * B[k * width + col];
        }
        C[row * width + col] = sum;
    }
}

int main() {
    // ... (Memory allocation, data transfer to GPU, kernel launch, data transfer back to CPU, error handling) ...
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates a basic matrix multiplication using CUDA.  The `matrixMultiply` function is the kernel, executed in parallel by many threads on the GPU.  The `main` function handles memory management and data transfer between CPU and GPU.  Note the omission of the memory allocation, data transfer, and error handling sections for brevity; those are crucial components in a production-ready code.  Proper error checking using CUDA runtime functions is essential.


**Example 2: Python with CuPy for Image Filtering**

```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np
from scipy import ndimage

# Load image using NumPy
image_np = ndimage.imread("image.jpg")

# Transfer to CuPy array
image_cp = cp.asarray(image_np)

# Apply Gaussian filter on GPU
filtered_image_cp = cp.ndimage.gaussian_filter(image_cp, sigma=2)

# Transfer result back to NumPy
filtered_image_np = cp.asnumpy(filtered_image_cp)

# ... (Further processing or saving of filtered_image_np) ...
```

This example utilizes CuPy, a NumPy-compatible library for GPU computing. The `gaussian_filter` function, normally CPU-bound in NumPy, is efficiently executed on the GPU.  The seamless integration with NumPy simplifies the workflow, reducing the need for explicit memory management.  However, the overhead of data transfer between NumPy and CuPy should be considered for very large images.


**Example 3:  OpenCL C for a Simple Computation**

```c
// ... (Includes and OpenCL setup) ...

// Kernel function for a simple computation
__kernel void simpleComputation(__global const float *input, __global float *output, int size) {
    int i = get_global_id(0);
    if (i < size) {
        output[i] = input[i] * 2.0f;
    }
}

int main() {
    // ... (OpenCL context creation, program build, kernel execution, memory allocation, data transfer, cleanup) ...
    return 0;
}

```

OpenCL offers platform independence, allowing execution on various GPU architectures.  This example shows a simple kernel that doubles the values in an input array.  The complexity lies in managing the OpenCL context, building the program, and handling the various OpenCL objects, which are substantially more involved than the CUDA example.  Careful error handling at each step is paramount.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of GPU computing, I recommend consulting the official documentation for CUDA, OpenCL, and relevant libraries such as CuPy or Numba. Textbooks on parallel computing and high-performance computing are beneficial for grasping the theoretical foundations.  Advanced topics include memory coalescing, shared memory optimization, and asynchronous data transfers.  Exploring specific application examples within your field of interest would provide further practical insights and accelerate the learning process.  Finally, studying benchmark results and profiling tools can significantly enhance your understanding of performance bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts.
