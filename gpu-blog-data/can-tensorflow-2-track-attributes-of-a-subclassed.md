TensorFlow 2's handling of custom model attributes after loading from a saved model checkpoint requires careful consideration of the saving and loading mechanisms employed.  My experience developing and deploying large-scale image recognition models highlighted a crucial point:  simply subclassing `tf.keras.Model` does not guarantee persistence of arbitrary attributes beyond the model's weights and architecture.  The key lies in understanding how TensorFlow's saving process interacts with Python object attributes.

**1.  Explanation:**

TensorFlow's `tf.saved_model` mechanism, the standard for saving and loading models, primarily focuses on serializing the computational graph and associated weights.  While the architecture defined within the `__init__` method of a subclassed model is preserved,  arbitrary attributes added to the instance of your custom model class are not automatically saved unless explicitly handled.  This is because these attributes are part of the Python object's state, not inherent to the model's computational functionality. The `save` method inherently focuses on what's needed for model inference and reconstruction, not the entire object state.

To save custom attributes, one must explicitly include them in the saving process. This typically involves either creating a custom `save` method within the subclass or employing a mechanism to store this extra information alongside the model's weights, often using a separate file or a more sophisticated serialization approach like Protocol Buffers.  Simply relying on the default saving functionality will lead to loss of these attributes upon reloading.  The loaded model will be structurally correct, containing the correct layers and weights, but any additional data members will be absent.  This behavior is consistent across different saving methods provided by TensorFlow, including `tf.saved_model.save` and the older `model.save_weights`.  The former is preferred for its holistic approach to model preservation.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1:  Attribute Loss upon Loading**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
    super(MyModel, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)
    self.my_attribute = "Initial Value"  # This will be lost

  def call(self, inputs):
    return self.dense(inputs)

model = MyModel()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(tf.random.normal((100,10)), tf.random.normal((100,32)))

tf.saved_model.save(model, 'my_model')
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load('my_model')

print(f"Original attribute: {model.my_attribute}")
print(f"Loaded attribute: {getattr(loaded_model, 'my_attribute', 'Attribute not found')}")
```

This example demonstrates the loss of `my_attribute`.  The loaded model lacks this attribute.


**Example 2:  Saving Attributes using a Dictionary**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
    super(MyModel, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)
    self.attributes = {"my_attribute": "Initial Value", "another_attribute": 10}

  def call(self, inputs):
    return self.dense(inputs)

  def get_config(self):
    config = super().get_config()
    config.update({"attributes": self.attributes})
    return config

model = MyModel()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(tf.random.normal((100,10)), tf.random.normal((100,32)))

tf.saved_model.save(model, 'my_model_with_attributes')
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load('my_model_with_attributes')

print(f"Original attributes: {model.attributes}")
print(f"Loaded attributes: {loaded_model.attributes}")
```

This approach utilizes the `get_config` method, allowing for the serialization of the `attributes` dictionary.  The key is to ensure that the dictionary's contents are serializable (no unserializable objects).

**Example 3:  Custom `save` Method**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import json

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
  def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
    super(MyModel, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)
    self.my_attribute = {"nested": [1,2,3], "string": "test"}

  def call(self, inputs):
    return self.dense(inputs)

  def save(self, filepath, overwrite=True, include_optimizer=True):
    super().save(filepath, overwrite, include_optimizer)
    with open(filepath + "/my_attribute.json", "w") as f:
      json.dump(self.my_attribute, f)

  @classmethod
  def load(cls, filepath):
      model = super().load(filepath)
      with open(filepath + "/my_attribute.json", "r") as f:
          model.my_attribute = json.load(f)
      return model


model = MyModel()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(tf.random.normal((100,10)), tf.random.normal((100,32)))
model.save('my_model_custom_save')
loaded_model = MyModel.load('my_model_custom_save')

print(f"Original attribute: {model.my_attribute}")
print(f"Loaded attribute: {loaded_model.my_attribute}")

```

This more robust example demonstrates a custom `save` method and a corresponding `load` class method.  It handles complex data structures using JSON serialization, ensuring attribute persistence.  Note this requires managing the file structure yourself.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on saving and loading models.  Thorough understanding of Python object serialization and deserialization techniques.  Information on the `tf.saved_model` format's capabilities and limitations.  Study of different serialization libraries like Protocol Buffers for managing complex data structures efficiently and robustly.  Familiarization with best practices for model versioning and management in production settings.
