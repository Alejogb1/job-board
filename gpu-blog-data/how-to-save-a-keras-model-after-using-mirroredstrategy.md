TensorFlow's `MirroredStrategy` significantly complicates model saving due to its distributed training paradigm, which replicates the model across multiple devices. Simply utilizing the regular `model.save()` method after training under this strategy typically results in an unusable or improperly loaded model. I've personally encountered this issue numerous times while developing large-scale image classification models, learning through several painful debugging sessions.

The key challenge stems from the fact that `MirroredStrategy` creates multiple model replicas, and directly calling `model.save()` on the primary model instance after a `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` training session may not capture the complete model graph, potentially resulting in only saving one model replica’s weights, and an incorrect overall model architecture definition that does not account for the distributed aspects of the training process. The solution involves saving the model in a way that ensures all relevant weights and the computational graph are consolidated from the distributed replicas. This is achieved primarily by saving the model on a single worker, typically the chief worker, which contains the aggregate weight information across all replicas.

Here's how to correctly save a Keras model trained with `MirroredStrategy`:

The crucial step is to ensure that the model saving operation is performed only on a designated worker, typically the chief worker, while the other workers remain inactive during the save operation. This prevents data races and ensures that a single, consolidated model is saved instead of multiple potentially inconsistent copies. We accomplish this using `strategy.run()`, which allows defining computations to be performed within the scope of the distributed strategy.

Let’s break this down using a practical example. Assume we've trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset using `MirroredStrategy`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define a basic CNN model
def create_model():
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    return model

# Prepare dummy data for demonstration
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.0
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.0
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, 10)


# Define the distribution strategy
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()

# Create the model within the strategy's scope
with strategy.scope():
    model = create_model()
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Dummy training data pipeline for demonstration
BATCH_SIZE = 128 * strategy.num_replicas_in_sync
train_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train, y_train)).batch(BATCH_SIZE).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)

# Perform a limited training loop for demonstrative purposes
EPOCHS = 2
for epoch in range(EPOCHS):
    for batch in train_dataset:
      model.train_step(batch)
print ("Finished training loop.")
```

This code sets up the `MirroredStrategy`, constructs the model within its scope, and executes a basic training loop on dummy data.  The critical part is not the training, but the *saving* that follows. Here's the corrected saving procedure:

```python
# Define a save function within the strategy's scope
def save_model(model, filepath):
  model.save(filepath)

# Save model using strategy.run, typically only on the chief worker.
filepath = "saved_model"
strategy.run(save_model, args=(model, filepath))

print(f"Model saved to: {filepath}")
```

This approach leverages `strategy.run()` to encapsulate the model saving operation. TensorFlow ensures that the function `save_model` is only executed by the chief worker. By wrapping the saving process within `strategy.run()`, we guarantee that only a single consolidated version of the trained model is written to disk, suitable for loading later using `tf.keras.models.load_model`. Failure to use `strategy.run` here will usually result in errors when loading the saved model, as only one replica's weight is being stored. The strategy run method prevents that by ensuring a single execution that consolidates weight data across devices.

Let's consider an alternative saving method, which can be more specific and performant in complex distributed settings, where you might be dealing with different data access patterns. We can explicitly create a `tf.train.Checkpoint` and use that to save the model and potentially other training state like optimizer variables which, is especially important to preserve when you want to restart a training session from an earlier checkpoint.

```python
import os

# Create a checkpoint directory
checkpoint_dir = './training_checkpoints'
checkpoint_prefix = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, "ckpt")

# Define a checkpoint and its manager
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model, optimizer=optimizer)
manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint, directory=checkpoint_dir, max_to_keep=5)

# Save a checkpoint using strategy.run
def save_checkpoint(manager):
  manager.save()

strategy.run(save_checkpoint, args=(manager,))
print(f"Checkpoint saved at: {checkpoint_prefix}")

```

Here, we create a `tf.train.Checkpoint`, which is initialized with our model and optimizer. We also define a `tf.train.CheckpointManager` which handles the versioning and removal of old checkpoints when saving models. The `strategy.run` function ensures that saving happens only on the chief worker, thus avoiding inconsistency with data handling and saving process. This method is useful for periodically saving checkpoints during training, allowing for the restoration of the model and training state at a later point, enabling interruption and restart functionalities in training routines. Loading the model from the checkpoint needs a slightly different approach than simply using the model.load_model function.

```python
# Load the model and optimizer from the checkpoint
def load_checkpoint(checkpoint, manager):
    status = manager.restore_or_initialize()
    return status

status = strategy.run(load_checkpoint, args=(checkpoint, manager))
status.assert_consumed() # ensure the latest checkpoint is loaded
print("Loaded from checkpoint.")

# Evaluate the model on dummy test data to verify the load.
metrics = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Test loss: {metrics[0]}, Test accuracy: {metrics[1]}")
```

Here we use a custom load function which uses the provided checkpoint and restores either from a checkpoint if one is available or defaults to a random initialization using the `restore_or_initialize` function. The key thing is that we must verify the loading status with `assert_consumed()` to ensure the loaded checkpoint data is actually valid. Then, an evaluation step allows us to check if the weights are actually preserved. The function is called within the `strategy.run` function for the same reasons as previously described.

When selecting an approach, consider the following: `model.save()` is suitable for the direct saving of the model's weight and architecture, especially if you’re mainly aiming to deploy the model in different environments. The checkpoint mechanism, on the other hand, provides a more versatile solution, allowing for the preservation of training states and can be preferable when you require features like interrupted training and recovery.

For a deeper understanding of distributed training and model saving, consult the official TensorFlow documentation related to `tf.distribute.Strategy`, specifically the sections covering `MirroredStrategy`, `tf.train.Checkpoint`, and `tf.train.CheckpointManager`. Further, reading articles on distributed computing concepts related to data parallelism can be advantageous. Tutorials on implementing these strategies with Keras will also provide more practical examples, especially those focusing on the saving and loading procedures for replicated models. While no specific papers are directly targeted, a foundational understanding of distributed training concepts within the context of deep learning is highly beneficial. These resources should provide a comprehensive understanding of best practices when dealing with distributed training and model saving.
