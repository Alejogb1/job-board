The `torch.load()` function in PyTorch is designed solely for loading serialized Python objects, primarily model weights and other training artifacts, from a disk-based storage format. It does not possess any inherent capability to initiate or participate in the training process itself. Training, conversely, is a procedural sequence involving forward passes, loss computation, gradient backpropagation, and weight updates, none of which are triggered by `torch.load()`. The misconception likely arises from the typical workflow where a model, loaded with pre-trained weights, is then immediately used for further training.

I’ve personally encountered situations where developers attempt to “train via load,” particularly when dealing with large, pre-trained models. This inevitably leads to errors or misunderstood behavior, primarily because they assume the `torch.load()` operation, which restores a model from storage, also activates the optimization process. In reality, `torch.load()` only reconstitutes the object and its state; it doesn't execute code or start computation. The loaded model becomes an object in the Python runtime, requiring additional code to be integrated into a training loop.

Let’s illustrate this with a hypothetical scenario. Imagine I've trained a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. I’ve saved its learned parameters using `torch.save()`. Now, I’ll demonstrate the process of loading these parameters and then continuing the training. The crucial distinction is that loading the weights with `torch.load()` is a separate step before the actual training commences.

**Code Example 1: Saving a model's weights**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple CNN model
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.maxpool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16 * 14 * 14, 10) # Assuming input size of 28x28

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.maxpool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)  # Flatten the feature map
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Initialize the model and optimizer
model = SimpleCNN()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Simulate a training step (in reality, you'd use a loop)
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 28, 28) # Example input tensor
output = model(dummy_input)
target = torch.randint(0, 10, (1,))  # Example target tensor
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
loss = criterion(output, target)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
optimizer.zero_grad()

# Save the model's state dictionary (weights)
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "my_cnn_weights.pth")
print("Model weights saved to my_cnn_weights.pth")
```
In this example, I created a basic CNN, performed a single training iteration and saved only the model's weights using `torch.save(model.state_dict(), ...)`. It’s critical to understand that only the state dictionary, not the entire model object, is being serialized. This is the standard practice for efficient weight management, allowing for more flexible model construction upon loading.

**Code Example 2: Loading saved weights and initializing the training loop**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the same CNN model
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.maxpool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16 * 14 * 14, 10) # Assuming input size of 28x28

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.maxpool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)  # Flatten the feature map
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Initialize the model
model = SimpleCNN()

# Load the saved weights into the model
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("my_cnn_weights.pth"))
print("Model weights loaded from my_cnn_weights.pth")

# Initialize the optimizer again, ensuring it's using the loaded model's parameters
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Simulate another training step to show the training process after loading
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 28, 28) # Example input tensor
output = model(dummy_input)
target = torch.randint(0, 10, (1,)) # Example target tensor
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
loss = criterion(output, target)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
optimizer.zero_grad()
print("Model has been trained after loading the weights.")
```
This example shows that `torch.load()` was used exclusively to populate the initialized model's state dictionary. This operation doesn't perform training; it merely copies saved data. I then defined an optimizer again, attached it to the model, and then manually invoked the training routine via another forward and backward pass. This explicitly highlights that loading the model is only the first step and not the entire training procedure.

**Code Example 3: Loading and training with a data loader**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Define the same CNN model
class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.maxpool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(16 * 14 * 14, 10) # Assuming input size of 28x28

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.maxpool(self.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)  # Flatten the feature map
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Initialize the model
model = SimpleCNN()

# Load the saved weights into the model
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("my_cnn_weights.pth"))
print("Model weights loaded from my_cnn_weights.pth")

# Initialize the optimizer again
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Generate some dummy data for demonstration
dummy_data = torch.randn(100, 3, 28, 28)
dummy_labels = torch.randint(0, 10, (100,))
dataset = TensorDataset(dummy_data, dummy_labels)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10)

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Perform training for several epochs
num_epochs = 2
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")

print("Model has been trained for multiple epochs after loading the weights.")
```
Here, I created a data loader and demonstrated a full training loop across multiple epochs, further showcasing that loading a model's weights only initializes the model state, but not training process. This example illustrates a common real-world scenario for using pre-trained weights, where a model is loaded and further refined with custom data.

In summary, `torch.load()` is a fundamental tool for persistence and reusability of trained models. It facilitates saving model states and reinstating models from saved parameters. However, it is not designed to initiate or participate in the training process directly. To continue or begin training after using `torch.load()`, explicit initialization of an optimizer, a loss function, and a training loop are required. The examples I've provided underline this vital distinction.

For further understanding and effective application of PyTorch, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation, specifically the tutorials on saving and loading models. Additionally, exploring example implementations within the PyTorch examples repository, particularly those demonstrating transfer learning, can offer valuable insights. Finally, studying research publications from the field of deep learning can contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the theory and practical application of these techniques.
