TensorFlow's failure to utilize the GPU often stems from a mismatch between the TensorFlow installation, the hardware configuration, and the execution environment.  In my experience troubleshooting this issue across numerous projects—from large-scale image recognition models to smaller, specialized NLP tasks—the root cause rarely lies in a single, easily identifiable problem. Instead, it's usually a combination of factors requiring systematic debugging.

**1.  Clear Explanation of Potential Causes:**

TensorFlow relies on CUDA, a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA, to leverage the processing power of NVIDIA GPUs.  If CUDA is not properly installed or configured, or if there's an incompatibility between TensorFlow, CUDA, and the specific NVIDIA driver version installed, GPU acceleration will be unavailable.  The problem often manifests as TensorFlow operations executing on the CPU, resulting in significantly slower training and inference times.

Beyond the CUDA/driver compatibility issue, several other contributing factors exist:

* **Incorrect TensorFlow Installation:**  Installing TensorFlow without specifying GPU support during installation will lead to a CPU-only configuration. This is a frequent oversight, especially when using pip or conda.  The installation instructions must explicitly indicate GPU support, often requiring the installation of specific CUDA toolkit and cuDNN libraries.  Failure to satisfy these dependencies leads to TensorFlow defaulting to CPU execution.

* **Environment Variable Issues:**  Environment variables like `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` control which GPUs TensorFlow can access.  Incorrectly setting or omitting these variables can prevent TensorFlow from detecting or using available GPUs.  Furthermore, conflicts between environment variables set within different shells or virtual environments can complicate the issue.

* **Code Errors:**  While less common, incorrect code can inadvertently restrict GPU usage.  For instance, explicitly placing TensorFlow operations within a `tf.device('/CPU:0')` context will force them to run on the CPU, regardless of GPU availability.  Similarly, inadequate memory allocation on the GPU can lead to TensorFlow resorting to CPU execution for parts of the computation.

* **Driver Issues:**  Outdated or corrupted NVIDIA drivers are a major source of problems.  Outdated drivers may lack support for the specific TensorFlow version, while corrupted drivers can cause instability and prevent proper GPU detection.  It is crucial to install and maintain the most recent drivers compatible with both the GPU and the CUDA toolkit.

* **Hardware Limitations:**  While less frequent, the GPU itself might be the culprit.  Insufficient GPU memory (VRAM) can limit the size of models that can be trained effectively on the GPU.  Similarly, older GPU architectures may lack the necessary features supported by newer TensorFlow versions.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following code examples illustrate different aspects of troubleshooting GPU usage within TensorFlow.

**Example 1: Verifying GPU Availability:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

if len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')) > 0:
    print("GPU is available")
    try:
        # Explicitly allocate GPU memory for a session
        gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
        if gpus:
            try:
                # Currently, memory growth needs to be the same across GPUs
                for gpu in gpus:
                    tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpu, True)
                logical_gpus = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
                print(len(logical_gpus), "Physical GPUs,", len(logical_gpus), "Logical GPUs")
            except RuntimeError as e:
                # Virtual devices must be set before GPUs have been initialized
                print(e)
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print(e) #Handle runtime errors, often related to memory allocation.
else:
    print("GPU is not available. Check your installation and CUDA setup.")

```

This code snippet verifies whether TensorFlow can detect and access any GPUs on the system.  The output directly indicates GPU availability, aiding in initial troubleshooting.  The memory growth setting is crucial for avoiding out-of-memory errors.  Error handling is important to identify underlying issues.

**Example 2:  Explicit GPU Device Placement:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check for GPU availability (as in Example 1)

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):  # Use GPU 0 if available; otherwise, falls back to CPU.
    # Define and train your TensorFlow model here.
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

```

This example demonstrates explicit device placement.  If a GPU is detected (`/GPU:0`), the model will be trained on it. Otherwise, TensorFlow will gracefully fall back to the CPU, preventing a crash.  This approach provides a controlled way to manage resource allocation.


**Example 3: Handling Out-of-Memory Errors:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        # Your TensorFlow operations here
        #...potentially memory intensive operations...
except tf.errors.ResourceExhaustedError as e:
    print(f"Out of GPU memory: {e}")
    # Fallback to CPU or reduce batch size, model size or precision.
    with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
        # Perform operations on the CPU
        #...potentially a reduced-size operation or lower precision calculations...
```

This code showcases error handling for out-of-memory (OOM) situations.  By catching `tf.errors.ResourceExhaustedError`, the program can gracefully handle memory limitations, potentially by reducing batch size or model complexity to allow execution on the available GPU memory, or switching to CPU execution.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is the primary resource for installation and troubleshooting.  Consult the CUDA toolkit documentation for detailed information about CUDA installation, driver versions, and troubleshooting.  NVIDIA's website offers extensive support documentation for their GPUs and drivers. Finally, many online forums and communities dedicated to TensorFlow and deep learning offer valuable insights and solutions from experienced users.  Careful examination of error messages provided by TensorFlow is paramount.  Understanding the specific error codes and messages provides valuable clues for pinpointing the source of the GPU-related problem.
