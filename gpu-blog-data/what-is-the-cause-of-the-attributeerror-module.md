The `AttributeError: 'module 'tensorflow._api.v2.summary' has no attribute 'image'` arises from attempting to use the TensorFlow 2.x `tf.summary.image` function within a context where it's unavailable, primarily due to an incorrect import or TensorFlow version incompatibility.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous large-scale machine learning projects has highlighted this as a frequent point of failure, often masked by seemingly unrelated errors.  The core issue is rooted in the significant API changes introduced in TensorFlow 2.x, specifically the shift away from the `tf.summary` module's direct use for image summarization within eager execution environments.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow's summarization capabilities evolved considerably between version 1.x and 2.x. In TensorFlow 1.x, `tf.summary.image` was readily available and directly used for logging images during training.  However, TensorFlow 2.x adopted a more streamlined approach emphasizing eager execution, and the functionality of `tf.summary.image` was implicitly integrated into the `tf.summary` API, but its direct invocation is no longer the standard practice.  This doesn't mean the functionality is gone; rather, the method of accessing it has changed.  The error arises when code written for TensorFlow 1.x, or code incorrectly adapting 1.x methods to 2.x, tries to directly call the obsolete `tf.summary.image` function.

The correct approach in TensorFlow 2.x involves using the `tf.summary.image` function *within a TensorFlow summary writer context*. This context is established using the `tf.summary.create_file_writer` function, which creates a log directory to store the generated summaries, including images.  Failure to properly set up this writer context leads to the aforementioned `AttributeError`. Additionally, ensuring the correct TensorFlow version is installed and dependencies are managed is crucial; using a TensorFlow 1.x style import with TensorFlow 2.x will inevitably lead to errors.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect TensorFlow 1.x Style Approach (will raise AttributeError):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Incorrect approach for TF 2.x
image = tf.zeros([1, 28, 28, 1])  # Example image
tf.summary.image('my_image', image) # AttributeError will be raised here.
```

This example demonstrates the typical source of the error.  It attempts to directly use `tf.summary.image` outside the proper context required by TensorFlow 2.x. The code is fundamentally incompatible with the newer structure.

**Example 2: Correct Approach using tf.summary.create_file_writer:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Correct approach for TF 2.x
logdir = "logs/image_logs"
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(logdir)

image = tf.zeros([1, 28, 28, 1])  # Example image

with writer.as_default():
  tf.summary.image("my_image", image, step=0)

writer.close()
```

This code showcases the correct method.  We first create a `tf.summary.create_file_writer` to specify the log directory. Then, using a `with` statement to manage the context, we call `tf.summary.image` within the writer's scope.  The `step` argument is crucial; it indicates the training step at which the image is logged. This allows for clear visualization of image changes over training iterations.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Images within a Batch:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

logdir = "logs/image_logs"
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(logdir)
images = tf.random.normal((32, 28, 28, 1)) #batch of 32 images

with writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.image("images_batch", images, step=0, max_outputs=3) #max_outputs limits images in summary

writer.close()
```
This example expands on the previous one by demonstrating how to handle batches of images. The `max_outputs` parameter is essential for limiting the number of images visualized in TensorBoard, as displaying all images in a large batch can be impractical.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

TensorFlow's official documentation on summaries and visualization.  The documentation for `tf.summary.create_file_writer` and `tf.summary.image` should be consulted carefully.  Understanding the TensorFlow 2.x API changes and best practices for logging and visualization is vital.  A strong grasp of the `tf.summary` module is crucial for effective debugging and implementing proper logging strategies in your machine learning projects.  Furthermore, reviewing examples and tutorials focusing on TensorFlow 2.x summarization will provide practical insight and assist in avoiding common pitfalls.  Pay close attention to the context management using `with` statements and ensuring that `tf.summary.image` is used within the scope of a summary writer. Examining sample TensorBoard configurations will aid in understanding the process of visualizing logged summaries.
