Function arrays, particularly when dealing with closures or dynamically generated functions, can exhibit unexpected behavior regarding the preservation of initial values.  This stems primarily from the interplay between variable scoping, closures, and the timing of function execution.  My experience debugging complex JavaScript applications frequently highlighted this issue, particularly within asynchronous contexts.  The core problem lies not in a fundamental flaw in the function array concept, but rather in a misunderstanding of how JavaScript handles scope and variable lifecycles.

**1.  Explanation: Scoping and Closures**

The seemingly erratic behavior arises from the nature of closures in JavaScript.  When a function is created within another function (a nested function), it inherits the surrounding function's scopeâ€”even after the outer function has finished execution. This inherited scope includes variables declared in the outer function, even if those variables have changed in value by the time the inner function is subsequently called.  The key is that the inner function doesn't receive a *copy* of the variable's value at the time of its creation; it retains a *reference* to the variable itself. This reference points to the original variable in the outer function's scope, which means any modifications to that variable after the inner function's creation will be reflected when the inner function is finally executed.

Consider the case where we create an array of functions, each intended to return a different value from a counter.  If we don't properly manage the counter's scope and lifetime, all the functions in the array will eventually return the same final value of the counter.  This isn't a loss of initial values in the traditional sense of data corruption, but rather a consequence of referencing a single, mutable variable from multiple functions.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate this behavior and offer solutions for its mitigation.

**Example 1: The Problem**

```javascript
function createFunctionArray(count) {
  const functions = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    functions.push(() => i); // Closure on 'i'
  }
  return functions;
}

const myFunctions = createFunctionArray(5);
console.log(myFunctions.map(func => func())); // Output: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
```

In this example, all functions in `myFunctions` return 5, not 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 as one might expect. This happens because the `i` variable is shared across all function closures. By the time each function in the array gets executed, the loop has already completed and `i` holds its final value of 5.

**Example 2: Solution using IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**

```javascript
function createFunctionArrayIIFE(count) {
  const functions = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    functions.push((() => { // IIFE creates a new scope
      const j = i; // j holds the value at closure time
      return () => j;
    })());
  }
  return functions;
}

const myFunctionsIIFE = createFunctionArrayIIFE(5);
console.log(myFunctionsIIFE.map(func => func())); // Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Here, we leverage an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to create a new scope for each iteration.  The `j` variable inside the IIFE captures the value of `i` at that specific iteration.  This effectively creates a private copy of the counter's value for each function, preventing the shared reference problem.

**Example 3: Solution using `let` within `forEach`**

```javascript
function createFunctionArrayLet(count) {
  const functions = [];
  [...Array(count).keys()].forEach(i => { //using forEach and spread syntax for clarity
    functions.push(() => i); // Closure on 'i' within forEach scope.
  });
  return functions;
}

const myFunctionsLet = createFunctionArrayLet(5);
console.log(myFunctionsLet.map(func => func())); // Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

This example demonstrates a more concise approach leveraging the block scope inherent in `let` within the `forEach` loop. Each iteration creates a new scope for `i`, solving the shared reference issue without the explicit creation of IIFEs. This method also avoids the potential inefficiencies that could arise from using a traditional `for` loop in very large arrays where function creation may take considerable time.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding of JavaScript closures, scope, and variable lifetime, I recommend studying materials that cover these core concepts in depth.  Look for resources focusing on the detailed specifications of JavaScript's execution model and how these mechanisms interact to affect variable accessibility and mutability.  Focus on texts detailing the precise behavior of variables within different scope types (global, function, block) and how closures impact that behavior.  Understanding asynchronous programming paradigms will further solidify the comprehension of these concepts, especially when observing how these effects manifest in event-driven systems or those leveraging promises.  Detailed documentation on lexical scoping and hoisting in JavaScript should also be consulted.
