The inherent challenge in computing the dot product of a constant vector and a variable-sized batch in TensorFlow stems from the need for efficient broadcasting and handling of dynamically shaped tensors.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural network training pipelines has highlighted the importance of leveraging TensorFlow's broadcasting capabilities and avoiding explicit looping where possible for performance reasons.  Inefficient implementations can significantly impact training time, especially when dealing with large batches.

**1. Clear Explanation**

The core operation involves multiplying a constant vector (let's call it `constant_vector` of shape (N,)) with each vector in a batch (let's call it `batch_tensor` of shape (M, N)), where M is the variable batch size and N is the dimensionality of the vectors. The desired output is a tensor of shape (M,) containing the dot product for each vector in the batch.  Directly applying the standard `tf.tensordot` or `tf.matmul` operations without careful consideration of broadcasting can lead to inefficient or incorrect results.

Efficient calculation hinges on exploiting TensorFlow's implicit broadcasting rules.  By ensuring the constant vector is appropriately reshaped and the multiplication is performed using the correct operation, we can avoid explicit looping and achieve optimal performance.  The key is to leverage the fact that TensorFlow automatically broadcasts a smaller tensor against a larger one when the dimensions are compatible.  Incorrect broadcasting leads to errors and performance penalties, especially when dealing with GPUs.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1: Using `tf.einsum` for Explicit Control**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def dot_product_einsum(constant_vector, batch_tensor):
  """Computes the dot product using tf.einsum for explicit control.

  Args:
    constant_vector: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (N,).
    batch_tensor: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (M, N).

  Returns:
    A TensorFlow tensor of shape (M,) containing the dot products.
  """
  return tf.einsum('i,ji->j', constant_vector, batch_tensor)

# Example usage:
constant_vector = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
batch_tensor = tf.random.normal((5, 3)) # Variable batch size of 5

result = dot_product_einsum(constant_vector, batch_tensor)
print(result)
```

This example utilizes `tf.einsum`, offering fine-grained control over the tensor contraction.  The Einstein summation convention `'i,ji->j'` explicitly specifies the summation over the 'i' index, resulting in the desired (M,) output.  This method is highly efficient and readable, clearly indicating the operation being performed.  In my experience, `tf.einsum` often provides better performance for this specific task than `tf.tensordot` or `tf.matmul` due to its optimized implementation.

**Example 2: Leveraging Broadcasting with `tf.reduce_sum`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def dot_product_broadcasting(constant_vector, batch_tensor):
  """Computes the dot product using broadcasting and tf.reduce_sum.

  Args:
    constant_vector: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (N,).
    batch_tensor: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (M, N).

  Returns:
    A TensorFlow tensor of shape (M,) containing the dot products.
  """
  return tf.reduce_sum(constant_vector * batch_tensor, axis=1)

# Example usage:
constant_vector = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
batch_tensor = tf.random.normal((5, 3))

result = dot_product_broadcasting(constant_vector, batch_tensor)
print(result)

```

This method demonstrates the power of implicit broadcasting.  The element-wise multiplication (`*`) between the (N,) shaped `constant_vector` and the (M, N) shaped `batch_tensor` leverages broadcasting, effectively replicating the constant vector along the first dimension.  `tf.reduce_sum` then sums the resulting (M, N) tensor along `axis=1`, yielding the desired (M,) output. This approach is concise and highly efficient, capitalizing on TensorFlow's optimized broadcasting capabilities.

**Example 3:  Reshaping and `tf.matmul` (Less Efficient)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def dot_product_matmul(constant_vector, batch_tensor):
  """Computes the dot product using tf.matmul (less efficient).

  Args:
    constant_vector: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (N,).
    batch_tensor: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (M, N).

  Returns:
    A TensorFlow tensor of shape (M,) containing the dot products.
  """
  constant_vector = tf.reshape(constant_vector, (1, -1))
  return tf.matmul(constant_vector, batch_tensor, transpose_b=True)

# Example usage:
constant_vector = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
batch_tensor = tf.random.normal((5, 3))

result = dot_product_matmul(constant_vector, batch_tensor)
print(result)

```

While functional, this approach using `tf.matmul` is generally less efficient than the previous two.  Reshaping the constant vector to (1, N) is necessary to make the matrix multiplication compatible.  The `transpose_b=True` argument ensures the correct dot product is computed.  This method involves an extra reshaping operation, adding unnecessary overhead compared to the broadcasting or `tf.einsum` approaches.  In my experience, this method should be avoided unless there's a specific reason to utilize `tf.matmul` within a larger computation graph where this reshaping operation might be absorbed into other operations.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a comprehensive understanding of tensor manipulation in TensorFlow, I highly recommend the official TensorFlow documentation.  Furthermore,  "Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet provides excellent context on the practical application of these techniques within a broader deep learning framework. Lastly, a thorough understanding of linear algebra principles is crucial for effectively working with tensor operations.  Mastering the concepts of matrix multiplication, broadcasting, and vectorization is paramount for writing efficient TensorFlow code.
