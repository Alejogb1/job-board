TensorFlow's graph structure, while powerful, necessitates precise control over data flow.  Severing connections between nodes isn't a direct operation like deleting a node; rather, it involves strategically manipulating the graph's definition to effectively disconnect the data pathways.  My experience working on large-scale NLP models taught me the crucial role of this fine-grained control, particularly during experimentation and model pruning.  In essence, you don't "sever" connections, but rather redefine the graph to exclude them. This can be achieved through several methods depending on your specific needs and the nature of your TensorFlow implementation (eager or graph mode).


**1.  Modifying the Graph Definition (Graph Mode):**

In TensorFlow's graph mode, the computation graph is defined before execution.  This allows for explicit manipulation of the graph's structure. The most straightforward approach involves redefining the graph, omitting the connections to be severed. This usually means rewriting the part of your code responsible for constructing the graph.  This is computationally expensive for large graphs but offers precise control.


**Code Example 1: Graph Mode Modification**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Original Graph
a = tf.constant(10, name="a")
b = tf.constant(5, name="b")
c = tf.add(a,b, name="c")  #Connection to sever: c depends on a and b

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(c)) #Output: 15


#Modified Graph - Connection severed
a_mod = tf.constant(10, name="a_mod")
b_mod = tf.constant(5, name="b_mod")
c_mod = tf.add(b_mod,b_mod, name="c_mod") #a_mod is now irrelevant to c_mod


with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    print(sess.run(c_mod)) #Output: 10 (a is effectively disconnected)
```

Here, we essentially create a new addition operation (`c_mod`) that doesn't depend on `a_mod`.  While `a_mod` exists in the graph, it's disconnected from the relevant computation path. This approach is effective for relatively static graphs but becomes cumbersome for dynamic graphs.


**2.  Using `tf.stop_gradient` (Eager and Graph Mode):**

For gradient-based operations, `tf.stop_gradient` is invaluable.  This function prevents the gradient from flowing back through a specific tensor, effectively breaking the connection for backpropagation.  This is particularly useful during training, allowing you to selectively exclude parts of the network from the optimization process. It's important to note that this doesn't remove the connection from the forward pass; only the backward pass is affected.


**Code Example 2:  `tf.stop_gradient`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.Variable(10.0)
b = tf.Variable(5.0)
c = a + b
d = tf.stop_gradient(c) * 2 # Gradient won't flow back through c

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  loss = d**2

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [a,b])

print(gradients) # Output: [None, None] or similar indicating zero gradient w.r.t. a and b
```


The gradient with respect to `a` and `b` is effectively zero because the gradient flow is stopped at `d`.  `c` still computes the sum, but its influence on the loss function's gradients is eliminated. This is useful for techniques like feature extraction where you only need the forward pass outputs of a certain layer without affecting the training of preceding layers.


**3.  Conditional Execution and Placeholder Usage (Eager and Graph Mode):**

This method uses conditional statements and placeholders to dynamically control the flow.  Essentially, you can use a placeholder to represent a connection and conditionally include or exclude it based on a boolean variable.  This offers great flexibility for dynamic graph structures.


**Code Example 3: Conditional Execution**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

sever_connection = tf.constant(True) # Control variable

a = tf.constant(10)
b = tf.constant(5)

c = tf.cond(sever_connection, lambda: b, lambda: a + b) #Conditional inclusion

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess: #for TF1
    print(sess.run(c)) # Output: 5 if sever_connection is True, 15 otherwise

#or using tf.function for TF2 and above for graph-like behavior
@tf.function
def my_op(sever_connection,a,b):
    c = tf.cond(sever_connection, lambda: b, lambda: a + b)
    return c

result = my_op(tf.constant(True),a,b)
print(result) #Same as above

```

In this example, the connection between `a` and the final result is severed when `sever_connection` is `True`.  This provides dynamic control over the graph structure during runtime.


**Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest reviewing the official TensorFlow documentation focusing on graph construction, gradient tape, and conditional operations.  Further exploration of TensorFlow's control flow operations and  more advanced topics like model pruning and knowledge distillation will enhance your understanding of managing complex graph structures.  Familiarity with graph visualization tools can significantly aid in understanding and debugging your graph modifications.  Consulting research papers on neural network pruning techniques will provide additional context for strategically disconnecting nodes within a model.


In conclusion, "severing" connections in TensorFlow involves skillful manipulation of the graph's structure or gradient flow.  Choosing the appropriate method depends heavily on whether you are operating in eager or graph mode, the nature of your model, and the goal of the disconnection (e.g., model pruning, gradient control, or experimental analysis).  The examples provided illustrate practical techniques, but careful planning and understanding of your specific model architecture are crucial for successful implementation.
