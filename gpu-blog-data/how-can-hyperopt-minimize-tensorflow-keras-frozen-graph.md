Hyperopt itself doesn't directly minimize the size of a TensorFlow Keras frozen graph (.pb file).  Hyperopt is a library for hyperparameter optimization; its role is to find the optimal configuration of your model's parameters, leading to improved performance metrics, not directly impacting file size.  The size of a frozen graph is determined by the model's architecture and the weights' precision.  Therefore, reducing the .pb file size requires focusing on model optimization techniques independent of Hyperopt's functionality.  In my experience optimizing large-scale convolutional neural networks for deployment on resource-constrained devices, I've found several effective strategies.

**1. Quantization:**  This is the most impactful technique for reducing model size and improving inference speed.  Quantization reduces the precision of the model's weights and activations.  Instead of using 32-bit floating-point numbers (float32), we can use 8-bit integers (int8) or even binary (1-bit). This significantly reduces the file size, often by a factor of four or more when moving from float32 to int8.  The trade-off is a slight decrease in accuracy, but this is often acceptable, particularly when the performance gain from faster inference outweighs it.  Post-training quantization is generally preferred as it does not require retraining.

**Example 1: Post-Training Quantization with TensorFlow Lite**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the frozen graph
loaded_graph = tf.compat.v1.GraphDef()
with tf.io.gfile.GFile("model.pb", "rb") as f:
    loaded_graph.ParseFromString(f.read())

# Convert to TensorFlow Lite model with quantization
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_frozen_graph(
    loaded_graph, input_arrays=["input_tensor"], output_arrays=["output_tensor"]
)
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT] # Enable optimizations, including quantization
tflite_model = converter.convert()

# Save the quantized model
with open("model_quantized.tflite", "wb") as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)
```

This code snippet demonstrates the conversion of a frozen graph to a TensorFlow Lite model using default optimizations, including quantization.  Remember to replace `"input_tensor"` and `"output_tensor"` with the actual names of your input and output tensors.  The resulting `model_quantized.tflite` will be significantly smaller than the original `model.pb`. Note that TensorFlow Lite models are generally smaller than their frozen graph counterparts even without explicit quantization.

**2. Pruning:** This technique involves removing less important connections (weights) in the neural network.  Weights with small magnitudes are considered less influential and are therefore pruned. This reduces the number of parameters in the model, leading to a smaller file size.  Pruning can be done during training (structured or unstructured pruning) or post-training.

**Example 2: Pruning with TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit (TensorFlow Model Optimization)**

```python
import tensorflow_model_optimization as tfmot

# Load the model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("my_model.h5") # Assume you have a Keras model to start with

# Apply pruning (example using sparsity)
prune_low_magnitude = tfmot.sparsity.keras.prune_low_magnitude
pruned_model = prune_low_magnitude(model, pruning_schedule=tfmot.sparsity.keras.PolynomialDecay(initial_sparsity=0.50, final_sparsity=0.80, begin_step=0, end_step=1000))

# Compile and train the pruned model
pruned_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
pruned_model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Strip pruning wrappers (important step to get a smaller model)
pruned_model = tfmot.sparsity.keras.strip_pruning(pruned_model)

# Save the pruned model
pruned_model.save("pruned_model.h5")
# Convert to .pb if needed (using tf.saved_model.save)

```

This example utilizes the TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit to apply sparsity pruning. A pruning schedule dictates the gradual increase in sparsity.  After training, the `strip_pruning` function removes the pruning wrappers, resulting in a smaller model. Remember to save the model in a format that can be converted to .pb subsequently if required.


**3. Model Architecture Optimization:** Choosing a more efficient model architecture inherently reduces the model's size. This involves selecting architectures with fewer layers, fewer parameters per layer, or using efficient building blocks like depthwise separable convolutions (common in MobileNet architectures).

**Example 3: Using EfficientNet or MobileNet architectures**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define EfficientNet model
efficientnet_model = tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB0(weights=None, include_top=True, input_shape=(224,224,3), classes=10) # Adjust input shape and classes as needed

# Compile and train the model
efficientnet_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
efficientnet_model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)

#Save model (needs to be converted to .pb afterwards)
efficientnet_model.save('efficientnet_model.h5')

```

This example demonstrates using the EfficientNetB0 architecture, known for its efficiency.  Other efficient architectures like MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, and others offer similar advantages in terms of size and speed. Note that you would have to convert this saved model into a .pb file using TensorFlow's saving functions.


Remember that after applying any of these optimizations, you should always evaluate the impact on the model's accuracy.  A small size is only beneficial if the performance remains acceptable for the application.  The choice of technique and the extent to which it's applied will be determined by the acceptable trade-off between model size and accuracy.

**Resource Recommendations:**

* TensorFlow documentation on model optimization.
* TensorFlow Lite documentation on quantization.
* TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit documentation.
* Research papers on model compression techniques (e.g., pruning, quantization).  Focus on papers discussing practical implementations and benchmarks.


These approaches, used individually or in combination, provide effective ways to minimize the size of a TensorFlow Keras frozen graph without using Hyperopt. Remember that Hyperopt's role is separate and focuses solely on hyperparameter tuning for performance improvements, not directly on file size reduction.
