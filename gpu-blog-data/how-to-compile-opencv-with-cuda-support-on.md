The successful compilation of OpenCV with CUDA support on Linux hinges critically on the precise alignment of CUDA toolkit version, cuDNN library version (if using deep learning functionalities), and the OpenCV source code version.  Inconsistencies in these versions frequently lead to compilation failures, often manifesting as cryptic linker errors.  My experience troubleshooting this for a large-scale computer vision project highlighted the importance of meticulous version management.

**1. Explanation:**

The process involves several key steps: obtaining the necessary prerequisites, configuring the OpenCV build system (CMake), and executing the build process itself.  The CUDA toolkit provides the necessary libraries and headers for leveraging NVIDIA GPUs.  This toolkit includes the `nvcc` compiler, essential for compiling CUDA kernels â€“ the code that runs on the GPU.  If employing deep learning operations within OpenCV, the cuDNN library, which provides highly optimized routines for deep neural networks, must also be installed.  The interplay between these components needs careful attention.

Firstly, ensure you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU driver installed.  The driver version needs to align with the CUDA toolkit version.  You'll then need to install the CUDA toolkit itself, choosing the appropriate version based on your GPU architecture and operating system.  Next, install the cuDNN library (optional, but recommended for deep learning functionalities) and ensure its location is accessible during the OpenCV compilation process.  Finally, download the OpenCV source code.  It's strongly recommended to obtain the source code directly from the official OpenCV repository to minimize compatibility issues with pre-built packages.

The core of the process involves using CMake, a cross-platform build system generator.  CMake reads a configuration file (CMakeLists.txt) and generates Makefiles (or other build system files) tailored to your specific environment.  Within the configuration step, you specify the paths to the CUDA toolkit, cuDNN library (if applicable), and other necessary dependencies.  CMake then creates a build directory containing the generated Makefiles. Finally, you use the appropriate build command (typically `make`) to compile OpenCV.  The resulting library will contain the CUDA-accelerated functions.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic CMake Configuration (without cuDNN):**

```cmake
cmake -D CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda \
      -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -D WITH_CUDA=ON \
      -D WITH_CUBLAS=ON \
      -D OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON \
      ../opencv
```

* `/usr/local/cuda`:  Replace this with the actual path to your CUDA toolkit installation.  This path should point to the root directory of your CUDA installation.
* `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`:  Specifies a release build for optimized performance.  Debug builds are generally slower but offer more debugging information.
* `WITH_CUDA=ON`: Enables CUDA support in OpenCV.
* `WITH_CUBLAS=ON`: Enables cuBLAS support (linear algebra library).
* `OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON`: Enables non-free algorithms, potentially including patented algorithms.  This might be necessary depending on which OpenCV modules you need.

This configuration will build OpenCV with CUDA support, assuming the CUDA toolkit is correctly installed.


**Example 2: CMake Configuration with cuDNN:**

```cmake
cmake -D CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/cuda \
      -D CUDNN_ROOT=/usr/local/cudnn \
      -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -D WITH_CUDA=ON \
      -D WITH_CUBLAS=ON \
      -D WITH_CUDNN=ON \
      -D OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON \
      ../opencv
```

* `/usr/local/cudnn`: Replace this with the actual path to your cuDNN installation.
* `WITH_CUDNN=ON`:  Enables cuDNN support for deep learning operations.  Note that the required cuDNN headers and libraries must be correctly installed and accessible via the specified path.


**Example 3: Makefile Execution and Testing:**

```bash
cd build
make -j$(nproc) # Use all available cores for faster compilation.
make install # Installs the compiled OpenCV library.
```

This section assumes that CMake has already generated the Makefiles in the `build` directory.  The `-j$(nproc)` option utilizes all available CPU cores to speed up the compilation process.  The `make install` command installs the compiled libraries and headers to the system, making them available to other applications.  After the build, it's crucial to test the functionality by running sample code to confirm that OpenCV is correctly utilizing your CUDA-enabled GPU. A simple test involves creating a small program that utilizes a CUDA-accelerated OpenCV function and verifying GPU utilization using monitoring tools like `nvidia-smi`.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official OpenCV documentation: This provides comprehensive instructions on building OpenCV from source, including the specifics on CUDA support and configuration options.
* The official NVIDIA CUDA documentation: It details CUDA toolkit installation, setup, and programming.
*  A good book on computer vision:  Understanding the underlying algorithms will significantly aid in diagnosing compilation errors or performance bottlenecks.  A thorough grasp of CUDA programming principles will also prove invaluable.



Remember to always meticulously check your system's environment variables and paths for potential issues.  Inconsistencies in these settings are a common cause of compilation failures.  Thorough understanding of your system setup and the dependencies involved is crucial for a smooth compilation process.  Consult the aforementioned resources for detailed, up-to-date instructions which may vary slightly depending on the specific version of CUDA, OpenCV, and the underlying Linux distribution.  My years spent working on large-scale computer vision projects emphasized that attention to detail in this area cannot be overstated.
