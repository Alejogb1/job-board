TensorFlow's flexibility in handling probabilistic sampling directly from tensor representations is a powerful feature often overlooked in introductory materials.  My experience building Bayesian neural networks and variational autoencoders highlighted the importance of efficient and numerically stable sampling methods when dealing with high-dimensional probability distributions represented as tensors.  The core principle lies in leveraging TensorFlow's built-in functions for random number generation and their seamless integration with tensor operations.  This allows for the creation of highly optimized sampling procedures, crucial for large-scale applications.

The fundamental approach involves using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) implicitly defined by the probability tensor.  We assume the probability tensor, which we'll call `probabilities`, represents a discrete probability distribution across its dimensions. Each element `probabilities[i]` represents the probability of selecting the `i`-th element from a corresponding tensor of the same shape, which we'll call `samples`.  To avoid ambiguity, we explicitly assume `probabilities` is a normalized probability distribution; that is, the sum across all elements of `probabilities` is equal to 1. If it is not normalized, it must be normalized prior to sampling. This normalization can be easily achieved using TensorFlow's `tf.math.softmax` or by explicitly dividing by the sum.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The sampling process can be broken down into the following steps:

a) **CDF Calculation (Implicit):**  We don't explicitly calculate the cumulative distribution function.  Instead, we rely on TensorFlow's `tf.random.categorical` function. This function directly samples from a categorical distribution defined by the probabilities in `probabilities`. It internally utilizes an efficient algorithm that avoids the explicit computation of the CDF, which is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional tensors.

b) **Index Generation:** `tf.random.categorical` returns a tensor of indices. Each index corresponds to the sampled element in the `samples` tensor.  The shape of the index tensor matches the shape of `probabilities`.  This means that if we are sampling multiple times (e.g., generating multiple samples from a single probability distribution), the index tensor will have an extra dimension representing the number of samples.

c) **Index-Based Selection:** Finally, we use the generated indices to select the corresponding elements from the `samples` tensor using `tf.gather_nd` or `tf.gather`.  This efficiently selects the sampled elements based on the indices generated in the previous step.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple 1D Sampling**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

probabilities = tf.constant([0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4]) # Must sum to 1
samples = tf.constant([10, 20, 30, 40])

# Generate indices based on probabilities
indices = tf.random.categorical(tf.math.log(probabilities), num_samples=1)  #Log probabilities for numerical stability

# Gather samples using indices. Note the squeeze operation to remove the extra dimension
sampled_values = tf.squeeze(tf.gather(samples, indices), axis=1)

print(f"Probabilities: {probabilities}")
print(f"Samples: {samples}")
print(f"Sampled Indices: {indices}")
print(f"Sampled Values: {sampled_values}")
```

This example demonstrates basic sampling from a 1D probability distribution. The use of `tf.math.log` enhances numerical stability, especially when dealing with very small probabilities.  The `tf.squeeze` operation is necessary because `tf.gather` returns a tensor with an additional dimension due to the `num_samples` parameter in `tf.random.categorical`.

**Example 2:  2D Sampling with Multiple Samples**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

probabilities = tf.constant([[0.2, 0.8], [0.6, 0.4]])
samples = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

indices = tf.random.categorical(tf.math.log(probabilities), num_samples=5)

#Gather samples, note shape of indices and axis specified in gather_nd
sampled_values = tf.gather_nd(samples, indices)

print(f"Probabilities: {probabilities}")
print(f"Samples: {samples}")
print(f"Sampled Indices: {indices}")
print(f"Sampled Values: {sampled_values}")
```

Here, we extend the process to a 2D probability distribution and generate multiple samples.  `tf.gather_nd` is employed for efficient multi-dimensional indexing.  The shape of the `indices` tensor reflects both the original shape of `probabilities` and the number of samples requested.

**Example 3: Handling Non-Normalized Probabilities**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

unnormalized_probabilities = tf.constant([2, 6, 2, 4])
samples = tf.constant([100, 200, 300, 400])

#Normalize probabilities.
normalized_probabilities = tf.math.softmax(unnormalized_probabilities)


indices = tf.random.categorical(tf.math.log(normalized_probabilities), num_samples=1)
sampled_values = tf.squeeze(tf.gather(samples, indices), axis=1)

print(f"Unnormalized Probabilities: {unnormalized_probabilities}")
print(f"Normalized Probabilities: {normalized_probabilities}")
print(f"Samples: {samples}")
print(f"Sampled Indices: {indices}")
print(f"Sampled Values: {sampled_values}")

```

This example explicitly shows how to handle probabilities that are not already normalized. `tf.math.softmax` is used to convert the unnormalized probabilities into a valid probability distribution.  Remember that `tf.math.log` is used for numerical stability.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is essential.  Furthermore,  a thorough understanding of probability and statistics, including categorical distributions and cumulative distribution functions, is crucial.   A solid grounding in linear algebra and tensor manipulation will also prove invaluable for advanced applications. Finally, exploring resources on Bayesian methods and variational inference will deepen your understanding of the practical applications of this sampling technique.
