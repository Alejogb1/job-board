The apparent retention of a gradient on a tensor with `requires_grad=False` in PyTorch stems from a misunderstanding of how gradients accumulate within the computational graph. The `requires_grad` flag controls whether gradients are *computed* for a tensor, not whether existing gradients are discarded or overwritten. Specifically, if a tensor initially has `requires_grad=False` but participates in operations where other input tensors do have `requires_grad=True`, that tensor's *value* may contribute to the gradient calculation of those tensors, and *those* gradients can propagate *backwards* even if our initial tensor does not itself track gradient information. This is crucial in understanding backpropagation and optimization within deep learning frameworks.

The key concept to grasp is the difference between gradient *computation* and gradient *accumulation*. Setting `requires_grad=False` tells PyTorch to omit the creation of the computational graph history needed for backpropagation *for that specific tensor*. However, it does not actively erase gradients that may have accumulated on that tensor during operations where it serves as an input to a tensor with `requires_grad=True`. The gradient storage exists as a member attribute of the Tensor object. Thus, even if the computational graph doesn't actively calculate it during `backward()`, the attribute is still accessible and can retain values that may have been assigned outside of the graph.

Consider a scenario I encountered while building a variational autoencoder. I was initially using a pre-trained encoder and wanted to avoid backpropagating gradients through it. I set `requires_grad=False` on the encoder's output tensor, expecting it to not influence gradient calculations at all during the decoder's training phase. However, I kept seeing non-zero gradients on the encoder's output, which confused me until I realized the distinction between gradient computation and accumulation.

Let's illustrate this with code:

```python
import torch

# Create a tensor with requires_grad=False
a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=False)
print("a.requires_grad:", a.requires_grad)  # Output: False
print("a.grad:", a.grad)  # Output: None

# Create another tensor with requires_grad=True
b = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)

# Perform an operation involving both tensors
c = a * b
print("c.requires_grad:", c.requires_grad) # Output: True

# Calculate the mean and call backward
loss = c.mean()
loss.backward()

print("a.grad:", a.grad) # Output: None
print("b.grad:", b.grad) # Output: tensor([0.5000, 1.0000])

```
In this first example, the tensor `a` has `requires_grad=False`, and initially its `grad` is `None`. While it participates in the multiplication that produces `c`, which has `requires_grad=True`, its own gradient remains `None` after `loss.backward()`. PyTorch did not compute gradients for `a`. However, if we change the code a bit, the retention of an externally assigned gradient is more clear.
```python
import torch

# Create a tensor with requires_grad=False
a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=False)

# Directly assign a value to a.grad
a.grad = torch.tensor([5.0, 6.0])
print("a.requires_grad:", a.requires_grad) # Output: False
print("a.grad:", a.grad) # Output: tensor([5., 6.])

# Create another tensor with requires_grad=True
b = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)

# Perform an operation involving both tensors
c = a * b

# Calculate the mean and call backward
loss = c.mean()
loss.backward()

print("a.grad:", a.grad) # Output: tensor([5., 6.])
print("b.grad:", b.grad) # Output: tensor([0.5000, 1.0000])
```

Here, I manually assigned a gradient to `a.grad` *before* the backpropagation. Despite `a` having `requires_grad=False`, its existing gradient remains, illustrating that the flag only impacts the graph's calculations. The value is not erased, but is also not updated by `backward()`. The `backward()` call still computes the appropriate gradients for tensor `b`. This further emphasizes that the `requires_grad` flag is controlling whether PyTorch *computes* gradients during backpropagation, and not the presence of an attribute that can retain externally assigned gradients.

Finally, consider a third example, where we assign a gradient after performing operations.

```python
import torch

# Create a tensor with requires_grad=False
a = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0], requires_grad=False)

# Create another tensor with requires_grad=True
b = torch.tensor([3.0, 4.0], requires_grad=True)

# Perform an operation involving both tensors
c = a * b

# Calculate the mean and call backward
loss = c.mean()
loss.backward()

# Attempt to assign to the gradient on a after backward propagation
try:
    a.grad = torch.tensor([5.0, 6.0])
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(e)  # Error message about modifying inplace after backward

print("a.grad:", a.grad) # Output: None
print("b.grad:", b.grad) # Output: tensor([0.5000, 1.0000])

```

In this scenario, I tried to assign a gradient to `a` *after* the `backward()` pass. It throws a runtime error, this is because once a backward pass has been performed, the gradient tensors are generally considered part of the computational graph, and modification is restricted by default. The gradient of tensor `a` remains `None` and the error confirms the nature of how the computational graph is built during the forward and back propagation phases. While one *can* access the attribute, it is generally not expected to be modified directly after `backward()`.

The key takeaway is: `requires_grad=False` does not mean gradients are automatically cleared or that the tensor's `.grad` attribute cannot retain values. It primarily controls whether gradients are computed during the `backward()` phase within the computational graph. Any gradients assigned manually to a tensor will persist, even if the tensorâ€™s `requires_grad` attribute is false and even if it has been used in forward passes, *until they are explicitly removed*. It only avoids the automatic calculation and update of those gradients as the backward pass executes through the established computational graph.

This understanding has been pivotal in my work, especially when dealing with complex architectures involving frozen pre-trained components or custom gradient manipulations. I had to learn to differentiate between what the flag prevents and what it does not, particularly regarding existing gradient values.

For further exploration of this topic, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation for a detailed overview of automatic differentiation, the mechanics of `requires_grad`, and the functionality of the backward pass. Deep learning textbooks often contain sections covering the theory and practice of backpropagation, which directly links to this concept. In addition, a thorough understanding of the Tensor class in PyTorch, including its member attributes such as `.grad` and how these interact with the computational graph is crucial. Studying code examples from repositories implementing popular deep learning models can also provide practical insight into the proper usage of `requires_grad`.
