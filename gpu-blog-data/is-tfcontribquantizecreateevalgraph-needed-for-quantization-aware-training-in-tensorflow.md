The necessity of `tf.contrib.quantize.create_eval_graph()` during quantization-aware training in TensorFlow hinges entirely on the intended post-training workflow.  My experience optimizing large-scale image recognition models has shown that while this function provides crucial functionality, it's only strictly required when exporting a quantized graph for deployment on resource-constrained platforms.  If the model remains within the TensorFlow environment for inference, its usage becomes optional, depending on your performance goals.  Directly using the quantized weights and biases produced during training is sufficient for improved inference speed within the TensorFlow ecosystem without graph export.

**1. Explanation:**

`tf.contrib.quantize.create_eval_graph()` is a legacy function from a previous TensorFlow API (pre-2.x).  Its primary role is to generate a graph optimized for quantized inference. This process involves replacing floating-point operations with their quantized counterparts, resulting in smaller model sizes and reduced computational costs. This optimized graph is essential for deployment to platforms with limited memory or processing power, such as mobile devices or embedded systems.  The generation of this optimized graph is the key function of `create_eval_graph()`.  It alters the graph in place, transforming it into a form suitable for deployment on platforms optimized for lower-precision computations (INT8, for example).

However, during quantization-aware training (QAT), TensorFlow inherently applies quantization simulation during the training process itself.  This means that the model's weights and biases are represented using quantized values *during* training.  This simulates the behavior of an actually quantized model, allowing the model to adapt and learn within the constraints of the lower precision. The resulting weights and biases will therefore already reflect the quantization effects. Thus, running inference directly on the trained model, using its quantized weights and biases, will yield performance improvements relative to inference with a floating-point model, *without* requiring the generation of a separate, exported quantized graph.


The critical difference lies in the target environment.  If inference happens within the TensorFlow environment, you're already leveraging the optimized TensorFlow runtime, which is designed to handle the quantized representation of your model effectively.  Exporting, on the other hand, generates a graph compatible with TensorFlow Lite or other inference engines that require a specifically quantized representation.


**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples demonstrate different approaches to quantization-aware training in TensorFlow, emphasizing the optional nature of `create_eval_graph()` when no export is involved.  These examples are simplified for clarity, and would require adapting for specific models and datasets.  Error handling and optimization strategies beyond the scope of this explanation are omitted.

**Example 1: QAT without `create_eval_graph()` (Inference within TensorFlow)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Model definition, assuming a convolutional neural network) ...

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    # Initialize quantizer
    tf.compat.v1.train.Saver().restore(sess, './my_model') # Restore your quantized weights

    # ... (Training loop with simulated quantization) ...

    # Inference directly on the trained model (No create_eval_graph() needed)
    predictions = sess.run(logits, feed_dict={input_tensor: input_data})
    # ... (Post-processing) ...
```

This example shows a straightforward training and inference process using quantization-aware training.  The model's quantized weights are loaded, and inference is performed directly.  `create_eval_graph()` is not necessary because the inference takes place within the TensorFlow runtime, which handles the quantized representations.  This was my typical workflow for rapid prototyping and early-stage experimentation in similar contexts.

**Example 2: QAT with `create_eval_graph()` (For Export)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.contrib import quantize

# ... (Model definition) ...

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    # ... (Training loop with simulated quantization) ...

    # Create a quantized graph suitable for export
    quantize.create_eval_graph()

    # Save the quantized graph
    tf.compat.v1.saved_model.simple_save(sess, './my_quantized_model', inputs={'input': input_tensor}, outputs={'output': logits})
```

This illustrates the use of `create_eval_graph()`  before saving the model. The function optimizes the graph for inference in a target environment, after which we create a SavedModel. The resulting graph will then have its floating-point operations replaced by their quantized equivalents.  This optimized graph is then suitable for deployment using TensorFlow Lite or similar tools.  In my experience, I primarily used this pattern for finalizing a model for production deployments onto low-power devices.

**Example 3:  Explicitly handling quantization parameters (Inference within TensorFlow)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... (Model definition) ...

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    # Restore weights and bias from checkpoint
    saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver()
    saver.restore(sess, "./my_quantized_model")

    # Access quantized weights and biases directly.  This requires knowing the exact names in your model graph.
    quantized_weights = sess.run("my_layer/weights/quantized")
    quantized_biases = sess.run("my_layer/biases/quantized")

    # ... (Inference using quantized weights and biases) ...
```

In this case, I demonstrate manual access to already quantized tensors. This approach might be necessary if you have a complex model or require fine-grained control over the quantization process.  It allows direct interaction with the already quantized parameters generated during the quantization-aware training phase.  This was useful in debugging and profiling certain aspects of my models.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation (specifically sections on quantization and model optimization), research papers on quantization-aware training techniques, and relevant chapters in specialized machine learning textbooks.  Focusing on material pertaining to TensorFlow 1.x and 2.x API differences is particularly helpful in understanding the context of `tf.contrib.quantize` which was deprecated in later versions. Consulting published work on efficient inference on low-power devices will help to contextualize the benefits and implications of this type of optimization.


In summary, while `tf.contrib.quantize.create_eval_graph()` offers a crucial path for graph optimization when preparing a quantized model for export, it's not inherently required for improved inference performance during quantization-aware training if the inference process remains within the TensorFlow ecosystem.  The simulated quantization during training results in quantized weights that can directly improve inference speed.  Choosing the right approach depends heavily on the ultimate deployment goals.
