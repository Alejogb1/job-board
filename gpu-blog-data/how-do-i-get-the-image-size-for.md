Determining the input image size expected by a TensorFlow 2 model is crucial for preprocessing new data and ensuring successful inference. Mismatched input dimensions will lead to errors. Often this information isn’t explicitly documented, requiring us to inspect the model's architecture directly.

In my experience building custom image classification pipelines, I've frequently encountered situations where the pre-trained model documentation was either absent or unclear about expected image input sizes. This necessitates extracting this crucial detail programmatically. The process isn't always straightforward, particularly with complex models built using the Functional API or those that incorporate custom layers. However, TensorFlow provides a set of tools that, when used correctly, consistently yield the correct answer.

The core principle revolves around understanding the model's input layer. Every TensorFlow model, regardless of its complexity, has a starting point where input data is fed in. This input layer typically defines the shape, and consequently, the size of the expected input image. However, models can have multiple inputs (especially in cases like multi-modal learning), so careful examination is essential.

Accessing the input shape information can be accomplished through several mechanisms. For sequential models, it’s quite direct using the `.input_shape` attribute. This attribute gives the input shape tensor excluding batch dimension, which is usually assumed to be variable. For more complex models built with the Functional API, we need to inspect the inputs via the `.inputs` attribute and subsequently examine their shapes. Moreover, the first layer in the model can also be a good candidate for extraction of expected input size, particularly if it has an `input_shape` defined. Regardless of the approach, the critical element is extracting the shape defined for the image data itself, typically represented by three dimensions: height, width, and channel number.

Let's explore a few practical scenarios with code.

**Example 1: Sequential Model**

Consider a straightforward convolutional neural network built using the Sequential API:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3)),
  layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
  layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
  layers.Flatten(),
  layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

input_shape = model.input_shape
print(f"Input Shape: {input_shape}")

first_layer_input_shape = model.layers[0].input_shape
print(f"First Layer Input Shape: {first_layer_input_shape}")


# Accessing the image dimensions
image_height = input_shape[1]
image_width = input_shape[2]
image_channels = input_shape[3]

print(f"Image Height: {image_height}")
print(f"Image Width: {image_width}")
print(f"Image Channels: {image_channels}")
```

In this example, we construct a basic CNN. The `input_shape` is explicitly defined in the first `Conv2D` layer as `(128, 128, 3)`. The `model.input_shape` attribute will also provide access to this information. Additionally, the first layer's input shape is accessible via `.layers[0].input_shape`.  We extract the height, width, and channel information to confirm it corresponds to the defined input size. Note that index zero of `input_shape` is the batch dimension which is always ignored when determining the image size. This approach is convenient for models where the input shape is declared within the model’s first layer itself.

**Example 2: Functional API Model (Single Input)**

Now, let's examine a model constructed using the Functional API where inputs are explicitly defined:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3))
x = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(inputs)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Flatten()(x)
outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

input_tensor = model.inputs[0]
input_shape = input_tensor.shape
print(f"Input Tensor Shape: {input_shape}")


# Accessing the image dimensions
image_height = input_shape[1]
image_width = input_shape[2]
image_channels = input_shape[3]

print(f"Image Height: {image_height}")
print(f"Image Width: {image_width}")
print(f"Image Channels: {image_channels}")
```

In the Functional API approach, we define a tensor representing the input (`tf.keras.Input`). The `model.inputs` attribute provides a list of these input tensors. We select the first input tensor using `model.inputs[0]`. Its shape, accessed via `input_tensor.shape`, reveals the expected input image size, confirming that it aligns with the input we specified initially as `(224, 224, 3)`. Note that we access the first tensor as models with the Functional API can have multiple input tensors. As with the previous example, index zero represents the batch size and is not utilized.

**Example 3: Functional API Model (Multiple Inputs)**

For a model with multiple inputs (e.g., a model taking both an image and textual input), extra care must be taken to identify which input pertains to the image:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

image_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(64, 64, 3), name='image_input')
text_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(100,), name='text_input')

# Image processing branch
x = layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(image_input)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Flatten()(x)
image_branch = layers.Dense(16)(x)

# Text processing branch (simplified)
y = layers.Dense(16)(text_input)

# Combined branch
combined = layers.concatenate([image_branch, y])
outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(combined)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[image_input, text_input], outputs=outputs)

for input_tensor in model.inputs:
    if len(input_tensor.shape) == 4 and input_tensor.shape[-1] == 3:
         input_shape = input_tensor.shape
         print(f"Image Input Tensor Shape: {input_shape}")
         image_height = input_shape[1]
         image_width = input_shape[2]
         image_channels = input_shape[3]
         print(f"Image Height: {image_height}")
         print(f"Image Width: {image_width}")
         print(f"Image Channels: {image_channels}")
         break
```

In this more complex scenario, the model accepts two inputs, an image and a textual vector. Here, we iterate through `model.inputs`. To identify the image input, we look for a tensor with a rank (number of dimensions) of four (batch, height, width, channels) and a final dimension of three (indicating RGB images). Once found, its shape is extracted to determine the required image dimensions which are (64,64,3), which was predefined when the image input was specified. If the color channel was greyscale, we would expect the third dimension to be 1.

In summary, determining image input sizes requires understanding a TensorFlow model’s structure and accessing the relevant information through its properties such as `.input_shape` or via its `inputs`. For sequential models, the first layer frequently dictates this. With models built using the Functional API, you’ll need to examine the `inputs` attribute, potentially iterating over them to select the relevant image input based on shape and channel count. This ability to programmatically inspect model architecture avoids the need for manual documentation lookup and ensures proper data preprocessing, particularly when using models downloaded from repositories or pre-trained models.

For further study on TensorFlow model inspection and architecture understanding, the official TensorFlow documentation is invaluable. In particular, I suggest exploring the guides that relate to both the Sequential and Functional API model construction methods. Keras API documentation is also essential since Keras is the interface by which you interact with TensorFlow to build models. Additionally, exploring source code of popular pre-trained models, can help in understanding how they are constructed and how model input shapes are defined.
