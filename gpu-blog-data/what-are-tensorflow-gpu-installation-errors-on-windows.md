TensorFlow GPU installation on Windows 10 frequently fails due to mismatched dependencies, primarily concerning CUDA, cuDNN, and the Visual C++ Redistributables.  My experience troubleshooting these issues over the past five years, supporting numerous research teams and commercial projects, points to a critical oversight:  system-level compatibility checks are often insufficient.  A thorough, methodical approach, emphasizing precise version alignment and driver integrity, is crucial.

**1. Clear Explanation of Error Sources:**

The root cause of TensorFlow GPU installation failures rarely stems from a single, easily identifiable problem. Instead, it's usually a cascade of interconnected issues.  Here's a breakdown:

* **CUDA Toolkit Mismatch:** TensorFlow's GPU support relies heavily on NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit.  Installing an incompatible version (e.g., attempting to use a CUDA 11.x toolkit with a TensorFlow build requiring CUDA 10.2) will inevitably lead to errors.  This incompatibility often manifests as cryptic error messages during TensorFlow import or during execution of GPU-bound operations.  The error messages rarely pinpoint the CUDA version mismatch directly; instead, they often refer to DLL load failures or other low-level issues.

* **cuDNN Library Incompatibility:**  cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) provides highly optimized routines for deep learning operations. Similar to CUDA, using a mismatched cuDNN version (incorrect architecture, version number, or incompatibility with the selected CUDA version) will prevent TensorFlow from correctly utilizing the GPU.  Error messages will typically relate to undefined symbols or missing functions within the cuDNN library.

* **Visual C++ Redistributables:** TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN depend on specific versions of the Visual C++ Redistributables.  Missing or conflicting installations of these redistributables frequently lead to runtime errors, particularly during TensorFlow initialization.  These errors are often manifested as 'DLL not found' exceptions.

* **Driver Issues:** Outdated, corrupted, or improperly installed NVIDIA drivers are a common source of problems.  Even with correctly matched CUDA, cuDNN, and Visual C++ components, incorrect or conflicting drivers can block TensorFlow from accessing the GPU.

* **PATH Environment Variable Configuration:**  Incorrectly configured PATH environment variables can prevent Windows from locating crucial DLLs needed by TensorFlow and its dependencies. This often leads to failures during the import process, before TensorFlow even attempts to access the GPU.

* **Insufficient System Resources:** While less frequent, insufficient system RAM or insufficient Virtual Memory can prevent successful TensorFlow installation and execution.  Large models and extensive datasets demand substantial memory resources.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate common scenarios and highlight crucial elements of successful TensorFlow GPU installation.  Note that these are simplified examples focusing on error handling and version checking; complete installation procedures require additional steps.

**Example 1: Checking CUDA Version Compatibility:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
print(f"CUDA is available: {tf.test.is_built_with_cuda}")
if tf.test.is_built_with_cuda:
    print(f"CUDA version: {tf.test.gpu_device_name()}")  #May not always return accurate version
    try:
        import cupy
        print(f"CuPy version (indicative of CUDA support): {cupy.__version__}")
    except ImportError:
        print("CuPy not found - CUDA integration may be incomplete.")
else:
    print("TensorFlow is not built with CUDA support.")
```

**Commentary:**  This code snippet checks if TensorFlow is built with CUDA support and attempts to retrieve the CUDA version.  The `tf.test.gpu_device_name()` function, while useful, doesn't always return the exact CUDA version, necessitating additional verification methods.  The attempt to import `cupy`, a NumPy equivalent for CUDA, offers an additional layer of validation.


**Example 2: Verifying cuDNN Availability:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

try:
    #This will raise an error if cuDNN is not available or improperly installed
    x = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):  #Attempting a GPU operation
        y = x + x
    print(y.numpy())
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Error accessing GPU: {e}")
    #Add more robust error handling, such as checking against specific error messages
    #related to cuDNN here.
except tf.errors.OpError as e:
    print(f"TensorFlow operation error: {e}")
```

**Commentary:** This example attempts a simple GPU computation.  Failure indicates problems with either GPU access or cuDNN integration.  More sophisticated error handling would involve parsing the exception message for keywords indicative of specific cuDNN-related errors.

**Example 3: Basic Dependency Check (Illustrative):**

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def check_dependency(command):
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        return result.stdout.strip()
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return f"Error checking dependency: {e}"
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "Dependency not found."

#Note: Replace paths appropriately
cuda_version = check_dependency(["nvcc", "--version"])
cudnn_version = check_dependency(["where", "cudnn64_8.dll"]) #Modify for your cuDNN version

print(f"CUDA version: {cuda_version}")
print(f"cuDNN path: {cudnn_version}")

if cuda_version.startswith("Error") or cudnn_version.startswith("Error"):
  print("CUDA or cuDNN installation issues detected.")
```

**Commentary:** This code demonstrates how to programmatically check for the presence and basic information on CUDA and cuDNN.  Using `subprocess` allows the script to interact with the system's command-line interface.  Note this is a simplified check and does not guarantee compatibility with TensorFlow.  A robust solution would involve parsing output for specific version numbers and comparing against requirements.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is essential.  Pay close attention to the system requirements and installation guides tailored to Windows 10 and GPU usage.  NVIDIA's CUDA and cuDNN documentation provides crucial details regarding the libraries themselves, compatibility matrices, and troubleshooting.  Consult the Microsoft documentation on Visual C++ Redistributables to ensure compatibility across all dependencies.  Finally, exploring relevant Stack Overflow threads and community forums often provides valuable insights into specific error messages and their solutions.  Thorough examination of event logs within Windows can also be extremely useful in diagnosing low-level failures.  Remember: meticulously documenting each step taken and the version numbers of all relevant software is crucial for effective troubleshooting and subsequent reproduction of successful configurations.
