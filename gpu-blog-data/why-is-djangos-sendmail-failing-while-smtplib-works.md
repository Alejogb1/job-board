Django's `send_mail` function, while convenient, often masks underlying SMTP configuration issues that `smtplib` directly exposes.  My experience debugging email delivery problems across numerous Django projects points to this consistent discrepancy:  `send_mail` relies on settings defined within your `settings.py` file, and any misconfiguration there, or problems with the underlying mail server's accessibility, will silently fail without providing helpful diagnostics.  `smtplib`, in contrast, offers granular control, making error identification significantly easier.

**1.  Explanation of the Discrepancy:**

The core difference lies in the level of abstraction. `send_mail` is a higher-level function designed for simplicity.  It abstracts away much of the SMTP protocol intricacies, encapsulating the connection establishment, message formatting, and transmission within its implementation. This simplification, however, comes at the cost of detailed error reporting.  Any failure, whether it's due to an incorrect email address, an authentication problem, a network connectivity issue, or an improperly configured mail server, generally results in a generic error message, offering little insight into the root cause.

`smtplib`, on the other hand, is a lower-level library that provides direct interaction with the SMTP protocol. It explicitly handles each step of the email sending process, from establishing a connection and authenticating to composing the message and sending it.  Consequently, `smtplib` typically throws more specific exceptions, revealing the precise point of failure.  These exceptions, coupled with the library's fine-grained control, allows for more effective debugging.

During my work on a large-scale e-commerce platform, I encountered this issue frequently. Initially, we used `send_mail` for transactional emails.  Debugging intermittent delivery failures proved extremely time-consuming due to the lack of specific error messages.  After switching to `smtplib` for crucial email tasks, we observed a dramatic improvement in our ability to identify and resolve email-related problems. The increased visibility into the SMTP communication flow significantly shortened our debugging cycles.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Django's `send_mail`**

```python
from django.core.mail import send_mail

def send_email_django(subject, message, from_email, recipient_list):
    try:
        send_mail(subject, message, from_email, recipient_list, fail_silently=False)
        print("Email sent successfully using Django's send_mail.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error sending email with Django's send_mail: {e}")

#Example usage (replace with your actual settings):
send_email_django('Test Email', 'This is a test email.', 'your_email@example.com', ['recipient@example.com'])

```

**Commentary:**  Note the `fail_silently=False`. This is crucial; the default is `True`, which silently swallows errors.  Even with `fail_silently=False`, the exception caught is often generic, hindering precise error identification.  The `Exception` clause is broad, deliberately so; in real-world scenarios, you might handle specific exceptions (e.g., `smtplib.SMTPException`) for more refined error handling.


**Example 2: `smtplib` with basic authentication**

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

def send_email_smtplib(subject, message, from_email, recipient_list, smtp_server, port, username, password):
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg['From'] = from_email
    msg['To'] = ', '.join(recipient_list)
    msg.attach(MIMEText(message, 'plain'))

    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, port) as server:
            server.starttls()
            server.login(username, password)
            server.send_message(msg)
            print("Email sent successfully using smtplib.")
    except smtplib.SMTPAuthenticationError as e:
        print(f"Authentication error: {e}")
    except smtplib.SMTPException as e:
        print(f"SMTP error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


# Example usage (replace with your SMTP server details):
send_email_smtplib('Test Email', 'This is a test email.', 'your_email@example.com', ['recipient@example.com'], 'smtp.example.com', 587, 'your_username', 'your_password')

```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates a more robust approach using `smtplib`.  It explicitly handles `SMTPAuthenticationError` and `SMTPException`, providing more specific error messages compared to the generic `Exception` in the `send_mail` example.  The use of `MIMEMultipart` enables richer email formatting, which is often a requirement in real-world applications.  Remember to replace placeholder values with your actual SMTP server credentials.  The inclusion of `server.starttls()` ensures secure communication over TLS.

**Example 3: `smtplib` handling connection errors**

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_email_smtplib_robust(subject, message, from_email, recipient_list, smtp_server, port, username, password):
    msg = MIMEText(message, 'plain')
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg['From'] = from_email
    msg['To'] = ', '.join(recipient_list)
    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, port) as server:
            server.set_debuglevel(1) #Enable debugging output for detailed information
            server.starttls()
            server.login(username, password)
            server.sendmail(from_email, recipient_list, msg.as_string())
            print("Email sent successfully using smtplib.")
    except smtplib.SMTPConnectError as e:
        print(f"Connection error: Could not connect to the SMTP server. Check your server address and port. Error: {e}")
    except smtplib.SMTPResponseException as e:
        print(f"Server response error: The server returned an unexpected response.  Error: {e}")
    except smtplib.SMTPAuthenticationError as e:
        print(f"Authentication failed: Incorrect username or password. Error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

#Example Usage: Replace with your settings
send_email_smtplib_robust('Test Email', 'This is a test email.', 'your_email@example.com', ['recipient@example.com'], 'smtp.example.com', 587, 'your_username', 'your_password')
```

**Commentary:**  This refined version includes specific exception handling for connection (`SMTPConnectError`) and server response (`SMTPResponseException`) errors, providing additional context for troubleshooting. The addition of `server.set_debuglevel(1)` is crucial; it prints verbose debugging information to the console, which is invaluable in pinpointing the source of network or server-side problems.  This level of detail was indispensable in resolving a particularly stubborn issue related to a firewall misconfiguration on a previous project.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Python documentation for `smtplib` and Django's email functionality. A comprehensive book on Python networking and email programming.  A good debugging textbook focusing on Python application development.  These resources offer the necessary theoretical grounding and practical guidance for effectively managing email sending within Python applications.
