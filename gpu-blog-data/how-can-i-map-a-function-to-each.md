TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset` API allows for highly efficient data loading and preprocessing, but applying complex operations on a per-batch basis during record parsing can be tricky. Specifically, directly mapping a function to each *batch* *after* the `tf.data.TFRecordDataset` stage is not the conventional approach, as `map` operations are typically performed on individual elements within a dataset, not batches themselves. Achieving this necessitates a nuanced understanding of how TensorFlow manages data pipelines, and requires careful consideration of performance and resource utilization.

To clarify, the typical `TFRecordDataset` workflow involves creating a dataset from TFRecord files, then mapping a parsing function to each *record* (single element). Batching occurs after this step, using `dataset.batch()`. Subsequently, functions are generally applied to each element *within* the batch. What we seek, however, is applying a function *to the entire batch* as a single unit after all other transformations. This deviation from typical practice requires a workaround using `tf.data.Dataset.map`, combined with either `tf.data.Dataset.batch` configuration or an explicit custom batching implementation.

The primary issue lies in the fact that the `map` operation, by design, operates on a per-element basis. To manipulate entire batches, we have to manipulate either the size of the underlying dataset that feeds into our batch process, or reconfigure the batch mechanism to introduce some specific logic.

One effective approach involves performing batching *before* mapping the parsing function. This, however, is counterintuitive, as generally, the user would prefer to parse each record individually. The logic lies in how we can use `tf.data.Dataset.unbatch` to restore the records, apply per-record logic, and then repack into a batch with our custom function. Specifically, we can: 1) batch the dataset of records before parsing, 2) map a function to the entire batch (here, our parsing function might be needed), 3) unbatch the records, 4) apply our desired per-record operations, and 5) repack the data back into batches.

Another technique, often used for complex operations that require accessing batch-level context, involves creating custom batch processing functions outside of the usual dataset workflow. In essence, instead of relying on `dataset.batch`, we leverage `dataset.map` to perform our own batching logic, and apply a custom function to this explicitly constructed batch. This method offers greater control over the batch processing logic, which may be crucial for intricate workflows.

Lastly, we can employ `tf.data.Dataset.window`. By partitioning the dataset into smaller windows, then using `tf.data.Dataset.flat_map` to batch these windows, and then map a batch specific function to each window, we can achieve the same goal, although this might be more suited for use cases where data needs to be viewed in windowed format, such as a time-series data scenario.

Below are code examples to elaborate on these approaches.

**Example 1: Batching Prior to Parsing and Custom Function**

This first example demonstrates batching records initially, performing the necessary parsing and then a custom batch function, and unbatching them, before re-batching them into new batches with the result.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume we have a function to parse a single TFRecord
def _parse_record(serialized_example):
    feature_description = {
        'feature_a': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64),
        'feature_b': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.float32)
    }
    parsed_example = tf.io.parse_single_example(serialized_example, feature_description)
    return parsed_example['feature_a'], parsed_example['feature_b']

def _custom_batch_function(batch_a, batch_b):
  # Assume batch_a and batch_b are tensors of shape [batch_size]
  # Apply a custom operation to the whole batch
  new_batch_a = tf.add(batch_a, 5)
  new_batch_b = tf.multiply(batch_b, 2.0)
  return new_batch_a, new_batch_b

def create_dataset_batch_before_parsing(file_paths, batch_size):
    dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(file_paths)
    # Batch records directly
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    # Apply parsing and batch transformation
    dataset = dataset.map(lambda records: _custom_batch_function(*tf.map_fn(_parse_record, records, fn_output_signature=(tf.int64, tf.float32))))
    # Unbatch to make the resulting elements usable by subsequent operations
    dataset = dataset.unbatch()
    # Re-batch the resulting elements
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
    return dataset


#Example Usage
file_paths = ["test.tfrecord"] # Replace with actual path
batch_size = 4

# Create a dummy record to test the dataset with
with tf.io.TFRecordWriter(file_paths[0]) as writer:
  for i in range(10):
    example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={
        'feature_a': tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[i])),
        'feature_b': tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=[i*1.1]))
    }))
    writer.write(example.SerializeToString())


dataset = create_dataset_batch_before_parsing(file_paths, batch_size)
for batch_a, batch_b in dataset.take(2):
  print("Batch a:", batch_a.numpy())
  print("Batch b:", batch_b.numpy())
```

In this example, the `create_dataset_batch_before_parsing` function first batches the serialized examples from the TFRecord files. Then, using `tf.map_fn`, the `_parse_record` function is applied to each individual record within the batch. Subsequently, `_custom_batch_function` is applied to the parsed features. After unbatching, the final batching restores the original intended size. This allows a batch-specific calculation, in this case, multiplying one batch by 2 and adding 5 to the other.

**Example 2: Custom Batching Implementation via `Dataset.map`**

This second example demonstrates creating an explicit batch via `Dataset.map` and then applying a custom function.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def _parse_record(serialized_example):
    feature_description = {
        'feature_a': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64),
        'feature_b': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.float32)
    }
    parsed_example = tf.io.parse_single_example(serialized_example, feature_description)
    return parsed_example['feature_a'], parsed_example['feature_b']

def _custom_batch_function(batch_of_pairs):
    batch_a = tf.stack([example[0] for example in batch_of_pairs])
    batch_b = tf.stack([example[1] for example in batch_of_pairs])
    # Apply custom operation
    new_batch_a = tf.subtract(batch_a, 2)
    new_batch_b = tf.divide(batch_b, 2.0)
    return new_batch_a, new_batch_b


def create_dataset_custom_batching(file_paths, batch_size):
    dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(file_paths)
    dataset = dataset.map(_parse_record)

    # Create explicit batches with map
    def _create_batch(dataset_elements):
        return tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(dataset_elements).batch(batch_size).take(1)

    dataset = dataset.window(batch_size, shift=batch_size, drop_remainder=True)
    dataset = dataset.flat_map(_create_batch)


    # Custom map to the batch of elements
    dataset = dataset.map(_custom_batch_function)
    return dataset

#Example Usage
file_paths = ["test.tfrecord"] # Replace with actual path
batch_size = 4

# Create a dummy record to test the dataset with
with tf.io.TFRecordWriter(file_paths[0]) as writer:
  for i in range(10):
    example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={
        'feature_a': tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[i])),
        'feature_b': tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=[i*1.1]))
    }))
    writer.write(example.SerializeToString())

dataset = create_dataset_custom_batching(file_paths, batch_size)

for batch_a, batch_b in dataset.take(2):
    print("Batch a:", batch_a.numpy())
    print("Batch b:", batch_b.numpy())
```

In this instance, `create_dataset_custom_batching` parses each record first, then uses `dataset.window` and `flat_map` with `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` to explicitly generate batches. Finally, `_custom_batch_function` is applied, performing operations of subtraction and division on the batched data.

**Example 3: Windowing Approach**

This final example uses the window API to achieve batch-level processing. This is mostly suitable when dealing with data that benefits from a windowing approach.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def _parse_record(serialized_example):
    feature_description = {
        'feature_a': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64),
        'feature_b': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.float32)
    }
    parsed_example = tf.io.parse_single_example(serialized_example, feature_description)
    return parsed_example['feature_a'], parsed_example['feature_b']

def _custom_batch_function(window_dataset):
    window_a = []
    window_b = []
    for a, b in window_dataset:
      window_a.append(a)
      window_b.append(b)
    
    window_a = tf.stack(window_a)
    window_b = tf.stack(window_b)
    #Apply Custom Operation
    new_window_a = tf.pow(window_a, 2)
    new_window_b = tf.add(window_b, 5)
    return new_window_a, new_window_b

def create_dataset_windowing(file_paths, batch_size):
  dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(file_paths)
  dataset = dataset.map(_parse_record)
  dataset = dataset.window(batch_size, shift=batch_size, drop_remainder=True)
  dataset = dataset.flat_map(lambda window_dataset: tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(_custom_batch_function(window_dataset)))

  return dataset

#Example Usage
file_paths = ["test.tfrecord"] # Replace with actual path
batch_size = 4

# Create a dummy record to test the dataset with
with tf.io.TFRecordWriter(file_paths[0]) as writer:
  for i in range(10):
    example = tf.train.Example(features=tf.train.Features(feature={
        'feature_a': tf.train.Feature(int64_list=tf.train.Int64List(value=[i])),
        'feature_b': tf.train.Feature(float_list=tf.train.FloatList(value=[i*1.1]))
    }))
    writer.write(example.SerializeToString())


dataset = create_dataset_windowing(file_paths, batch_size)

for batch_a, batch_b in dataset.take(2):
    print("Batch a:", batch_a.numpy())
    print("Batch b:", batch_b.numpy())
```

In the above implementation, the dataset is windowed and the `flat_map` operation transforms the window dataset to a dataset of batches after applying a custom function. In this case, we apply the `pow` function for batch A and the `add` function for batch B.

**Resource Recommendations**

For more in-depth information on these techniques, it would be beneficial to consult:

*   The official TensorFlow documentation on `tf.data.Dataset`, specifically the sections on `map`, `batch`, `unbatch`, and `window`.
*   TensorFlow tutorials on efficient data loading, focusing on performance optimization within data pipelines.
*   Examples provided in the TensorFlow model garden, particularly those utilizing complex data processing logic, as they often employ sophisticated data preprocessing techniques.
*   Relevant academic papers on efficient data processing for deep learning, which may detail nuances of different pipeline optimization strategies.

In conclusion, applying custom functions to batches during TensorFlow record parsing requires careful manipulation of the dataset pipeline. Techniques like batching before parsing, implementing custom batching logic through `Dataset.map` and leveraging windowing offer flexible solutions, depending on the specific data processing needs. These approaches provide ways to circumvent the limitation of `tf.data.Dataset.map` operating on individual elements, achieving per-batch operations. Careful consideration of the use case, combined with appropriate implementation, ensures efficient and effective data processing in deep learning workflows.
