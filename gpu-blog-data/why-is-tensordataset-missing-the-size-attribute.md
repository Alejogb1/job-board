TensorDataset in PyTorch, a fundamental utility for managing data within deep learning pipelines, lacks a direct ‘size’ attribute despite the apparent logic in having one. This absence stems from its internal design focused on memory efficiency and iterator-based access rather than pre-computed dataset dimensions. Having spent considerable time working with custom dataset classes and optimizing for large-scale training in PyTorch, I've often encountered this question and initially found the omission perplexing.

The TensorDataset class, at its core, functions as a wrapper around tensors, providing an iterable interface that aligns well with PyTorch’s DataLoader. This approach allows for seamless integration into training loops, where data is typically processed in batches, rather than as a single, monolithic entity. Critically, TensorDataset does not store a separate, computed size; it dynamically derives dataset length by examining the length of the first tensor within the provided tuple. This behavior prevents unnecessary memory allocation that would be required for storing the size attribute redundantly, especially important when dealing with extremely large datasets. Consider situations where you’re working with image datasets; each tensor could represent a large matrix of pixel values, and storing the total dataset size as a fixed value could become burdensome in RAM, given that the length is implicitly available in the tensors themselves.

The absence of a dedicated ‘size’ attribute forces a more explicit approach to determining the dataset size, which becomes an exercise in direct tensor interrogation. Instead of directly accessing `dataset.size`, we consistently determine the dataset's cardinality by accessing `len(dataset)`, which under the hood, simply queries the length of the first tensor. This mechanism reinforces the idea that TensorDataset's strength lies in its ability to lazily access data, rather than operating on assumptions about pre-computed attributes. This is particularly important in handling datasets where the tensors themselves might have variable lengths, although such use-cases are less common for TensorDataset intended use with data of consistent size along the first dimension.

To clarify with code, let's consider a few usage examples.

**Example 1: Basic TensorDataset Creation and Size Determination**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset

# Create some example tensors
features = torch.randn(100, 20)  # 100 samples, 20 features each
labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))  # 100 labels, either 0 or 1

# Create a TensorDataset
dataset = TensorDataset(features, labels)

# Attempt to access a non-existent 'size' attribute (will fail)
# print(dataset.size) # This line will raise an AttributeError

# Correctly determine dataset size using len()
dataset_size = len(dataset)
print(f"Dataset size: {dataset_size}") # Output: Dataset size: 100

# Alternatively, accessing the first tensor's length works
first_tensor_length = features.shape[0]
print(f"First tensor size: {first_tensor_length}") # Output: First tensor size: 100

```

In the code snippet above, we create a simple `TensorDataset` with feature tensors and label tensors, each representing 100 data points. Attempts to access `dataset.size` will lead to an `AttributeError` as it does not exist.  We must retrieve the size via `len(dataset)`, which internally checks the first tensor for its length, or alternatively we can directly query the first tensor itself. This is a recurring pattern in TensorDataset, requiring that we derive length information rather than access a direct attribute. This design decision prevents redundant calculations and memory usage when constructing the `TensorDataset`.

**Example 2: Impact of Inconsistent Tensor Lengths (Illustrating a potential problem)**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset

# Create tensors with inconsistent sizes
features1 = torch.randn(100, 20)
features2 = torch.randn(50, 20)
labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))

# Attempt to create a TensorDataset with inconsistent feature lengths
try:
    dataset_inconsistent = TensorDataset(features1, features2, labels)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # Output: Error: Sizes of tensors must match except in the first dimension

# Using valid consistent tensors
dataset_consistent = TensorDataset(features1, labels[:100]) # Ensure labels align to features1
consistent_size = len(dataset_consistent)
print(f"Consistent dataset size: {consistent_size}") # Output: Consistent dataset size: 100

```
Here, we demonstrate what happens when the lengths of the supplied tensors in the dataset do not match on the first dimension, which is a common problem for new users. It’s important to understand that TensorDataset enforces a requirement that all input tensors have the same size along the first dimension, which implies an equal number of data points across the entire dataset. Attempting to create a `TensorDataset` with tensors of disparate lengths results in a ValueError. We also show how to properly align the tensors to create a functioning `TensorDataset`. If you supply two tensors of different sizes, you must ensure the second dimension is the same. For example you could provide two tensors where `tensor1.shape=(100, 20)` and `tensor2.shape=(50, 20)` and then correctly provide `dataset_inconsistent = TensorDataset(tensor1[0:50], tensor2)` this would work as the length on the first dimension is consistent.

**Example 3: Implications for Data Iteration**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader

# Create sample data
features = torch.randn(50, 10)
labels = torch.randint(0, 3, (50,))

# Create a TensorDataset and DataLoader
dataset = TensorDataset(features, labels)
data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=True)

# Iterate through the dataloader
for batch_index, (batch_features, batch_labels) in enumerate(data_loader):
    print(f"Batch {batch_index}: Features shape {batch_features.shape}, Labels shape {batch_labels.shape}")
    if batch_index > 2:
      break

# Note that the dataloader is responsible for chunking and providing a way to iterate
# the total number of batches can be calculated as the len(dataset) / batch_size if drop_last=False or
# math.ceil(len(dataset) / batch_size) if drop_last=True

```

This example shows how `TensorDataset` is typically utilized within a training loop using a `DataLoader`. The `DataLoader` handles batching, shuffling, and iterating over the dataset by repeatedly accessing items from the `TensorDataset` using its `__getitem__` implementation. Notice that the `size` of the dataset is used to determine how many batches can be provided by the dataloader and the iteration. Since `TensorDataset` provides a length which is equivalent to the number of data points (samples) in the tensors, the `DataLoader` can effectively create batches for use in training.

In conclusion, the absence of a `size` attribute in `TensorDataset` is not an oversight but a deliberate design choice that optimizes for memory efficiency and aligns with PyTorch's overall architecture for data loading. While it might seem initially counterintuitive, the approach is efficient, prevents unnecessary storage of redundant data, and encourages a more direct interaction with tensors.

For further exploration of dataset creation in PyTorch, I recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation, which covers fundamental dataset handling concepts. It is beneficial to study tutorials on the torch.utils.data modules. Experimenting with the creation of custom dataset classes that inherit from `torch.utils.data.Dataset` is also very beneficial for improving your understanding, allowing you to better comprehend the flexibility and design choices behind TensorDataset’s behavior and also allowing you to create more optimized custom datasets for different use cases. Finally, examining examples in the PyTorch codebase will give deeper insights into the design principles.
