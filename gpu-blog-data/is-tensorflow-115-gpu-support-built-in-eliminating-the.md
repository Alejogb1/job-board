TensorFlow 1.15 GPU support is not entirely built-in and requires specific, version-matched NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit installation. The core TensorFlow package, even the GPU-enabled builds, functions as an interface to these external libraries. A common misconception arises from observing that a 'tensorflow-gpu' package exists, leading some to believe that without this explicitly named package, no GPU acceleration will occur. However, this package mainly handles the dependency management and binary compatibility for a specific CUDA version.

The key distinction lies between the TensorFlow API and the underlying hardware acceleration. The API exposes functions and classes for building and training neural networks. These computations can be executed on either the CPU or, if the necessary drivers and libraries are present, the GPU. The 'tensorflow-gpu' package, often specified as part of the installation, serves to indicate the desired path for acceleration. Without the correctly installed CUDA drivers and libraries, even with the 'tensorflow-gpu' package, TensorFlow will default to CPU execution, potentially leading to significantly slower training times and erroneous impressions that GPU acceleration is simply unavailable. Thus, the situation isn't about the absence of the separate package disabling GPU usage; it's the missing or incompatible runtime environment. The package essentially contains pre-compiled components linked against a certain CUDA version.

In my past experience, I recall a particularly frustrating debugging session involving a newly deployed server. I had installed 'tensorflow-gpu' as part of the image creation process and expected GPU processing to be automatic. However, performance metrics indicated CPU utilization rather than GPU. After investigation, I discovered that the CUDA toolkit version on the server did not match what the 'tensorflow-gpu' package required. This mismatch led TensorFlow to fall back to CPU processing silently, without explicit error messages that were immediately actionable. Correcting this involved carefully matching the required CUDA version with a suitable 'tensorflow-gpu' package.

Let's delve into code examples to illustrate this point further:

**Example 1: Initial Setup (Often Mistaken)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Attempt to verify if GPU is accessible
if tf.test.is_gpu_available():
    print("GPU is available.")
    device_name = tf.test.gpu_device_name()
    print("Device Name:", device_name)
else:
    print("GPU is NOT available. TensorFlow is using CPU.")
```

This code snippet attempts to determine if a GPU device is recognized by TensorFlow. However, it doesn't ensure that the application will actually use the GPU even if availability is reported. The check simply verifies the presence of a suitable driver and compatible CUDA environment. It often reports GPU availability if the drivers exist, even if the CUDA version is incompatible with TensorFlow’s precompiled binaries. It’s the actual execution that will highlight the issue.

**Example 2: Basic GPU Usage (With Potential Issues)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import time
import numpy as np

# Create random tensors
a = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1000, 1000).astype(np.float32))
b = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1000, 1000).astype(np.float32))

# Perform matrix multiplication
c = tf.matmul(a, b)

start_time = time.time()
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(c)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds.")

# Check where the operation occurred (CPU or GPU)
print(f"Device placement: {c.device}")
```

This snippet performs matrix multiplication. The output from 'c.device' can give information about the selected device. If the device name contains "GPU," the computation occurred on the GPU, whereas "/CPU:0" indicates CPU usage. A critical observation is that even if the previous availability check returns 'True', this program might still use the CPU if the CUDA compatibility is compromised. This often misleads users who interpret the initial check as full GPU utilization, underscoring how the underlying environment is crucial. It serves as a valuable confirmation test; a long execution time coupled with a CPU device indicates that even if a GPU is present, TensorFlow isn't utilizing it for calculations due to incompatible libraries.

**Example 3: Explicit Device Placement (Illustrative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
    a = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1000, 1000).astype(np.float32))
    b = tf.constant(np.random.rand(1000, 1000).astype(np.float32))
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)


with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    try:
      result = sess.run(c)
    except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
      print(f"Error encountered: {e}")
      print("GPU Device Placement failed. Check CUDA compatibility.")

print(f"Device placement: {c.device}")
```

This code attempts explicit device placement using `tf.device('/GPU:0')`. While the first two examples may still run on CPU silently, this example introduces a key element: an explicit error check using a try-except block. If the necessary CUDA drivers and libraries are not properly installed or matched, the tensorflow will generate an InvalidArgumentError exception that directly states device allocation failure, helping to pin point underlying issues. Examining this error provides a faster way to establish if an environment problem exists than monitoring performance alone.

These examples collectively demonstrate that while a separate ‘tensorflow-gpu’ package influences which pre-compiled binaries are downloaded, the root of GPU utilization in TensorFlow hinges on a correctly configured runtime environment encompassing compatible NVIDIA drivers, CUDA Toolkit, and cuDNN library versions.

To achieve proper GPU utilization in TensorFlow 1.15, meticulous attention must be paid to compatibility requirements. Official NVIDIA documentation provides detailed instructions on selecting the correct driver and CUDA toolkit versions that match TensorFlow’s needs, and often includes compatibility matrix. Additionally, review of the specific 'tensorflow-gpu' package documentation within the project's official source code repository usually contains details on the required versions. Finally, technical forums often include discussions regarding common dependency issues encountered, and provides different perspectives on problem solving, especially for older versions. Consulting multiple of these information sources ensures complete configuration, rather than relying on perceived built-in support.
