The core of the "AttributeError: module 'tensorboard.summary._tf.summary' has no attribute 'FileWriter'" error stems from the deprecation of `tf.summary.FileWriter` in TensorFlow 2.x. This class, crucial for writing TensorBoard summaries in TensorFlow 1.x, was replaced by higher-level APIs. Encountering this error almost always indicates an attempt to use legacy TensorFlow 1.x code with a TensorFlow 2.x installation, or using TensorBoard utilities incorrectly within the newer framework. I’ve personally debugged this transition issue countless times migrating legacy models to the current ecosystem, and understanding the exact changes in TensorBoard’s API is crucial.

The principal change is the shift from manually creating `FileWriter` instances to utilizing TensorFlow's `tf.summary` context manager within the training loop or, alternatively, through the use of `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard`. The `FileWriter` class managed writing summary data to a specific log directory. In TensorFlow 2.x, summaries are handled more implicitly through the `tf.summary` API and often in combination with Keras or by manually using `tf.summary.create_file_writer`. Direct calls to `FileWriter` will therefore result in the `AttributeError` as it is simply not exposed.

Let’s delve into some specific examples to clarify how to correctly implement TensorBoard logging.

**Example 1: Logging a Scalar Value using `tf.summary` context manager**

This first example demonstrates the idiomatic way to log a scalar value, such as a loss or metric, in TensorFlow 2.x. This replaces the older `FileWriter` based approach.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import datetime

log_dir = "logs/scalar_example/" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

# Assume we have some training loop where 'step' is the current step
step = 0
loss = 0.8

with summary_writer.as_default():
  tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=step)

# In a real application, step and loss would be updated in a loop
step +=1
loss = 0.7

with summary_writer.as_default():
  tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=step)

# The logs are written to the specified log_dir and can be viewed in TensorBoard
```

Here's a breakdown:

*   `tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)`: This function replaces the direct instantiation of `FileWriter`. It initializes the writing mechanism to a directory that houses the log files. This call does *not* immediately write to disk.
*   `with summary_writer.as_default():`: This context manager sets the file writer to which any subsequent `tf.summary` calls will write. This is key to associating summary data with the correct log directory.
*   `tf.summary.scalar('loss', loss, step=step)`:  This logs the scalar value of the variable named `loss` at the given step. These are the high-level functions that replace the functionality of `FileWriter.add_summary`. The `step` argument is essential for plotting values over time in TensorBoard.
* Note that no direct file writing is performed within the context manager; the file writer buffers the summary information, writing to disk only when it needs to or when explicitly told to.

This approach ensures that all summaries generated within the `with` block are directed to the created file writer without manually passing the writer to every `tf.summary` function.

**Example 2: Using `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard` for Model Training**

When training a model using `tf.keras`, the `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard` callback offers a more integrated and straightforward way to log summaries.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import datetime

# Create a simple model (replace with your actual model)
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Create a dataset (replace with your data)
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((tf.random.normal(shape=(1000, 784)), tf.random.uniform(shape=(1000,), minval=0, maxval=9, dtype=tf.int32)))
dataset = dataset.batch(32)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])


log_dir = "logs/model_training/" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir, histogram_freq=1)

model.fit(dataset, epochs=2, callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
```

Explanation:

*   `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir, histogram_freq=1)`:  This creates a `TensorBoard` callback instance, specifying the directory for logs. The `histogram_freq=1` indicates that weight and activation histograms should be logged every epoch. This is optional.
*   `model.fit(..., callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])`: The `TensorBoard` callback is passed to the `fit` method during training. During each training step and epoch, the callback will automatically log relevant information such as loss, metrics, model weights, and gradients, without manual calls to `tf.summary` by the programmer. This is the preferred approach when using Keras for model training.
* The call to `fit` implicitly manages the file writer, meaning the user does not have to be concerned with manually opening and closing it.

This method abstracts away the manual creation of file writers and summary recording, aligning more closely with the Keras API. This approach also allows easy inclusion of profiling data and additional information.

**Example 3:  Logging Custom Values Outside Model Fitting**

Sometimes, we need to log values that are not automatically included with model training. Example would be tracking hyperparameter values or pre-processing statistics. Here's how:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import datetime
import numpy as np

log_dir = "logs/custom_values/" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(log_dir)

# Example: some manual pre-processing step
dummy_data = np.random.rand(100)
mean = np.mean(dummy_data)
std = np.std(dummy_data)

step = 0

with summary_writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.scalar("data/mean", mean, step=step)
    tf.summary.scalar("data/std", std, step=step)
    tf.summary.histogram("data/histogram", dummy_data, step=step)

# Example: manually tracking some custom metric
custom_metric = 0.65
step = 1

with summary_writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.scalar('custom_metric', custom_metric, step=step)
```

Here's a quick breakdown:

*   `tf.summary.histogram`: allows logging of a histogram of an array, useful for visualizing data distributions and model weights/activations.
*   The `with summary_writer.as_default()` pattern persists, allowing us to log data at any point in our code. As we are controlling the `step` counter, we have full flexibility over how information is organized in Tensorboard.
*   The method of manual creation of the file writer as well as the `with` context should only be used when the preferred `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard` is not sufficient. This is the case for pre/post-processing steps or other custom functionality.

In all of these examples, the use of `FileWriter` is entirely avoided, resolving the original `AttributeError`. The correct method is to employ either the `tf.summary` context manager, as in examples 1 and 3, or the `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard`, as in example 2. These changes reflect the API updates in TensorFlow 2.x and are crucial for proper TensorBoard usage.

**Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections pertaining to `tf.summary` and `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard`.  The Keras documentation, focusing on callbacks in general, also provides invaluable context for how TensorBoard is integrated within the framework. Tutorials published by the TensorFlow team on their website or on platforms like YouTube can also offer practical demonstrations and deeper insights. Finally, examining the changelogs for TensorFlow versions moving from 1.x to 2.x will highlight the precise changes in API organization, particularly those affecting `tf.summary` and its file writing mechanism. These resources will enhance your grasp of the subtle but essential changes, leading to more robust and correctly implemented code.
