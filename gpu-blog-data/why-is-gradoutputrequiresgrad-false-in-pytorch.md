The assertion that `grad_output.requires_grad` is False in PyTorch after a backward pass is not universally true, but rather a consequence of PyTorch's automatic differentiation mechanism and the typical usage patterns surrounding it.  It stems from the understanding that `grad_output` represents the gradients *computed* during the backward pass, not the variables used to *compute* those gradients.  My experience debugging complex neural network architectures involving custom loss functions and complex computational graphs has solidified this understanding.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's `autograd` system dynamically builds a computational graph as operations are performed on tensors.  When `requires_grad=True` is set for a tensor, PyTorch tracks operations performed on it, allowing for gradient computation during the backward pass.  The backward pass, initiated by calling `.backward()` on a tensor (typically the loss), computes gradients according to the chain rule.  Crucially, the `grad_output` argument passed to the `.backward()` method, if provided, represents the gradient of some *outer* function with respect to the output of the current computational subgraph.

The key point is that the gradients calculated during the backward pass – the gradients that are then stored in `.grad` attributes of tensors – are *not* themselves tracked for further differentiation.  This is by design.  Consider the computational cost and the lack of practical need for differentiating the gradients themselves.  Differentiating gradients (second-order derivatives) is certainly possible but requires explicit specification using higher-order automatic differentiation techniques, which are not the default behavior.  Therefore, when the backward pass completes, the resulting gradient tensors within `grad_output` do not have `requires_grad=True` because further differentiation of these gradients is not automatically enabled and, often, unnecessary.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Basic Backward Pass**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
z = y.mean()
z.backward()

print(x.grad)  # Gradients of z with respect to x are computed and stored
print(y.requires_grad) # True because y was part of the computational graph
print(z.requires_grad) # True, z initiated the backward pass.
print(z.grad) # z.grad is None.  Gradients are accumulated in x.grad
```

In this example, `y` retains `requires_grad=True` because it's part of the computational graph leading to `z`. However, if we were to inspect any hypothetical `grad_output` within this simple example, it would likely not be a tensor involved in the chain rule, and thus its `requires_grad` attribute would be False by default.

**Example 2:  Backward Pass with `grad_output`**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
z = y.mean()

# Simulate an outer function that needs a weighted gradient
grad_z = torch.tensor([0.1, 0.5, 0.4])
z.backward(gradient=grad_z)


print(x.grad) # Gradients are scaled by grad_z
print(y.requires_grad) # Still True
print(grad_z.requires_grad) # Almost certainly False. grad_z was not part of the autograd graph.
```

Here, we explicitly provide `grad_output` (represented by `grad_z`).  Observe that while the gradients of `z` with respect to `x` are modified by the provided gradient, `grad_z` itself is not tracked by autograd;  it’s merely input data to the backward pass. Therefore, the `requires_grad` attribute of `grad_z` (our `grad_output` analogue) will be False.  Had `grad_z` been the result of computation within the same graph, it might have had `requires_grad = True`.

**Example 3: Custom Function with Backward Pass**

```python
import torch

class CustomFunction(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, input):
        ctx.save_for_backward(input)
        return input.pow(2)

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_output):
        input, = ctx.saved_tensors
        return grad_output * 2 * input


x = torch.randn(3, requires_grad=True)
custom_func = CustomFunction.apply
y = custom_func(x)
y.backward()

print(x.grad)
print(y.requires_grad)  # True.
#grad_output within CustomFunction.backward() will have requires_grad = False as it is simply input data for the derivative computation.
```

This illustrates a custom autograd function.  The `grad_output` received in the `backward` method represents the gradient of some function *external* to our custom function.  It's not a tensor within the graph that our custom function builds; its `requires_grad` attribute will be determined by how it was created, but usually it is False.  It’s simply used in the calculation of the gradients within the `backward` method.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The PyTorch documentation's section on `autograd`, specifically the explanation of the `backward()` method and how gradients are computed and stored, is invaluable.  Furthermore, a comprehensive textbook on deep learning, covering the mathematical foundations of automatic differentiation and backpropagation, will provide essential context.  Finally, explore resources explaining computational graphs to visualize how PyTorch tracks operations and their dependencies.  Thorough understanding of these concepts is essential for effectively utilizing and debugging PyTorch’s autograd system.
