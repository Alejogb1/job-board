The `mark_geoshape` encoding in Altair, while conceptually powerful for displaying geographical boundaries, often fails to render correctly due to a confluence of factors related to data preparation, projection compatibility, and the underlying Vega-Lite renderer's handling of geoJSON data. My experience working on numerous mapping projects using Altair has highlighted these common pitfalls.

The primary hurdle lies in the meticulous structure required for geoJSON data and its interoperability with Altair's projection handling. Specifically, `mark_geoshape` expects a valid geoJSON object, which may include polygons or multipolygons, to define the spatial outlines. These objects must be properly formatted, exhibiting valid coordinate pairs within a defined coordinate reference system (CRS). Altair does not inherently transform between CRSs; thus, if the geoJSON data's CRS does not align with the projection specified in the Altair chart, the shapes may not render correctly or at all. This mismatch often appears as either blank plots or distorted, nonsensical shapes.

Furthermore, the order of elements within a complex geoJSON structure can impact rendering. Polygons are constructed by arranging coordinate pairs, and incorrect ordering can result in self-intersecting boundaries that fail to render as expected. While many geoJSON editing tools attempt to adhere to conventions, human or script-based modifications can introduce errors. Similarly, attribute data attached to these shapes also plays a role. Altair utilizes a data-driven approach, linking data fields in the DataFrame with encodings in the chart. Incorrect association of data with geometries, perhaps due to mismatches in indexing or feature IDs, can also lead to rendering failures.

The interaction with Altair's internal representation of geoJSON also needs consideration. When we provide geoJSON strings to Altair, it typically interprets them correctly. However, in certain edge cases, specifically with very large or highly complex geoJSON objects, Vega-Lite's processing can become computationally intensive, sometimes failing due to browser resource limits or timeouts. This issue can be exacerbated when applying numerous filters or transformations on the geoJSON before plotting. Furthermore, the type of data container used to present the geoJSON to Altair is significant; presenting the data as a string, a pre-parsed dictionary, or a file path can impact handling and subsequent rendering.

Finally, while less frequent, the versions of Altair and its dependencies, particularly Vega-Lite, also have an impact. Bugs that may affect the interpretation of geoJSON data or the implementation of `mark_geoshape` might have been resolved in later releases. Therefore, it is good practice to ensure you are operating on the latest version of relevant packages.

To illustrate these points, I will provide three examples highlighting common issues and solutions.

**Example 1: Data Format and Projection Mismatch**

This example demonstrates the error created by a mismatch between the data format and the projection system.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

# Incorrect geoJSON data with no CRS specified
geojson_string = """
{
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [
        {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Polygon",
                "coordinates": [
                  [
                    [0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [0,1], [0,0]
                    ]
                  ]
              },
            "properties": { "id": 1, "value": 10 }
        }
    ]
}
"""
df = pd.DataFrame({'data': [geojson_string]})

# Incorrect: No explicit projection or coordinate system specified.
chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_geoshape().encode(
    tooltip=['data.properties.value:Q']
).properties(
  projection={"type": "mercator"}  # Implicitly assumes latitude/longitude, but data is in arbitrary units
).display()
```

Here, the geoJSON represents a simple square, but its coordinate values (0, 1) are not latitude and longitude as Mercator projection requires. The code will attempt to project this, leading to a distorted outcome. A correct implementation would require either altering the coordinate values to valid latitude and longitude or specifying a suitable projection system or not specifying any projection for an arbitrary coordinate system.

**Example 2: Invalid geoJSON Structure**

This example showcases how improperly ordered coordinates in a Polygon can cause rendering issues.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

#  geoJSON data with polygon coordinates in the wrong order
geojson_string = """
{
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [
        {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Polygon",
                "coordinates": [
                  [
                   [1,1], [0,1], [1,0], [0,0], [1,1]
                    ]
                  ]
              },
            "properties": { "id": 1, "value": 10 }
        }
    ]
}
"""
df = pd.DataFrame({'data': [geojson_string]})

#Incorrect: The Polygon is self-intersecting due to the order.
chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_geoshape().encode(
    tooltip=['data.properties.value:Q']
)

chart.display()
```

The polygon's coordinate order does not follow a standard counter-clockwise or clockwise convention, causing it to self-intersect, and leading to unexpected display. A valid geoJSON definition requires a consistently ordered sequence of points to correctly define the exterior ring, thus the correct solution is to adhere to these conventions.

**Example 3: Using a Pre-Parsed GeoJSON Dictionary**

This example highlights the correct way to handle geoJSON using a pre-parsed python dictionary.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import json

# Valid geoJSON data pre-parsed into a python dictionary
geojson_dict = {
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [
        {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Polygon",
                "coordinates": [
                    [
                        [-100, 40], [-100, 50], [-90, 50], [-90, 40], [-100, 40]
                    ]
                ]
              },
            "properties": { "id": 1, "value": 10 }
        }
    ]
}

df = pd.DataFrame({'data': [geojson_dict]})

# Correct: Using a valid geoJSON structure, valid projection and pre-parsed geoJSON object
chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_geoshape(
    fill='blue',
    stroke = 'black'
).encode(
    tooltip=['data.properties.value:Q']
).properties(
  projection={"type": "mercator"}
)
chart.display()

```

This example uses valid geoJSON coordinates adhering to the expectations of the specified projection, ensuring the rendering of the shape. Pre-parsing the geoJSON data into a python dictionary before passing it to Altair often improves handling.

In summary, the lack of rendering when using `mark_geoshape` usually stems from improper geoJSON data formatting, lack of CRS alignment, incorrect data association, or exceeding the rendering capabilities of Vega-Lite. Proper data preparation, validation and knowledge of the underlying assumptions of the projection system are crucial to successful geospatial visualizations in Altair. When encountering rendering issues, meticulous verification of the geoJSON structure and projection settings should be the initial step.

For further exploration, resources like the official GeoJSON specification, documentation on the Vega-Lite project, and literature surrounding cartographic projections, can help clarify many of these core concepts and their implementation in libraries like Altair. Online resources from reputable GIS and data visualization education websites will also serve as useful learning tools. Focusing on these areas will help build a solid understanding that allows for the creation of accurate, complex maps using `mark_geoshape`.
