Directly addressing the question of row deletion in PyTorch tensors reveals a core limitation: PyTorch tensors, unlike NumPy arrays, lack a dedicated, in-place row deletion method.  This stems from PyTorch's focus on computational graph construction and automatic differentiation, where preserving operation history is paramount.  In-place modifications can disrupt this history, leading to unpredictable behavior during backpropagation. Consequently, strategies for removing rows invariably involve creating a new tensor, excluding the designated rows from the original. My experience working on large-scale NLP models, particularly sequence-to-sequence tasks, has consistently highlighted this distinction.  Efficiently managing tensor dimensions is crucial for memory management and computational speed in these scenarios.

My approach to this problem, honed over years of working with PyTorch in research and production environments, centers around three primary techniques, each with its specific strengths and trade-offs:  boolean indexing, advanced indexing using `torch.index_select`, and tensor concatenation after slicing.

**1. Boolean Indexing:** This method offers intuitive readability and is often the most straightforward for relatively simple row deletions. It leverages a boolean mask to select the rows to retain.  The mask's creation is the crucial step, defining which rows survive the operation.

```python
import torch

# Example tensor
tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3],
                     [4, 5, 6],
                     [7, 8, 9],
                     [10, 11, 12]])

# Rows to delete (indices starting from 0)
rows_to_delete = [1, 3]

# Create a boolean mask.  Note the use of '~' for negation.
mask = torch.ones(tensor.shape[0], dtype=torch.bool)
mask[rows_to_delete] = False

# Apply the mask to select the rows to keep.
new_tensor = tensor[mask]

print(f"Original tensor:\n{tensor}")
print(f"New tensor after deleting rows {rows_to_delete}:\n{new_tensor}")
```

The code first defines a tensor.  Then, `rows_to_delete` specifies the indices of rows to be removed. A boolean mask is initialized to all `True` values, the same length as the number of rows in the tensor.  The indices in `rows_to_delete` are set to `False` in the mask.  Finally, boolean indexing (`tensor[mask]`) selects only the rows where the mask is `True`, effectively creating a new tensor without the specified rows.  This method is particularly efficient for scattered row removals, where the pattern is not easily expressed through slicing.

**2. `torch.index_select`:** For scenarios involving consecutive row deletion or where performance is paramount, `torch.index_select` provides a more optimized approach. This function directly selects rows based on their indices, avoiding the overhead of boolean mask creation.

```python
import torch

# Example tensor (same as before)
tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3],
                     [4, 5, 6],
                     [7, 8, 9],
                     [10, 11, 12]])

# Rows to keep (indices starting from 0)
rows_to_keep = [0, 2]

# Select rows using torch.index_select
new_tensor = torch.index_select(tensor, 0, torch.tensor(rows_to_keep))

print(f"Original tensor:\n{tensor}")
print(f"New tensor after keeping rows {rows_to_keep}:\n{new_tensor}")
```

Here, we explicitly define the indices of rows we wish to retain in `rows_to_keep`.  `torch.index_select(tensor, 0, torch.tensor(rows_to_keep))` performs the selection along dimension 0 (rows). The resulting `new_tensor` contains only the selected rows.  This approach is generally faster than boolean indexing when dealing with large tensors and contiguous row deletions, avoiding the implicit iteration inherent in boolean masking.  It's crucial to note that this method requires explicitly specifying the indices to *keep*, unlike the previous boolean masking which directly defines the indices to *delete*.


**3. Slicing and Concatenation:**  This method is suitable for deleting a range of consecutive rows. It employs tensor slicing to extract the portions of the tensor to be kept and then concatenates them to form the new tensor.

```python
import torch

# Example tensor (same as before)
tensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3],
                     [4, 5, 6],
                     [7, 8, 9],
                     [10, 11, 12]])

# Range of rows to delete (inclusive)
start_delete = 1
end_delete = 2

# Slice the tensor to keep rows before and after the deleted range
part1 = tensor[:start_delete]
part2 = tensor[end_delete+1:]

# Concatenate the slices to form the new tensor
new_tensor = torch.cat((part1, part2), dim=0)

print(f"Original tensor:\n{tensor}")
print(f"New tensor after deleting rows {start_delete} to {end_delete}:\n{new_tensor}")
```

This example demonstrates the deletion of a contiguous block of rows. The tensor is sliced into two parts: `part1` contains rows before the deletion range and `part2` contains rows after. `torch.cat` concatenates these parts along dimension 0 (rows), effectively removing the specified range. This method offers a concise way to manage block deletions, but it's less flexible than boolean indexing for non-contiguous removals.  The clarity of this method shines in its straightforward approach, emphasizing the simplicity of slicing and concatenating for range-based deletions.


**Resource Recommendations:**

I would strongly advise consulting the official PyTorch documentation for detailed explanations of tensor manipulation functions.  Thorough study of the documentation on indexing, slicing, and tensor manipulation is essential.  Exploring tutorials focused on advanced tensor operations will greatly enhance your understanding.  Finally, reviewing examples within the PyTorch ecosystem, particularly those within research papers utilizing large-scale tensors, will provide valuable insight into best practices and efficiency considerations for tensor manipulation.  This structured approach, combining documentation study with practical exploration, will establish a firm foundation for working effectively with PyTorch tensors.
