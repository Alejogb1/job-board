Often when visualizing time series data or data with many discrete categories using Altair, the default behavior of automatic x-axis label generation results in overcrowding and illegibility. The number of labels plotted is determined by Altair's heuristics aimed at producing a readable chart, but this algorithm is not always optimal for specific datasets. I've encountered this issue numerous times while working with large datasets, particularly when plotting activity logs, and have developed a clear understanding of the techniques available to manage x-axis labels.

The primary method for controlling the number of x-axis labels is through manipulating the underlying Vega-Lite specification, the declarative language Altair uses to define charts. Altair provides a mechanism to pass arguments directly to the Vega-Lite configuration through the `.configure_axis()` method. Within this method, several parameters become relevant. The key to controlling the number of labels lies in understanding how these parameters interact, particularly when a temporal scale is being used.

The most direct way is by using the `tickCount` parameter within the axis configuration. `tickCount` defines the desired (or approximate) number of ticks and consequently, labels on the axis. However, it's crucial to understand that this isn't a hard constraint; the system might adjust the number based on the overall readability. For instance, when dealing with a time scale, Vega-Lite will favor integer values and sensible temporal intervals when deciding where ticks will be placed.

Let's examine some examples with commentary to illustrate how this works.

**Example 1: Basic tickCount for Numerical Data**

Consider a simple scatter plot. Without any axis configuration, Altair will generate labels based on the range of x values. We can control the label count using `tickCount`.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(42)
data = pd.DataFrame({'x': np.random.rand(100) * 100, 'y': np.random.rand(100) * 100})

chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
    x='x:Q',
    y='y:Q'
).configure_axis(
    labelFontSize=12, # Optional - for label readability
    labelPadding=5,   # Optional - to give more space between labels and axis
    x=alt.Axis(tickCount=5)
)

chart.display()
```

In this example, the `tickCount=5` argument tells the Vega-Lite engine to generate approximately five ticks along the x-axis. While the resulting number might not be exactly 5, it provides a significant level of control over the density of labels. The `labelFontSize` and `labelPadding` are included to show that one can also configure the label appearance for improved readability.

**Example 2: tickCount on a Time Scale**

Controlling the number of time labels can be particularly useful for detailed time-series visualizations. When dealing with dates or times, `tickCount` interacts with the time scale in interesting ways.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

dates = pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=30, freq='D')
data = pd.DataFrame({'date': dates, 'value': np.random.rand(30) * 100})

chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_line().encode(
    x='date:T',
    y='value:Q'
).configure_axis(
     labelFontSize=12, # Optional - for label readability
     labelPadding=5,  # Optional - to give more space between labels and axis
     x=alt.Axis(tickCount=7)
)

chart.display()
```

Here, with `tickCount=7`, Vega-Lite will attempt to display approximately 7 ticks along the time scale. It will pick intervals like weeks or multiples of days, aiming for easily interpretable labels based on the provided data. If the data span is short, such as a few hours, the labels will be more frequent. On the other hand, if the data spans months or years, the tick spacing will be larger. Note that `tickCount` is merely a suggestion, and the system will prioritize sensible time intervals over the exact count.

**Example 3: Manual Tick Specification with `values`**

If `tickCount` doesn't offer the required level of control, the `values` parameter of the `axis` configuration can manually define the positions of ticks. This provides a very fine level of control but it’s more verbose and requires deeper understanding of data ranges, making `tickCount` more appropriate for the majority of use cases. I recommend using this approach only when other methods don't provide adequate control.

```python
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

dates = pd.date_range('2023-01-01', periods=30, freq='D')
data = pd.DataFrame({'date': dates, 'value': np.random.rand(30) * 100})

# Manually specify tick positions at 0th, 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th date
manual_tick_values = dates[[0, 7, 14, 21, 28]]

chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_line().encode(
    x='date:T',
    y='value:Q'
).configure_axis(
    labelFontSize=12, # Optional - for label readability
    labelPadding=5,   # Optional - to give more space between labels and axis
    x=alt.Axis(values=list(manual_tick_values))
)

chart.display()
```
In this final example, `values` takes a list of dates directly from our date array that were selected at specific intervals. This approach bypasses Vega-Lite’s time-based calculations and forces ticks exactly where they were specified. It’s a powerful tool for intricate cases when precise control is needed, for example when aligning ticks with domain-specific events.

In summary, controlling x-axis label count in Altair boils down to strategically configuring the underlying Vega-Lite specification. The `tickCount` parameter is the most effective general-purpose method, allowing control over the approximate label density, adapting well to both numerical and temporal scales. When finer control over specific tick positions is necessary, the `values` parameter can specify the exact locations for these. When choosing between the two, start with `tickCount`, and only use `values` when the automatic calculation by Vega-Lite does not produce the required result. Always keep in mind that the primary goal is to create legible charts, and that axis label density should be tailored to the complexity of data. For more in-depth documentation and exploration of specific configuration options for Vega-Lite, I’ve found online documentation specifically about the axis configuration parameters and their interactions with different data types particularly useful. Additionally, the official Vega-Lite website provides comprehensive information for advanced cases or customization of the underlying specifications.
