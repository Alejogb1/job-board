The core distinction between TensorFlow's `Session.run` and `Session.partial_run` lies in their handling of computational graphs and the execution of operations within them.  While `Session.run` executes a complete subgraph defined by a set of fetched tensors,  `Session.partial_run` allows for the execution of a subgraph in stages, feeding intermediate results back into subsequent executions. This capability is crucial in scenarios requiring asynchronous or iterative computations, where the complete computational graph isn't known upfront or where efficiency gains are obtained through staged execution.  My experience working on large-scale reinforcement learning models, particularly those involving asynchronous actor-critic architectures, highlighted the importance of understanding this distinction.

**1.  `Session.run` : Complete Execution**

`Session.run` is the standard method for executing operations within a TensorFlow session.  It takes a list of `fetches` (tensors or operations to retrieve) and optionally a `feed_dict` (mapping of placeholder tensors to input values). The session evaluates the minimal subgraph required to compute the requested `fetches`, executes it, and returns the results.  This implies that the entire subgraph necessary to produce the requested outputs is computed in a single call.  This is straightforward and easy to use, but it lacks the flexibility needed for certain advanced applications.

**Code Example 1: `Session.run`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a simple graph
a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
c = a + b

# Create a session
sess = tf.Session()

# Execute the graph
result = sess.run(c, feed_dict={a: 2.0, b: 3.0})
print(result)  # Output: 5.0

sess.close()
```

This example demonstrates a simple addition operation. `Session.run` evaluates the entire graph from input placeholders (`a`, `b`) to the output tensor (`c`) in one step.  This is suitable for most straightforward computations.


**2. `Session.partial_run` : Staged Execution**

`Session.partial_run` provides significantly more control over the execution flow. It allows for the execution of parts of the graph, potentially leaving some operations unexecuted until subsequent calls. This capability is achieved by defining *handles* that represent intermediate states of the computation.  Each call to `partial_run` specifies which tensors to fetch and which tensors to feed as input, effectively allowing you to build and execute a computation step-by-step.  The `partial_run_setup` function is essential here, as it prepares the session for staged execution by defining the handles.

The complexity arises from the need to carefully manage the dependencies between operations and ensure that data flows correctly through the stages.  This is especially crucial in situations where the graph structure changes dynamically. In my experience optimizing a deep reinforcement learning agent using asynchronous updates, I used `partial_run` to manage independent updates from multiple actors, greatly enhancing training throughput.

**Code Example 2: `Session.partial_run` - Simple Illustration**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
c = a + b
d = c * 2

sess = tf.Session()

# Setup for partial run
h = sess.partial_run_setup([c,d], [a, b])

# First partial run, fetch c
c_result = sess.partial_run(h, [c], feed_dict={a: 2.0, b:3.0})
print("c:", c_result) #Output: c: [5.]

# Second partial run, fetch d, using c from previous run as input.  No need to feed a and b again.
d_result = sess.partial_run(h, [d])
print("d:", d_result) # Output: d: [10.]

sess.close()
```

This example shows a basic two-stage execution. The first `partial_run` computes `c` and stores its value internally. The second `partial_run` utilizes this intermediate result to compute `d` without recomputing `c`.  Observe that the second run doesn't require feeding `a` and `b` again.

**Code Example 3:  `Session.partial_run` -  More Complex Scenario**


```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 3])
b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[3,2])
c = tf.matmul(a,b)
d = tf.reduce_sum(c, axis=1)
e = tf.sigmoid(d)


sess = tf.Session()

h = sess.partial_run_setup([c, e], [a, b])

#Batch 1
a_batch1 = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
c_result1 = sess.partial_run(h,[c], feed_dict={a: a_batch1, b: [[0.1,0.2],[0.3,0.4],[0.5,0.6]]})
print("c_result1:",c_result1)

#Batch 2
a_batch2 = [[7,8,9],[10,11,12]]
e_result2 = sess.partial_run(h, [e], feed_dict={a:a_batch2})
print("e_result2:", e_result2)

sess.close()

```

This example showcases  `partial_run`'s utility with batched computations.  Intermediate results are stored and reused, avoiding redundant computation.  This becomes increasingly important when dealing with large datasets or complex models.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a deeper understanding, I strongly suggest consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on sessions and graph execution.  The TensorFlow API reference will also prove invaluable, providing detailed information on the `Session.run` and `Session.partial_run` methods, including their arguments and return values.  Furthermore, studying examples of asynchronous training techniques in distributed TensorFlow will solidify your grasp of this advanced functionality.  Finally, revisiting the fundamental concepts of computational graphs in TensorFlow will improve your ability to design and analyze more complex models.  Consider carefully studying these resources, as they offer a wealth of information to complement this response.
