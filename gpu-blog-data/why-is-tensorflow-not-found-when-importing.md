The common 'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'' encountered when attempting to import TensorFlow in Python often stems from discrepancies in the installed Python environment and the expected TensorFlow installation location. Specifically, TensorFlow, while readily available, isn't automatically globally accessible upon installation, and this issue compounds when dealing with virtual environments or differing Python installations. I've diagnosed this countless times while building ML pipelines, and the problem usually boils down to one of a few key culprits.

Firstly, the most frequent cause is that TensorFlow was installed in a different Python environment than the one currently active. Python installations and their corresponding packages are typically isolated using virtual environments (venv, conda env, etc.). If TensorFlow was installed within a specific environment using `pip install tensorflow`, that installation is confined to that environment. If you then attempt to `import tensorflow` while another environment is active or with the system Python installation, the module will not be discoverable. This is because the `sys.path`, which dictates where Python looks for modules, is unique to each environment and reflects its installation structure. Furthermore, if TensorFlow was installed using conda, it's exclusively associated with the conda environment. This environment-specific isolation is intentional, preventing conflicts between different project dependencies, but it demands careful management.

Secondly, an incorrect TensorFlow installation method is another common issue.  TensorFlow has different CPU and GPU builds. Trying to install the GPU-enabled version without the necessary CUDA drivers and a compatible Nvidia GPU, or vice-versa, can result in installation failures or unexpected behavior. While pip generally reports a successful installation, it might not correctly place all relevant files. This can lead to TensorFlow partially being installed or having its libraries in locations Python can't find, especially on systems with multiple Python versions and installations. Furthermore, installing using `conda` channels and `pip` in the same environment can result in incompatibilities and module not found errors, as package management systems can conflict with each other.

Lastly, even if you believe the installation is correct within the right environment, an older version of Python itself might not be fully compatible with newer TensorFlow releases. While backwards compatibility exists, running, say, Python 3.7 with the latest TensorFlow is not always seamless. This can manifest in import errors, especially with very recent TensorFlow features relying on newer Python APIs or libraries not present in the older Python version. Similarly, an incorrectly configured PYTHONPATH environment variable can sometimes interfere with where Python searches for packages, although this is rarer.

To troubleshoot this, I generally start by verifying the active Python environment using `python --version` and ensuring it corresponds to the intended one.  Then, I would check if TensorFlow is installed in this environment using `pip list | grep tensorflow`. If TensorFlow isn't listed, that’s the likely culprit. If it is, I move on to more thorough checks of the installation structure, and try reinstalling tensorflow in a different environment for verification.

Here are three code examples, simulating troubleshooting situations I’ve encountered:

**Example 1: Verifying Environment and Installation**

```python
# First, verify the active environment and location
import sys
import os

print(f"Active Python executable: {sys.executable}")
print(f"Environment Variables:\n{os.environ}")

# Then, try the import
try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
    print("TensorFlow imported successfully.")
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    print("TensorFlow not found in the current environment. Check installation.")
    # List installed packages as further diagnostics
    import subprocess
    process = subprocess.run(['pip', 'list'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    print(process.stdout)


```
*Commentary:* This example first prints the location of the Python executable, providing crucial information about the active environment. It then prints out environment variables, including `PYTHONPATH`. Subsequently, it attempts the import within a `try-except` block, clearly identifying the `ModuleNotFoundError` if it occurs. Finally, it includes listing all installed packages using `pip list`, to show exactly which packages are present, providing an easy way to double-check whether tensorflow is present or not.  This combination often reveals if you are in the wrong environment or whether the package has been installed properly.

**Example 2: Using a Virtual Environment**

```python
# Create a virtual environment and activate it
# This is commonly done via terminal but can be programatically simulated here for demonstration.
# This process is highly dependent on your system, and assumes virtualenv is installed and PATH is correctly configured.
# You will need to run this code in your system terminal, not directly in the python code, since this interacts with the underlying OS.
# python -m venv venv
# source venv/bin/activate  (Linux/MacOS) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)

# After activation, run the below code
import sys
import subprocess
print(f"Active Python executable: {sys.executable}") # check if venv's Python is active
process = subprocess.run(['pip', 'install', 'tensorflow'], capture_output=True, text=True) # install tensorflow in the venv
print(f"Installation logs:\n{process.stdout}\n{process.stderr}")
try:
    import tensorflow as tf
    print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
    print("TensorFlow imported successfully within the virtual environment.")
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    print("TensorFlow not found even after installing in this environment. Further investigation needed.")
```
*Commentary:* This example demonstrates the creation of a virtual environment, and installation of tensorflow within it. The comments indicate that the environment creation/activation would usually happen in the system's terminal, not in python code. It also uses subprocess to run pip commands, to install the library. By verifying that the correct python environment is active via sys.executable, and then installing within that environment, we can confirm the steps needed to use a virtual environment for tensorflow use. The output of the `pip install` command is printed for further diagnostics. This demonstrates that ensuring the environment is active, and the package is installed within that environment is essential to resolving import issues.

**Example 3: Investigating Specific Installation Issues**

```python
# Sometimes, tensorflow will install but still not be found, if some libraries are missing, or installation has errors.
# This example is a simulation of an error, in reality it will depend on the operating system and platform.
# For example, missing dll files or corrupted installations are common causes of error.

# For illustrative purposes, consider that installation returned an error due to incomplete files being downloaded.
# The error log would typically be in the command line during installation of tensorflow.
class MockErrorLog():
  def __init__(self, success):
      self.stdout = "tensorflow installation started..."
      self.stderr = "error: some files could not be downloaded. please check internet connection." if not success else ""
      self.returncode = 1 if not success else 0
def Mock_Installation_Run(success):
    return MockErrorLog(success) # simulating pip install

process_result = Mock_Installation_Run(False)

print(f"installation results: {process_result.stdout} , {process_result.stderr}")

if process_result.returncode !=0:
    print("Tensorflow has not installed properly. Please check the error messages and reinstall.")
else:
    try:
        import tensorflow as tf
        print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
        print("TensorFlow imported successfully.")
    except ModuleNotFoundError:
        print("TensorFlow not found even after successful installation. Please check installation directories and compatibility of files.")
# Usually in real situations you will check the error messages returned during pip install
# and resolve these issues such as missing dlls or corrupted files.
```
*Commentary:* This example simulates a situation where tensorflow appears to install, but due to errors, libraries aren't correctly downloaded or placed.  By simulating an error log returned by pip, this example outlines that it is important to fully resolve installation errors that happen with `pip install`. This often means checking the log messages and ensuring that libraries are correctly downloaded, and placed in the correct directories. This is an advanced case, but it shows that even when pip is seemingly successful, underlying issues can still lead to `ModuleNotFoundError`. This example emphasizes the importance of checking both success and logs from installation tools.

For further self-directed study, several books and online documentation sources offer comprehensive information on Python environments, package management, and TensorFlow setup: “Python Crash Course” provides an accessible intro to venv, and the official TensorFlow documentation details system requirements and installation guidelines. Package management systems such as conda provide excellent documentation of their environment system. The documentation for pip is also useful in debugging specific issues that occur with that tool. Finally, reading stackoverflow Q&A threads relating to tensorflow import issues can be extremely informative, with a large range of possible user scenarios.

In summary, resolving `ModuleNotFoundError` requires systematically identifying the active Python environment, verifying the installation of TensorFlow within that specific environment, double-checking the correctness of the install via `pip list` and logs, and being aware of potential compatibility issues between the Python version and TensorFlow. The use of virtual environments, and paying attention to error messages during package installation are key to successfully using TensorFlow.
