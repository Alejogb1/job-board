TensorFlow's ability to apply a boolean mask to a variable with an unknown shape hinges on the use of `tf.boolean_mask`, coupled with a careful understanding of tensor broadcasting and shape inference.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines, particularly those involving variable-length sequences of detected objects, frequently required this functionality.  Directly applying a mask to a tensor with a completely undefined shape isn't possible; TensorFlow needs *some* shape information for efficient operation. However, leveraging symbolic shape tensors and leveraging the flexibility of broadcasting allows for handling tensors with partially or dynamically defined shapes effectively.


**1.  Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in the fact that TensorFlow's operations generally require compile-time shape information for optimization.  A completely unknown shape implies the compiler can't determine memory allocation or execution paths in advance.  However, `tf.boolean_mask` cleverly circumvents this limitation. While it *requires* the mask tensor to be the same rank as the input tensor, it handles partial shape information effectively.

This means you can't mask a tensor where *every* dimension's size is completely unknown. Instead, you must know the rank (number of dimensions).  The unknown dimensions are handled through symbolic shape tensors. These are TensorFlow tensors representing the shape of another tensor; their values are only known during runtime.

During graph construction, the shape is unknown. However, during execution, when the actual tensor values are fed into the graph, TensorFlow infers the shape from the input tensor, and the `tf.boolean_mask` operation can proceed without issues. The crucial point is that the rank must be known at graph construction time to allow TensorFlow to structure the operation correctly.  The sizes of the dimensions, however, can remain dynamically determined.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Handling Unknown Batch Size:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def mask_unknown_batch(data, mask):
    """Applies a boolean mask to a tensor with an unknown batch size.

    Args:
        data: A tensor of shape [?, feature_dim] where ? is an unknown batch size.
        mask: A boolean tensor of shape [?, 1].

    Returns:
        A masked tensor with the same feature dimension as the input data.
        Returns None if the input shapes are invalid.

    """
    data_shape = tf.shape(data)
    mask_shape = tf.shape(mask)

    # Static rank check to ensure compatible shapes
    if data.shape.rank != 2 or mask.shape.rank != 2:
        return None

    # Dynamic shape validation. This check happens during execution.
    with tf.control_dependencies([tf.assert_equal(data_shape[1], data.shape[1]), 
                                 tf.assert_equal(mask_shape[0], data_shape[0]),
                                 tf.assert_equal(mask_shape[1], 1)]):
        masked_data = tf.boolean_mask(data, tf.reshape(mask, [-1]))
        return masked_data


# Example usage:
feature_dim = 10
data_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, feature_dim])  #Unknown batch size
mask_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.bool, shape=[None,1]) # Unknown batch size, but consistent with data

masked_data_op = mask_unknown_batch(data_placeholder, mask_placeholder)

# Session execution with sample data
with tf.Session() as sess:
    data = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
            [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
            [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]]
    mask = [[True], [False], [True]]
    masked_data = sess.run(masked_data_op, feed_dict={data_placeholder: data, mask_placeholder: mask})
    print(masked_data)

```

This example demonstrates masking a tensor where only the batch size is unknown. The use of placeholders allows for dynamic batch sizes.  Crucially, the rank of both the data and the mask are known statically (2), enabling TensorFlow to construct the appropriate graph. Shape assertions are used for runtime checks, ensuring data integrity.

**Example 2:  Masking a Higher-Dimensional Tensor:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def mask_higher_dim(data, mask):
  """Masks a higher-dimensional tensor with a corresponding boolean mask."""
  # Assuming the mask matches the first dimension of the data
  masked_data = tf.boolean_mask(data, tf.reshape(mask, [-1]))
  return masked_data


#Example usage:
data = tf.constant([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]], [[9,10],[11,12]]])
mask = tf.constant([True, False, True])

masked_data_op = mask_higher_dim(data, mask)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(masked_data_op)
    print(result)

```

This shows masking a 3D tensor. The mask applies to the first dimension. While the second and third dimensions have known static shapes, the number of the first dimension is flexible.



**Example 3: Dynamically Shaped Sequence Data:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def mask_sequences(sequences, lengths):
    """Masks variable-length sequences based on their lengths.

    Args:
        sequences: A tensor of shape [batch_size, max_length, feature_dim].
        lengths: A tensor of shape [batch_size] containing sequence lengths.

    Returns:
        A masked tensor.  Returns None if input is invalid.
    """
    batch_size = tf.shape(sequences)[0]
    max_length = tf.shape(sequences)[1]

    # Create a mask
    row_indices = tf.range(batch_size)
    col_indices = lengths -1
    indices = tf.stack([row_indices, col_indices], axis=1)
    mask = tf.scatter_nd(indices, tf.ones([batch_size], dtype=tf.bool), [batch_size, max_length])
    mask = tf.logical_not(tf.cumsum(mask, axis=1, exclusive=True)) #cumulative true values are not masked

    if sequences.shape.rank != 3 or lengths.shape.rank != 1:
      return None

    masked_sequences = tf.boolean_mask(tf.reshape(sequences, [-1, sequences.shape[2]]), tf.reshape(mask, [-1]))
    return tf.reshape(masked_sequences, [-1, sequences.shape[2]])

#Example Usage
sequences = tf.constant([[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]],[[7,8],[9,10], [11,12]], [[13,14],[15,16],[17,18]]])
lengths = tf.constant([2, 3, 1])

masked_sequences_op = mask_sequences(sequences, lengths)

with tf.Session() as sess:
  result = sess.run(masked_sequences_op)
  print(result)

```

This example deals with sequence data, a common scenario in NLP and time series analysis.  The `lengths` tensor dynamically defines the valid portion of each sequence.  The mask is generated dynamically based on these lengths.  The reshaping is crucial to handle the variable-length sequences within the `tf.boolean_mask` function.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation.  A good introductory text on deep learning with TensorFlow.  Advanced TensorFlow tutorials focusing on custom operations and graph manipulation.


In summary, while TensorFlow requires some shape information for efficient computation, using `tf.boolean_mask` with symbolic shape tensors and careful shape management allows the application of boolean masks to tensors with partially unknown shapes, especially those with a known rank.  The examples highlight diverse scenarios where this approach proves highly effective.  Remember, thorough understanding of tensor broadcasting and shape inference is vital for utilizing this capability effectively and avoiding runtime errors.
