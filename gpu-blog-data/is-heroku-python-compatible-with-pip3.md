Heroku's Python support relies on a buildpack system, which fundamentally differentiates its approach from directly invoking `pip3` on a local machine.  While the end result – installing Python packages – is the same, the underlying mechanism is crucial to understanding compatibility.  My experience deploying numerous Python applications to Heroku has highlighted the subtle yet significant differences.  Directly executing `pip3` within a Heroku application's runtime is generally discouraged and rarely necessary.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Heroku's Python buildpack manages the installation and configuration of Python and its dependencies.  It utilizes a `requirements.txt` file, which acts as a definitive list of project dependencies.  This file dictates which packages are installed during the build process.  The buildpack implicitly uses `pip` (the version specified by the buildpack, usually a relatively recent stable version) to install packages listed in `requirements.txt`.  Therefore, while you don't explicitly call `pip3` in your application code or during deployment, the process inherently utilizes a `pip` equivalent to manage the dependencies.  The buildpack abstracts away the direct interaction with the system's `pip` installation, ensuring consistency and portability across different Heroku environments.

Attempting to directly use `pip3` within the application's runtime, rather than relying on the `requirements.txt` file managed by the buildpack, can lead to several issues:

* **Dependency Conflicts:**  The packages installed during the build process might clash with those installed directly during runtime.  This can result in unpredictable application behavior and runtime errors.
* **Unforeseen Buildpack Behavior:**  The buildpack might interpret or override the changes made by the runtime `pip3` calls, rendering them ineffective or counterproductive.
* **Deployment Inconsistencies:**  The application's behavior might vary across different deployments or instances due to differing `pip3` versions or system configurations on the Heroku dynos.

The recommended and reliable approach is to exclusively manage dependencies using `requirements.txt`. This ensures consistent and reproducible deployments.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Correct Dependency Management**

```python
# myapp.py (Application code)
import requests

# ... rest of application code ...
```

```
# requirements.txt
requests==2.31.0
```

This is the standard and recommended approach.  The `requirements.txt` file explicitly states the `requests` package and its version. The Heroku buildpack will automatically install this package during deployment, resolving any dependency conflicts.  The `myapp.py` file then simply imports and uses the package without needing to worry about its installation.


**Example 2:  Incorrect use of pip3 during runtime (avoid this)**

```python
# myapp.py (Application code)
import subprocess

# ... other code ...

try:
    subprocess.run(['pip3', 'install', 'somepackage'], check=True)
    import somepackage
    # ... use somepackage ...
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error installing somepackage: {e}")
```

This example directly uses `subprocess` to attempt installing `somepackage` at runtime.  This is strongly discouraged.  It's prone to failures due to permission issues, dependency conflicts, and inconsistency across deployments.  The buildpack will not account for this runtime installation.


**Example 3:  Indirect Package Management (via a setup.py, less preferred):**

```python
# setup.py
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='myapp',
    version='1.0',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        'requests==2.31.0',
    ],
)
```

While using a `setup.py` file allows for more complex package management, it is still generally preferred to use `requirements.txt` for Heroku deployments due to its simplicity and the buildpack's optimized handling. This example demonstrates using `install_requires` within `setup.py` which accomplishes similar dependency management to the `requirements.txt` approach but introduces extra complexity unnecessarily for most Heroku Python applications.  The Heroku buildpack can interpret this to correctly install the required packages.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Heroku Dev Center documentation on deploying Python applications.  Reviewing materials on Python packaging and virtual environments is valuable for enhancing general understanding of package management. Consult the documentation for the specific Python version your project utilizes, paying attention to potential differences in package compatibility.  Finally, becoming familiar with different buildpack mechanisms and their functionalities is beneficial for advanced deployment scenarios.
