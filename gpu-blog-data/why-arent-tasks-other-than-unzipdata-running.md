The observed behavior, where only the `unzip_data` task executes within a larger workflow, strongly suggests a dependency management or task execution logic issue within the implemented framework, specifically concerning how tasks are defined and triggered relative to each other. This typically arises when tasks lack explicitly defined relationships or are not correctly registered as members of an executable workflow sequence.

My experience frequently points to two primary causes: implicit dependency assumptions and incorrect task registration. Implicit assumptions occur when developers rely on the order in which tasks are *defined* rather than explicitly specifying *execution* order. For instance, if a task like `process_data` needs the output of `unzip_data`, it’s not sufficient for `process_data` to simply appear later in the code. It must *declare* `unzip_data` as a prerequisite. Secondly, many task orchestration systems require explicit registration of tasks within a graph or execution plan. If a task isn’t registered, the system will not even consider it a part of the workflow.

Let's delve into these problems with some code examples. Consider this scenario representing the setup:

```python
# Example 1: Implicit dependency, no registration

import time

class Task:
    def __init__(self, name, action):
        self.name = name
        self.action = action

    def run(self):
        print(f"Running task: {self.name}")
        self.action()

def unzip_data():
    time.sleep(1) #Simulates work
    print("Data unzipped")
    return "/path/to/unzipped/data"

def process_data(data_path):
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Data processed from: {data_path}")
    return "/path/to/processed/data"

def save_results(processed_data_path):
    time.sleep(1)
    print(f"Results saved from: {processed_data_path}")

tasks = [
    Task("unzip", unzip_data),
    Task("process", lambda: process_data("/path/to/unzipped/data")), # BAD - relying on the return of unzip_data being available
    Task("save", lambda: save_results("/path/to/processed/data")) # BAD - relying on the return of process_data being available
]

for task in tasks:
    task.run()
```

Here, the execution appears to occur sequentially based on the `tasks` list. `unzip_data` executes as expected. However, neither `process_data` nor `save_results` functions correctly because they rely on the string literals "/path/to/unzipped/data" and "/path/to/processed/data," respectively, instead of the actual results of the preceding tasks. The output of `unzip_data` is not captured and passed to `process_data`, and likewise for `process_data` and `save_results`. The key issue is that the `process_data` and `save_results` tasks are defined as lambda functions that are executed in the `Task.run()` context; however, this executes those lamdas, but the arguments passed to the functions in the lambdas are all static string values. There is no dependency specified between `unzip_data`, `process_data`, and `save_results`. Additionally, nothing makes this set of tasks a "workflow." This means, it is not clear if there is any explicit notion of "task registration" and that this is why the functions are executing, not because of a registered workflow mechanism. It's only due to a linear sequence.

Now, let's move to a more structured approach using a minimal "task registry" concept:

```python
# Example 2: Simple task registry with manual dependency management

import time

class Task:
    def __init__(self, name, action, dependencies=None):
        self.name = name
        self.action = action
        self.dependencies = dependencies or []
        self.result = None

    def run(self, results):
        print(f"Running task: {self.name}")
        dependency_results = {dep: results[dep] for dep in self.dependencies}
        if dependency_results:
             self.result = self.action(**dependency_results)
        else:
            self.result = self.action()
        return self.result

def unzip_data():
    time.sleep(1)
    print("Data unzipped")
    return "/path/to/unzipped/data"

def process_data(data_path):
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Data processed from: {data_path}")
    return "/path/to/processed/data"

def save_results(processed_data_path):
    time.sleep(1)
    print(f"Results saved from: {processed_data_path}")

tasks = {
  "unzip": Task("unzip", unzip_data),
  "process": Task("process", process_data, dependencies=["unzip"]),
  "save": Task("save", save_results, dependencies=["process"])
}

results = {}
for task_name, task in tasks.items():
  if task.dependencies and not all(dep in results for dep in task.dependencies):
       print(f"Skipping {task_name}. Dependencies not yet resolved.")
       continue
  results[task_name] = task.run(results)
```

In this version, the `Task` class now tracks dependencies. When a task is executed using the `run()` method, it checks if the specified dependencies are already in `results` and fetches corresponding results to pass to the action. We are iterating through the task dictionary until all tasks resolve. Importantly, tasks are referenced using the `tasks` dictionary and *keys*.  This implements a minimal task registration scheme where task names are used to determine whether they have been executed already. Tasks are no longer running linearly as in the prior example. Instead, the `process` task declares its dependency on `unzip` via the dependencies kwarg passed to its constructor, and `save` declares its dependency on `process` in the same way. The tasks will attempt to execute repeatedly until their dependencies are met and each task runs. However, note that we are using string identifiers to lookup the results of other tasks using the `results` dictionary - which could be problematic in large applications.

Finally, consider a more elaborate setup using a hypothetical `Workflow` class:

```python
# Example 3: Task Registration with Workflow Class

import time
from collections import defaultdict

class Task:
    def __init__(self, name, action, dependencies=None, output_name=None):
        self.name = name
        self.action = action
        self.dependencies = dependencies or []
        self.output_name = output_name if output_name else name
        self.result = None

    def run(self, results):
        print(f"Running task: {self.name}")
        dependency_results = {dep: results[dep] for dep in self.dependencies}
        if dependency_results:
            self.result = self.action(**dependency_results)
        else:
           self.result = self.action()
        return self.output_name, self.result

class Workflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = {}
        self.dependency_graph = defaultdict(list)

    def register_task(self, task):
        self.tasks[task.name] = task
        for dep in task.dependencies:
           self.dependency_graph[dep].append(task.name)

    def run(self):
      results = {}
      completed = set()
      while len(completed) < len(self.tasks):
         for task_name, task in self.tasks.items():
           if task_name in completed:
               continue
           if all (dep in results for dep in task.dependencies):
             output_name, result = task.run(results)
             results[output_name] = result
             completed.add(task_name)
      return results

def unzip_data():
    time.sleep(1)
    print("Data unzipped")
    return "/path/to/unzipped/data"

def process_data(data_path):
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Data processed from: {data_path}")
    return "/path/to/processed/data"

def save_results(processed_data_path):
    time.sleep(1)
    print(f"Results saved from: {processed_data_path}")

workflow = Workflow()
unzip_task = Task("unzip", unzip_data, output_name="unzipped_data")
process_task = Task("process", process_data, dependencies=["unzipped_data"], output_name="processed_data")
save_task = Task("save", save_results, dependencies=["processed_data"])
workflow.register_task(unzip_task)
workflow.register_task(process_task)
workflow.register_task(save_task)

workflow_results = workflow.run()
```

In this version, the `Workflow` class now explicitly handles task registration using `register_task`. The `Workflow` maintains its own notion of "completed" tasks to keep track of what has executed already. We use the `output_name` kwarg of the task to specify that the `unzip` task should produce an output named `"unzipped_data"` and that the `process` task should depend on this specific name. This approach provides greater clarity and robustness over the prior two examples. The dependency graph ensures correct sequencing by only running a task if all its dependencies have been executed already. The use of a Workflow class to manage task execution and resolve dependencies using names makes it easier to observe how these features work in practice.

Based on these examples, I would recommend a thorough review of the task dependency definitions within your implementation. Ensure that: 1) each task requiring a result from a previous task explicitly declares this dependency. 2) tasks are properly registered with the execution system or workflow manager. Finally, I would look at the way that the results of prior tasks are referenced. If strings are used, they are not able to contain dynamic results and are most likely static values. Consider adopting a workflow pattern using the task-based dependency graph approach shown above.

For further study, resources covering workflow engines and task scheduling patterns are beneficial. Specifically, exploring directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and how they are used in workflow orchestration is useful. Researching libraries like Airflow, Prefect, or Luigi – even without directly using them – will provide useful insights into the core concepts of dependency management. Books on system design patterns can also be of considerable help to design robust workflows. Finally, documentation for the specific task execution system you are utilizing is the most immediately relevant source of information.
