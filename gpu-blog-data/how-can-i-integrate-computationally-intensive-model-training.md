Integrating computationally intensive model training within a FastAPI endpoint requires careful consideration of asynchronous processing and resource management.  My experience developing high-throughput machine learning services has highlighted the critical need to decouple the training process from the request-response cycle to prevent blocking the FastAPI server.  Directly executing training within the endpoint leads to poor scalability and unresponsive applications.  The solution lies in leveraging asynchronous task queues and appropriate resource allocation strategies.

**1.  Explanation: Architecting for Asynchronous Training**

The core principle is to design a system where the FastAPI endpoint accepts a training request, delegates it to a background task, and returns an acknowledgment to the client. The client then periodically polls for the training status or receives a notification upon completion.  This avoids tying up the main thread responsible for handling incoming requests.  Efficient implementation requires the following components:

* **FastAPI Endpoint:** This serves as the entry point, receiving training parameters from the client.  It's crucial that this endpoint be lightweight and rapidly return a response, indicating request acceptance.  This allows for horizontal scaling of the API itself.

* **Asynchronous Task Queue:** This is the workhorse, managing the execution of computationally intensive training jobs.  Popular choices include Celery, RQ, or Redis Queue. These queues offer mechanisms for queuing tasks, distributing them across worker processes or machines, and monitoring their progress.  Selection depends on project-specific needs like scalability requirements and existing infrastructure.

* **Worker Processes:** These are independent processes dedicated to executing training tasks retrieved from the queue. The number of worker processes should be adjusted based on available computational resources (CPU cores, GPU availability) to maximize throughput without overwhelming the system.  Efficient resource utilization is key; oversubscription leads to performance degradation, while undersubscription leaves resources idle.

* **Result Storage and Retrieval:** A database or file system is needed to store training results and their associated status.  The API can then query this storage to provide the client with updates on the training progress.  The choice of storage mechanism depends on factors like data size, access patterns, and desired consistency levels.  Consider solutions like databases optimized for time series data or cloud-based storage solutions.

* **Progress Monitoring and Reporting:**  The system should provide mechanisms to monitor the progress of training jobs and provide feedback to the client. This may involve periodic updates through the API, webhooks, or a dedicated monitoring dashboard.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

These examples use Celery, a widely adopted task queue.  Adaptations for other systems would require modifying the queue interaction.  The underlying training process is simplified for illustrative purposes.


**Example 1: FastAPI Endpoint (Python)**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks
from celery import Celery

app = FastAPI()
celery = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0') # Replace with your broker

@celery.task(name='train_model')
def train_model(training_data):
    # Simulate computationally intensive training
    # Replace with your actual model training code
    import time
    time.sleep(10)  # Simulate 10 seconds of training
    return {"status": "complete", "model": "trained_model"}

@app.post("/train/")
async def train(training_data: dict, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    task = train_model.delay(training_data)
    return {"task_id": task.id}

@app.get("/status/{task_id}")
async def get_status(task_id: str):
    task = train_model.AsyncResult(task_id)
    if task.status == 'PENDING':
        return {"status": "pending"}
    elif task.status != 'FAILURE':
        return {"status": task.status, "result": task.result}
    else:
        return {"status": "failure", "error": task.result}

```

This example defines a FastAPI endpoint that accepts training data, schedules the training using Celery's `delay` method, and returns a task ID. A separate endpoint retrieves the task status and result.


**Example 2: Celery Task (Python)**

```python
# This is within the celery task definition (from Example 1)

    import time
    time.sleep(10) # Simulate 10 seconds of training

    # Replace with your actual model training code
    # Example using scikit-learn
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(training_data['features'], training_data['labels'])
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    # ... further model evaluation and saving ...

    return {"status": "complete", "model": "trained_model"} # Or save the model to a persistent location

```

This excerpt shows a placeholder for the actual training logic.  Remember to replace this with your specific model training code and handle potential exceptions appropriately.  Consider saving the trained model to a persistent storage location instead of returning it directly.


**Example 3:  Client-side interaction (Conceptual Python)**

```python
import requests
import time

task_id = requests.post("http://your-api-url/train/", json={"features": features, "labels": labels}).json()['task_id']

while True:
  status = requests.get(f"http://your-api-url/status/{task_id}").json()
  if status['status'] == 'complete':
    print("Training complete!")
    break
  elif status['status'] == 'failure':
    print("Training failed!")
    break
  time.sleep(5) # Poll every 5 seconds

```

This illustrates how a client might interact with the API, submitting a training request and periodically checking its status until completion or failure.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For detailed explanations of Celery's functionalities and configuration, consult the official Celery documentation.  For efficient data storage and retrieval, explore the capabilities of PostgreSQL, particularly its extensions for handling large datasets and time-series data.  In the context of distributed training, investigate frameworks like Ray, which provides tools for parallel and distributed computing.  Thoroughly evaluate the performance characteristics of different database solutions before making a choice for your result storage.  Understanding asynchronous programming concepts and principles is crucial for effectively implementing this architecture.  Finally, consider using a monitoring tool to track the performance of your API and the workers in your task queue.  This will help with troubleshooting and identifying potential bottlenecks.
