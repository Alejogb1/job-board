The optimal episode length and `train_batch_size` for RLlib's Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm are not fixed values; they are highly dependent on the specific environment's characteristics and the desired trade-off between training speed and performance.  My experience tuning hyperparameters across numerous reinforcement learning projects, including complex robotics simulations and resource-intensive game environments, has shown that a systematic approach, rather than relying on heuristics, is crucial for finding the best configuration.

**1. Explanation of Interdependence and Optimization Strategies**

The episode length dictates the amount of experience collected before an update to the policy.  Shorter episodes lead to more frequent updates, potentially accelerating learning, especially in environments with rapid feedback. However, excessively short episodes can result in high variance in the training signal, hindering convergence and leading to suboptimal policies.  Conversely, longer episodes provide more stable learning signals but might slow down the training process because updates become less frequent.  The optimal episode length should strike a balance between these competing factors.

`train_batch_size` determines the amount of data used to update the policy in each iteration.  A larger batch size reduces the variance in gradient estimations, potentially leading to smoother and more stable training. However, this comes at the cost of increased computational requirements and slower updates.  Smaller batch sizes are computationally cheaper, allowing for more frequent updates, but they might result in noisy gradients and slower convergence.

The interplay between episode length and `train_batch_size` is significant.  A large `train_batch_size` necessitates a longer episode length to accumulate sufficient data, otherwise, the policy updates become overly reliant on a small sample of experience, negatively impacting its convergence properties. Similarly, short episodes necessitate smaller `train_batch_size` values.  Therefore, optimization should not treat these hyperparameters independently.

Effective optimization strategies involve systematic experimentation using techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization.  I've found Bayesian optimization, particularly using libraries like Optuna, to be particularly effective in navigating the complex hyperparameter landscape of RLlib PPO. It intelligently explores the hyperparameter space, significantly reducing the number of evaluations needed compared to exhaustive grid search.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate how to configure these hyperparameters within an RLlib PPO training configuration.  These are illustrative and should be adapted based on the specific environment and computational resources.

**Example 1:  A Baseline Configuration**

```python
import ray
from ray import tune

ray.init()

tune.run(
    "PPO",
    stop={"training_iteration": 100},
    config={
        "env": "CartPole-v1",
        "framework": "torch",  # or "tf"
        "num_workers": 4,  # Adjust based on your system
        "lr": 5e-5,  # Learning rate
        "gamma": 0.99,  # Discount factor
        "horizon": 200,  # Episode length
        "train_batch_size": 4000,  # Batch size
    },
}
```

This example uses a relatively standard configuration for the CartPole environment.  The `horizon` parameter sets the episode length to 200, meaning each episode terminates after 200 time steps.  `train_batch_size` is set to 4000, ensuring a sufficient number of samples for each policy update.  The `num_workers` parameter defines the number of parallel workers for data collection.  This should be adjusted based on available CPU cores.

**Example 2:  Exploring Shorter Episodes and Smaller Batch Sizes**

```python
import ray
from ray import tune

ray.init()

tune.run(
    "PPO",
    stop={"training_iteration": 100},
    config={
        "env": "CartPole-v1",
        "framework": "torch",
        "num_workers": 4,
        "lr": 5e-5,
        "gamma": 0.99,
        "horizon": 50,  # Shorter episode length
        "train_batch_size": 1000,  # Smaller batch size
    },
)
```

This configuration explores the effect of shorter episodes (50 steps) and smaller batch sizes (1000 samples).  This setup is computationally less expensive per iteration, enabling more frequent policy updates.  However, we might observe increased variance in training progress.

**Example 3:  Parameter Sweeping with Tune**

```python
import ray
from ray import tune

ray.init()

tune.run(
    "PPO",
    stop={"training_iteration": 100},
    config={
        "env": "CartPole-v1",
        "framework": "torch",
        "num_workers": 4,
        "lr": tune.loguniform(1e-5, 1e-3),
        "gamma": 0.99,
        "horizon": tune.choice([50, 100, 200]),  # Sweeping episode length
        "train_batch_size": tune.choice([1000, 2000, 4000]),  # Sweeping batch size
    },
)
```

This example demonstrates using Tune's capabilities for hyperparameter sweeping.  It systematically explores different combinations of `horizon` and `train_batch_size`, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of optimal configurations.  The `tune.choice` and `tune.loguniform` functions allow for efficient exploration of the hyperparameter space.  This is far more effective than manual experimentation.  Remember to monitor training curves to identify successful parameter combinations.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For efficient hyperparameter tuning, utilize a robust experimentation platform that facilitates parallel execution and result tracking.  Consider using tools designed for managing and analyzing large-scale experiments.  Furthermore, employ a visualization tool capable of handling multi-dimensional data to effectively compare the performance across various configurations.  Finally, meticulous documentation of your experimental setup and results is crucial for reproducibility and future analysis.  Employ version control for all your code and configuration files.
