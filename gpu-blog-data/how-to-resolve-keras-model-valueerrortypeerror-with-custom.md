Keras model errors arising from custom layers, specifically `ValueError` or `TypeError`, frequently stem from mismatches between the layer's expected input shape and what is actually provided, or incorrect handling of TensorFlow operations within the layer's logic. Based on my experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, these errors typically manifest during model instantiation, compilation, or during the forward pass (training or inference). They are rarely simple, often requiring careful inspection of both the custom layer definition and how it interacts with the surrounding model.

The primary source of `ValueError` in this context is an inconsistency in the tensor shapes being passed to the custom layer's `call()` method, or within the internal operations of that method. Tensor dimensions may be mismatched due to incorrect application of reshaping, transposition, or broadcast operations. Consider a scenario where a convolutional layer outputting a 4D tensor (batch_size, height, width, channels) is fed into a custom layer that expects a 3D tensor. This shape disagreement will trigger a `ValueError`, even if the numerical values are compatible. Similarly, using incorrect `tf.reshape` operations inside the custom layer, or operations that change the shape where not intended, will produce this error.

`TypeError` generally points to incompatible data types passed to custom layers or operations inside the layer. A common scenario is when a custom layer expects a TensorFlow tensor (`tf.Tensor`) but receives something else, for example, a NumPy array or a Python scalar. This mismatch arises most frequently when data preprocessing steps are not appropriately converting inputs to the correct tensor type or if the layer's internal computations inadvertently return a non-tensor value. A less obvious issue arises when gradients are calculated during training. Operations that are not fully defined within TensorFlow’s computational graph will not compute valid gradients, leading to `TypeError` during backpropagation.

A solid understanding of TensorFlow’s tensor manipulation and the Keras API’s expected behavior is crucial to diagnosing these error types. It requires carefully stepping through your code to see precisely what type and shape of data your layer is receiving and outputting. Debugging custom layers can be made simpler by validating the shapes within the `call` method itself using `tf.shape` and `tf.debugging.assert_equal`, allowing you to catch issues before they cascade and become harder to isolate.

Here are some concrete examples and approaches I have found effective in resolving these errors:

**Example 1: Shape Mismatch (ValueError)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class CustomLayer1(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer1, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                 initializer='random_normal',
                                 trainable=True)
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                 initializer='zeros',
                                 trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Expected a 2D tensor, but might receive a higher dimensional one.
        # Assume the input is meant to be flattened.
        inputs_flat = tf.reshape(inputs, [-1, tf.shape(inputs)[-1]])
        return tf.matmul(inputs_flat, self.w) + self.b

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),  # Flatten before CustomLayer1
    CustomLayer1(10) # Correctly expects a 2D tensor after Flatten.
])

# Without the Flatten(), the CustomLayer would have a Shape ValueError.
# model = keras.Sequential([
#     keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
#     CustomLayer1(10) # Incorrect: Shape mismatch. CustomLayer1 expects 2D, given 4D.
# ])

# Example Usage:
dummy_input = tf.random.normal((1, 28, 28, 1))
output = model(dummy_input)
print(output.shape)
```

In this example, `CustomLayer1` expects a 2D tensor because it performs a matrix multiplication. If we directly feed the output of the convolutional layer, which is a 4D tensor, we'd get a `ValueError`. The `Flatten` layer resizes the tensor into 2D (batch_size, flattened_features), which `CustomLayer1` can then handle correctly. If the `Flatten` layer was removed, a `ValueError` would be thrown by the matrix multiplication inside `call`. In the given code the input will pass successfully, however, as the `Flatten` is included. Adding a `tf.print` statement at the start of the `call()` method inside the custom layer with `tf.shape(inputs)` will greatly aid debugging this kind of error.

**Example 2: Data Type Mismatch (TypeError)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

class CustomLayer2(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, scale, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer2, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.scale = scale

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Incorrect: Assuming `scale` is a tensor for element-wise multiplication, but it's a Python scalar.
        # return inputs * self.scale  # TypeError when trying to compute gradient.
        # Correct: Use `tf.multiply` or `tf.constant` to make `scale` a Tensor.
        return inputs * tf.constant(self.scale, dtype=inputs.dtype)


model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    CustomLayer2(2.0) # scale is a python scalar.
])

# Example Usage:
dummy_input = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
output = model(dummy_input)
print(output.shape)

# Training example to demonstrate the gradient failure.
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.01)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()
dummy_target = tf.random.normal((1, 10))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    output = model(dummy_input)
    loss = loss_fn(dummy_target, output)
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

# Uncomment the incorrect line of code in `CustomLayer2` to observe the TypeError during backpropagation.
# The correct implementation uses tf.multiply which is gradient-aware.
```

Here, the initial code in the `call` function is incorrect: performing element-wise multiplication with a non-Tensor `scale` parameter directly (a float) causes a `TypeError` during backpropagation. By casting `scale` to a Tensor and using the `tf.multiply` operation, we resolve the `TypeError`.  The corrected example shows a successful training process. The core issue is that operations within a layer must be TensorFlow operations to enable the backpropagation. A simple multiplication between a Python float and a tensor will break the computational graph required to calculate gradients.

**Example 3: Incorrect Reshape and Tensor Dimension (ValueError):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class CustomLayer3(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, new_shape, **kwargs):
        super(CustomLayer3, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.new_shape = new_shape

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Incorrect: Incorrect reshaping due to misunderstanding of `tf.shape` semantics
        # reshaped = tf.reshape(inputs, [tf.shape(inputs)[0]] + self.new_shape)

        #Correct: Use batch size as the first dimension and the provided new_shape.
        batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[0]
        reshaped = tf.reshape(inputs, tf.concat([[batch_size],self.new_shape], axis=0))

        return reshaped

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    CustomLayer3([2, 5]), # Attempting to reshape the output from the dense layer to 2x5.
    keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='relu')
])


# Example Usage:
dummy_input = tf.random.normal((2, 10)) # Modified to have batch size > 1.
output = model(dummy_input)
print(output.shape)

# Incorrect implementation with incorrect tensor dimension throws a ValueError.
```

In this example, `CustomLayer3` is intended to reshape the incoming tensor. However, the initial reshaping logic incorrectly attempts to combine the existing batch size with a new set of shapes which will result in an invalid size.  The corrected reshaping concatenates the input batch size with the provided custom size using `tf.concat`. The incorrect implementation which uses `[tf.shape(inputs)[0]]` will result in errors when batch_size is not 1, since it is used to explicitly define the size of the tensor. While the layer is still performing a reshape operation, it needs to ensure it retains the batch dimension properly.

To further aid in debugging, I suggest using the `tf.debugging.assert_equal` function within the `build` and `call` methods to explicitly check the shapes of tensors after crucial operations. Additionally, setting breakpoints using an integrated development environment (IDE) with debugging support will allow you to step through your code line by line and inspect the values of tensors. The TensorFlow documentation is essential, especially the sections dealing with custom layers and tensor manipulation. Understanding the difference between element-wise and matrix operations, and carefully reading the documentation for the relevant TensorFlow functions is crucial. Lastly, I've found that a combination of unit tests for the custom layer's forward pass and gradient calculation is often necessary to fully validate the layer, especially for complex internal operations.
