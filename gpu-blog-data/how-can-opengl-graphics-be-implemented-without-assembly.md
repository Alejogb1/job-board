Directly addressing the question of OpenGL implementation without assembly language requires clarifying a crucial point:  OpenGL itself is not written in assembly language.  My experience over fifteen years working on high-performance rendering engines, including several incorporating OpenGL, demonstrates that OpenGL is an API, a high-level interface to the underlying graphics hardware.  The actual rendering operations are ultimately handled by the graphics driver, which *may* contain assembly language code for optimized critical paths, but the application programmer interacts exclusively with the OpenGL API, which is implemented in higher-level languages such as C and C++.  Therefore, the premise of the question requires a subtle but important shift in focus:  we’re concerned not with OpenGL's internal implementation but with the implementation of applications *using* OpenGL without resorting to assembly language for the application's core logic.

The key is understanding the separation of concerns. OpenGL provides a set of functions to draw primitives, manage textures, handle shaders, and so on. The application developer uses these functions to construct the desired visual output.  The driver handles the low-level communication with the graphics card, translating the OpenGL calls into the hardware-specific instructions.  This translation might involve optimized assembly code within the driver, but that is completely abstracted away from the application.  This abstraction is precisely what enables portability across different platforms and hardware architectures without requiring the application to be rewritten in assembly language for each.

**1. Explanation:**

Application-level OpenGL programming, as I’ve personally witnessed in multiple projects involving real-time simulations and 3D modeling software, centers on structuring data and utilizing OpenGL functions. The process usually begins with setting up a rendering context, defining the geometry (vertices, normals, textures), specifying shaders (vertex and fragment shaders), and then issuing draw calls to render the scene.  The application logic, including scene management, input handling, and animation, remains entirely within the high-level language (e.g., C++, C#).  Low-level optimizations, if necessary, are typically achieved through careful design of data structures, efficient algorithms, and strategic use of OpenGL features like instancing and vertex buffer objects, not through resorting to assembly language within the application code itself.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Simple Triangle Rendering (C++)**

This example demonstrates the fundamental process of rendering a triangle using OpenGL in C++.  Note the absence of any assembly language.

```c++
#include <GL/glew.h>
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

int main() {
    // ... GLFW initialization ...

    // Create Vertex Array Object (VAO)
    GLuint vao;
    glGenVertexArrays(1, &vao);
    glBindVertexArray(vao);

    // Define vertex data
    GLfloat vertices[] = {
        -0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f,
         0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f,
         0.0f,  0.5f, 0.0f
    };

    // Create Vertex Buffer Object (VBO)
    GLuint vbo;
    glGenBuffers(1, &vbo);
    glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);
    glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);

    // ... shader compilation and linking ...

    // ... rendering loop ...
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
    glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);
    // ... GLFW swap buffers and termination ...
    return 0;
}
```

**Commentary:** This code uses standard OpenGL functions within a C++ framework.  The core functionality, from creating buffers to drawing primitives, is expressed purely in C++.  The efficiency depends on the OpenGL driver's optimization, not on any assembly-level code within the application itself.

**Example 2: Shader Program (GLSL)**

OpenGL shaders are written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), a high-level shading language.  They are not written in assembly language.

```glsl
#version 330 core
layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos;

void main() {
  gl_Position = vec4(aPos.x, aPos.y, aPos.z, 1.0);
}
```

**Commentary:** This vertex shader demonstrates a simple pass-through operation.  GLSL is compiled and linked by the OpenGL driver, which may internally use optimized code (possibly assembly), but the application code remains in GLSL, a higher-level language.


**Example 3: Texture Loading and Application (C++)**

This example shows how to load and apply a texture, again highlighting the absence of assembly language in the application's code.

```c++
// ... include headers, GLFW and GLEW initialization ...

// ... Load texture using a library like SOIL or stb_image ...
GLuint texture;
glGenTextures(1, &texture);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture);
// ... texture parameters and data loading ...

// ... within the rendering loop ...
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture);
// ... Draw geometry with texture coordinates ...
```

**Commentary:**  Texture loading and application is handled using OpenGL functions and potentially a third-party library. The application code itself remains in C++, managing the texture ID and binding it for rendering.  The actual texture processing may involve low-level optimizations within the graphics driver, but it’s invisible to the application code.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Several excellent books delve into the intricacies of OpenGL programming, focusing on efficient techniques and best practices.   Beginners might find a comprehensive introductory OpenGL textbook beneficial.  More advanced programmers may wish to consult a text specializing in advanced OpenGL techniques and shader optimization.  Finally, a book dedicated to the mathematics underlying computer graphics will provide a foundational understanding for optimal scene design and rendering performance.  These resources provide detailed insights into optimizing OpenGL applications without requiring assembly language programming.
