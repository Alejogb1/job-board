The most significant factor determining the speed of writing large Fortran arrays to a file is minimizing I/O operations.  Direct, unformatted writing offers the best performance gains, particularly when dealing with datasets exceeding available memory.  My experience optimizing high-performance computing codes for climate modeling simulations has shown a consistent advantage in this approach over formatted writing and other methods.

**1.  Explanation: Unformatted Direct Access**

Fortran's unformatted I/O offers substantial performance benefits over formatted I/O for large array writing.  Formatted I/O involves significant overhead due to the conversion of numerical data into human-readable strings. This process is computationally expensive and becomes a major bottleneck when dealing with millions or billions of data points. Unformatted I/O, conversely, writes the raw binary representation of the data directly to the file, bypassing this conversion entirely.

Further optimizing this approach requires the use of direct access.  Sequential access, the default mode in Fortran, involves writing data sequentially from the beginning of the file. This leads to inefficient disk access patterns if you need to append data to the end of a large file; the system might need to read through the entire file to reach the end.  Direct access, however, allows you to specify the record number, enabling random access to specific parts of the file. This feature is crucial when writing large arrays to pre-allocated files or for updating specific sections without overwriting the entire dataset.  Using direct access coupled with unformatted I/O minimizes seek time and maximizes throughput, especially on disk systems with limitations on seek operations.

The choice of file system also influences performance. Network file systems (NFS) are generally slower than local file systems. For optimal performance with large arrays, consider using a local file system and potentially leveraging features like asynchronous I/O (though this adds complexity and may not always yield significant gains depending on your system architecture and workload).


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Here are three examples illustrating different aspects of fast array writing in Fortran, progressing from a basic example to more advanced techniques incorporating optimized data types and error handling.

**Example 1: Basic Unformatted Direct Access**

```fortran
program write_array
  implicit none
  integer, parameter :: array_size = 1000000
  real(kind=8), dimension(array_size) :: my_array
  integer :: i, iostat, file_unit
  integer :: recl
  
  ! Initialize the array (replace with your actual data)
  do i = 1, array_size
    my_array(i) = i * 1.0d0
  enddo

  !Open file for unformatted direct access, calculate record length
  recl = array_size * 8
  open(unit=10, file='large_array.bin', access='direct', recl=recl, form='unformatted', iostat=iostat)
  if(iostat /= 0) then
    print*, "Error opening file:", iostat
    stop
  endif

  ! Write the array to the file
  write(10, rec=1) my_array

  ! Close the file
  close(10, iostat=iostat)
  if(iostat /= 0) then
    print*, "Error closing file:", iostat
    stop
  endif

end program write_array
```

This example demonstrates the basic principles of unformatted direct access. The `recl` parameter specifies the record length in bytes, which is crucial for direct access. The `rec=1` argument in the `write` statement indicates that the array is written to the first record. Error handling using `iostat` is included to manage potential file system errors.


**Example 2: Using Optimized Data Types**

```fortran
program write_array_optimized
  implicit none
  integer, parameter :: array_size = 1000000
  real(kind=4), dimension(array_size) :: my_array  !Use single-precision
  integer :: i, iostat, file_unit
  integer :: recl

  ! Initialize the array (replace with your actual data)
  do i = 1, array_size
    my_array(i) = i * 1.0
  enddo

  recl = array_size * 4
  open(unit=10, file='large_array_optimized.bin', access='direct', recl=recl, form='unformatted',iostat=iostat)
  if(iostat /= 0) then
    print*, "Error opening file:", iostat
    stop
  endif

  write(10, rec=1) my_array
  close(10, iostat=iostat)
  if(iostat /= 0) then
    print*, "Error closing file:", iostat
    stop
  endif

end program write_array_optimized
```

This variation uses `real(kind=4)` to reduce the size of the array elements, thus decreasing the overall file size and potentially improving I/O performance.  The trade-off is reduced precision, which might be acceptable depending on the application's requirements.


**Example 3:  Handling Larger Arrays Across Multiple Records**

```fortran
program write_large_array
  implicit none
  integer, parameter :: array_size = 100000000  !Much larger array
  integer, parameter :: record_size = 1000000
  real(kind=8), dimension(record_size) :: array_chunk
  real(kind=8), dimension(array_size) :: my_array
  integer :: i, j, iostat, file_unit, num_records, recl
  
  ! Initialize array
  do i = 1, array_size
    my_array(i) = i * 1.0d0
  enddo

  recl = record_size * 8
  num_records = ceiling(real(array_size) / record_size)
  open(unit=10, file='very_large_array.bin', access='direct', recl=recl, form='unformatted',iostat=iostat)
  if(iostat /= 0) then
    print*, "Error opening file:", iostat
    stop
  endif
  
  do i = 1, num_records
    j = min(i * record_size, array_size)
    array_chunk = my_array((i-1)*record_size + 1:j)
    write(10, rec=i) array_chunk
  enddo

  close(10, iostat=iostat)
  if(iostat /= 0) then
    print*, "Error closing file:", iostat
    stop
  endif

end program write_large_array
```

This example addresses scenarios with arrays larger than available memory. The array is broken down into smaller chunks, written to individual records.  This strategy avoids memory issues and allows for efficient processing of extremely large datasets.  The `ceiling` function ensures correct handling of any remainder when dividing the total array size by the chunk size.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For further study on optimizing Fortran I/O, I recommend consulting the official Fortran standard documents.  Also, thoroughly examine the documentation for your specific Fortran compiler and the file system you are using.  Exploring performance analysis tools, such as those included in many HPC environments, is crucial for identifying I/O bottlenecks.  Finally, advanced texts on parallel and high-performance computing will offer further insight into managing I/O in large-scale applications.
