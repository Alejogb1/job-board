The root cause of PyTorch installing on the CPU despite a declared GPU specification often stems from mismatched or missing CUDA toolkit versions and associated libraries, not necessarily a fundamental PyTorch installation error.  During my years working on high-performance computing projects, I've encountered this numerous times. The problem rarely lies in PyTorch itself; instead, it's a consequence of the complex interplay between PyTorch, CUDA, cuDNN, and the underlying system configuration.  This necessitates a methodical check across several layers of your software and hardware setup.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch utilizes CUDA, NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model, to leverage the processing power of GPUs.  Crucially,  the CUDA toolkit must be installed and correctly configured *before* attempting to install PyTorch.  If the CUDA toolkit is absent or incompatible with the PyTorch version you're installing, or if critical dependencies like cuDNN (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) are missing or improperly linked, PyTorch will default to the CPU.  This isn't a bug; it's a fallback mechanism to ensure functionality even if GPU acceleration isn't possible.  Further, the presence of conflicting CUDA installations or incorrect environment variables can confound the installation process and lead to CPU-only execution.  Finally, it's vital to verify that your GPU is supported by the CUDA version you're using â€“ older cards may lack the necessary compute capability.

The installation process involves several distinct layers:

* **Hardware:** A compatible NVIDIA GPU with sufficient memory and a compute capability supported by your CUDA version.
* **CUDA Toolkit:** The core software providing the interface between the CPU and GPU.  Specific versions are required for different PyTorch versions.
* **cuDNN:** An optimized library for deep neural network operations, significantly enhancing performance on NVIDIA GPUs.
* **PyTorch:** The machine learning framework that leverages CUDA and cuDNN for GPU acceleration.

Failure at any one of these layers can result in a PyTorch installation that operates only on the CPU, despite the user's intention and the hardware's capabilities.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples illustrate how to verify your environment and guide the troubleshooting process.  They are presented in Python, assuming a standard Linux environment. Adaptations for Windows and macOS are possible but may involve different commands and paths.

**Example 1: Checking CUDA Availability**

```python
import torch

print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Returns True if CUDA is available, False otherwise
print(torch.version.cuda)       # Prints the CUDA version being used (if any)
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)) # Prints the name of the GPU
    print(torch.cuda.device_count())      # Prints the number of GPUs available

```

This code snippet directly queries PyTorch for CUDA availability.  A `False` return from `torch.cuda.is_available()` immediately indicates a problem; the remaining lines provide specifics about the currently available hardware and drivers.  The absence of a CUDA version or an error message at this stage signals a missing or incorrectly configured CUDA installation.

**Example 2: Verifying CUDA and cuDNN Paths**

```python
import os

cuda_path = os.environ.get("CUDA_PATH")
cudnn_path = os.environ.get("CUDNN_PATH")

print(f"CUDA_PATH: {cuda_path}")
print(f"CUDNN_PATH: {cudnn_path}")

if cuda_path is None or cudnn_path is None:
    print("WARNING: CUDA_PATH or CUDNN_PATH environment variables are not set.")

```

This example checks if the crucial environment variables pointing to the CUDA and cuDNN installations are correctly set.  Missing or incorrect paths prevent PyTorch from locating these essential libraries.  On some systems, these paths may be automatically detected, but explicitly setting them can resolve ambiguity.


**Example 3:  Checking Compute Capability**

```python
import torch

if torch.cuda.is_available():
    device = torch.device("cuda")
    properties = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0)
    print(f"Compute Capability: {properties.major}.{properties.minor}")
    print(f"GPU Name: {properties.name}")
```

This code snippet retrieves the compute capability of your GPU. PyTorch requires a compatible compute capability; mismatch between this value and your CUDA version can lead to installation failure or CPU-only execution.  This information, combined with the GPU name, helps to diagnose potential incompatibilities with the CUDA toolkit version.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The NVIDIA website offers comprehensive documentation on CUDA, cuDNN, and their installation.  Refer to the PyTorch documentation for detailed installation instructions specific to your operating system and PyTorch version. Consult the documentation for your specific GPU model to confirm its CUDA compatibility and recommended drivers.  Thorough reading of the error messages generated during the installation process often provides crucial clues about the precise cause of the problem.  A well-structured and systematically-maintained conda or virtual environment is also crucial for managing dependencies and avoiding conflicts. Carefully examine your system's environment variables, paying close attention to those related to CUDA and its dependencies.  Finally, checking your system logs for any errors related to CUDA, PyTorch, or driver issues is important during the diagnostic stage.
