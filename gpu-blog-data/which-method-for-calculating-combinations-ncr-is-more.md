The efficiency of calculating combinations (nCr), often represented as  ⁿCᵣ or  (ⁿᵣ), hinges critically on the avoidance of redundant calculations.  While a naive recursive approach might seem intuitive, its exponential time complexity renders it impractical for larger values of n and r.  In my experience optimizing combinatorial algorithms for large-scale graph analysis, I’ve found that leveraging the properties of factorials and employing dynamic programming or a pre-computed lookup table yields significantly superior performance.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

The fundamental formula for combinations is:

ⁿCᵣ = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)

where n! denotes the factorial of n (n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1).  A direct implementation based on this formula suffers from two major inefficiencies:

* **Repeated calculations:**  Factorials are repeatedly computed for various values of n, r, and (n-r). This redundancy leads to exponential time complexity, O(n!).

* **Integer overflow:**  Factorials grow extremely rapidly. Even for moderately sized n, the intermediate values can exceed the capacity of standard integer data types, leading to incorrect results or program crashes.


To mitigate these issues, several optimized approaches exist.  The most common are:

* **Using the iterative approach for factorial calculation:**  Instead of the recursive factorial calculation, we can use an iterative approach to calculate factorial, thus reducing function call overhead.

* **Pre-computation and Lookup Table:**  Pre-computing factorials for a range of values and storing them in a lookup table eliminates redundant calculations. The memory trade-off is worthwhile for scenarios requiring frequent combination calculations with relatively small n values.

* **Dynamic Programming:**  Dynamic programming avoids redundant calculations by storing intermediate results.  It leverages the observation that ⁿCᵣ can be calculated using previously computed values of ⁿ⁻¹Cᵣ and ⁿ⁻¹Cᵣ₋₁ via Pascal's identity: ⁿCᵣ = ⁿ⁻¹Cᵣ₋₁ + ⁿ⁻¹Cᵣ.  This approach offers a good balance between memory usage and computation time.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Naive Recursive Approach (Inefficient):**

```python
def combinations_recursive(n, r):
    if r == 0 or r == n:
        return 1
    if r > n:
        return 0
    return combinations_recursive(n - 1, r - 1) + combinations_recursive(n - 1, r)

# Example usage (highly inefficient for larger n and r)
result = combinations_recursive(10, 3)
print(f"Combinations (10, 3): {result}")
```

This recursive approach clearly demonstrates the exponential time complexity.  Each call spawns two more recursive calls, leading to a rapidly expanding call tree.  While concise, it's utterly impractical for anything beyond small n and r values.  I've encountered this in early projects and learned its limitations quickly.


**Example 2: Iterative Approach with Factorial Calculation and Division (Improved):**

```python
import math

def combinations_iterative(n, r):
    if r > n:
        return 0
    numerator = math.factorial(n)
    denominator = math.factorial(r) * math.factorial(n - r)
    return numerator // denominator

# Example Usage
result = combinations_iterative(10,3)
print(f"Combinations (10, 3): {result}")
```

This iterative approach improves upon the recursive method by calculating factorials iteratively using `math.factorial`. This avoids the function call overhead of recursion but still suffers from potential integer overflow for larger values of `n`.  The use of `//` for integer division prevents floating-point errors.  While better than the recursive version, it still doesn't address the core issue of redundant computations and potential overflow.


**Example 3: Dynamic Programming Approach (Most Efficient for Larger n):**

```python
def combinations_dynamic(n, r):
    if r > n:
        return 0
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(r + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n + 1):
        for j in range(min(i, r) + 1):
            if j == 0 or j == i:
                dp[i][j] = 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]
    return dp[n][r]

# Example Usage
result = combinations_dynamic(10,3)
print(f"Combinations (10, 3): {result}")
```

The dynamic programming approach in this example builds a table (`dp`) to store intermediate results.  Each cell `dp[i][j]` represents ⁱCⱼ.  The values are calculated bottom-up, using previously computed values, thereby avoiding redundant computations. This method offers a polynomial time complexity, O(n*r), making it significantly more efficient than the naive recursive or even the improved iterative approach for larger values of `n` and `r`. This is the method I consistently prefer when dealing with larger combinatorial problems.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of combinatorial algorithms and their complexities, I recommend studying standard algorithms textbooks focusing on dynamic programming and combinatorial optimization.   Reviewing materials on number theory, particularly concerning factorials and modular arithmetic, will prove beneficial in handling large numbers efficiently.  Finally, exploring advanced data structures and techniques for handling large datasets within memory constraints is critical for real-world applications of these algorithms.
