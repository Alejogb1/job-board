Singularity containers, by default, operate under a strict security model designed to prevent unauthorized access to the host system's resources. This inherent constraint directly impacts their ability to access external files during a build process.  My experience building and deploying high-performance computing applications within Singularity confirms this limitation, and necessitates careful consideration of data management strategies.  While seemingly restrictive, this design choice is fundamental to Singularity's security and reproducibility guarantees.

The core issue revolves around the container's root filesystem and the bind mount mechanism. Singularity containers function with a root filesystem defined within the container image itself.  Any files or directories within this root are directly accessible to the processes running inside.  However, accessing files *outside* this isolated environment requires explicit configuration through bind mounts. This is crucial because direct access would undermine the security benefits of containerization.

The ability to access external files during a build hinges on whether these files are explicitly mounted into the container's filesystem *before* the build process commences.  If not, the build process operates solely within the confines of the image's root filesystem.  This is often the intended behaviour, promoting reproducibility and preventing unexpected dependencies on the host system.

Let's examine this with three specific code examples demonstrating different approaches:

**Example 1:  No External File Access (Default Behavior)**

This example illustrates the standard build process where no external files are accessible.  The build script attempts to access a file (`external_data.txt`) presumed to exist on the host system.

```bash
# Singularity Recipe (build/test.def)
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:latest

%post
    # This will fail if external_data.txt is not in the image
    if [ ! -f /external_data.txt ]; then
        echo "Error: external_data.txt not found." >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    # ... build process using /external_data.txt ...
%runscript
    echo "Build completed (hopefully)."
```

This recipe will fail if `external_data.txt` is not pre-included in the `ubuntu:latest` base image or within any subsequent layers added during the build process.  Attempting to directly access a file from the host system at `/path/to/external_data.txt` will result in a failure. This demonstrates the default sandboxed behaviour.


**Example 2: Accessing External Files via Bind Mounts**

This example uses a bind mount to make an external file accessible within the container during the build process.

```bash
# Singularity build command
singularity build test.sif build/test.def --bind /path/to/external_data.txt:/external_data.txt
```

Here, `/path/to/external_data.txt` on the host system is mounted at `/external_data.txt` inside the container.  The `test.def` recipe (from Example 1) now needs to be modified to look for the file at this mounted path:

```bash
# Singularity Recipe (modified build/test.def)
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:latest

%post
    # This will now succeed if /path/to/external_data.txt exists on the host
    if [ ! -f /external_data.txt ]; then
        echo "Error: external_data.txt not found." >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    # ... build process using /external_data.txt ...
%runscript
    echo "Build completed successfully."
```

This modified recipe now successfully accesses the external file because the bind mount makes it part of the container's filesystem during the build.  This highlights the crucial role of bind mounts for controlled external access.


**Example 3:  Data within the Image - Best Practice**

The most robust and recommended approach is to include the necessary data directly within the Singularity image itself.  This ensures reproducibility and avoids reliance on host system resources.

```bash
# Singularity Recipe (build/test_best.def)
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:latest

%files
    external_data.txt /external_data.txt  # Copies the file into the image
%post
    # ... build process using /external_data.txt ...
%runscript
    echo "Build completed using embedded data."
```

In this approach, `external_data.txt` is explicitly copied into the image during the build.  The build process operates solely on data available within the container's root filesystem. This method guarantees consistency and avoids issues related to host system variability or accidental file modification during the build.  This is the most suitable strategy for reproducible research or deployment scenarios.


**Resource Recommendations**

I'd recommend reviewing the official Singularity documentation thoroughly.  Pay particular attention to sections on bind mounts, the `%files` directive, and security considerations related to container building.  Furthermore, exploring advanced topics like  network namespaces and user namespaces will provide a deeper understanding of Singularity's security model.  A strong grasp of Linux filesystem operations and containerization principles is also essential.


In summary, while Singularity containers don't directly allow access to arbitrary external files during the build process, the bind mount mechanism offers a secure and controlled way to integrate necessary data. However, incorporating data directly into the image through the `%files` directive is generally preferred for improved reproducibility and security. This strategy avoids the complexities and potential vulnerabilities associated with managing external dependencies during the build.  Understanding these trade-offs is fundamental to leveraging Singularity's capabilities effectively and securely.
