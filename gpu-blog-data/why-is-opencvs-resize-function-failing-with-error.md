The OpenCV resize function, specifically when triggering the `(-215:Assertion failed) !ssize.empty()` error, almost invariably points to an issue with the size parameters provided for the destination image. I've encountered this several times across various projects, and in my experience, it’s rarely due to a fundamental issue with the OpenCV library itself, but rather with how the intended output dimensions are being calculated or passed. This assertion failure signifies that the `dsize` argument, a `Size` object indicating the desired output image dimensions, is being evaluated as empty or invalid within the resize function’s internal checks. Let’s break down the common causes and illustrate with specific code examples.

The core issue resides in the manner `cv::resize()` interprets its input parameters, specifically `dsize`. This parameter, if explicitly specified, takes precedence over the scale factors (`fx`, `fy`). However, if `dsize` is not explicitly passed or if it's provided as an empty or invalid `Size` object, OpenCV throws the assertion failure. A `Size` object needs two positive integer components: `width` and `height`. Common mistakes include attempting to create a size with zero or negative values, or inadvertently passing a `Size` object that has not been properly initialized. If `dsize` is zero or negative the resize function can not perform its operation. Additionally, incorrect logic in image size calculations upstream can easily lead to invalid sizes being passed to `resize`.

**Code Example 1: Incorrect Initialization**

Consider a scenario where one attempts to resize an image based on user input for scale factors, without properly initializing the output size:

```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <iostream>

using namespace cv;
using namespace std;

int main() {
  Mat image = imread("input.jpg", IMREAD_COLOR); 

  if(image.empty()){
      cout << "Could not open or find the image" << endl;
      return -1;
  }

  double scale_x = 0.5;
  double scale_y = 0.75;

  // Problematic: dsize is not explicitly created with calculated width and height
  Size dsize; //default initialization resulting in dsize with empty values
  Mat resized_image;
  resize(image, resized_image, dsize, scale_x, scale_y); // This will cause the assertion error

  imshow("Resized Image", resized_image);
  waitKey(0);

  return 0;
}
```

In this first example, the `dsize` variable is declared as a `Size` object without explicitly assigning a value to its members, which will result in an invalid initialization. This leaves the object in an uninitialized state with default zero values for the width and height of the `Size` object. When `resize()` is invoked, even though scale factors (`scale_x` and `scale_y`) are provided, OpenCV first checks `dsize`. Because `dsize` is considered invalid, the assertion is triggered, immediately halting execution. It is important to remember that if you are not providing an explicit dsize value, then it is imperative that you are providing both `scale_x` and `scale_y` as arguments.

**Code Example 2: Incorrect Calculation**

Another common issue involves flawed calculations that inadvertently produce a zero width or height.  This might stem from a miscalculation related to cropping, padding, or other transformations being applied before the resize:

```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <iostream>

using namespace cv;
using namespace std;

int main() {
  Mat image = imread("input.jpg", IMREAD_COLOR);
    if(image.empty()){
      cout << "Could not open or find the image" << endl;
      return -1;
  }
  int target_width = 100;
  int target_height = 200;
  
  int crop_width = 1000; // Incorrect - larger than image width, would lead to negative size
  int crop_height = 500; // Correct relative to height
  
  int resized_width = target_width - crop_width;  
  int resized_height = target_height; // Assume we want to maintain full height

  Size dsize(resized_width, resized_height); // Incorrect width calculation will lead to negative width

  Mat resized_image;
  resize(image, resized_image, dsize); // Assertion error because of a negative width calculation

  imshow("Resized Image", resized_image);
  waitKey(0);
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, I’ve intentionally introduced an invalid width calculation using `crop_width`, which will lead to a negative value for `resized_width`. Although `resized_height` is a positive value, having even one dimension (width or height) be negative or zero will result in the assertion failure. The key here is to meticulously verify all calculations leading up to the creation of `dsize`. This requires ensuring that all intermediate variables resolve to positive integer values.

**Code Example 3: Correct Usage with Calculation and Size Specification**

Here's an example that accurately calculates and specifies a `Size` object, avoiding the assertion failure:

```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>
#include <iostream>

using namespace cv;
using namespace std;

int main() {
  Mat image = imread("input.jpg", IMREAD_COLOR);
    if(image.empty()){
        cout << "Could not open or find the image" << endl;
        return -1;
    }
    double scale_x = 0.5;
    double scale_y = 0.75;

    int original_width = image.cols;
    int original_height = image.rows;

    int resized_width = static_cast<int>(original_width * scale_x);
    int resized_height = static_cast<int>(original_height * scale_y);

    Size dsize(resized_width, resized_height);

    Mat resized_image;
    resize(image, resized_image, dsize); // Correct way to invoke resize

    imshow("Resized Image", resized_image);
    waitKey(0);

  return 0;
}
```

In this corrected version, we retrieve the image's dimensions using `image.cols` and `image.rows`. The scaled dimensions are calculated based on the `scale_x` and `scale_y` factors and then explicitly cast to an `int` type as required by the `Size` object. This ensures that we create a valid `Size` object with positive integer values. When `resize` is invoked with this correctly constructed `dsize`, the assertion error is avoided. Also, note the explicit casting to `int` as `cols` and `rows` are of type int so the multiplication will produce a double value that must be cast. If a cast is not performed, a compiler error will be thrown.

In summary, the `(-215:Assertion failed) !ssize.empty()` error within OpenCV’s `resize()` function arises from an invalid or improperly initialized `dsize` parameter. This usually stems from logic errors that produce an empty or zero-dimensional `Size` object. Proper initialization using calculated positive integer values for both `width` and `height` is crucial, as are thorough checks of any calculations that determine these parameters. Remember that when you provide an explicit `dsize` parameter, the `scale_x` and `scale_y` parameters are ignored.

**Resource Recommendations:**

*   **OpenCV Documentation:** The official OpenCV documentation provides extensive explanations and examples regarding image resizing and the usage of the `cv::resize()` function. This should always be the primary reference.
*   **Books on Computer Vision:** Many books offer in-depth discussions on image processing techniques, including resizing and its implementation in libraries like OpenCV. Check for titles focused on practical application rather than theoretical frameworks.
*   **Online Tutorials:** Many platforms host step-by-step tutorials covering OpenCV, image resizing, and debugging common error scenarios. These can supplement the official documentation with clear examples and problem-solving strategies.
