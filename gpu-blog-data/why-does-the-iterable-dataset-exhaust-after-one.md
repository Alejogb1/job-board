The core reason an iterable dataset, specifically one implemented with custom Python classes, appears to exhaust after a single epoch in contexts like training machine learning models is due to the underlying iterator protocol's stateful nature. Once an iterator is consumed, typically by a `for` loop or functions like `next()`, it does not inherently reset its internal pointer or index. Therefore, subsequent attempts to iterate yield no further values, giving the illusion of an empty or exhausted dataset. This stems from the fact that the iterable is responsible for constructing a *new* iterator each time it’s asked to provide one. It's the iterator's job to manage the traversal; the iterable itself doesn't track iteration state.

I've encountered this several times when crafting data pipelines for deep learning experiments, particularly with image datasets stored in a custom format. I realized early on that relying solely on a simple class that returned a list as an iterator was insufficient, because the data needed to be shuffled between epochs. The core problem wasn’t with the list itself, but rather that the iterable wasn’t returning a fresh iterator with each epoch cycle.

To elaborate, an iterable object in Python must implement the `__iter__` method. This method, when called, must return an iterator object. This iterator object then implements the `__next__` method, which produces subsequent values. Crucially, the iterable itself is *not* the iterator; it's a factory. When you initiate iteration with a `for` loop or use `iter(dataset)`, Python calls the dataset's `__iter__` method to get the iterator. The iterator maintains internal state related to how far through the sequence it has progressed. This state is *not* stored by the original iterable. When that iterator is exhausted (by `__next__` raising `StopIteration`), it's done. The iterable is still perfectly valid, but you need to create a new iterator from it.

Let’s examine a first, simple incorrect example to understand this more concretely.

```python
class SimpleDataset:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.data)  # Returning the iterator of internal data


data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
dataset = SimpleDataset(data)

print("First Epoch:")
for item in dataset:
    print(item)

print("Second Epoch:")
for item in dataset: # This won't yield anything.
    print(item)
```

The `SimpleDataset` class encapsulates a list, and its `__iter__` method simply returns the standard iterator provided by the list. When the `for` loop iterates through it for the first time, Python obtains this iterator, which traverses the list. Once the iterator exhausts all elements, it raises `StopIteration`, and subsequent attempts to iterate from the same `dataset` variable do not yield new values. The problem is that the iterator returned by `iter(self.data)` is stateful and only valid for one pass. Each call to the dataset to begin iterating only ever provides the same, now consumed, iterator.

The fix is to ensure the `__iter__` method of the iterable always returns a *new* iterator that is initialized to the beginning of the data. A common pattern is to define a separate iterator class that can be reset.

Here's a second, partially improved example that still exhibits the original problem, but uses a dedicated iterator class. This illuminates how, even with more sophisticated setup, the issue persists if the iteratable doesn’t create new iterators on every call of `__iter__`.

```python
class CustomIterator:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.index = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.index >= len(self.data):
            raise StopIteration
        value = self.data[self.index]
        self.index += 1
        return value

class AlmostCorrectDataset:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __iter__(self):
        return CustomIterator(self.data)


data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
dataset = AlmostCorrectDataset(data)

print("First Epoch:")
for item in dataset:
    print(item)

print("Second Epoch:")
for item in dataset: # This still won't yield anything.
    print(item)

```

This example shows the creation of the `CustomIterator`. The iterator keeps track of its current `index`. The `AlmostCorrectDataset` returns a *new* `CustomIterator` on each `__iter__` call. But the issue lies in that the iterator does *not* reset it's internal index, `self.index`. The iterator, as implemented here, returns `self` from its `__iter__` method, making the iterator also an iterable. But it never resets its own index. Consequently, the iterator, once traversed, is still exhausted when called the second time in the second epoch, because it's still referencing the same iterator object.

Finally, here’s a corrected and typical pattern demonstrating the necessary fix:

```python
import random

class ShufflingIterator:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.index = 0
        self._shuffled_indices = list(range(len(self.data)))
        random.shuffle(self._shuffled_indices)


    def __iter__(self):
      return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.index >= len(self.data):
            raise StopIteration
        shuffled_index = self._shuffled_indices[self.index]
        value = self.data[shuffled_index]
        self.index += 1
        return value

class CorrectDataset:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __iter__(self):
        return ShufflingIterator(self.data)


data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
dataset = CorrectDataset(data)


print("First Epoch:")
for item in dataset:
    print(item)

print("Second Epoch:")
for item in dataset:
    print(item)

```
The `CorrectDataset` class now correctly returns a new iterator, `ShufflingIterator`, with each call to `__iter__`. Crucially, `ShufflingIterator` constructs a shuffled list of indices each time it is created, ensuring the data is traversed differently each epoch. The `__next__` method uses this shuffled index for data retrieval. Because `ShufflingIterator` objects are instantiated each time `__iter__` is called on `CorrectDataset` a fresh iterator is provided, which ensures iteration through the entire dataset. This highlights how the dataset’s role is to *provide* a new iterator with fresh state for each epoch, not maintain that state itself.

In practical machine learning workflows, this pattern is critical when using generators that load data on-demand, implement data augmentation or perform other transforms, because the generator often also manages an internal state. Ensuring each epoch starts with a fresh iterator, as demonstrated by the `CorrectDataset` design, is the standard approach.

For further information, I recommend consulting the Python documentation for iterators and generators. The book "Fluent Python" provides a comprehensive overview of the iterator pattern, while "Effective Computation in Physics" illustrates this in the context of scientific data processing, and "Deep Learning with Python" shows how such patterns are used with datasets for model training. The standard library's documentation also provides details about the `collections.abc` module and `Iterator` abstract base class, which can clarify the exact requirements. These references are invaluable for gaining a deeper understanding of iterables and iterators.
