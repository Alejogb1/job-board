A `FailedPreconditionError` in Google Colab, specifically during variable initialization, typically arises not from the initialization process itself, but from attempting to use a variable that relies on a resource that hasn't been properly set up or is no longer available. I've encountered this frequently when working with TensorFlow and TPUs, where the environment isn't fully initialized before model definition and variable creation. The core issue isn't the act of assigning a value; rather, it is attempting to access external resources, such as TPU contexts or files, that haven't been created.

This specific error, within the Colab environment, generally points to a misalignment between the requested hardware accelerator and the state of the runtime or, more frequently, attempting to access these resources outside of their correct initialization sequence.  It's crucial to understand that Colab's runtime is not a persistent environment like a local machine. Sessions can terminate, resources may be deallocated, and variables depending on these resources become invalid. The error doesn't often come from invalid syntax or variable typing. It's more about resource availability and context.

To trigger this error, imagine a scenario where you're developing a model using TensorFlow and want to leverage a TPU. The `FailedPreconditionError` can arise in two distinct phases: TPU setup/initialization and subsequent variable creation. The error is raised by the TPU runtime because a resource, the device in this case, is not available.

Let's outline the specific conditions for reproduction and provide code examples.

**Example 1: Incorrect TPU Initialization Order**

The most common scenario I have seen is that users create a variable that depends on a TPU context, while the TPU hasn't been initialized properly. In the code below, a TensorFlow variable is defined inside a strategy scope without ensuring a TPU has been successfully initialized and made available to TensorFlow.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Attempt to use a TPU strategy *before* TPU initialization. This is the mistake.
strategy = tf.distribute.TPUStrategy()

with strategy.scope():
  try:
      a = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((10, 10))) # FailedPreconditionError occurs here
      print(a)
  except tf.errors.FailedPreconditionError as e:
    print(f"Caught a FailedPreconditionError: {e}")


# Correct way should be first calling tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver() followed by strategy instantiation
# The following is for demonstration and cannot guarantee proper execution of TPU initialization if no TPU is available.
try:
  resolver = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver()
  tf.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster(resolver)
  tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system(resolver)
  strategy = tf.distribute.TPUStrategy(resolver)
  with strategy.scope():
        b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((10,10)))
        print(b)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while initializing TPU: {e}")

```

In this example, the variable `a` is declared within the scope of `tf.distribute.TPUStrategy` before a proper connection to TPU cluster is made and therefore before device initialization has taken place. The `FailedPreconditionError` occurs at the initialization of variable `a` and not while creating the strategy. The second block demonstrates the proper way to proceed, by connecting to a TPU and initializing its system first. This is critical for any TPU-dependent operations, including variable creation. It highlights that using a strategy itself does not necessarily mean a TPU is available. It is important to ensure the TPU is not only configured but actively connected within the TensorFlow session.

**Example 2: TensorBoard Log Directory Issues**

Another context where this error can appear is related to tensorboard logging, especially when using file paths on Colab's temporary filesystem, which can be volatile.  I have found that the error will not happen on first run, but can happen if subsequent runs reuse directories without a restart or clear up the cache or when Colab's runtime environment is reset which invalidates previously created resources.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Define the logs directory (will exist only during current Colab session)
logdir = os.path.join("logs", datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"))


#Create a summary writer for tensorboard which uses the log directory as resource.
try:
    file_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(logdir)
    with file_writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('example_scalar', 0.123, step=0)

    x = tf.Variable(2.0)
    print(f"Variable x initialized: {x}")


    # Simulate Colab environment reset by trying to access the file writer after the first usage
    file_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(logdir)
    with file_writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.scalar('another_scalar', 0.456, step=1)

    y = tf.Variable(10.0) # This can cause a FailedPreconditionError if logdir is invalid.
    print(f"Variable y initialized: {y}")


except tf.errors.FailedPreconditionError as e:
    print(f"Caught a FailedPreconditionError: {e}")
except Exception as e:
  print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```
In this scenario, I am not deleting any files or logs, however, Colab's runtime may clear up the session environment and invalidate the resource associated with the created log directory which makes the file writer an invalid resource which causes the error. The first part of the code will execute without issues because it's the first time the resource was requested. However, when attempting to create `y`, a `FailedPreconditionError` can arise because the log directory may not be writeable (it can also happen if directory does not exist anymore if a Colab reset happens). Colab is a cloud-based environment and its resources might have temporal nature. This often manifests when the runtime terminates or is refreshed, making previously valid references become unavailable.  This is similar to a hardware resource that has been disconnected or reset.

**Example 3: Attempt to use a pre-saved checkpoint while TPU or device is offline**

Often, when working with models, I rely on checkpoints for training recovery, but a similar issue occurs if a variable attempts to load a value from a checkpoint while the correct computational device is not available (for example, if a checkpoint was created using TPU then being loaded without a TPU runtime).

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

checkpoint_dir = './checkpoints'
checkpoint_prefix = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, "ckpt")

# Create some variable to be stored
var_a = tf.Variable(1.0)
var_b = tf.Variable(2.0)

# Create checkpoint manager
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(var_a=var_a, var_b=var_b)
manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint, directory=checkpoint_dir, max_to_keep=3)

# Save the variables initially.
manager.save()
print("Checkpoints saved.")


# Attempt to restore before setting the device:
try:
  # Reinitialize the same variables
  var_a = tf.Variable(0.0)
  var_b = tf.Variable(0.0)

  # Create a checkpoint to restore to the new initialized variables
  checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(var_a=var_a, var_b=var_b)
  manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint, directory=checkpoint_dir, max_to_keep=3)

  manager.restore_or_initialize() # This will cause a FailedPreconditionError if device/TPU is not initialized.

  print(f"var_a: {var_a}, var_b: {var_b}")

except tf.errors.FailedPreconditionError as e:
    print(f"Caught a FailedPreconditionError: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


#  Correct way to restore after device/TPU setup would be as follows:
# try:
#   resolver = tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver()
#   tf.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster(resolver)
#   tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system(resolver)
#   strategy = tf.distribute.TPUStrategy(resolver)
#
#   with strategy.scope():
#     var_a = tf.Variable(0.0)
#     var_b = tf.Variable(0.0)
#
#     # Create a checkpoint to restore to the new initialized variables
#     checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(var_a=var_a, var_b=var_b)
#     manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint, directory=checkpoint_dir, max_to_keep=3)
#
#     manager.restore_or_initialize()
#
#     print(f"var_a: {var_a}, var_b: {var_b}")
#
# except Exception as e:
#      print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

In this example, the variables are initialized and saved on a default device. The second part of the code attempts to restore the variables. While the checkpoint is valid, the default variables that are created in the default scope cannot access the resource because it has not been correctly attached (either CPU or TPU). The `FailedPreconditionError` is thrown because the restored values from the checkpoint need to have a device which has to be specified in a distributed setup or using TPU. The commented out code shows how the variables would have to be created withing a TPU strategy scope to correctly load the checkpoint when training on TPU.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I recommend reviewing TensorFlow's official documentation regarding distributed training with strategies, specifically concerning the TPUStrategy and its setup. Additionally, examining the documentation related to file system interaction within Colab environments will provide insight into the persistence of resources and directories. Lastly, a thorough review of TensorFlow's checkpointing system, especially for distributed training, will prove valuable in avoiding these errors related to saved variables and models.
