Directly calling `mousePressEvent` from within a `paintEvent` in PyQt is not the intended pattern for event handling. The `paintEvent` is specifically designed for updating the visual representation of a widget, and attempting to inject interactive behavior there breaks the event loop and generally leads to unpredictable results. Instead, one must implement logic within the `paintEvent` to determine *what* to draw based on the widget's state, and the state changes should be driven by other event handlers like `mousePressEvent`, thereby ensuring correct event propagation and separation of concerns. I’ve encountered this type of design issue multiple times in past projects, including one involving a custom interactive chart, where direct `paintEvent` interaction was initially attempted. The challenge is not *how* to call the event, but *how* to manage the state that influences the `paintEvent`’s rendering behavior.

The core problem stems from the different roles these event types play. The `paintEvent` is called whenever the widget needs to be redrawn, this might be due to an expose event, a resize event, or the update method being called, either by the system or by user code. It’s a low-level request for a visual refresh and should focus solely on painting. In contrast, mouse events, including `mousePressEvent`, are generated when user interactions occur within the widget. These events should manage state transitions, effectively serving as the system's input that will then trigger a repainting of the widget reflecting the updated state.

Attempting to call `mousePressEvent` from within `paintEvent` creates a circular dependency: the `paintEvent` wants to trigger a mouse interaction, which would in turn potentially need to trigger another `paintEvent`, and then another `mousePressEvent`, and so on. It's a recipe for a recursive loop or unexpected behavior. The correct approach involves leveraging the `mousePressEvent` to alter the internal state of the widget, and to subsequently use `update()` method to schedule a new repaint. The `paintEvent` then uses this state information to render accordingly.

Consider this scenario. We have a custom widget that displays a series of circles. When a user clicks within a circle, the circle changes color. The logic should be separated so `mousePressEvent` identifies the selected circle, changes the internal data structure, and requests a redraw via `update()`. The `paintEvent` then renders the circles based on this new state.

Here’s a simple code example demonstrating this pattern:

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget, QApplication
from PyQt5.QtGui import QPainter, QColor
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt, QPoint

class CircleWidget(QWidget):
    def __init__(self, circles, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.circles = circles  # List of (x, y, radius, color) tuples
        self.selected_circle_index = None

    def paintEvent(self, event):
        painter = QPainter(self)
        painter.setRenderHint(QPainter.Antialiasing)
        for i, circle in enumerate(self.circles):
            x, y, radius, color = circle
            if i == self.selected_circle_index:
                painter.setBrush(QColor(color).lighter(120)) #slightly lightens if selected
            else:
                 painter.setBrush(QColor(color))
            painter.drawEllipse(QPoint(x, y), radius, radius)

    def mousePressEvent(self, event):
        mouse_pos = event.pos()
        for i, circle in enumerate(self.circles):
            x, y, radius, _ = circle
            distance = ((mouse_pos.x() - x) ** 2 + (mouse_pos.y() - y) ** 2) ** 0.5
            if distance <= radius:
                self.selected_circle_index = i
                self.update()  # Trigger repaint
                break
        else:
            self.selected_circle_index = None
            self.update()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    circles = [(50, 50, 20, 'red'), (150, 100, 30, 'blue'), (250, 150, 25, 'green')]
    widget = CircleWidget(circles)
    widget.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

In this first example, the `paintEvent` only concerns itself with drawing circles according to current data. When the mouse clicks happen, `mousePressEvent` iterates through defined circles; if the click is within a circle, it sets `self.selected_circle_index` to the clicked circle’s index, triggering a repaint through the `update()` method. The `paintEvent` then uses this index to highlight the selected circle by painting it in a slightly lighter color.

Let us consider a more complex interaction, where pressing the mouse causes the widget to draw a line. This requires storing the start point of the line upon a press event and only drawing it when mouse moves while button is pressed.

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget, QApplication
from PyQt5.QtGui import QPainter, QColor, QPen
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt, QPoint

class LineWidget(QWidget):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.line_start = None
        self.line_end = None
        self.is_drawing = False
        self.setMouseTracking(True)

    def paintEvent(self, event):
        painter = QPainter(self)
        painter.setRenderHint(QPainter.Antialiasing)
        if self.line_start and self.line_end:
             pen = QPen(QColor('black'), 2, Qt.SolidLine)
             painter.setPen(pen)
             painter.drawLine(self.line_start, self.line_end)

    def mousePressEvent(self, event):
        if event.button() == Qt.LeftButton:
            self.line_start = event.pos()
            self.is_drawing = True
            self.line_end = event.pos() #ensure no strange state if click without move
            self.update()

    def mouseMoveEvent(self, event):
         if self.is_drawing:
            self.line_end = event.pos()
            self.update()

    def mouseReleaseEvent(self, event):
         if event.button() == Qt.LeftButton:
             self.is_drawing = False
             self.update()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    widget = LineWidget()
    widget.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

```

In this example, `mousePressEvent` sets the `self.is_drawing` to true, stores the starting point of the line and calls `update()`, while the mouseMoveEvent updates the `self.line_end` and calls update() while `self.is_drawing` is true, with the `mouseReleaseEvent` setting the `self.is_drawing` to `False`. Here, we handle mouse input to manipulate the widget's state, and `paintEvent` then draws the line based on this state. This approach ensures that drawing happens only when the widget's state indicates the need to do so.

As a final example, consider a scenario in which clicking the mouse changes the background color of the widget. Here the state to change is very simple.

```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget, QApplication
from PyQt5.QtGui import QPainter, QColor
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt

class ColorWidget(QWidget):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        self.current_color = QColor('white')

    def paintEvent(self, event):
        painter = QPainter(self)
        painter.fillRect(self.rect(), self.current_color)

    def mousePressEvent(self, event):
        if event.button() == Qt.LeftButton:
            if self.current_color == QColor('white'):
                self.current_color = QColor('lightgrey')
            else:
                self.current_color = QColor('white')
            self.update()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    widget = ColorWidget()
    widget.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

Here the `mousePressEvent` changes the `self.current_color` to either white or light gray on each left mouse press, followed by calling `update()`. The paintEvent simply draws the background of the widget based on this color.

In each scenario, the `paintEvent` only draws according to the state of the widget without attempting to change it directly. The state changes are managed by other event handlers such as `mousePressEvent` or `mouseMoveEvent`, and then the `update()` method forces a redraw.

To further solidify understanding, I would recommend studying the official PyQt documentation, focusing specifically on the event handling mechanism.  Additionally, examining existing open-source projects that implement complex user interfaces can offer pragmatic insights. Books on GUI programming principles, particularly those focusing on the Model-View-Controller pattern, provide theoretical grounding to this approach.
