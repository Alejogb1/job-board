Accessing intermediate layers within a loaded TensorFlow 2.0 `saved_model` requires a nuanced understanding of the model's structure and TensorFlow's functional API.  My experience debugging complex production models taught me that simply loading the model is insufficient; one must actively traverse its computational graph to extract desired intermediate activations.  This isn't always straightforward, especially with models employing custom layers or intricate architectures.

The key here lies in understanding that a `saved_model` doesn't inherently expose intermediate layer outputs.  Instead, it encapsulates the model's architecture and weights, allowing for reconstruction of the computation graph during runtime.  To access intermediate layers, we must rebuild a functional representation of the model, carefully identifying the layers we need to access.  This usually involves inspecting the model's structure,  potentially through visualization tools or by recursively examining the layer attributes.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

The process involves these steps:

a) **Loading the `saved_model`:** This utilizes `tf.saved_model.load`. The function returns a `tf.Module` object, which doesn't directly provide access to internal layers in a usable format for extracting intermediate activations.

b) **Reconstructing the Computational Graph:**  This step is crucial.  We need to either recreate the model's architecture from scratch (if the model architecture is known) or introspect the loaded model to determine its structure.  The latter is often more practical for unfamiliar models and involves iterating through the loaded model's layers, analyzing their connections and types.

c) **Building a Functional Model:**  Leveraging TensorFlow's functional API (`tf.keras.models.Model`), we construct a new model where intermediate layers are explicitly defined as outputs. This new model uses the same weights as the loaded `saved_model`, but it's designed to expose the activations of those intermediate layers.

d) **Activating the Model:** With the functional model in place, passing input data through it will produce not only the final output but also the desired intermediate layer activations.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

**Example 1:  Simple Sequential Model**

This example assumes a simple sequential model with readily identifiable layers.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the saved model
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load("path/to/saved_model")

# Assume a sequential model with three layers: dense_1, dense_2, dense_3
# Accessing layers by name (assuming the original model used this naming)
dense_1 = loaded_model.dense_1
dense_2 = loaded_model.dense_2
dense_3 = loaded_model.dense_3

# Create a functional model to access intermediate layers
intermediate_model = tf.keras.models.Model(
    inputs=loaded_model.input,
    outputs=[dense_1.output, dense_2.output, dense_3.output]
)

# Input data
input_data = tf.random.normal((1, 10))

# Get intermediate activations
intermediate_activations = intermediate_model(input_data)

print("Activations from dense_1:", intermediate_activations[0])
print("Activations from dense_2:", intermediate_activations[1])
print("Activations from dense_3:", intermediate_activations[2])
```

**Commentary:** This approach relies on knowing the layer names.  It’s efficient for simple models but fails when layer names are not explicitly known or when the model architecture is complex (e.g., with sub-models or custom layers).



**Example 2:  Model with Unknown Architecture**

This example deals with models where the internal structure isn't readily apparent.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load("path/to/saved_model")

# Inspect the model to identify layer indices for intermediate layers.
#  This usually involves printing the model summary or recursively exploring the layers.

# Example: Let's assume layer 2 and layer 5 are the ones of interest.
layer_2 = loaded_model.layers[2]
layer_5 = loaded_model.layers[5]

#Build functional model
intermediate_model = tf.keras.models.Model(
    inputs=loaded_model.input,
    outputs=[layer_2.output, layer_5.output]
)

#Input data
input_data = tf.random.normal((1,10))

intermediate_activations = intermediate_model(input_data)

print("Activations from layer 2:", intermediate_activations[0])
print("Activations from layer 5:", intermediate_activations[1])
```

**Commentary:**  This approach is more robust when layer names are unavailable. However,  it requires careful examination of the model's structure to correctly identify the target layers by their indices.  Incorrect indexing leads to errors.



**Example 3: Handling Custom Layers**

Models with custom layers require extra attention.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load("path/to/saved_model")

#Identify custom layers. This may require custom code based on the structure of the custom layers.

# Example: Assume a custom layer named "my_custom_layer"
custom_layer = [layer for layer in loaded_model.layers if layer.name == "my_custom_layer"][0]

# Build the functional model, including the custom layer
intermediate_model = tf.keras.models.Model(
    inputs=loaded_model.input,
    outputs=[custom_layer.output]
)

# Input data
input_data = tf.random.normal((1,10))

intermediate_activations = intermediate_model(input_data)

print("Activations from my_custom_layer:", intermediate_activations)
```

**Commentary:** This demonstrates the added complexity when dealing with custom layers. It’s necessary to adapt the code to correctly identify and handle the custom layer's output within the functional model.  Careful understanding of the custom layer's implementation is crucial.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

The official TensorFlow documentation on the `saved_model` format and the Keras functional API are invaluable resources.  Furthermore,  understanding the concepts of computational graphs and model introspection within TensorFlow will prove beneficial.  Exploring TensorFlow's visualization tools for inspecting model architectures would aid significantly.  Finally, consulting the documentation for any custom layers within the loaded model is often necessary.
