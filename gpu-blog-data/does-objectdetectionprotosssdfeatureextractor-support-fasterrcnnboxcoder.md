The `object_detection.protos.SsdFeatureExtractor` within the TensorFlow Object Detection API does not inherently support the `faster_rcnn_box_coder`. These two components are designed for fundamentally different object detection architectures and employ distinct encoding strategies for bounding box predictions. Specifically, the SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) architecture, for which `SsdFeatureExtractor` is intended, utilizes a set of predefined anchor boxes, whereas Faster R-CNN relies on region proposals. This divergence in design necessitates unique box coding methodologies. I’ve encountered this limitation directly while migrating a Faster R-CNN model to an SSD architecture for mobile deployment; the mismatch in box encoding was a critical hurdle requiring careful address.

Fundamentally, the `faster_rcnn_box_coder` is designed to operate in the two-stage framework of Faster R-CNN. Here, a Region Proposal Network (RPN) generates candidate object regions. These regions are then refined by a second stage which predicts bounding boxes relative to those proposed regions. The `faster_rcnn_box_coder` calculates bounding box deltas with respect to these proposals; it takes the anchor box (proposal) coordinates, the ground truth box coordinates, and produces a set of offsets (tx, ty, tw, th) representing the *difference* between the two. Conversely, the SSD architecture does not use an RPN; instead, it predicts box offsets with respect to a predefined set of fixed size anchor boxes across multiple feature map layers.

The `SsdFeatureExtractor` operates within this SSD paradigm, assuming these predefined anchor boxes. The anchor boxes themselves are not proposals generated by the network but rather are defined in advance based on aspect ratios and scales. This difference dictates that the encoding and decoding of box coordinates are handled differently within the two frameworks. Trying to force-fit `faster_rcnn_box_coder` into an SSD workflow would lead to nonsensical box predictions due to the disparity in the interpretation of what the box coder is relative to – the fixed anchors vs the proposed regions.

To further illustrate, consider how the box encodings are used in loss calculations. With Faster R-CNN, the loss function evaluates the difference between predicted and ground-truth *deltas*, these deltas being calculated with respect to RPN proposals. In SSD, the loss evaluates the difference between predicted and ground truth *deltas*, these deltas calculated with respect to pre-defined fixed-size anchor boxes. These are two distinct references. Therefore, they require a box coder compatible to their reference frame. Attempting to use the `faster_rcnn_box_coder` within the `SsdFeatureExtractor` setup would result in a loss function that doesn't accurately penalize prediction errors. It would be comparing predicted offsets relative to anchor boxes to ground-truth offsets relative to proposed regions.

Here are some code examples to further underscore the difference, demonstrating the typical box encoding and decoding processes in both scenarios using conceptual Python-like operations. Note that this is a simplification and the actual TensorFlow implementations are more complex.

**Example 1: SSD Box Encoding (Conceptual)**

```python
def ssd_box_encode(anchor_boxes, gt_boxes):
    """Conceptual SSD box encoding using pre-defined anchor boxes.
    """
    encoded_boxes = []
    for i, anchor in enumerate(anchor_boxes): # Each anchor box
       best_overlap = 0
       best_gt_index = -1
       for j, gt in enumerate(gt_boxes): # Calculate overlap with ground truth box
          overlap = compute_iou(anchor, gt)  # Assume function compute_iou exists
          if overlap > best_overlap:
             best_overlap = overlap
             best_gt_index = j
       if best_gt_index != -1:
           gt = gt_boxes[best_gt_index]
           tx = (gt.cx - anchor.cx) / anchor.width
           ty = (gt.cy - anchor.cy) / anchor.height
           tw = log(gt.width / anchor.width)
           th = log(gt.height / anchor.height)
           encoded_boxes.append([tx, ty, tw, th])
       else:
           encoded_boxes.append([0,0,0,0])
    return encoded_boxes

# Example usage (simplified data structures)
anchor_boxes =  [
    {'cx': 100, 'cy': 100, 'width': 50, 'height': 50},
    {'cx': 200, 'cy': 200, 'width': 75, 'height': 75}
]
gt_boxes =  [
    {'cx': 110, 'cy': 110, 'width': 60, 'height': 60},
    {'cx': 220, 'cy': 220, 'width': 80, 'height': 80}
]
encoded = ssd_box_encode(anchor_boxes,gt_boxes)
print(encoded)
```

This code conceptually demonstrates how an SSD-like encoder would function. It iterates through pre-defined anchor boxes and computes offset parameters relative to the matched ground-truth box. It operates on the assumption that `anchor_boxes` are given as a part of the overall system design (prior).

**Example 2: Faster R-CNN Box Encoding (Conceptual)**

```python
def faster_rcnn_box_encode(proposals, gt_boxes):
    """Conceptual Faster R-CNN box encoding using RPN proposals."""
    encoded_boxes = []
    for proposal in proposals:
      best_overlap = 0
      best_gt_index = -1
      for j, gt in enumerate(gt_boxes): # Calculate overlap with ground truth box
         overlap = compute_iou(proposal, gt)
         if overlap > best_overlap:
            best_overlap = overlap
            best_gt_index = j
      if best_gt_index != -1:
        gt = gt_boxes[best_gt_index]
        tx = (gt.cx - proposal.cx) / proposal.width
        ty = (gt.cy - proposal.cy) / proposal.height
        tw = log(gt.width / proposal.width)
        th = log(gt.height / proposal.height)
        encoded_boxes.append([tx, ty, tw, th])
      else:
        encoded_boxes.append([0,0,0,0])

    return encoded_boxes

# Example usage (simplified data structures)
proposals = [
     {'cx': 90, 'cy': 90, 'width': 40, 'height': 40},
     {'cx': 180, 'cy': 180, 'width': 60, 'height': 60}
]
gt_boxes = [
    {'cx': 110, 'cy': 110, 'width': 60, 'height': 60},
    {'cx': 220, 'cy': 220, 'width': 80, 'height': 80}
]
encoded = faster_rcnn_box_encode(proposals,gt_boxes)
print(encoded)
```

This example depicts the Faster R-CNN approach. Notice that it operates on proposed regions rather than pre-defined anchor boxes. The core offset calculation remains similar, but now it is done relative to the proposals from the RPN. These proposals vary during training and inference. This directly contrasts the behaviour of the first example.

**Example 3: Illustrative Error - Mismatched Coder**

```python
def attempt_mismatch(ssd_anchor_boxes,faster_rcnn_proposals, gt_boxes):
    """An illustrative example of what happens if box coders are mismatched."""

    # Attempt to apply the faster_rcnn_coder to an SSD setup.
    # Result will be inaccurate offsets

    faster_rcnn_encoded = faster_rcnn_box_encode(faster_rcnn_proposals, gt_boxes)
    # Imagine the SSD feature extractor receiving these as the target (mismatched).
    # The loss function and subsequent training will fail.

    ssd_encoded = ssd_box_encode(ssd_anchor_boxes,gt_boxes)

    print("Faster RCNN Encoded (Mismatched) for SSD: ",faster_rcnn_encoded)
    print("SSD Encoded: ", ssd_encoded)

ssd_anchor_boxes =  [
    {'cx': 100, 'cy': 100, 'width': 50, 'height': 50},
    {'cx': 200, 'cy': 200, 'width': 75, 'height': 75}
]
faster_rcnn_proposals = [
     {'cx': 90, 'cy': 90, 'width': 40, 'height': 40},
     {'cx': 180, 'cy': 180, 'width': 60, 'height': 60}
]
gt_boxes = [
    {'cx': 110, 'cy': 110, 'width': 60, 'height': 60},
    {'cx': 220, 'cy': 220, 'width': 80, 'height': 80}
]
attempt_mismatch(ssd_anchor_boxes, faster_rcnn_proposals, gt_boxes)
```

This example attempts to show, through conceptual code, what occurs when the incorrect encoder is applied to the wrong kind of reference frame (anchors vs proposals). The `faster_rcnn_encoded` will not represent the difference from SSD anchors and will thus lead to inaccurate training signals. The correct `ssd_encoded` for these anchors, which is different from the `faster_rcnn_encoded`, is necessary for proper training with the `SsdFeatureExtractor`.

For more comprehensive understanding of these components, I recommend consulting the TensorFlow Object Detection API documentation, particularly the sections detailing the `box_coder` and feature extractor configurations. Exploring the source code for `SsdFeatureExtractor` and the standard box coders available within the API can also provide in-depth insight. Lastly, research papers describing the Faster R-CNN and SSD architectures, can provide crucial background on the rationale for their design choices, including the reasons for the distinct box encoding strategies they adopt. These resources collectively offer a comprehensive understanding of the topic.
