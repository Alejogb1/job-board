The core challenge in managing LSTM state within TensorFlow 1.x lies in explicitly handling the hidden state and cell state tensors across timesteps.  Unlike higher-level APIs that abstract away these details, direct manipulation requires a thorough understanding of TensorFlow's computational graph and the underlying tensor operations.  My experience building sequence-to-sequence models for financial time series prediction heavily relied on this precise control, allowing for optimizations not readily available through simplified interfaces.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow 1.x's LSTM implementation, typically found within `tf.nn.rnn_cell`, doesn't automatically manage state updates in the way later versions do.  Instead, you must explicitly pass the previous state as input and retrieve the updated state as output at each timestep.  The LSTM cell itself performs the internal calculations – updating the cell state (`c`) and hidden state (`h`) based on the input and previous states – but the responsibility of carrying this state forward rests with the user.  This necessitates a loop structure, often implemented using `tf.while_loop` or a `for` loop within a TensorFlow session. The state tensors, `c` and `h`, are typically initialized with zeros or learned embeddings, depending on the application.  Mismanagement of these tensors can lead to incorrect predictions or vanishing/exploding gradients, highlighting the need for precise control.

The process involves three main steps:

* **Initialization:** Create initial hidden state (`h`) and cell state (`c`) tensors of the correct shape.  Shape depends on the LSTM's number of units.
* **Iteration:**  In a loop iterating over the input sequence, pass the current input and the *previous* state (`h`, `c`) to the LSTM cell.  The cell returns the updated state (`h_new`, `c_new`) and the output.
* **State Update:**  Assign the updated state (`h_new`, `c_new`) to the variables representing the previous state for the next iteration. This is crucial; failing to do this will result in the LSTM always operating on the same initial state.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `tf.while_loop`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def lstm_with_while_loop(inputs, num_units):
    # Input shape: [sequence_length, batch_size, input_size]
    sequence_length = tf.shape(inputs)[0]
    batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[1]

    lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(num_units)
    initial_state = lstm_cell.zero_state(batch_size, tf.float32)  # Initialize state
    h, c = initial_state

    # Define the body of the while loop
    def loop_body(i, output_ta, h, c):
        input_i = inputs[i]
        output, (h, c) = lstm_cell(input_i, (h,c)) #Update h and c in place within tf.while_loop
        output_ta = output_ta.write(i, output)
        return i + 1, output_ta, h, c

    # Define while loop condition
    def loop_condition(i, output_ta, h, c):
        return i < sequence_length

    # Run the while loop
    _, output_ta, final_h, final_c = tf.while_loop(loop_condition, loop_body, [0, tf.TensorArray(tf.float32, size=sequence_length), h, c])

    outputs = output_ta.stack()  # Stack tensor array to get outputs
    return outputs, final_h, final_c #Return the final h and c


# Example usage:
inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, None, 10])  # Example input shape
outputs, final_h, final_c = lstm_with_while_loop(inputs, 20)
# ... rest of your model ...
```

This example demonstrates the explicit state management within a `tf.while_loop`. The `loop_body` function updates the state at each timestep, and the final state is retrieved after the loop completes.  The use of `tf.TensorArray` efficiently accumulates the outputs across timesteps.

**Example 2: Using a `for` loop in a session**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def lstm_with_for_loop(inputs, num_units):
    sequence_length = tf.shape(inputs)[0]
    batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[1]
    lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(num_units)
    h = tf.zeros([batch_size, num_units])
    c = tf.zeros([batch_size, num_units])
    outputs = []

    with tf.Session() as sess:
        sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
        for i in range(int(sess.run(sequence_length))):
            input_i = inputs[i]
            output, (h, c) = sess.run([lstm_cell.call(input_i, (h, c)), lstm_cell.state_size], feed_dict = {inputs: sess.run(inputs)})
            outputs.append(output)
        return outputs, h, c

#Example Usage
inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, None, 10])
outputs, final_h, final_c = lstm_with_for_loop(inputs,20)
# ...rest of your model...
```

This approach uses a standard Python `for` loop within a TensorFlow session. This is generally less efficient than `tf.while_loop` for larger sequences due to the repeated session calls, but offers a simpler structure for debugging.


**Example 3: Handling Variable-Length Sequences**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def lstm_variable_length(inputs, sequence_lengths, num_units):
    # Inputs shape: [max_time, batch_size, input_size]
    # sequence_lengths: [batch_size] - Length of each sequence in the batch
    lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(num_units)
    batch_size = tf.shape(inputs)[1]
    initial_state = lstm_cell.zero_state(batch_size, tf.float32)
    outputs, final_state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(lstm_cell, inputs, sequence_length=sequence_lengths, initial_state=initial_state)
    return outputs, final_state


# Example Usage
inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, None, 10])
sequence_lengths = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None])
outputs, final_state = lstm_variable_length(inputs, sequence_lengths, 20)
# ... rest of your model...

```

This demonstrates handling variable-length sequences using `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn`.  `dynamic_rnn` internally manages the state updates, making it more concise but still requiring explicit state initialization. This approach is generally preferred for variable-length sequences as it's more efficient than manually managing states for varying lengths in a loop.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow 1.x documentation, particularly sections detailing RNN cells and `tf.while_loop`, is invaluable.  A good understanding of linear algebra and basic calculus related to gradients is essential.  Finally, exploring examples from research papers implementing LSTMs in TensorFlow 1.x can provide practical insights into state management techniques for specific applications.  These resources, combined with careful code experimentation, will allow you to confidently control LSTM states in TensorFlow 1.x.
