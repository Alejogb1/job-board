TensorBoard, while powerful for visualizing neural network architectures and training metrics, does not inherently display node or cell names within computational graphs unless explicitly configured. This absence of names can severely hinder debugging and architectural comprehension, especially for complex models. I've encountered this frustration firsthand debugging recurrent neural networks with hundreds of layers; without identifiable names, tracing data flow becomes nearly impossible. The process requires explicit assignment of names within your TensorFlow or Keras model definition, and then these names will be propagated to the TensorBoard graph representation. This response will outline how to achieve this using TensorFlow, with Keras as a relevant but derivative example.

The underlying mechanism hinges on TensorFlow’s support for name scopes and the `.name` attribute on TensorFlow operations and tensors. When defining your graph, any operation or tensor created within a `tf.name_scope` will have its name prefixed with the scope. This allows for logically grouping related operations and provides a hierarchical structure to the generated graph. Without such explicit naming, TensorFlow resorts to auto-generating names, which are generally uninformative. This also applies to Keras, which leverages TensorFlow's core graph building. Keras models and layers can be named which cascades down to the underlying graph.

Let's start with a basic example using pure TensorFlow operations:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_named_graph():
  with tf.name_scope("input_layer"):
    input_tensor = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 784], name="input_data")
    weights = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([784, 128]), name="weights")
    bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([128]), name="bias")
    
  with tf.name_scope("hidden_layer"):
    pre_activation = tf.matmul(input_tensor, weights) + bias
    activation = tf.nn.relu(pre_activation, name="relu_activation")

  with tf.name_scope("output_layer"):
      output_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([128, 10]), name="output_weights")
      output_bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]), name="output_bias")
      output_tensor = tf.matmul(activation, output_weights) + output_bias

  return output_tensor


output = create_named_graph()

# Create a summary writer for TensorBoard
writer = tf.summary.FileWriter("logs", tf.get_default_graph())
writer.close()
```

In this example, I’ve encapsulated operations within three `tf.name_scope` contexts: `input_layer`, `hidden_layer`, and `output_layer`. Further, I've added specific `name` attributes to individual tensors and variables. When you execute this and then launch TensorBoard (using command `tensorboard --logdir logs`), you will observe the graph is now hierarchical, with clearly labeled input, hidden, and output sections, and specific node names within those. The `input_data` placeholder will be explicitly named; similarly, you will see named weights and biases, along with the `relu_activation` node. The names provided, like `weights` or `output_bias`, are not just for convenience; they are the actual names that TensorBoard uses to represent nodes.  This enhances debuggability and allows you to pinpoint specific operations visually.

The naming convention extends to Keras as well, though with a slightly different syntax. Keras models and layers automatically inherit naming and the `name` attribute is the primary mechanism for this. Consider this example:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def create_named_keras_model():
  input_layer = keras.layers.Input(shape=(784,), name="input_layer")

  hidden_layer = keras.layers.Dense(128, activation="relu", name="hidden_dense")(input_layer)

  output_layer = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax", name="output_dense")(hidden_layer)
  
  model = keras.models.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer, name="my_named_model")
  return model

model = create_named_keras_model()

# Create a summary writer for TensorBoard
writer = tf.summary.FileWriter("keras_logs", tf.keras.backend.get_session().graph)
writer.close()
```

Here, I named both the layers and the model. The key difference is that the name is passed to the constructor of the layer instead of `tf.name_scope`.  Again, when you view this in TensorBoard under the 'keras\_logs' log directory, the graph clearly displays the `input_layer` with its associated input, a dense layer named `hidden_dense`, and a dense output layer named `output_dense`, all under the overall model name `my_named_model`.  The graph structure and the node names follow the Keras model definition. This naming convention is critical for managing complex Keras architectures and identifying bottlenecks or issues specific to individual layers.

Finally, consider a more complex example, a recurrent neural network using TensorFlow, where the proper naming is of greater importance due to its temporal structure:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_named_rnn_graph():
  with tf.name_scope("input_section"):
      input_ph = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10, 100], name="rnn_input")

  with tf.name_scope("lstm_section"):
    lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(num_units=128, name="lstm_cell")
    initial_state = lstm_cell.zero_state(tf.shape(input_ph)[0], tf.float32)
    outputs, final_state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(lstm_cell, input_ph, initial_state=initial_state, dtype=tf.float32, name="dynamic_rnn")


  with tf.name_scope("output_section"):
    output_weights = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([128, 20]), name="output_weights")
    output_bias = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([20]), name="output_bias")
    
    last_output = outputs[:, -1, :]  #Take the output from the last step
    output_tensor = tf.matmul(last_output, output_weights) + output_bias
    
  return output_tensor

output = create_named_rnn_graph()

# Create a summary writer for TensorBoard
writer = tf.summary.FileWriter("rnn_logs", tf.get_default_graph())
writer.close()
```

In this RNN example, you see  the crucial role of name scopes in structuring the graph representation.  The `input_section` clearly demarcates where input enters the graph and, importantly, so does the `lstm_section` with the core RNN structure. The 'dynamic\_rnn' operator node is particularly useful as it shows the entry point of the recurrent process into TensorBoard and can be isolated when required. Finally, the `output_section` shows final transformation and output.  Without these name scopes and node names, the RNN structure in the TensorBoard would be a less comprehensible collection of operations, making debugging and analysis exceedingly difficult.  The explicit naming makes the temporal and structural flow clear.

In my experience, it's not uncommon to spend significant time debugging model issues, and these problems are often related to the connections between specific operations.  The ability to quickly identify these operations by node name within TensorBoard becomes invaluable. Furthermore, explicit naming contributes to the readability and maintainability of the code base itself as it forces you to logically structure and consider your model's design.

For further learning, resources that provide a deep dive into TensorFlow naming conventions are highly recommended. Specifically, the TensorFlow documentation on name scopes, variables, and placeholders, are key areas to explore.  Furthermore, the Keras documentation concerning naming of layers and models is important for proper use in the context of its higher-level API. Exploring any published examples of complex models is also beneficial; examine the way the graph naming is structured in those cases. Lastly, it's prudent to examine open-source model architectures where careful graph naming is often implemented.  These resources provide a foundational understanding of the how and why behind the explicit naming of graph components, rather than simply showing a recipe for adding names.
