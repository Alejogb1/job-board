The core issue with `optim()` failing when function arguments are passed through an intermediary function in R stems from how environments and lexical scoping interact with optimization routines. I’ve encountered this several times while building custom likelihood functions for Bayesian modeling and have had to carefully debug parameter passing. The root problem lies not directly with `optim()` itself, but rather with the function it is evaluating. When `optim()` receives a function, it expects to modify parameters within *that* function's environment, typically by changing a vector of input values. However, if this target function is constructed by another function, particularly one that encloses argument values, the environment within which `optim()` attempts changes may not be the one containing the parameters that are intended for optimization.

Here's a breakdown: `optim()` manipulates a vector of numeric values – these are the parameters it’s meant to iteratively improve. When a user defines a function `f` to be optimized, this `f` usually contains these parameters within its scope. If `f` is passed directly to `optim()`, R can readily modify them because `optim()`'s scope allows alteration to `f`'s immediate environment. When a generating function, let's call it `make_f`, is introduced which creates and returns `f`, the parameters might no longer reside in `f`’s scope directly. Instead they become captured by `make_f`'s scope, or even enclosed deeper depending on how the generating function is constructed. This capturing of parameter values within a different environment, or *closure*, means that `optim()`, operating within the scope of the function `f` it directly receives, cannot modify the desired values. It is working with different copies or placeholders for the parameters. Consequently, `optim()` may return nonsense results, infinite values, or an error.

To clarify this, consider three scenarios, presented below as working code examples.

**Example 1: Direct Function Application (Working)**

This first example illustrates the canonical case where `optim()` functions as intended, because there are no intermediate environment-generating functions.

```R
# Define the target function
target_function <- function(x) {
  x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 + 2*x[1]*x[2] # A simple quadratic
}

# Initial guess for parameters
initial_params <- c(1, 1)

# Optimize using optim
optimization_result <- optim(initial_params, target_function)

# Output the optimized parameters
optimization_result$par
```
In this basic case, `target_function` directly uses the parameter vector `x` passed by `optim()`. `optim()` makes alterations to `x` within the scope of `target_function`, and those changes directly affect the objective. The output will be near `c(0, 0)`. This serves as a functional baseline.

**Example 2: Improper Function Generation (Failing)**

This second example demonstrates the problem with passing arguments through an intermediary function.

```R
# Function that returns a target function with fixed args
make_target_function_bad <- function(a, b) {
  function(x) {
    (x[1] - a)^2 + (x[2] - b)^2  # Target function with parameters in scope of make_f
  }
}

# Generate the target function, setting a=2, b=3
target_function_bad <- make_target_function_bad(2, 3)

# Initial parameters
initial_params <- c(0, 0)

# Run the optimizer - this will fail
optimization_result_bad <- optim(initial_params, target_function_bad)

# This result will be suboptimal
optimization_result_bad$par
```
Here, `make_target_function_bad` creates a function that contains the parameters `a` and `b` as free variables. These values are captured in the scope of `make_target_function_bad` when `target_function_bad` is created. Even though `optim()` changes the vector `x`, these updates don't change the values of `a` and `b`, meaning the optimization will not target a minimum. It will likely return `initial_params`. The problem resides in the closure: `a` and `b` are not within the scope `optim()` is modifying, `x` within `target_function_bad`. The actual parameters that need optimization are locked away in `make_target_function_bad`'s environment.

**Example 3: Corrected Function Generation (Working with a Modification)**

The final example shows one solution, which is to pass parameters using a single vector in both functions.

```R
# Function that returns a target function where parameters are in a shared environment
make_target_function_good <- function() {
  function(x) {
      a = x[1] # Extract a from x
      b = x[2] # Extract b from x
    (a - 2)^2 + (b - 3)^2 # Target function using extracted parameters
  }
}

# Generate target function
target_function_good <- make_target_function_good()

# Extended initial parameters with parameters a and b
initial_params_good <- c(0, 0)

# Optimise this should work
optimization_result_good <- optim(initial_params_good, target_function_good)

# These optimized parameters should be close to [2,3]
optimization_result_good$par
```
In this case, the parameters `a` and `b` are now directly part of the vector `x` passed into the target function. Instead of capturing them as free variables, the `make_target_function_good` function uses `x[1]` and `x[2]` to access `a` and `b`, respectively. Since `optim()` modifies `x`, it directly adjusts the values being used in the objective function, resulting in convergence. The solution in the third case isn't about an entirely new mechanism, but simply structuring the parameter passing correctly; they are in the same environment from the point of view of `optim()`, as a single vector that it modifies.

This issue, stemming from R’s lexical scoping rules, is very common when constructing higher-order functions or working with complex objective functions requiring parameter pre-processing. When employing more sophisticated modelling techniques, which often require creating custom functions for optimization, it becomes crucial to understand how environments operate in R in order to avoid problems like this.

To deepen understanding, I recommend reviewing documentation on R's functional programming paradigm, paying close attention to function closures, lexical scoping, and environments. Additionally, researching topics related to gradient-based optimization methods may help to understand what specific inputs are required by optimizers, and thereby avoid incorrect function inputs. Books providing a deep dive into R's computational mechanics will be very beneficial to understanding the subtle environment problems present when working with optimizers like `optim()`. Finally, exploring packages in the R ecosystem specifically designed for optimization problems will offer exposure to robust methodologies and best practices related to function argument structure.
