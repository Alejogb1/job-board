TensorFlow's native equivalent to Keras' `UpSampling2D` layer isn't a single, directly analogous function.  The functionality of `UpSampling2D`, which performs nearest-neighbor or bilinear upsampling of a 2D input tensor, is achieved through a combination of TensorFlow's core operations or via the `tf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D` layer itself (which is part of the TensorFlow ecosystem even though it originates from Keras).  My experience building high-resolution image generation models has taught me that understanding this nuance is crucial for efficient and correct implementation.  Directly substituting `UpSampling2D` from a Keras model into a pure TensorFlow graph often requires rewriting the upsampling step.

**1.  Explanation:**

Keras' `UpSampling2D` primarily serves to increase the spatial dimensions (height and width) of a feature map. It does so without learning any parameters; it simply duplicates existing pixels or interpolates values between them.  Nearest-neighbor upsampling replicates existing pixel values, leading to a blocky appearance in the upsampled output. Bilinear upsampling computes weighted averages of neighboring pixels, producing a smoother result.

In pure TensorFlow, we bypass the Keras layer abstraction and utilize lower-level tensor manipulation functions.  Specifically, `tf.image.resize` provides the core functionality for upsampling.  This function offers control over the interpolation method (`method` argument), mirroring the choices offered by `UpSampling2D`'s `interpolation` parameter (nearest or bilinear).  Crucially, the `tf.image.resize` function operates directly on TensorFlow tensors, offering greater flexibility for integration into custom TensorFlow graphs and avoiding potential issues related to layer compatibility encountered when intermixing Keras and TensorFlow.  Choosing between `tf.image.resize` and `tf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D` depends primarily on the context of your project; if working purely within a Keras model, the layer is generally more convenient.  If integrating upsampling into a custom TensorFlow graph or needing finer control over the resizing process, `tf.image.resize` provides the necessary flexibility.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Nearest-neighbor upsampling using `tf.image.resize`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Input tensor:  Batch size, height, width, channels
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 64, 64, 3))

# Upsample using nearest-neighbor interpolation
upsampled_tensor = tf.image.resize(input_tensor, size=(128, 128), method=tf.image.ResizeMethod.NEAREST_NEIGHBOR)

# Verify shape change
print(upsampled_tensor.shape) # Output: (1, 128, 128, 3)
```

This example demonstrates the straightforward application of `tf.image.resize` for nearest-neighbor upsampling. The `size` argument specifies the desired output dimensions, and `method` explicitly selects the nearest-neighbor interpolation. I've utilized this approach extensively in my work on super-resolution tasks where computational efficiency is paramount.

**Example 2: Bilinear upsampling using `tf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D`**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Input tensor
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 64, 64, 3))

# Define the upsampling layer
upsampling_layer = keras.layers.UpSampling2D(size=(2, 2), interpolation='bilinear')

# Apply the layer
upsampled_tensor = upsampling_layer(input_tensor)

# Verify shape
print(upsampled_tensor.shape)  # Output: (1, 128, 128, 3)
```

Here, I leverage the Keras layer directly within a Keras workflow.  This is often the most convenient method when building models using the Keras Sequential or Functional API. Note that this approach is less flexible than the direct TensorFlow method if you need to control the upsampling behavior beyond the standard options offered by `UpSampling2D`.

**Example 3:  Upsampling within a custom TensorFlow graph:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def upsample_tensor(input_tensor, size):
  """Custom function for upsampling within a TensorFlow graph."""
  upsampled_tensor = tf.image.resize(input_tensor, size=size, method=tf.image.ResizeMethod.BILINEAR)
  return upsampled_tensor

# Example usage:
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 32, 32, 3))
upsampled_tensor = upsample_tensor(input_tensor, size=(64, 64))
print(upsampled_tensor.shape)  # Output: (1, 64, 64, 3)
```

This demonstrates embedding upsampling within a custom TensorFlow graph.  This approach becomes essential when constructing complex computational graphs, especially when performance optimization techniques such as graph compilation are necessary. The use of `@tf.function` enhances performance by compiling the function into an optimized graph execution plan.  In my experience, managing memory and optimization in complex TensorFlow graphs often requires precisely this level of control.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* The official TensorFlow documentation.  It provides comprehensive details on all TensorFlow functions and layers.
*  A good book on deep learning with TensorFlow/Keras. The practical examples significantly aid understanding.
*  Research papers detailing advanced techniques in image upsampling and super-resolution. These provide a deeper theoretical foundation for making informed decisions regarding upsampling methods.


Through careful consideration of the context and the trade-off between convenience and control, one can efficiently replicate and even extend the functionality of Keras' `UpSampling2D` within the broader TensorFlow ecosystem.  Direct substitution is often not necessary, and understanding the underlying mechanics of upsampling through TensorFlow's core operations often proves more beneficial in the long run, particularly for tasks involving intricate model designs and performance optimizations.
