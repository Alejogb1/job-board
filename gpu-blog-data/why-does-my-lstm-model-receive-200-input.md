The discrepancy between the expected single input tensor and the 200 tensors your LSTM model receives stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how LSTM layers process sequential data and, specifically, how your data is being fed into the model.  In my experience troubleshooting recurrent neural networks, this error often arises from an incorrect understanding of the expected input shape, frequently related to batch processing and the temporal dimension.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

LSTMs, unlike feedforward networks, are designed to handle sequential data.  The critical aspect to grasp is the distinction between the *timesteps* within a single sequence and the *batch size*.  A single sequence, such as a sentence or a time series, is represented as a sequence of vectors.  Each vector corresponds to a timestep, representing the features at that point in the sequence. For instance, in Natural Language Processing, each vector could represent a word embedding.  The batch size defines how many sequences are processed concurrently.  Therefore, the input tensor to an LSTM layer needs three dimensions: (batch_size, timesteps, features).

Your model expects a single input tensor, suggesting it’s configured for a batch size of 1. However, you’re feeding it 200 tensors. This indicates that your data loading or preprocessing step is incorrectly providing 200 individual sequences, instead of a single batch containing all 200 sequences. The model is interpreting each of these 200 tensors as a separate batch of size 1, leading to the error.  The solution is to reshape your data into the correct three-dimensional tensor.  This might involve aggregating individual sequences or modifying your data generator.

Over the course of my career, I've encountered this precise issue multiple times while working on projects involving sentiment analysis of customer reviews and financial time series forecasting.  In both cases, the root cause was consistently a mismatch between the expected input shape and the actual shape of the data fed to the LSTM.  Carefully inspecting the dimensions of your input data before feeding it to the model is crucial in preventing this common error.  In my earlier projects, I mistakenly assumed that providing individual sequences would work, only to encounter precisely this problem. The resulting debugging process highlighted the necessity for meticulous attention to data formatting.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's assume your data is stored in a NumPy array called `data`.  Each element in `data` represents a single sequence (e.g., a sentence represented by word embeddings).  The shape of `data` is (200, timesteps, features).

**Example 1: Correctly Reshaping Data using NumPy:**

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'data' is a NumPy array of shape (200, timesteps, features)
data = np.random.rand(200, 50, 100) # Example data: 200 sequences, 50 timesteps, 100 features

# Reshape the data for batch processing.  This assumes a batch size of 200.
reshaped_data = data

#Define LSTM model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(50, 100)), # Input shape is (timesteps, features)
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(reshaped_data, np.random.rand(200,1), epochs=10) #Example target data
```

This example directly utilizes the entire dataset as a single batch.  This is appropriate if your dataset is not excessively large to fit in memory.  The `input_shape` parameter in the LSTM layer specifies the expected shape of a single sequence (timesteps, features), not the batch size. The batch size is handled automatically by TensorFlow/Keras.

**Example 2: Using TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset` for Batching:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

data = np.random.rand(200, 50, 100)  # Example data: 200 sequences, 50 timesteps, 100 features
labels = np.random.rand(200,1)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
dataset = dataset.batch(200) # Batch size of 200

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(50, 100)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(dataset, epochs=10)
```

This approach utilizes TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset` API, which is highly recommended for efficient data handling, especially with large datasets. This example explicitly defines the batch size during dataset creation, ensuring the data is fed to the model correctly. This method is preferred for larger datasets that may not fit into memory.

**Example 3: Handling Variable Sequence Lengths:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

#Data with variable sequence length (padding is necessary)
data = [np.random.rand(i, 100) for i in np.random.randint(20, 60, 200)] #200 sequences, features=100, varying timesteps
data = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(data, maxlen=60, padding='post') # Pad sequences to max length

labels = np.random.rand(200,1)

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((data, labels))
dataset = dataset.batch(200)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(64, input_shape=(None, 100), return_sequences=False), # input_shape=(None, features) for variable sequence lengths
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(dataset, epochs=10)

```

This example demonstrates how to handle sequences with varying lengths.  Padding is crucial to ensure all sequences have the same length before being fed into the LSTM.  The `input_shape` parameter now includes `None` for the timesteps dimension, indicating variable length sequences. The `return_sequences=False` argument ensures that only the output of the last timestep is returned.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I would suggest consulting the official documentation for the deep learning framework you are utilizing (TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, etc.).  A thorough understanding of the data structures and input requirements for recurrent neural networks is essential.  Furthermore, exploring introductory materials on sequence modeling and LSTM networks will provide a strong foundation.  Finally, reviewing examples of LSTM implementations focusing on data handling and preprocessing will offer valuable practical insights.  Pay close attention to the shape and dimensionality of the tensors at every stage of your data pipeline.  This attention to detail often proves the key to resolving these types of input errors.
