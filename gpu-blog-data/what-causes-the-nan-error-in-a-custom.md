The NaN (Not a Number) error encountered during training a custom Inception v3 model with sigmoid cross-entropy is almost invariably linked to numerical instability stemming from gradients exploding or vanishing during the backpropagation phase.  My experience debugging similar issues across various deep learning projects, including a large-scale image classification task involving satellite imagery, points towards several root causes, all ultimately traceable to problematic gradients.  These range from improperly scaled inputs and targets to architectural flaws and, less frequently, optimizer hyperparameter misconfigurations.

**1.  Explanation:**

The sigmoid activation function, often used in the final layer of binary classification problems and frequently paired with cross-entropy loss, maps any real-valued input to the range (0, 1).  However, its derivatives are bounded by 0 and 0.25. When chained across many layers, as in a deep network like Inception v3, this can lead to the vanishing gradient problem.  Extremely small gradients effectively prevent weight updates, causing the model to stop learning.  Conversely, extremely large gradients can lead to exploding gradients, resulting in numerical overflows and the generation of NaN values. This is exacerbated by sigmoid cross-entropy, which can produce unstable gradients for extreme values of predicted probabilities (close to 0 or 1).

Another common contributor is improper data scaling. If input features or target labels contain extremely large or small values, the intermediate calculations within the network can easily surpass the numerical limits of floating-point representation, resulting in NaNs.  This is particularly relevant given the depth and complexity of the Inception v3 architecture.  Furthermore, incorrect implementation of the loss function or its gradient calculation can also lead to the generation of NaNs.  A subtle bug in the custom implementation can easily introduce erroneous computations, propagating NaNs through the backpropagation process.

Finally, less frequent but still possible culprits are optimizer issues. Using an inappropriately large learning rate can cause weight updates that lead to instability, particularly when coupled with already unstable gradients.  Similarly, certain optimizers might be inherently less stable than others in this specific context, though this is less common than the aforementioned issues.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

The following examples illustrate potential scenarios leading to NaN errors, focusing on data scaling, gradient instability, and loss function implementation.  All examples assume the use of TensorFlow/Keras, which is the framework I've extensively employed in my previous projects.  Adaptation to PyTorch would be straightforward, involving primarily syntax changes.

**Example 1:  Unscaled Inputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Un-normalized inputs leading to potential overflow
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 299, 299, 3) * 1000  # Very large values
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)

model = tf.keras.applications.InceptionV3(weights=None, classes=1, include_top=True, activation='sigmoid')
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Training will likely produce NaN
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

**Commentary:**  The input data `X_train` contains extremely large values (0-1000).  These large values can lead to numerical instability during the forward and backward passes, culminating in NaN values.  Normalization, typically scaling to a 0-1 range or using techniques like z-score normalization, is crucial to mitigate this.


**Example 2: Gradient Instability (Vanishing Gradient)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.applications.InceptionV3(weights=None, classes=1, include_top=True, activation='sigmoid')
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01), loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Extremely deep network with many sigmoid layers can exhibit vanishing gradients
# This example is illustrative and doesn't explicitly create a deeper network 
# but highlights the underlying principle

# ... training with potentially unstable gradients ...
model.fit(X_train_normalized, y_train, epochs=10)  # X_train_normalized is appropriately scaled data.
```

**Commentary:** Even with scaled inputs, the deep architecture of Inception v3, combined with multiple sigmoid activations, can inherently cause vanishing gradients.  While this example doesn't explicitly show the creation of an exceptionally deep network to amplify the problem, the principle remains that the compound effect of multiple sigmoids and their limited derivatives can suppress gradient propagation.  Careful architectural choices or utilizing alternative activation functions (e.g., ReLU, ELU) can address this.  Adding Batch Normalization layers throughout the model can also be effective.


**Example 3: Incorrect Loss Function Implementation**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    # Incorrect implementation: potential division by zero
    return -tf.reduce_mean(y_true * tf.math.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * tf.math.log(1 - y_pred))

model = tf.keras.applications.InceptionV3(weights=None, classes=1, include_top=True, activation='sigmoid')
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss)
model.fit(X_train_normalized, y_train, epochs=10)
```


**Commentary:** This demonstrates a hypothetical case of an incorrect binary cross-entropy implementation. While the given function is conceptually correct, edge cases, particularly `y_pred` being exactly 0 or 1, can lead to `log(0)` which results in negative infinity, hence NaN after averaging. A robust implementation should handle such scenarios through small epsilon additions to `y_pred` to prevent this.  This highlights the importance of thoroughly testing custom loss functions and carefully reviewing their implementation for potential numerical instabilities.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

*  Deep Learning textbooks focusing on numerical stability and optimization algorithms.
*  Research papers addressing vanishing and exploding gradients in deep neural networks.
*  Documentation for your chosen deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.), focusing on optimizer and loss function details.  Pay close attention to the mathematical formulas provided.  Reproduce them step by step to understand their limitations.


By systematically addressing potential sources of numerical instability, such as through proper data scaling, careful choice of activation functions, architecture refinements, and thorough verification of custom components, you can effectively mitigate the occurrence of NaN errors during the training of your custom Inception v3 model.  Remember that meticulous debugging, often involving print statements to examine intermediate values, and incremental experimentation are invaluable during this process.
