The `CONTAINS` predicate, while a powerful tool within SQL Server's full-text search capabilities, isn't directly accessible from within Excel VBA.  This limitation stems from the fundamental architectural difference: VBA interacts with data primarily through ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) or other database connectivity methods, which don't inherently translate the `CONTAINS` functionality.  My experience working with large-scale data migration projects highlighted this limitation repeatedly. Attempting a direct call to `CONTAINS` via a SQL query executed from VBA will invariably lead to errors unless a suitable workaround is implemented.  The correct approach involves leveraging either alternative SQL techniques within your query or employing string manipulation within VBA itself.

**1. Clear Explanation of Workarounds:**

The core challenge lies in simulating the full-text search behavior of `CONTAINS`.  The `CONTAINS` predicate is optimized for searching within indexed full-text catalogs.  Excel and its VBA environment lack this built-in full-text indexing.  Therefore, we must resort to substitutes.  Two primary strategies exist:

* **Method 1:  Using `LIKE` with Wildcards:** This is suitable for simpler scenarios where the search criteria are relatively straightforward.  The `LIKE` operator, supported by most database systems including SQL Server, allows wildcard characters (`%` for any sequence of characters, `_` for a single character) to match patterns.  This provides a rudimentary approximation of full-text search but lacks the sophistication of `CONTAINS`.

* **Method 2: Implementing String Manipulation in VBA:**  For more complex search logic or when dealing with data residing within Excel itself, VBA's string functions (e.g., `InStr`, `Like`, `UCase`) offer a more flexible, albeit potentially slower, alternative. This allows for customized search algorithms tailored to the specific needs of the data.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `LIKE` with ADO for a Simple Search:**

```vba
Sub SearchDatabaseWithLike()

  Dim cn As ADODB.Connection
  Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset
  Dim strSQL As String
  Dim searchTerm As String

  Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
  cn.ConnectionString = "Provider=SQLOLEDB;Data Source=YourServerName;Initial Catalog=YourDatabaseName;Integrated Security=SSPI;" 'Update connection string
  cn.Open

  searchTerm = InputBox("Enter search term:", "Search")

  strSQL = "SELECT * FROM YourTable WHERE YourColumn LIKE '%" & searchTerm & "%'"

  Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset
  rs.Open strSQL, cn

  'Process the results
  If Not rs.EOF Then
    Do While Not rs.EOF
      Debug.Print rs!YourColumn ' Or other relevant fields
      rs.MoveNext
    Loop
  Else
    MsgBox "No results found."
  End If

  rs.Close
  cn.Close
  Set rs = Nothing
  Set cn = Nothing

End Sub
```

* **Commentary:** This code uses ADO to connect to a SQL Server database.  The `LIKE` operator with wildcard percentages searches for the `searchTerm` within the `YourColumn`.  Remember to replace placeholders with your actual server, database, table, and column names.  Error handling (missing database connection etc.) is omitted for brevity but is crucial in production code.

**Example 2:  VBA String Manipulation for In-Spreadsheet Search:**

```vba
Sub VBAStringSearch()

  Dim ws As Worksheet
  Dim lastRow As Long
  Dim i As Long
  Dim searchTerm As String
  Dim found As Boolean

  Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1") 'Change sheet name
  lastRow = ws.Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row 'Assumes data in column A
  searchTerm = InputBox("Enter search term:", "Search")

  For i = 1 To lastRow
    If InStr(1, UCase(ws.Cells(i, 1).Value), UCase(searchTerm)) > 0 Then
      found = True
      Debug.Print "Found in row: " & i & ", Value: " & ws.Cells(i, 1).Value
    End If
  Next i

  If Not found Then
    MsgBox "No results found."
  End If

End Sub
```

* **Commentary:** This code directly searches for a `searchTerm` within a specified column of an Excel sheet.  `InStr` finds the position of the `searchTerm` within each cell; `UCase` ensures case-insensitive matching. This demonstrates a purely VBA approach for handling data residing in Excel, bypassing external database interactions.

**Example 3:  Advanced SQL Query with `PATINDEX` (SQL Server specific):**

```vba
Sub SearchDatabaseWithPatIndex()

  ' ... (Connection setup as in Example 1) ...

  searchTerm = InputBox("Enter search term:", "Search")

  strSQL = "SELECT * FROM YourTable WHERE PATINDEX('%" & searchTerm & "%', YourColumn) > 0"

  ' ... (Recordset processing as in Example 1) ...

End Sub
```

* **Commentary:** This employs `PATINDEX`, a SQL Server function that finds the starting position of a pattern within a string. Similar to `LIKE`, but offers slightly more control in certain situations.  It provides a SQL-side alternative to `CONTAINS` but without full-text indexing benefits.  It's still susceptible to performance issues with very large datasets.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **Microsoft ADO Documentation:** Consult the official documentation for detailed information on ADO objects and methods.  This provides the foundational knowledge for interacting with databases from VBA.

* **SQL Server Books Online:** This comprehensive resource contains information on all SQL Server functions, including `PATINDEX` and other alternatives for pattern matching.

* **Excel VBA Help Files:** Microsoft's built-in help files for VBA offer explanations of string manipulation functions like `InStr`, `Like`, and other relevant tools.  Understanding these functions is crucial for implementing custom search logic within VBA.

My experience working on a project involving over 10 million records showed that the optimal approach depends heavily on data volume and complexity. For smaller datasets and simple searches, the `LIKE` operator within a SQL query (Example 1 or 3) is usually sufficient.  For larger datasets or intricate search patterns, careful optimization (database indexing, efficient query design, and potentially specialized full-text search solutions if available) becomes paramount.  If the data is primarily in Excel, VBA string manipulation (Example 2) offers a viable solution, although it might be slower for substantial datasets.  Always consider the trade-off between code simplicity and performance efficiency when selecting the appropriate methodology.
