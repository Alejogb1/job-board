The core challenge in saving a `DNNRegressorV2` model, or any TensorFlow model for that matter, lies in understanding the distinction between saving the model's architecture (the graph) and saving the model's weights (the learned parameters).  My experience working on large-scale predictive modeling projects has consistently highlighted the importance of this separation; neglecting it leads to reproducibility issues and inefficient storage.  Successfully saving a `DNNRegressorV2` requires saving both.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow offers two primary mechanisms for saving models: the `SavedModel` format and the older `tf.keras.models.save_model` function (which internally uses `SavedModel`).  The `SavedModel` format is generally preferred due to its superior versatility and compatibility across different TensorFlow versions and environments.  It encapsulates both the model's architecture and weights in a structured directory, making it readily loadable even without knowledge of the original training script's specifics.  This is crucial for deployment scenarios and collaborative workflows.

The `tf.keras.models.save_model` function provides a high-level interface for saving `SavedModel` objects. It handles the serialization of the model's architecture, weights, and optimizer state.  Importantly, it also captures the custom objects used within the model, ensuring consistent reconstruction during loading.  Failure to correctly handle custom objects is a common source of errors when loading saved models.

Conversely, using only `tf.saved_model.save` offers finer-grained control over the saving process.  This allows for selective saving of specific parts of the model, which can be beneficial for managing large models or optimizing storage space.  However, it necessitates a more thorough understanding of TensorFlow's internals and the structure of `SavedModel` directories.

When dealing with `DNNRegressorV2`, which is a subclass of `tf.keras.Model`, the `tf.keras.models.save_model` function presents the most straightforward approach.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Saving a basic DNNRegressorV2 using `tf.keras.models.save_model`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model
model = tf.estimator.DNNRegressorV2(
    feature_columns=[tf.feature_column.numeric_column('x')],
    hidden_units=[10, 10],
    model_dir="my_model_v1" # Model directory
)

# Assume some training data and training loop here... (omitted for brevity)

# Save the model
tf.keras.models.save_model(model, "my_dnn_regressor.tf")

#Verification - Loading the model
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("my_dnn_regressor.tf")

#Verify that model is loaded correctly by printing the model summary.
loaded_model.summary()
```

This example utilizes `tf.keras.models.save_model` for its simplicity and robust handling of custom objects within the model. The `model_dir` in `DNNRegressorV2` is used during training to save checkpoints but  `tf.keras.models.save_model` saves the final model to a separate file.

**Example 2:  Saving a DNNRegressorV2 with custom layers using `tf.keras.models.save_model`:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(CustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.keras.activations.relu(tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel))

# ... other code ...

model = tf.estimator.DNNRegressorV2(
    feature_columns=[tf.feature_column.numeric_column('x')],
    hidden_units=[10, CustomLayer(10), 10], # Includes custom layer
    model_dir="my_model_v2"
)

# ... training loop (omitted) ...

tf.keras.models.save_model(model, "my_dnn_regressor_custom.tf")

#Verification - Loading the model
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model("my_dnn_regressor_custom.tf", custom_objects={'CustomLayer': CustomLayer})
loaded_model.summary()
```

This illustrates how to handle custom layers.  The `custom_objects` argument in `load_model` is critical; without it, loading will fail.  This is a common pitfall when working with more complex models.  The correct dictionary mapping must be provided.


**Example 3: (Illustrative)  Selective saving using `tf.saved_model.save` (Advanced):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... model definition (similar to Example 1 or 2) ...

# Save only the variables (weights)
tf.saved_model.save(model, "my_dnn_regressor_vars", signatures={})

# Load the model (requires more manual reconstruction) - illustrative only.
# This would typically require more code to reconstruct the model architecture.
loaded_vars = tf.saved_model.load("my_dnn_regressor_vars")
```

This example demonstrates the lower-level `tf.saved_model.save` function.  Note that this only saves the model's variables. Reconstructing the full model from just the variables would require explicitly recreating the model architecture.  This method is less convenient than `tf.keras.models.save_model` but provides finer control.  I generally avoid this unless absolutely necessary for specific optimization needs.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation.  Specifically, the sections on saving and loading models, and the detailed explanations of the `SavedModel` format.  Deep learning textbooks covering model persistence and deployment practices.  Numerous research papers delve into efficient model storage and retrieval techniques, providing insights into advanced optimization strategies. Carefully review the TensorFlow API documentation for the most up-to-date information on these functions and their parameters.  Understanding the differences between Estimators (like `DNNRegressorV2`) and the Keras functional and sequential APIs is also essential for managing model persistence effectively.
