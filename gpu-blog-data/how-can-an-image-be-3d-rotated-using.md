The core principle underlying 3D rotation of an image using a depth map lies in the transformation of 2D image coordinates into 3D space, applying the rotation in that space, and then projecting the result back onto the 2D image plane.  This requires accurate depth information, which the depth map provides.  In my experience working on a photogrammetry pipeline for architectural modeling, this precise transformation was critical for aligning point clouds and generating realistic 3D models from overlapping images.  Inaccurate depth maps invariably led to distortions and artifacts in the final rotated image.

**1.  Explanation:**

The process begins with the depth map, a grayscale image where each pixel value represents the distance from the camera to the corresponding point in the scene.  This depth information, combined with the camera's intrinsic parameters (focal length, principal point) and extrinsic parameters (rotation and translation), allows us to reconstruct the 3D coordinates of each pixel.  Once in 3D space, we can apply a rotation matrix to transform the coordinates according to the desired rotation angles (around X, Y, and Z axes). Finally, the transformed 3D points are projected back onto the image plane using the camera's intrinsic parameters to produce the rotated 2D image.

Mathematically, the process involves these steps:

* **Coordinate Transformation:**  Convert pixel coordinates (u, v) from the image plane to camera coordinates (X_c, Y_c, Z_c) using the depth map (Z_c) and intrinsic parameters:

   X_c = (u - c_x) * Z_c / f_x
   Y_c = (v - c_y) * Z_c / f_y

   where (c_x, c_y) is the principal point and (f_x, f_y) are the focal lengths in pixels along the x and y axes.

* **Rotation:**  Apply a 3D rotation matrix R to the camera coordinates to obtain the rotated camera coordinates (X_c', Y_c', Z_c'):

   [X_c']   [ R_11  R_12  R_13 ] [X_c]
   [Y_c'] = [ R_21  R_22  R_23 ] [Y_c]
   [Z_c']   [ R_31  R_32  R_33 ] [Z_c]

   The rotation matrix R is derived from the desired rotation angles around the X, Y, and Z axes using elementary rotation matrices.

* **Projection:**  Project the rotated camera coordinates back onto the image plane using the intrinsic parameters:

   u' = f_x * X_c' / Z_c' + c_x
   v' = f_y * Y_c' / Z_c' + c_y

   (u', v') represent the pixel coordinates in the rotated image.  Interpolation techniques (e.g., bilinear or bicubic) are necessary to handle non-integer pixel coordinates.


**2. Code Examples:**

The following examples demonstrate the process using Python and libraries such as NumPy and OpenCV.  These are simplified implementations and may require adjustments based on specific depth map formats and camera parameters.

**Example 1: Basic Rotation using NumPy**

```python
import numpy as np

def rotate_image_depth(image, depth, rx, ry, rz):
    # Intrinsic parameters (example values)
    fx, fy = 500, 500
    cx, cy = image.shape[1]/2, image.shape[0]/2

    # Rotation matrices
    Rx = np.array([[1, 0, 0],
                   [0, np.cos(rx), -np.sin(rx)],
                   [0, np.sin(rx), np.cos(rx)]])
    #similarly for Ry and Rz

    R = np.dot(Rx, np.dot(Ry, Rz)) #Combine rotations

    # Coordinate transformation, rotation, and projection (simplified)
    rows, cols = image.shape[:2]
    rotated_image = np.zeros_like(image)
    for u in range(cols):
        for v in range(rows):
            z = depth[v,u]
            Xc = (u-cx)*z/fx
            Yc = (v-cy)*z/fy
            
            # Homogeneous coordinates to handle translation, omitted for simplicity here
            
            rotated_coords = np.dot(R, np.array([Xc,Yc,z]))
            
            u_prime = int(fx * rotated_coords[0]/rotated_coords[2] + cx)
            v_prime = int(fy * rotated_coords[1]/rotated_coords[2] + cy)
            
            #Boundary check and interpolation (omitted for brevity)
            if 0 <= u_prime < cols and 0 <= v_prime < rows:
              rotated_image[v_prime, u_prime] = image[v, u]
    return rotated_image

# Example usage (requires image and depth data)
#rotated_image = rotate_image_depth(image, depth, np.pi/4, 0, 0) # Rotation around x-axis by 45 degrees
```

**Example 2:  Leveraging OpenCV for efficiency**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def rotate_image_depth_opencv(image, depth, rx, ry, rz):
    # ... (Intrinsic parameters, rotation matrices as in Example 1) ...

    # Create 3D point cloud
    rows, cols = image.shape[:2]
    points3D = np.zeros((rows, cols, 3))
    # ... (Convert pixel coordinates to 3D using depth and intrinsics) ...

    #Apply rotation
    rotated_points = np.dot(points3D.reshape(-1,3), R.T).reshape(rows, cols, 3)

    # Project back to 2D
    # ... (project using intrinsics and handle potential issues with depth) ...

    #Using warpPerspective for efficiency
    # ... This requires defining the appropriate transformation matrix and handling depth issues correctly ...

    return rotated_image

#Example usage (requires image and depth data)
#rotated_image = rotate_image_depth_opencv(image, depth, 0, np.pi/6, 0) # Rotation around y-axis by 30 degrees

```

**Example 3: Addressing Depth Discontinuities**

Depth maps often contain discontinuities and noise.  Robust implementation should address these issues:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def robust_rotate_image_depth(image, depth, rx, ry, rz):
    # ... (Intrinsic parameters, rotation matrices as before) ...

    # Preprocessing: noise reduction and filling gaps (median filter example)
    depth = cv2.medianBlur(depth.astype(np.float32), 5)  # Adjust kernel size

    # Coordinate transformation, rotation, and projection

    # Handle depth discontinuities and out-of-bounds pixels with interpolation
    # ... (Employ techniques like inpainting or nearest-neighbor interpolation) ...

    return rotated_image

#Example usage (requires image and depth data)
#rotated_image = robust_rotate_image_depth(image, depth, 0, 0, np.pi/3) # Rotation around z-axis by 60 degrees

```
