The appearance of NaN (Not a Number) values in model weights, despite a seemingly functional custom loss function, frequently stems from numerical instability within the gradient calculation process, not necessarily a direct flaw in the loss function itself.  My experience debugging similar issues across various deep learning projects, including a particularly thorny instance involving a variational autoencoder with a custom KL divergence term, highlighted the crucial role of gradient clipping and careful consideration of numerical precision. While the loss function might appear to produce valid numerical results, the gradients derived from it – the signals guiding weight updates – can easily become unstable, leading to NaN propagation.

**1. Explanation of the NaN Propagation Mechanism:**

The backpropagation algorithm, the core of training neural networks, calculates gradients by recursively applying the chain rule of calculus.  This process involves many intermediate calculations, each potentially contributing to numerical instability.  Small numerical errors, inherent in floating-point arithmetic, can accumulate throughout the chain, leading to excessively large or infinitely large gradient values.  These extreme values, when used in gradient descent update rules (e.g., Adam, RMSprop, SGD), often result in weight updates that are either impossibly large or undefined, thus manifesting as NaNs in the weight matrices. This propagation is insidious; even if a single gradient calculation produces a NaN, it can quickly contaminate the entire weight update process.

Several factors can exacerbate this instability within custom loss functions.  First, the mathematical formulation of the loss itself might contain operations susceptible to numerical overflow or underflow.  Operations like exponentiation (e.g., in softmax or exponential loss functions) can easily produce extremely large or small numbers, quickly exceeding the representable range of floating-point numbers.  Second, the complexity of the loss function can increase the likelihood of error accumulation during the automatic differentiation process.  A highly non-linear or intricate custom loss function will often have a more elaborate gradient expression, increasing the potential for numerical instability.  Third, improper handling of boundary conditions within the loss function can also introduce NaNs. For example, dividing by zero or taking the logarithm of a non-positive number can directly yield NaNs.  Finally,  incorrect implementation of the gradient calculation in the custom loss function can directly lead to NaN propagation.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Gradient Clipping**

This example demonstrates how gradient clipping prevents NaN propagation caused by excessively large gradients.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume 'model' is a TensorFlow/Keras model and 'custom_loss' is your custom loss function
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(clipnorm=1.0) # Gradient clipping norm set to 1.0

model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=custom_loss)
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

The `clipnorm` argument limits the magnitude of the gradient vector, preventing exceptionally large gradients from causing NaN propagation.  I've found this to be remarkably effective in mitigating many gradient instability problems.  Experimenting with different `clipnorm` values is crucial, as a value that is too small can hinder convergence while a value that is too large can be ineffective.

**Example 2:  Numerical Stability Techniques in Loss Function**

This example showcases the importance of numerical stability within the loss function itself.  Let's assume a portion of the loss involves a softmax calculation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def stable_softmax(x):
  """Computes softmax with improved numerical stability."""
  x = x - np.max(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)  # Shift to prevent overflow
  exp_x = np.exp(x)
  return exp_x / np.sum(exp_x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  # ... other parts of your custom loss ...
  probabilities = stable_softmax(y_pred) # Use the stabilized softmax
  # ... rest of the custom loss calculation ...
  return loss_value

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss)
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

The `stable_softmax` function prevents numerical overflow by subtracting the maximum value from the input before exponentiation. This simple technique dramatically improves the numerical stability of the softmax calculation.  Similar strategies should be applied to other potentially unstable operations within the loss function.


**Example 3:  Checking for NaNs During Training**

This example incorporates a check for NaNs during training to identify the source of the problem more precisely.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
  loss = ... # Your loss calculation
  if tf.math.is_nan(loss):
    tf.print("NaN detected in custom loss!")
    tf.debugging.assert_all_finite(y_pred, "NaN in predictions!")
    tf.debugging.assert_all_finite(y_true, "NaN in labels!")
  return loss


model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_loss)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, callbacks=[tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='loss', patience=10)])

```

Adding assertions and explicit NaN checks within the loss function aids in identifying precisely where the problem originates.  This allows for more focused debugging and allows one to pinpoint the specific problematic component or input data.  The `EarlyStopping` callback halts training prematurely if the loss consistently shows signs of instability.

*   "Numerical Recipes": This classic text offers comprehensive coverage of numerical methods, including techniques for improving the stability of numerical computations.
*   TensorFlow/PyTorch documentation: The official documentation for these deep learning frameworks provide detailed explanations of their automatic differentiation mechanisms and strategies for handling numerical issues.  Pay particular attention to sections on debugging and numerical stability.


By systematically investigating the potential sources of numerical instability, implementing gradient clipping, employing improved numerical techniques within the loss function, and incorporating robust checks for NaNs during training, one can effectively resolve the issue of NaN model weights despite seemingly correct loss function outputs. Remember that the issue is often in the *gradients* calculated from the loss, not the loss itself.  Careful attention to numerical precision and stability is critical for successful deep learning model training.
