The reliability of `wait(NULL)` for harvesting all child processes spawned via `execv`/`execvp` hinges critically on the parent process's understanding of its own process group and the potential for orphaned processes.  My experience debugging multi-process daemons for embedded systems highlighted this subtle yet significant issue repeatedly.  While `wait(NULL)` *attempts* to wait for any child process, it doesn't inherently guarantee the collection of all descendants in a complex process tree.  This stems from how signals propagate and the asynchronous nature of process termination.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

`wait(NULL)` is a blocking system call that waits for the termination of any child process within the calling process's process group.  Crucially, this means that only child processes directly created by the calling process within the same process group are considered.  If a child process forks further children, those grandchildren are not automatically included in the `wait(NULL)` call's scope.  Moreover, if a child process terminates before the parent calls `wait(NULL)`, its exit status is lost.  This is further complicated by the possibility of process termination signals being delivered asynchronously.  A child process might receive a `SIGKILL` or `SIGTERM`, bypassing the orderly termination and status reporting mechanisms expected by `wait(NULL)`.

To reliably wait for all descendants, one must employ a more robust strategy involving iterative calls to `waitpid()` with specific process IDs or process group IDs.  This grants finer-grained control, enabling the parent process to explicitly track and wait for all its children, even those that themselves become parents.  Simply put, `wait(NULL)` provides a convenient but limited mechanism, suitable only for simple scenarios with a single level of process hierarchy.  For complex scenarios with multiple levels of forking, it's fundamentally insufficient.

Furthermore, signal handling plays a crucial role. If a signal handler interrupts a `wait(NULL)` call, the wait might be prematurely terminated, potentially leaving some child processes unharvested.  Properly designed signal handlers are thus essential for robust process management.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Illustrating the Limitation of `wait(NULL)`:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid1, pid2;

    pid1 = fork();
    if (pid1 == 0) {
        // Child 1: Executes a simple command
        execl("/bin/sleep", "sleep", "5", NULL);
        perror("execl failed"); // Should not reach here in normal operation
        exit(1);
    } else if (pid1 > 0) {
        pid2 = fork();
        if (pid2 == 0) {
            // Child 2: Executes another simple command
            execl("/bin/sleep", "sleep", "2", NULL);
            perror("execl failed"); // Should not reach here in normal operation
            exit(1);
        } else if (pid2 > 0) {
            // Parent: Waits for ANY child process
            wait(NULL);
            printf("Parent: One child finished.\n");
            wait(NULL); // Attempting to wait for the second child. Might not succeed if the order changes
            printf("Parent: Second child finished.\n");
        } else {
            perror("fork failed");
            exit(1);
        }
    } else {
        perror("fork failed");
        exit(1);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This example demonstrates the unpredictability. While it *might* work, the order of termination of `sleep 5` and `sleep 2` could lead to only one `wait(NULL)` call succeeding, leaving one child process unaccounted for.


**Example 2:  Using `waitpid()` for reliable child process harvesting:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid1, pid2;
    int status;

    pid1 = fork();
    if (pid1 == 0) {
        execl("/bin/sleep", "sleep", "5", NULL);
        perror("execl failed");
        exit(1);
    } else if (pid1 > 0) {
        pid2 = fork();
        if (pid2 == 0) {
            execl("/bin/sleep", "sleep", "2", NULL);
            perror("execl failed");
            exit(1);
        } else if (pid2 > 0) {
            waitpid(pid1, &status, 0);
            printf("Parent: Child 1 finished with status %d.\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
            waitpid(pid2, &status, 0);
            printf("Parent: Child 2 finished with status %d.\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
        } else {
            perror("fork failed");
            exit(1);
        }
    } else {
        perror("fork failed");
        exit(1);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This demonstrates the superior control offered by `waitpid()`.  By specifying the process ID, the parent guarantees the collection of both children, irrespective of their termination order.


**Example 3: Handling Multiple Levels of Forking with `waitpid()`:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid;
    int status;

    pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        //Child 1
        pid = fork();
        if(pid == 0){
            //Grandchild
            execl("/bin/sleep", "sleep", "1", NULL);
            perror("execl failed");
            exit(1);
        } else if (pid > 0){
            //Child 1 continues.
            execl("/bin/sleep", "sleep", "3", NULL);
            perror("execl failed");
            exit(1);
        } else {
            perror("fork failed");
            exit(1);
        }
    } else if (pid > 0) {
        while ((pid = waitpid(-1, &status, 0)) > 0) {
            printf("Parent: Child/Grandchild with PID %d finished with status %d.\n", pid, WEXITSTATUS(status));
        }
    } else {
        perror("fork failed");
        exit(1);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This example uses `waitpid(-1)` which waits for any child process in the process group.  This is safer than `wait(NULL)` in multi-level forking scenarios because it handles all descendants within the same process group.  Note that even here, a signal arriving at the precisely wrong moment could still interfere.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment" by Stevens and Rago is indispensable.  A thorough understanding of process management, signals, and system calls is crucial.  Consult the relevant man pages for `wait`, `waitpid`, `fork`, `execv`, `execvp`, and signal handling functions.  Finally, studying the source code of well-established process management utilities can offer valuable insights into practical implementations.  Consider examining the source of init systems (like systemd) for sophisticated examples of process lifecycle management.
