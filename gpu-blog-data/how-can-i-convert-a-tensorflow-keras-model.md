TensorFlow Keras models, while functionally equivalent to standalone Keras models in many respects,  differ in their underlying structure and how they handle dependencies.  This structural difference often manifests as loading errors when attempting to utilize a TensorFlow Keras model with a Keras environment lacking the TensorFlow backend. The core issue stems from the implicit dependency injection performed by TensorFlow Keras during model creation and serialization.  My experience resolving these discrepancies over the past five years has involved careful attention to both the serialization process and the loading environment.

The solution isn't simply a direct conversion; it's a process of reconstructing the model architecture from a serialized representation compatible with a purely Keras-based environment.  This usually involves extracting the model's architecture, weights, and optimizer state, then recreating the model using the standard Keras API, ensuring the chosen backend is compatible with the overall environment.  Ignoring backend incompatibility will invariably lead to further runtime errors.

**1. Explanation:**

TensorFlow Keras models leverage TensorFlow's computational graph and tensor operations. When saved, they often include TensorFlow-specific metadata. Standard Keras, on the other hand, operates with a more generic backend system, allowing for flexibility but requiring explicit specification. Loading a TensorFlow Keras model into a pure Keras environment (e.g., one using the Theano or CNTK backends) without adjustments will almost certainly fail due to this mismatch in metadata and backend expectations.

The key is to avoid loading the model directly. Instead, we load the model architecture and weights separately. The architecture can be reconstructed using the Keras `Sequential` or `Model` classes, while the weights can be loaded directly into the newly created model. This approach sidesteps the incompatibility introduced by the TensorFlow-specific serialization format.  Crucially, this process depends on the way the model was originally saved.  Using the `save_weights` method offers superior portability compared to `save` which saves the entire model including potentially problematic backend-specific information.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Using `save_weights` for enhanced portability (Recommended):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

#Original Model Creation (TensorFlow/Keras)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#Simulate some training
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 784)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)

#Save weights only. This is crucial for cross-backend compatibility.
model.save_weights('my_model_weights.h5')

#Recreate the model in a 'pure' Keras environment
new_model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

#Load weights into the recreated model
new_model.load_weights('my_model_weights.h5')

#Verify model architecture and weights are identical (optional, but recommended)
print(model.get_weights())
print(new_model.get_weights())

```

This example demonstrates the preferred method. Saving only the weights ensures portability.  The architecture is recreated explicitly, eliminating any backend-related inconsistencies.


**Example 2:  Using `model.to_json()` (Less Robust):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

#... (Model creation and training as in Example 1) ...

#Save model architecture only
model_json = model.to_json()
with open("model.json", "w") as json_file:
    json_file.write(model_json)

#Recreate the model from JSON in a 'pure' Keras environment (Requires careful dependency management)

with open('model.json', 'r') as json_file:
    json_model = json_file.read()

new_model = keras.models.model_from_json(json_model)

#Load weights separately
new_model.load_weights('my_model_weights.h5') #'my_model_weights.h5' assumed to exist from previous save.
```

This approach relies on the architecture description being entirely independent of the TensorFlow backend. While functional, this can be fragile and depends heavily on the absence of TensorFlow specific layers or custom objects in the original model.


**Example 3: Handling Custom Layers (Advanced):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

#Custom layer definition
class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                  initializer='random_normal',
                                  trainable=True)
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).build(input_shape)

    def call(self, x):
        return tf.matmul(x, self.w)

#Model with custom layer
model = keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(32, name='custom_layer'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
#... (training and saving weights as before)...

#Recreate the model, including the custom layer.  This requires precise replication of the custom layer.
class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer): #Must be exactly the same definition!
    #... (same implementation as before) ...

new_model = keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(32, name='custom_layer'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
new_model.load_weights('my_model_weights.h5')
```

This example showcases the necessary steps for dealing with custom layers.  Precise replication of the custom layer definition is paramount.  Any discrepancy will result in loading errors.  This highlights the limitations of simple direct conversion and necessitates a more careful, manual reconstruction.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation, specifically the sections on model saving and loading, and the chapters on custom layers and using different backends are essential references.  Similarly, the TensorFlow documentation covering the differences between TensorFlow Keras and the standalone Keras API would prove invaluable.  Finally, a comprehensive guide on Python's `h5py` library, which underlies the HDF5 format used for saving model weights, will also be helpful.



In conclusion, while there’s no direct “conversion” function, the techniques described here allow you to effectively migrate a TensorFlow Keras model's functionality to a pure Keras environment by strategically separating the model architecture and weights during the saving and loading phases, emphasizing the use of `save_weights` to improve portability.  Addressing custom layers requires meticulous replication of their definitions.  By following these steps, you can reliably circumvent the loading errors often encountered when working across different Keras backends.
