The discrepancy observed between expected and produced outputs when using PyTorchâ€™s Autograd with complex Fourier transforms arises primarily from subtle nuances in how gradients are handled for complex numbers, particularly concerning the implicit assumption of conjugate symmetry by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) implementation. My experience in signal processing, specifically developing a neural network to analyze radar data, brought this issue to light. Initially, the backpropagation yielded seemingly random weight adjustments, pointing directly to a problem with gradient calculations during the complex FFT operation.

The crux of the problem lies in the fact that while PyTorch supports complex numbers and provides complex versions of Fourier transforms (like `torch.fft.fft` for one-dimensional and `torch.fft.fft2` for two-dimensional), its Autograd system, at its core, is designed around real numbers. When a complex FFT is involved in a computational graph, the gradients are calculated *as if* the complex inputs and outputs were two independent real numbers (real and imaginary components). This can be problematic for two reasons.

First, the Fourier Transform and its inverse are not just linear operations; they are *unitary* transformations. This means, mathematically, that the inverse transform is the conjugate transpose of the forward transform, which is crucial for maintaining signal energy. When Autograd treats complex numbers as independent real and imaginary components, this unitary relationship is not automatically enforced during backpropagation. Therefore, it can cause the backward pass to propagate gradients without reflecting the properties of the conjugate transpose inherent in the inverse transform. The error accumulates with each complex operation and can have cascading effects on gradients for preceding operations in the computational graph.

Second, the implementation of FFT algorithms leverages the fact that for *real-valued inputs*, the output spectrum has conjugate symmetry. This implies that the positive frequencies are mirrored in the negative frequencies. While this property enables significant computational speed-ups, especially for large datasets, PyTorch's Autograd doesn't inherently comprehend this symmetry. When a forward FFT is performed, PyTorch might not store the full complex spectrum but rather a compressed version (e.g. only the positive half for real-valued input), relying on the assumption of symmetry to reconstruct the full spectrum during the inverse. However, during backpropagation, it calculates gradients as if the *entire* spectrum were distinct, neglecting this constraint. When dealing with non-real inputs, where the output spectrum will *not* have conjugate symmetry, this inconsistency creates issues in the backpropagation due to the underlying computational optimizations for real-valued data.

To better understand, consider a situation with a custom neural network that performs complex convolution by transforming the input to the frequency domain using `torch.fft.fft`, applies a complex-valued kernel, and then converts back to the spatial domain with the inverse Fourier transform `torch.fft.ifft`. If this was part of training, the backpropagation would, under the conditions described, lead to inaccurate weight updates and ultimately, to a poorly performing model.

Here are three code examples that demonstrate this issue, along with explanations of what is happening and how it impacts the gradients:

**Example 1: Simple Complex FFT and Backpropagation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ComplexFFTModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.fft.fft(x)

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 256, dtype=torch.complex64, requires_grad=True)
model = ComplexFFTModule()

output = model(input_tensor)
loss = torch.sum(torch.abs(output))
loss.backward()

print("Input Gradient:", input_tensor.grad)
```

In this first example, a simple `ComplexFFTModule` performs a 1D FFT. We initialize a complex tensor with `requires_grad=True`. After performing the forward pass and calculating a loss using the absolute magnitude of the output, we call `.backward()` to compute the gradients. While this seems straightforward, if you inspect `input_tensor.grad`, you will likely see non-sensical gradients for some elements. These gradients are calculated on the assumption that the real and imaginary components of the complex output are entirely independent, overlooking the unitary nature and possible conjugate symmetry of the operation. The gradients are therefore incorrect.

**Example 2: Complex FFT and IFFT Sequence**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ComplexFFTInverseModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def forward(self, x):
       fft_result = torch.fft.fft(x)
       ifft_result = torch.fft.ifft(fft_result)
       return ifft_result

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 256, dtype=torch.complex64, requires_grad=True)
model = ComplexFFTInverseModule()

output = model(input_tensor)
loss = torch.sum(torch.abs(output))
loss.backward()

print("Input Gradient:", input_tensor.grad)
```

This example extends the first to include a full FFT-IFFT sequence. Ideally, applying the inverse transform after the forward transform should give us back our original input. However, the backpropagation still suffers from the same issues as above. Even though forward pass appears to work, the gradients will have an error that arises because the backward pass treats the IFFT not as the conjugate transpose of the FFT, but as independent real and imaginary number operations.

**Example 3: Complex FFT with a Real Input**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ComplexFFTRealInputModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def forward(self, x):
       fft_result = torch.fft.fft(x)
       return fft_result

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 256, dtype=torch.float32, requires_grad=True)
model = ComplexFFTRealInputModule()
input_tensor_complex = input_tensor.type(torch.complex64)

output = model(input_tensor_complex)
loss = torch.sum(torch.abs(output))
loss.backward()

print("Input Gradient:", input_tensor.grad)
```

This final example highlights a critical, often overlooked edge case. If the input to the complex FFT is *real-valued* (despite being passed into the complex FFT function), the output spectrum *will* have conjugate symmetry. However, during gradient calculations, PyTorch still assumes all elements are independent, thus ignoring the inherent dependencies and leading to incorrect gradients as a result of that assumption. Again, this creates errors in the backpropagation. This also demonstrates that type casting to complex does *not* inherently solve the problem, which is one that is fundamentally related to incorrect assumptions about the operations within the Autograd.

To address this issue, several approaches can be taken. One method involves implementing custom gradient functions to explicitly handle the unitary transformation of the FFT, which has been suggested in the documentation. Another less mathematically rigorous, but often viable, approach is to make sure that all operations that you intend to work with the complex domain are cast to `torch.complex64` before using them, and to make sure your intermediate computations are carried out in complex numbers as well. Sometimes, simply adding a complex cast to intermediate tensors can solve unexpected gradient errors. Careful type management and awareness is often needed when working with these functions in PyTorch.

For further study, I recommend resources on signal processing textbooks covering the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its properties, particularly conjugate symmetry. PyTorch's official documentation on complex numbers and Autograd should also be consulted. Additionally, articles discussing implementation details of the FFT can provide greater context. Finally, exploring resources in numerical analysis on linear transforms and their adjoints will also improve ones understanding of the underlying issue. While no simple fix is available, a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics and the behavior of the Autograd engine can be very effective in solving these kinds of issues.
