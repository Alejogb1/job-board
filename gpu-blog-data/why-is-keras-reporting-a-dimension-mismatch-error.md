The Keras dimension mismatch error, specifically "dim[1] = 90," during model execution frequently stems from an incongruence between the expected input shape of a layer and the actual shape of the input data being fed to it.  This discrepancy is almost always a consequence of a mismatch in the number of features (or channels) in the input tensor.  I've encountered this numerous times during my work on large-scale image classification projects and natural language processing tasks.  The error arises because Keras, internally, performs rigorous shape checking to ensure correct tensor operations within its computational graph.  Let's dissect this problem and examine potential solutions.

**1.  Understanding the Root Cause:**

The "dim[1] = 90" indicates that the second dimension of your input tensor (usually representing features or channels) has a size of 90.  This implies your model, at a specific layer, anticipates a different number of features.  This might be due to several reasons:

* **Incorrect Data Preprocessing:** The most common cause.  If your data (images, text vectors, etc.) isn't preprocessed correctly to match the expected input shape of your model, you'll encounter this error. This includes issues with image resizing, feature extraction, or one-hot encoding of categorical variables.

* **Layer Misconfiguration:** Your model architecture might be incorrectly defined. A layer might be expecting an input shape that doesn't align with the output shape of the preceding layer, or with the initial input shape.  This often happens with convolutional layers (incorrect `input_shape` parameter) or dense layers (mismatched number of units).

* **Data Loading Issues:** Errors during data loading can lead to unexpected data shapes.  This can be related to problems with your data generators, improper batching, or issues with data loading libraries.

* **Incorrect Reshaping:** Explicit reshaping operations within your code (using `reshape()` or similar functions) can introduce errors if performed incorrectly.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's consider three scenarios where this error might occur and how to diagnose and correct them.

**Example 1: Incorrect Image Resizing:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, Flatten, Dense

# Incorrect data preprocessing: images are not resized to (28, 28)
img_data = np.random.rand(100, 90, 90, 3) # 100 images, 90x90 pixels, 3 channels

model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 3)), # Expecting 28x28 images
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(img_data, np.random.rand(100, 10), epochs=1) # This will raise the error
```

**Commentary:** The `Conv2D` layer expects input images of size (28, 28, 3). However, the `img_data` has images of size (90, 90, 3).  This mismatch leads to the error. The solution is to resize the images using libraries like OpenCV or Scikit-image before feeding them to the model.


**Example 2: Mismatched Layer Input/Output Shapes:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

# Mismatched layer shapes
model = keras.Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(784,)), #784 features
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Error here because dense layer will attempt to process data of a wrong dimensionality.
])

#Correcting it:
model_corrected = keras.Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(90,)), #Corrected Input Shape
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax') # Error resolved by using 90 as the input dimension.
])


model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# model.fit(np.random.rand(100, 784), np.random.rand(100, 10), epochs=1) # This will work with the corrected version only

```

**Commentary:**  This example illustrates a scenario where the input shape of a layer doesn't align with the output shape of the preceding layer.  Here, it's assumed that the input data to the model has 90 features, yet the model is designed to accept 784 features. This should be corrected by either modifying your model architecture or by reshaping your input to fit the model.


**Example 3:  Incorrect Batch Size in Data Generator:**

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.utils import Sequence

class DataGenerator(Sequence):
    def __init__(self, x_set, y_set, batch_size):
        self.x, self.y = x_set, y_set
        self.batch_size = batch_size

    def __len__(self):
        return int(np.ceil(len(self.x) / float(self.batch_size)))

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        batch_x = self.x[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) * self.batch_size]
        batch_y = self.y[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) * self.batch_size]
        #Incorrect Reshape here. The data generator should be adjusted to generate data in the proper shape
        return np.reshape(batch_x, (self.batch_size, 90)), batch_y

#Assuming correct data shape is (100, 90)
x_train = np.random.rand(100, 90)
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)

training_generator = DataGenerator(x_train, y_train, 32)

model = keras.Sequential([
    Dense(10, activation='softmax', input_shape=(90,))
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(training_generator, epochs=1)
```

**Commentary:** Data generators are crucial for efficient data handling, especially with large datasets. If your data generator produces batches with an incorrect shape, the error will manifest.  Carefully review how your generator constructs and shapes each batch. Ensure that the output of `__getitem__` matches the expected input shape of your model's first layer. The example shows a possible correction by adjusting the reshape function to match the expected shape.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of Keras model building and troubleshooting, I would recommend the official Keras documentation, particularly the sections on model building, layers, and data preprocessing.  Furthermore, exploring resources on NumPy array manipulation and understanding tensor operations will be invaluable.  A well-structured textbook on deep learning fundamentals would also prove beneficial.  Careful examination of error messages and stack traces provided by Python's exception handling system is crucial for effective debugging.  Finally, mastering the use of debugging tools within your IDE will significantly improve your efficiency in identifying these types of issues.
