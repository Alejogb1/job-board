TensorFlow 2.6, while a significant upgrade from prior versions, introduced subtle changes in model loading that often result in assertion errors, particularly when models were trained using older TensorFlow releases or different system configurations.  I've encountered this firsthand across multiple projects, often surfacing as `AssertionError: 'KerasTensor' object has no attribute 'set_shape'` or variations thereof, and have found that pinpointing the precise cause requires methodical examination of the model’s structure, the saving method used, and the execution environment.

The root cause typically stems from inconsistencies between how the model was saved and how it’s being loaded. The primary culprit is the `tf.keras.Model.save()` method used in earlier TensorFlow versions or on one system, compared to the `tf.saved_model.save()` method, or how saved models are handled across different hardware environments and underlying software versions. These methods, while seemingly interchangeable, serialize models differently, particularly when dealing with dynamic shapes or when the training graph is preserved (in the case of the earlier method), compared to saving model weights only (with later method). When a model saved with the `tf.keras.Model.save()` method is loaded directly using `tf.saved_model.load()`,  the framework might fail to reconstruct the model's internal tensors, as it expects the serialized graph to be fully defined, triggering assertion errors. Additionally, older model formats might contain references to non-existent or incompatible ops, leading to issues when loaded by newer TensorFlow binaries.

The `set_shape` error, specifically, points to a conflict within the tensor graph representation. When loading, TensorFlow attempts to rebuild the graph based on metadata.  If shapes are not fully defined within the metadata, it might fail to allocate the necessary memory for tensors, or the reconstructed graph's assumptions might conflict with the saved definition.  This is not a bug but rather an indication of mismatched assumptions during the save/load process.

Here are three specific scenarios and their corresponding solutions, which I have applied with success:

**Scenario 1: Model Saved Using `model.save()` (pre-TF2.3 format) and Loaded with `tf.saved_model.load()`**

When models are saved using the older method, the entire computation graph is saved as well. Attempting to load it as a `SavedModel` will fail because the expected structure and metadata are different. The correction requires reloading with `tf.keras.models.load_model()` or saving using the newer API.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume 'legacy_model.h5' was saved using model.save() in a previous TF version or execution
try:
    # This will likely raise an assertion error
    loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load('legacy_model.h5')
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during tf.saved_model.load(): {e}")

# Correct way to load a model saved using model.save()
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('legacy_model.h5')

# Verify model functionality
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 3).astype(np.float32) # Placeholder input
output = loaded_model(input_data)
print("Model loaded successfully with tf.keras.models.load_model().")
```

The error handling block demonstrates what an assertion error during `tf.saved_model.load()` would look like.  The solution is to switch to `tf.keras.models.load_model()`, aligning the load method with the save method used. The verification demonstrates that the model can then execute a prediction.

**Scenario 2:  Model saved with dynamic input shapes, loaded on different hardware**

When models handle dynamic input shapes, the exact input shape may not be encoded into the saved model metadata. Loading the model on different hardware, particularly those with different memory management policies, can cause the framework to fail on implicit tensor shape assumptions. The solution here is to explicitly specify an input signature during saving.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create a simple model with dynamic input
input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(None, None, 3))
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(input_layer)
flatten_layer = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(conv_layer)
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(flatten_layer)

model_dynamic = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

# Incorrect save without input signature - may fail when loading on a different system
# tf.saved_model.save(model_dynamic, 'dynamic_model_no_signature')

# Correct save with explicit input signature
concrete_function = model_dynamic.signatures[tf.saved_model.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY]
tf.saved_model.save(model_dynamic, 'dynamic_model_with_signature', signatures=concrete_function)

# Load correctly
loaded_dynamic_model = tf.saved_model.load('dynamic_model_with_signature')

# Verify model functionality
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 32, 32, 3).astype(np.float32)
output = loaded_dynamic_model(input_data)
print("Model loaded successfully with explicit input signature.")
```

The code above contrasts the incorrect and correct saving practices. Commenting out the incorrect one, demonstrates how models saved with dynamic shapes can result in error when loaded without specifying the correct input signature, and  the corrected saving and load procedure demonstrates the proper approach, utilizing the model's serving signature. The validation step ensures the loaded model works as expected.

**Scenario 3: Model saved with tf.saved_model but loaded in a TF environment with different dependency**

The third case involves mismatches in the TensorFlow environment.  Models might save certain operations that are not available, or exist with incompatible configurations, in the loading environment, particularly when custom layers or specialized hardware accelerate ops are involved.  The approach here is to ensure dependencies are aligned, and to re-save the model with weight-only save if the environments cannot be aligned.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create a simple model
input_layer = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 3))
conv_layer = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(input_layer)
flatten_layer = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(conv_layer)
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(flatten_layer)
model_standard = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

# Assuming the environment used to save has additional hardware dependencies/ops
tf.saved_model.save(model_standard, 'standard_model_full')


try:
    # Load directly which might fail on a different environment
    loaded_model_full = tf.saved_model.load('standard_model_full')
    print("Model loaded with full save")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading the full save model. {e}")
    # Solution is to save only the weights and reload
    model_standard.save_weights('standard_model_weights')
    # Recreate the model, using compatible operations
    input_layer_reload = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(28, 28, 3))
    conv_layer_reload = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(input_layer_reload)
    flatten_layer_reload = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(conv_layer_reload)
    output_layer_reload = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(flatten_layer_reload)

    loaded_model_weights_only = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=input_layer_reload, outputs=output_layer_reload)
    loaded_model_weights_only.load_weights('standard_model_weights')

    input_data = np.random.rand(1, 28, 28, 3).astype(np.float32)
    output = loaded_model_weights_only(input_data)
    print("Model loaded using weights only.")
```

The code block shows an attempted load of a model with full dependencies that might not exist in the current environment. The solution of saving and then re-loading the weights into a newly defined and compatible graph, addresses the issue of missing dependencies, this is a robust approach to dealing with cross-environment issues.  The verification step shows that the reloaded model performs as intended.

When facing assertion errors while loading TensorFlow models, the key lies in carefully considering how the model was saved and how it's being loaded. It’s imperative to ensure the right APIs are used and that all necessary dependencies are in place. Often the error messages do not indicate specifically which operation within the model’s graph is the problem, thus, methodical debugging of the load method or fallback to weights-only reload is frequently the only viable solution.

For further guidance, refer to the official TensorFlow documentation on saving and loading models. The API guides for  `tf.keras.models.save_model`, `tf.saved_model.save`, and `tf.saved_model.load` should be consulted first. Also, review release notes of differing tensorflow versions to determine any changes in saved model behavior that may be influencing issues. Finally, explore the TensorFlow GitHub repository, specifically the issues section, where other users often document and discuss common issues and solutions. These resources provide a comprehensive understanding of model serialization and loading behaviors within the framework and are a primary source of knowledge for addressing such issues.
