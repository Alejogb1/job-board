The `AttributeError: module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'get_default_session'` in TensorFlow 2.0 stems from a fundamental architectural shift away from the static computational graph paradigm of TensorFlow 1.x.  TensorFlow 2.0 adopted eager execution by default, eliminating the need for a global default session.  This change necessitates a revised approach to managing TensorFlow operations and variables.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous large-scale machine learning projects has underscored the importance of understanding this core difference.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow 1.x relied heavily on `tf.Session()` to manage the execution of operations.  `tf.get_default_session()` provided access to the currently active session, crucial for interacting with the graph and retrieving results.  This reliance on a global session made code less explicit about the context of operations, potentially leading to subtle bugs.

TensorFlow 2.0, however, embraces eager execution.  In eager execution, operations are executed immediately when called, eliminating the need for a separate session to manage the execution flow.  Consequently, `tf.get_default_session()` is deprecated and no longer exists.  The concept of a global, implicitly defined session is absent.  Instead, TensorFlow 2.0 encourages explicit management of TensorFlow operations using functions and control flow constructs.

The error arises when code written for TensorFlow 1.x, which assumes the existence of a default session, is directly ported to TensorFlow 2.0.  The solution lies in refactoring the code to explicitly manage tensors and operations, leveraging TensorFlow 2.0's eager execution capabilities.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: TensorFlow 1.x Code (Problematic)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

sess = tf.Session()
with sess.as_default():
    a = tf.constant(5)
    b = tf.constant(3)
    c = a + b
    result = sess.run(c)
    print(result)  # Output: 8

sess.close()
```

This code relies on a `tf.Session()` and `sess.run()` to execute the addition operation. Porting this directly to TensorFlow 2.0 will fail.


**Example 2: TensorFlow 2.0 Equivalent (Correct)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant(5)
b = tf.constant(3)
c = a + b
print(c)  # Output: tf.Tensor(8, shape=(), dtype=int32)
print(c.numpy()) #Output: 8
```

This demonstrates the simplicity of eager execution.  The addition `a + b` is executed immediately, and the result `c` is a tensor that can be directly printed or converted to a NumPy array using `.numpy()`.  No session management is necessary.


**Example 3:  Handling Variable Initialization (Correct)**

In TensorFlow 1.x, variable initialization often relied on the default session. In TensorFlow 2.0, variables are initialized automatically when they are created, removing the need for explicit initialization within a session.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# TensorFlow 1.x (Problematic)
# with tf.Session() as sess:
#     W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([2, 2]))
#     sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
#     print(sess.run(W))

# TensorFlow 2.0 (Correct)
W = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([2, 2]))
print(W) #Variable automatically initialized.
```


This example showcases the automatic initialization in TensorFlow 2.0.  The `tf.Variable` constructor automatically initializes the variable, eliminating the need for an explicit `tf.global_variables_initializer()` and session run.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

1.  The official TensorFlow documentation:  This is your primary resource for understanding the changes between TensorFlow 1.x and 2.0, especially concerning eager execution and the deprecation of session management.  Thorough reading of the relevant sections is crucial for successful migration.

2.  TensorFlow's API reference:  For detailed explanations of individual functions and classes, including their usage within eager execution, the API reference is invaluable.  Consult it frequently for specific details.

3.  A well-structured introductory textbook or online course on TensorFlow 2.0:  A structured learning approach solidifies the understanding of TensorFlow 2.0's core concepts and provides a broader perspective on best practices.  This will assist in migrating existing code and developing new models effectively.


In conclusion, the `AttributeError` regarding `get_default_session` is a direct consequence of the shift to eager execution in TensorFlow 2.0.  Eliminating reliance on implicit session management, and adopting explicit control over tensor operations and variable initialization, are key to resolving this issue and building robust, efficient TensorFlow 2.0 applications.  Following the guidelines outlined and diligently studying the recommended resources will enable developers to effectively navigate this transition.  My experience shows that a gradual, methodical approach, focusing on understanding the underlying principles of eager execution, is the most reliable strategy for migrating from TensorFlow 1.x.
