Monitoring the evolution of a model's trainable weights during learning is crucial for assessing training efficacy and identifying potential issues like vanishing gradients or insufficient learning rates.  I've spent considerable time debugging neural networks, and directly observing weight changes—rather than relying solely on loss curves or validation metrics—has consistently proven invaluable.  The key lies in understanding that weight changes are not uniformly distributed or easily visualized directly.  Instead, we need to employ statistical measures and focused sampling techniques.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

Directly inspecting the entire weight tensor of a large model at each iteration is computationally infeasible and provides little insight.  A more effective strategy involves focusing on a representative subset of weights and analyzing their changes over time. This can involve calculating statistical measures, like the mean and standard deviation of the weight changes, or focusing on specific weight layers deemed critical to the model's performance.  Furthermore, visualizing a subset of weight changes using line plots provides a clear intuitive grasp of the learning process.  Significant deviations from expected behavior—stagnant weights, erratic fluctuations, or consistently large changes—indicate potential problems requiring investigation.  We can, for instance, analyze the distribution of weight changes to detect whether the model is converging smoothly or exhibiting instability.

The analysis should consider the scaling of weights.  Certain weight initialization strategies (e.g., Xavier or He initialization) lead to weights within specific ranges.  Large deviations from these initial ranges during training could point to numerical issues or hyperparameter misconfigurations.  Furthermore, the learning rate directly influences the magnitude of these changes; an excessively high learning rate may cause erratic jumps, while a rate that's too low might lead to exceedingly slow or insignificant changes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples demonstrate how to track and analyze weight changes using Python and popular deep learning libraries.  These are simplified illustrations; adapting them to specific models and architectures will require understanding the model's internal structure.  I've encountered situations where the ideal sampling method is layer-specific—some layers benefit from mean analysis while others are best understood by examining the maximum absolute weight change.

**Example 1: Tracking Mean Weight Change (PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ... model definition (assuming model is defined and training loop is set up) ...

weight_means = []
weight_stds = []

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        # ... forward pass, loss calculation, backpropagation ...
        optimizer.step()  # Update weights

        # Collect statistics on a specific layer's weights
        layer_weights = model.layer1.weight.data.cpu().numpy().flatten()  # Access and flatten weights of a chosen layer
        weight_means.append(np.mean(layer_weights))
        weight_stds.append(np.std(layer_weights))

# Plotting the results:
plt.plot(weight_means, label='Mean Weight')
plt.plot(weight_stds, label='Weight Std Dev')
plt.xlabel('Iteration')
plt.ylabel('Weight Value')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Mean and Standard Deviation of Layer 1 Weights')
plt.show()

```

This example focuses on a single layer (`model.layer1`) for simplicity. In practice, you might monitor multiple layers or even aggregate statistics across multiple layers. Note the use of `.cpu().numpy()` to convert the PyTorch tensor into a NumPy array for easier manipulation.


**Example 2:  Monitoring Maximum Absolute Weight Change (TensorFlow/Keras)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# ... model definition (assuming model is defined and training loop is set up) ...

max_weight_changes = []

prev_weights = model.layers[0].get_weights()[0].flatten() #  Get weights from the first layer, flatten for easy comparison

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in train_data:
        # ... forward pass, loss calculation, backpropagation ...
        model.train_on_batch(batch[0], batch[1]) # Assume the model is compiled for training

        current_weights = model.layers[0].get_weights()[0].flatten()
        max_weight_changes.append(np.max(np.abs(current_weights - prev_weights)))
        prev_weights = current_weights

# Plotting the results:
plt.plot(max_weight_changes)
plt.xlabel('Iteration')
plt.ylabel('Max Absolute Weight Change')
plt.title('Maximum Absolute Weight Change in Layer 1')
plt.show()

```

This TensorFlow/Keras example tracks the maximum absolute change in weights between consecutive iterations.  This approach is particularly sensitive to outliers and may highlight sudden, significant shifts in individual weights.  Careful consideration of the layer selected is vital.


**Example 3: Histogram of Weight Changes (PyTorch)**

```python
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ... model definition (assuming model is defined and training loop is set up) ...

weight_changes_all_epochs = []

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        # ... forward pass, loss calculation, backpropagation ...
        optimizer.step()

        layer_weights = model.layer1.weight.data.cpu().numpy().flatten()
        if len(weight_changes_all_epochs) == 0: #initialize on first epoch
            weight_changes_all_epochs = layer_weights
        else:
            weight_changes_all_epochs = np.vstack((weight_changes_all_epochs, layer_weights))

#Plotting Histogram
plt.hist(weight_changes_all_epochs[-1], bins=30) # Hist of weights at the end of training, adjust as needed
plt.xlabel('Weight Value')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Layer 1 Weights at the end of Training')
plt.show()


```

This illustrates visualizing the distribution of weight changes, offering insights into the overall behavior.  It uses the final epoch's weights to show the weight distribution. You can modify this to view at various points during training.  The choice of the number of bins in the histogram can influence the visualization; experimentation is crucial.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For further exploration, I suggest consulting relevant chapters on neural network training and optimization in standard machine learning textbooks.  Look for sections dealing with gradient descent algorithms, weight initialization strategies, and techniques for monitoring model training progress.  Additionally, review documentation for deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) pertaining to accessing model parameters and performing tensor manipulations.  Specialized papers on debugging neural networks and dealing with convergence issues are highly beneficial for advanced analysis.  Consider exploring numerical analysis texts to better understand the subtleties of floating-point arithmetic and potential sources of numerical instability in deep learning.
