Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) excel at processing sequential data, making them suitable for natural language generation (NLG) tasks.  However, directly feeding CSV data—typically tabular and lacking inherent sequential structure—into an RNN for NLG requires careful preprocessing and framing.  My experience building conversational AI agents for a financial institution highlighted this challenge.  We needed to synthesize human-readable summaries from client transaction data stored in CSV format, a task that demanded converting structured data into the sequential format RNNs expect.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in transforming the tabular nature of CSV data into sequences suitable for RNN processing.  This involves identifying the relevant fields within the CSV that contribute to the desired narrative and constructing sequences representing those fields' relationships.  For instance, generating a natural language summary of daily transactions requires structuring the data chronologically, with each sequence representing a day's transactions, incorporating relevant fields like transaction type, amount, and time.

The process generally involves the following steps:

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** This crucial initial step involves handling missing values, outlier detection, and potentially data normalization or standardization.  The quality of the preprocessing significantly impacts the quality of the generated text.  For example, inconsistent date formats or erroneous transaction amounts can lead to incoherent or nonsensical output.

* **Feature Engineering:**  This step focuses on transforming the raw CSV data into a representation suitable for RNN input.  This might involve one-hot encoding categorical variables (transaction type), numerical scaling for continuous variables (transaction amount), or more sophisticated techniques like embedding categorical features into a lower-dimensional vector space.

* **Sequence Construction:** This is the critical stage of transforming the preprocessed data into sequences. Depending on the desired narrative, this might involve creating sequences representing individual transactions, daily summaries, or even weekly or monthly reports.  The sequence length is a hyperparameter that needs to be carefully chosen; too short and the model may miss contextual information; too long and the model might struggle to learn long-range dependencies.

* **RNN Model Selection and Training:**  Several RNN architectures, such as LSTMs or GRUs, are applicable.  The choice depends on the complexity of the relationships within the data and the desired length of generated sequences. The model is trained to map input sequences to corresponding natural language outputs.  A large training dataset is critical for optimal performance.

* **Decoding and Generation:** Once trained, the RNN generates natural language by taking a sequence as input and producing a probability distribution over the vocabulary.  Decoding methods, such as greedy decoding or beam search, are used to select the most likely sequence of words.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples illustrate sequence construction and model training using Python, TensorFlow/Keras.  Assume we have a CSV with fields `date`, `transaction_type`, `amount`, and these are preprocessed and features engineered.

**Example 1: Simple Sequence Creation**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

data = pd.read_csv('transactions.csv') #Assume preprocessed data
#assuming data is sorted by date.
sequences = []
sequence_length = 7 # one week summary
for i in range(0, len(data) - sequence_length + 1):
    sequence = data.iloc[i:i + sequence_length].values
    sequences.append(sequence)
sequences = np.array(sequences)
```

This code segments the data into sequences of a specified length, each representing a week's transactions.  The `sequences` array holds these sequences ready for input into the RNN.  Note the assumption that data is sorted by date; this is essential for chronological sequencing.


**Example 2: One-hot Encoding and Sequence Padding**

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

data = pd.read_csv('transactions.csv')
transaction_types = data['transaction_type'].unique()
transaction_type_mapping = {t: i for i, t in enumerate(transaction_types)}

encoded_types = [transaction_type_mapping[t] for t in data['transaction_type']]
encoded_types = to_categorical(encoded_types)

sequences = []
sequence_length = 7
for i in range(0, len(data) - sequence_length + 1):
    sequence = [encoded_types[i+j] for j in range(sequence_length)] #One hot encoded sequences
    sequences.append(np.array(sequence))

padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=sequence_length, padding='post')

```
This illustrates one-hot encoding for the `transaction_type` feature and padding sequences to a uniform length using Keras' `pad_sequences`. Padding ensures consistent input shape to the RNN.


**Example 3:  Basic LSTM Model Training (Illustrative)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=(sequence_length, encoded_types.shape[1]))) #assuming features are flattened.  Input shape needs adjusting based on feature engineering
model.add(Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')) # vocab_size depends on your vocabulary

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(padded_sequences, np.array(training_labels), epochs=10, batch_size=32) # training_labels needs to be created based on the desired output

```

This is a highly simplified example.  The `input_shape` needs adjustment based on the number of features and their representation (one-hot, embeddings, etc.).  The output layer should match the size of your vocabulary.  Training labels (`training_labels`) need to be carefully constructed to represent the desired natural language output corresponding to each input sequence.  Hyperparameter tuning (number of LSTM units, learning rate, etc.) is crucial for performance.  This is a bare-bones illustration; real-world applications require more sophisticated architectures and training techniques.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

"Deep Learning with Python" by Francois Chollet
"Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning" by Yoav Goldberg
"Speech and Language Processing" by Jurafsky & Martin


These books provide detailed explanations of RNN architectures, training methodologies, and NLG techniques.  Further exploration into sequence-to-sequence models and attention mechanisms will be beneficial.  Remember that effective NLG from tabular data depends heavily on both the careful design of the preprocessing and sequence construction stages and the judicious selection and training of the RNN model.  The examples provided are skeletal and should be adapted based on the specifics of the data and the desired output.
