The core insight into the Adam optimizer lies in its adaptive learning rates for each parameter, stemming from the method's utilization of both first-order (gradient) and second-order (squared gradient) momentum estimates. This distinguishes it from simpler methods like stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which use a single, global learning rate. My experience developing deep learning models for image recognition revealed significant improvements in training stability and speed using Adam compared to SGD, particularly with complex architectures.

Adam essentially maintains two moving averages: one for the gradients (first-order momentum) and another for the squared gradients (second-order momentum). Let's denote parameters being optimized as θ. For each parameter θᵢ in a batch at iteration *t*, the gradient is computed as *gₜᵢ*. This *gₜᵢ* feeds into the moving average calculations. The first-order moment estimate, denoted as *mₜᵢ*, is calculated as a weighted average of the current gradient and the previous moment estimate:

  *mₜᵢ* = β₁ * *mₜ₋₁ᵢ* + (1 - β₁) * *gₜᵢ*

Here, β₁ is the decay rate for the first moment estimate, typically set to a value around 0.9. The second-order moment estimate, denoted as *vₜᵢ*, is calculated similarly but using the squared gradient:

 *vₜᵢ* = β₂ * *vₜ₋₁ᵢ* + (1 - β₂) * *gₜᵢ²*

Here, β₂ is the decay rate for the second moment estimate, usually around 0.999.

These moment estimates, *mₜᵢ* and *vₜᵢ*, are biased toward zero, especially in the initial iterations, because they are initialized to zero. To address this, the estimates are bias-corrected. The bias-corrected first-order moment estimate, *m̂ₜᵢ*, is given by:

*m̂ₜᵢ* = *mₜᵢ* / (1 - β₁ᵗ)

Similarly, the bias-corrected second-order moment estimate, *v̂ₜᵢ*, is given by:

*v̂ₜᵢ* = *vₜᵢ* / (1 - β₂ᵗ)

The parameter update is then performed using these corrected estimates. The learning rate, denoted as α, is multiplied by *m̂ₜᵢ*, and divided by the square root of *v̂ₜᵢ* plus a small constant, ε, for numerical stability:

θₜ₊₁ᵢ = θₜᵢ - α * *m̂ₜᵢ* / (√*v̂ₜᵢ* + ε)

The core functionality lies in the adaptive adjustment of learning rates. In areas of the parameter space where gradients are consistently large, the second-order moment estimate, *v̂ₜᵢ*, will grow, effectively scaling down the parameter updates, thus dampening oscillations. Conversely, in areas where gradients are small, *v̂ₜᵢ* will be small, leading to larger updates. This allows for faster convergence in flat regions and more cautious movement in steep regions. This adaptive mechanism makes Adam less sensitive to the choice of learning rate compared to SGD, which often requires meticulous tuning.

I'll now illustrate this process using simplified code snippets in a Python-like pseudocode. First, consider a basic example updating a single parameter:

```python
# Example 1: Single parameter update
def adam_update(param, grad, m, v, t, alpha=0.001, beta1=0.9, beta2=0.999, epsilon=1e-8):
    m = beta1 * m + (1 - beta1) * grad
    v = beta2 * v + (1 - beta2) * grad**2
    m_hat = m / (1 - beta1**t)
    v_hat = v / (1 - beta2**t)
    param = param - alpha * m_hat / (v_hat**0.5 + epsilon)
    return param, m, v

#Initialization
param_value = 10.0  #Initial Parameter Value
moment_m = 0.0      #Initialize Moment 1
moment_v = 0.0     #Initialize Moment 2

# Gradient and parameter update at time t=1
gradient = 2.0      #Gradient Example
updated_param, moment_m, moment_v = adam_update(param_value, gradient, moment_m, moment_v,1)

print(f"Updated Parameter: {updated_param}")
print(f"Updated Momentum 1: {moment_m}")
print(f"Updated Momentum 2: {moment_v}")

```

This example demonstrates the fundamental steps of updating a parameter using the Adam algorithm. We can see the parameter gets adjusted based on the gradient along with the computed momentums. Next, let's extend this to handle multiple parameters, akin to a neural network layer:

```python
# Example 2: Multiple parameters in a list

def adam_multiple_params(params, grads, m_list, v_list, t, alpha=0.001, beta1=0.9, beta2=0.999, epsilon=1e-8):
    updated_params = []
    updated_m_list = []
    updated_v_list = []
    for i in range(len(params)):
        m = beta1 * m_list[i] + (1 - beta1) * grads[i]
        v = beta2 * v_list[i] + (1 - beta2) * grads[i]**2
        m_hat = m / (1 - beta1**t)
        v_hat = v / (1 - beta2**t)
        updated_param = params[i] - alpha * m_hat / (v_hat**0.5 + epsilon)
        updated_params.append(updated_param)
        updated_m_list.append(m)
        updated_v_list.append(v)
    return updated_params, updated_m_list, updated_v_list

# Initial parameters and gradients
parameters = [10.0, 5.0, 2.0]
gradients = [2.0, -1.0, 0.5]

# Initial momentum lists
momentum_m_list = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
momentum_v_list = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

# Parameter and momentum update at time t=1
updated_params, updated_m_list, updated_v_list = adam_multiple_params(parameters, gradients, momentum_m_list, momentum_v_list, 1)

print(f"Updated Parameters: {updated_params}")
print(f"Updated Momentum List 1: {updated_m_list}")
print(f"Updated Momentum List 2: {updated_v_list}")
```
This second example shows how Adam iterates over multiple parameters, each with their own momentum terms, allowing for individual adaptation of learning rates. Finally, it is beneficial to see how a class could be created to encapsulate the parameters and optimizers:

```python
# Example 3: Encapsulated Class Example

class AdamOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, params, alpha=0.001, beta1=0.9, beta2=0.999, epsilon=1e-8):
        self.params = params
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.beta1 = beta1
        self.beta2 = beta2
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.m_list = [0.0 for _ in params] #Initialized with 0 for each parameter
        self.v_list = [0.0 for _ in params]
        self.t = 0

    def step(self, grads):
        self.t += 1
        updated_params = []
        for i in range(len(self.params)):
          m = self.beta1 * self.m_list[i] + (1 - self.beta1) * grads[i]
          v = self.beta2 * self.v_list[i] + (1 - self.beta2) * grads[i]**2
          m_hat = m / (1 - self.beta1**self.t)
          v_hat = v / (1 - self.beta2**self.t)
          updated_param = self.params[i] - self.alpha * m_hat / (v_hat**0.5 + self.epsilon)
          updated_params.append(updated_param)
          self.m_list[i] = m
          self.v_list[i] = v
        self.params = updated_params

# Initialize parameters and an instance of the optimizer
parameters = [10.0, 5.0, 2.0]
optimizer = AdamOptimizer(parameters)

# Simulate gradient and update parameters
gradients = [2.0, -1.0, 0.5]
optimizer.step(gradients)
print(f"Updated Parameters: {optimizer.params}")

# Next update:
gradients = [1.0, 1.0, -1.0]
optimizer.step(gradients)
print(f"Updated Parameters: {optimizer.params}")

```

In this example, we wrap Adam's functionality within a class, demonstrating a more organized way to manage parameters and their associated optimization states. It showcases how the internal momentum values and the iteration count can be tracked effectively.

For further understanding and application, I would recommend consulting optimization chapters in standard textbooks on deep learning and machine learning. Additionally, research papers detailing the original Adam algorithm, as well as those that compare and contrast various optimization techniques, provide deeper insight. A strong understanding of calculus and linear algebra is crucial for fully grasping the mathematical underpinnings of the algorithm. Examining the source code of popular deep learning frameworks, particularly their optimizer implementations, can further enhance practical comprehension.
