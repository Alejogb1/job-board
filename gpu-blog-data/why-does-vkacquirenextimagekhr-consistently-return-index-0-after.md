The consistent return of index 0 from `vkAcquireNextImageKHR` after a swapchain resize stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the Vulkan synchronization primitives and their interaction with swapchain recreation.  In my experience debugging similar issues across numerous Vulkan applications, I’ve observed this behavior is almost always due to a failure to properly handle the synchronization objects associated with the *old* swapchain after its destruction.  The runtime may reuse memory addresses and, unless explicitly destroyed, semaphores and fences associated with the old swapchain can lead to unpredictable behavior, including the persistent return of image index 0.


The core problem is that `vkAcquireNextImageKHR` waits for the image to become available. This availability is determined by signals associated with rendering commands completed *on that image*. If these signals are improperly handled during the swapchain resize, the system might incorrectly determine image 0 (often the first image created) is perpetually available, regardless of the actual state of the newly created swapchain images.  The new swapchain has new images, but the acquired semaphore may still be referencing the old, destroyed images.  This creates a race condition where the fence or semaphore associated with the image completion, from the previously rendered frame, remains signalled while the new images are not yet available.  This leads to the illusion of the first image constantly being ready, even though it's no longer part of the active swapchain.


Let's analyze this with concrete examples.


**1. Incorrect Semaphore Handling:**

```c++
// ... previous code ...

// Swapchain resize code (simplified for clarity)
vkDeviceWaitIdle(device); // Necessary for complete destruction
vkDestroySwapchainKHR(device, swapchain, nullptr);
swapchain = createSwapchain( ... ); // Create a new swapchain

// Incorrect handling:  Reusing the old semaphores without resetting their state.
VkResult result = vkAcquireNextImageKHR(device, swapchain, UINT64_MAX, imageAvailableSemaphore, VK_NULL_HANDLE, &imageIndex);
if (result == VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR) {
    // Handle swapchain out of date.  This is not the problem here
} else if (result != VK_SUCCESS) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to acquire swapchain image!");
}

// ... rest of rendering code using imageIndex (which is almost certainly 0) ...

// ... later, the same semaphore is used in submission without proper synchronization leading to unpredictable behavior.

// ... end code ...
```

This example demonstrates the critical error.  While `vkDeviceWaitIdle` ensures that the old swapchain's operations are complete *before* destruction, it doesn't reset the semaphores. Consequently, `imageAvailableSemaphore`, which is likely still signaled from a completion of rendering on the *old* swapchain, will always satisfy `vkAcquireNextImageKHR`, resulting in the continuous return of image index 0.  The solution requires recreating the semaphores after the swapchain recreation.


**2.  Ignoring Fence Signals:**

```c++
// ... code ...

// ... swapchain resize code ...

// Ignoring proper fence handling.
VkResult result = vkAcquireNextImageKHR(device, swapchain, UINT64_MAX, imageAvailableSemaphore, fence, &imageIndex);

// ... rendering using imageIndex which will be 0.
// ... submission code where the fence is never waited on or reset


// ... end code ...
```

This illustrates another common pitfall.  Using a fence to signal image availability often involves waiting on the fence before acquiring the next image.  If the fence isn’t properly waited on (`vkWaitForFences`) and reset (`vkResetFences`) after each frame, the rendering commands associated with the old swapchain remain in the pipeline, erroneously signaling the availability of an image from the old swapchain.  This is more subtle than the semaphore case, as the problem might not manifest immediately, leading to sporadic behavior.


**3. Correct Implementation:**

```c++
// ... previous code ...

// Swapchain resize (simplified)
vkDeviceWaitIdle(device);
vkDestroySwapchainKHR(device, swapchain, nullptr);
vkDestroySemaphore(device, imageAvailableSemaphore, nullptr); // Destroy old semaphore
// ... destroy other relevant synchronization objects associated with the old swapchain...

swapchain = createSwapchain( ... );
imageAvailableSemaphore = createSemaphore(device); // Create a new semaphore
// ... recreate other synchronization objects as needed

VkResult result = vkAcquireNextImageKHR(device, swapchain, UINT64_MAX, imageAvailableSemaphore, VK_NULL_HANDLE, &imageIndex);
if (result == VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR || result == VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR) {
    //Handle resize appropriately, recreate swapchain etc.
} else if (result != VK_SUCCESS) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Failed to acquire swapchain image!");
}

// ... rendering using imageIndex.

// ... before submitting rendering commands:
// ... wait on any fences associated with previous frames
// ... submit commands, signaled with a new fence
// ... after submission, wait on new fence to ensure completion
// ... reset the new fence for reuse in the next frame


// ... end code ...
```

This example shows the correct approach.  The old semaphore is explicitly destroyed before creating a new one.  Critically, this example also highlights the need for proper fence handling—waiting on the fence before acquisition and resetting it afterwards to prevent false signaling from the previous frame.  Complete synchronization management is paramount to preventing this issue.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The Vulkan specification itself is the ultimate authority. Supplement this with a good Vulkan API textbook and a well-structured Vulkan tutorial series focusing on synchronization primitives.  A dedicated chapter or section covering swapchain recreation and the correct handling of synchronization during resize is essential. Examine sample applications that properly handle swapchain resizing, paying close attention to how synchronization objects are managed across the entire lifecycle of the swapchain.  Thorough understanding of memory management in Vulkan is crucial for avoiding subtle issues like this.  Finally, using a Vulkan debugging layer can help identify inconsistencies in your synchronization mechanisms, providing invaluable insights into the actual timing of events.
