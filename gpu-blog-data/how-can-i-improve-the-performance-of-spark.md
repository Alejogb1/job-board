Directly impacting Spark SQL's `INSERT INTO` performance for Hive tables often boils down to optimizing data serialization and file writing strategies within the Hadoop ecosystem, as well as understanding how Spark's execution plan interacts with Hive's storage mechanisms. I've personally seen scenarios where poorly configured partitions or an inefficient write mode would cripple even modest data loading tasks, pushing completion times from minutes to hours.

The performance bottleneck when inserting data into a Hive table through Spark SQL usually originates in the serialization and deserialization phases between Spark’s internal data representation and Hive’s storage formats. Spark processes data in-memory, often utilizing its efficient Tungsten execution engine. However, when writing to Hive, Spark must convert this internal data into formats such as text, sequence files, or, most commonly, Parquet or ORC, which Hive understands. The chosen format, coupled with how Spark partitions the data, significantly affects write speed and resource utilization. Furthermore, Hive's configuration impacts the writing process, especially with regards to how it creates and manages the resulting files and directories.

Let's examine these aspects systematically. First, consider the file format. Parquet and ORC are columnar storage formats that excel in analytical workloads where only a subset of columns are accessed. These formats are far more efficient than row-based formats like text or sequence files, because they enable predicate pushdown, whereby filtering operations occur at the data reading level before the Spark engine gets involved, as well as more efficient compression. Switching from a less efficient format to either Parquet or ORC can often lead to a substantial performance increase. Choosing between Parquet and ORC often comes down to specific use-cases, with ORC offering superior compression in many cases. However, Parquet’s broader ecosystem support may make it a better default option for interoperability.

Secondly, partitioning the data logically within the Hive table affects how Spark writes to disk and how Hive performs subsequent queries. Without partitioning, all data is written into a single massive file, leading to slower write operations and inefficient subsequent queries. Partitioning the table on a suitable column (e.g., date, location) allows Spark to write data into smaller, separate files. This, in turn, limits the amount of data that must be processed when performing queries on specific partitions.

Thirdly, Spark’s write mode is crucial. When inserting data, Spark offers different write modes: `overwrite`, `append`, `ignore`, and `errorifexists`. `Overwrite` replaces existing data, which can be suitable in situations where you intend to update the whole table. `Append` adds data to existing data. Using `overwrite` might be more efficient when dealing with large updates, especially with partitioned tables because it allows Spark to delete the old partition directory and write directly into the new one. `Append` requires to check for files already present in target directory, which might involve additional time.

Beyond these core considerations, the number of files created per partition is significant. Too many small files, often termed the "small files problem", can significantly slow down both write and read operations because metadata operations for each file add overhead. Spark allows control over the number of output files through methods such as `repartition` or `coalesce`. Using `coalesce` before writing will reduce the number of partition in dataframe resulting in smaller number of files while `repartition` will shuffle data and can result in even distribution of data across output files.

Let’s consider three code examples, demonstrating how these principles can be applied to improve `INSERT INTO` operations.

**Example 1: Changing the File Format and Partitioning**

This example demonstrates how to convert a table from text to Parquet, while introducing partitioning on a ‘date’ column.
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Assume 'source_table' exists and 'target_table' does not
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("HiveInsert").enableHiveSupport().getOrCreate()

# Read source data
source_df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM source_table")

#Partition on date column
date_partitioned_df = source_df.repartition(12,col("date"))

# Write into a new Parquet table with partitioning
date_partitioned_df.write.mode("overwrite")\
    .partitionBy("date")\
    .format("parquet")\
    .saveAsTable("target_table")

spark.stop()
```

Here, I read the data from `source_table`, partition the data on the ‘date’ column, and write it into a new table named `target_table`, explicitly using Parquet and specifying `overwrite` mode. Previously the table `source_table` was stored in plain text, and was not partitioned. Introducing partitioning and switching to Parquet dramatically improves performance. The number of partitions (12) is a hyperparameter and should be determined based on the size of the data. I am using `repartition` to enforce more even distribution and achieve higher degree of parallelism on smaller cluster with limited resources.

**Example 2:  Adjusting Write Mode and  Number of Output Files**

This example focuses on tuning an existing table, assuming that data is being loaded regularly on daily basis.
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Assume 'existing_table' exists and is partitioned on 'date'
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("HiveInsert").enableHiveSupport().getOrCreate()

# Read data from source
new_data_df = spark.sql("SELECT * from daily_data_source where date = '2024-01-01'")

#Coalesce the data into a reasonable number of partitions before writing
new_data_coalesced_df = new_data_df.coalesce(4)

# Write to the partitioned table in append mode with overwrite partitions
new_data_coalesced_df.write.mode("append")\
    .insertInto("existing_table", overwrite=True)

spark.stop()
```

In this example, I'm appending new data to the `existing_table`, which is already partitioned by `date`. I'm reading daily data which is added to the partition related to '2024-01-01' date. The important part is using `coalesce(4)` to reduce the number of output files. `Coalesce` avoids shuffling and repartitioning data which is suitable here since we are inserting only a small amount of new daily data. In case of full data update, `overwrite` mode might be preferable in the write configuration. Also, the `insertInto` operation, unlike saveAsTable, allows the user to specify `overwrite=True` for partitions only. If the table has large number of partitions, it might help to only override a specific partition rather than overwriting the whole table. It saves significant time in a daily batch processing scenario, where new data for a day is being inserted.

**Example 3: Using Bucketing**

This example shows how to use bucketing for tables that will be subject to join operations on one or multiple columns.
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Assume 'source_table' exists and 'bucketed_table' does not
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("HiveInsert").enableHiveSupport().getOrCreate()

# Read source data
source_df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM source_table")

#Bucket table on 'id' into 100 buckets
bucketed_df = source_df.repartition(100, col("id"))

# Write the bucketed table
bucketed_df.write.mode("overwrite")\
    .bucketBy(100, "id")\
    .sortBy("id")\
    .saveAsTable("bucketed_table")

spark.stop()
```

In this scenario, I am creating a table, `bucketed_table`, that is bucketed by the `id` column into 100 buckets. The table is also sorted by `id`. Bucketing improves performance for join operations performed between two bucketed tables. When joining on bucketed columns, Spark can perform shuffle-free joins which are significantly faster compared to regular join operations.  I also repartitioned data before bucketing to achieve better data distribution in buckets.

In summary, the key to improving Spark SQL `INSERT INTO` performance with Hive revolves around a few core strategies. First, choose a columnar format such as Parquet or ORC over row-based formats. Secondly, partition your data on relevant columns, to limit the volume of data accessed during subsequent queries. Adjust your write mode based on use-case. Finally, be mindful of small files; repartition data to increase parallelism and use `coalesce` to reduce the number of output files. Furthermore, for tables with joins, consider the option of bucketing for improved performance.

For further study, I would recommend focusing on the official Apache Spark documentation, specifically sections covering SQL performance tuning, file formats, and data partitioning. Consulting documentation on Apache Hive will help when dealing with interactions between Spark and Hive metastore and file format handling. Additional resources to explore include books and articles related to big data processing optimization, particularly those discussing distributed file systems and columnar storage formats. It's always beneficial to examine configurations in both your Spark environment and your Hive environment, to ensure that they are aligned and that you're maximizing your I/O throughput. Also, hands-on experimentation, such as running performance test with different data volumes, number of partitions, and varying file sizes, is valuable to develop intuition about these parameters and how they impact performance.
