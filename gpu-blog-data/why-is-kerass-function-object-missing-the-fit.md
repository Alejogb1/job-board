The absence of a `fit` attribute on a Keras functional API model object stems from a fundamental design difference between the Sequential and Functional APIs.  My experience building complex, production-ready models in Keras, specifically those involving custom layers and non-sequential architectures, has repeatedly highlighted this distinction.  The `fit` method isn't directly associated with the model *object* itself in the Functional API; instead, it's a method of the `Model` class, which *wraps* the functional model definition.  This distinction is crucial for understanding how the Functional API constructs and manages models, especially those beyond the scope of simple linear stacks of layers.

The Sequential API provides a straightforward, layer-by-layer construction.  Its inherent simplicity allows for the direct attachment of the `fit` method to the model instance.  However, the Functional API offers greater flexibility for creating intricate models with complex connections, including residual connections, shared layers, and multiple inputs/outputs.  This flexibility necessitates a decoupling of model definition and training.  The functional model, built by connecting layers through tensors, is essentially a graph representation;  the `Model` class then compiles this graph, defining the training process, allowing for the application of the `fit` method.

Let's clarify this with examples.

**Example 1: Simple Sequential Model (for contrast)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# fit method is directly accessible
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

Here, the `Sequential` model directly possesses the `fit` attribute.  This is a consequence of the sequential nature of the modelâ€”its structure is implicit and readily understood by Keras.  The `compile` method prepares the model for training, and `fit` then executes the training loop. This is a simpler, more compact representation, but lacks the flexibility of the Functional API.

**Example 2: Functional API Model with Shared Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

input_tensor = keras.Input(shape=(784,))
x = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_tensor)
shared_layer = keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', name='shared')
branch1 = shared_layer(x)
branch2 = shared_layer(x) # Shared layer used multiple times

output1 = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax', name='output1')(branch1)
output2 = keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax', name='output2')(branch2)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=[output1, output2])

# fit method is on the Model object, not the individual layers or tensors
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=['categorical_crossentropy', 'categorical_crossentropy'],
              loss_weights=[0.7, 0.3], # Allows for weighting multiple outputs
              metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(x_train, [y_train_1, y_train_2], epochs=10)
```

This demonstrates the power of the Functional API. We define the model as a graph using tensors as connections between layers.  The `shared_layer` is used in two branches, illustrating a common practice in advanced network architectures. Note that `model.fit` is called on the `keras.Model` object created, not directly on any individual layer or tensor. This model has multiple outputs, requiring careful consideration of loss functions and weight assignments during compilation. The `fit` method operates on the entire graph, handling the complexities of backpropagation and weight updates across all connected layers.


**Example 3: Functional API Model with Multiple Inputs**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

input_a = keras.Input(shape=(784,), name='input_a')
input_b = keras.Input(shape=(10,), name='input_b')

x = keras.layers.concatenate([input_a, input_b])
x = keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
output = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)

model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_a, input_b], outputs=output)

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit([x_train_a, x_train_b], y_train, epochs=10)
```

This example showcases a model with two input tensors.  The Functional API elegantly handles this by specifying both inputs when creating the `keras.Model` object.  The `fit` method then expects two input arrays, reflecting the two input tensors in the model definition. This flexibility is not readily achievable with the Sequential API.  The underlying graph structure, defined implicitly in the Sequential API and explicitly in the Functional API, dictates how the `fit` method interacts with the model.


In summary, the absence of `fit` on the functional model *object itself* is by design.  The Functional API prioritizes flexibility and allows for building complex, non-sequential architectures.  The `keras.Model` class provides the necessary interface, wrapping the functional model definition and providing the `fit`, `evaluate`, and `predict` methods for training, evaluation, and inference, respectively.  This separation between model definition and training is a key feature and not a deficiency of the Functional API.  Understanding this distinction is fundamental to leveraging the full power and expressiveness of Keras for building sophisticated neural networks.


**Resource Recommendations:**

1.  The official Keras documentation on the Functional API.  Thoroughly review the examples and explanations provided.
2.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning, covering both theoretical foundations and practical implementations in frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.
3.  Research papers on deep learning architectures, paying close attention to those that employ intricate connections and non-sequential structures.  These will further illustrate the necessity and advantages of the Functional API.
