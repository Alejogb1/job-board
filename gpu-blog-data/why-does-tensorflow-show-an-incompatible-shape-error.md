The root cause of a TensorFlow shape incompatibility error, specifically observed as a mismatch between `[90]` and `[8704]`, often stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how tensors are reshaped and processed within a deep learning model's architecture. I’ve encountered this exact error multiple times, frequently during the prototyping phase of sequence-to-sequence models where dynamic input lengths and pre-defined output layers interact. The disparity highlights a conflict between the expected shape for an operation and the actual shape of the tensor passed to it, indicating an inconsistent data flow within the graph.

Essentially, TensorFlow operations operate on tensors with pre-defined dimensionalities. The numbers within the brackets denote the size of each dimension. So `[90]` represents a tensor with a single dimension, having 90 elements. Similarly, `[8704]` also represents a single dimension, but with 8704 elements. An incompatibility error signals that an operation designed to accept a tensor of shape `[8704]` received one of shape `[90]`, or vice versa. This mismatch arises because a reshaping operation, a misconfigured layer, or an incorrect data preparation step has failed to align the data dimensions.

Let's break down typical scenarios using concrete code examples, considering that both the stated shapes suggest vectors within a neural network. The smaller shape, `[90]`, might be the result of processing a sequence of some kind, while the larger `[8704]` could be a result of vocabulary expansion, like the one-hot encoding of a vocabulary that has 8704 unique tokens.

**Example 1: Mismatch in Fully Connected Layer Input**

This scenario often occurs after some preprocessing, perhaps after embedding a word sequence. The embedding output may be of the shape `[batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dimension]`. If we flatten this, we would expect a tensor suitable for a fully connected (dense) layer. However, a mistake at this stage can lead to this error.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

#Assume input is a sequence of integers representing word indices
sequence_length = 90
embedding_dimension = 256
batch_size = 32

# Simulating an embedding lookup
embedded_sequence = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dimension))

# Incorrect flattening, mistakenly dropping the batch dimension
flattened_incorrect = tf.reshape(embedded_sequence, [-1, sequence_length * embedding_dimension])
#flattened_incorrect shape is [batch_size, 23040], not what we want if a layer expected input to be of [8704].

#Incorrect way to process, where we only want the flattened output of one sample
flattened_single_incorrect = tf.reshape(embedded_sequence[0], [-1])

# Assume a dense layer expecting input of [8704]
dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu', input_shape=(8704,))


try:
    #This will cause a shape error
    dense_output = dense_layer(flattened_single_incorrect)
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Correct flattening to maintain batch dimension:
flattened_correct = tf.reshape(embedded_sequence, [batch_size, -1])

# Example of a correctly shaped layer where it is possible we would see an error if the output was intended to be [90] rather than [8704].
another_dense_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu', input_shape=(sequence_length*embedding_dimension,))
dense_output_correct = another_dense_layer(flattened_correct)
print(f"Correct Dense layer output shape: {dense_output_correct.shape}")

```

In this example, `embedded_sequence` initially has the shape `[32, 90, 256]`. The `flattened_incorrect` shape is `[32, 23040]` (i.e. 32 batches of 23040). However, the mistake we make is the case where we attempt to process only one sample of the batch, by grabbing only one sequence using `embedded_sequence[0]`. We reshape this, resulting in `flattened_single_incorrect` having shape `[23040]` if we want to flatten without maintaining batch sizes, yet we could be expecting [8704] from the input of the dense layer. The `dense_layer` is configured to expect a shape of `[8704]`, causing the error when we provide `flattened_single_incorrect` of the shape `[23040]`. If the user was expecting the output of the layer to be of the shape `[90]`, then an error would also occur. The second layer, `another_dense_layer` correctly processes a flattened batch of data. The critical point is the need to ensure that flattening retains the batch dimension to match the intended input shape of the dense layer, and that the dimensions are correctly mapped to the subsequent layer.

**Example 2: Inconsistent Output Layer Shape in Sequence Models**

The `[90]` shape could represent a sequence length, like in a recurrent neural network. An issue can arise if you then expect an output of the vocabulary size (say, 8704), but have mismatched dimensionalities. Consider a decoder in a sequence-to-sequence model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assume previous decoder output is of shape [batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_units]
batch_size = 32
sequence_length = 90
hidden_units = 512

decoder_output = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_units))

# This example assumes a vocabulary size of 8704
vocabulary_size = 8704

# Incorrect projection
incorrect_output_projection = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=vocabulary_size, activation='softmax')
incorrect_logits = incorrect_output_projection(decoder_output)
#incorrect_logits has shape [32, 90, 8704], where the output should be shaped [batch_size, vocabulary_size].

# Incorrect operation, intended to sum all tokens in the sequence:
incorrect_summed = tf.reduce_sum(incorrect_logits, axis = 1)

# Attempting to use the summed result in a calculation
incorrect_reshape = tf.reshape(incorrect_summed, [-1])

# Attempting to use the summed result in a calculation
second_incorrect_projection = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu', input_shape=(8704,))
try:
    second_incorrect_output = second_incorrect_projection(incorrect_reshape)
    #This will cause an error as the shape is not as expected from the dense layer.
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")


# Correct projection - first flatten the input across sequence, maintain batch
correct_reshape = tf.reshape(decoder_output, [batch_size, -1])
correct_output_projection = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=vocabulary_size, activation='softmax')
correct_logits = correct_output_projection(correct_reshape)

#correct_logits has the shape [32, 8704] now

print(f"Correct projection shape: {correct_logits.shape}")
```

Here, `decoder_output` has the shape `[32, 90, 512]`. The incorrect approach makes two key errors: first, it attempts to directly feed this 3 dimensional tensor to a dense layer, expecting to have a output of a shape that represents the vocabulary size per token in the sequence, instead of for the sequence as a whole. Then, we attempt to sum each of the tokens in the sequence. This will cause a mismatch between our shapes and the expected shape of the subsequent layer. The correct operation flattens the sequence length, preserving the batch size, resulting in correct output shape `[32, 8704]`.

**Example 3: Incorrect Data Preprocessing**

Sometimes, shape issues arise due to erroneous preprocessing before feeding the data into the network. For example, if you process data in a manner that is inconsistent between training, validation and testing datasets.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Assume raw data has a different number of elements for different samples
raw_data_1 = np.random.rand(90)
raw_data_2 = np.random.rand(8704)

# Incorrect Preprocessing: attempt to pad but with a fixed number of pads for all samples
padded_data_1 = tf.pad(raw_data_1, [[0, 100]], constant_values=0)
padded_data_2 = tf.pad(raw_data_2, [[0, 100]], constant_values=0)

#Incorrect stacking into a tensor, causing a shape inconsistency.
incorrect_tensor = tf.stack([padded_data_1, padded_data_2])

# Attempt to perform batch processing assuming batch is dimension 0:
try:
    incorrect_batch_processing = tf.reduce_mean(incorrect_tensor, axis=1)
    #This will cause an error as the two samples have different shapes after padding.
except tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Correct Preprocessing: pad to the maximum length in the batch
max_length = max(raw_data_1.size, raw_data_2.size)
padded_data_1_correct = tf.pad(raw_data_1, [[0, max_length - raw_data_1.size]], constant_values=0)
padded_data_2_correct = tf.pad(raw_data_2, [[0, max_length - raw_data_2.size]], constant_values=0)

#Correct stacking
correct_tensor = tf.stack([padded_data_1_correct, padded_data_2_correct])

# Example use where we now have a correctly shaped tensor:
correct_batch_processing = tf.reduce_mean(correct_tensor, axis=1)

print(f"Correct tensor shape: {correct_tensor.shape}")
print(f"Correct batch processing output shape: {correct_batch_processing.shape}")
```

The critical mistake here is padding every raw data array to a fixed arbitrary length rather than to the maximum length within the batch itself, resulting in the first sample being padded to length `90+100 = 190`, and the second to `8704+100 = 8804`. The `tf.stack` function then raises an error because they are no longer compatible. The correctly processed version pads to the appropriate length, thereby ensuring that a correctly stacked tensor is formed.

To resolve these shape mismatches, a systematic approach is essential. It’s necessary to carefully trace the tensor’s path from input to the problematic operation, logging shapes at each critical stage. This involves using `tf.shape()` at relevant points to debug dynamically, as well as scrutinizing any reshaping or layer configurations that modify the tensor dimensions. Correcting these inconsistencies involves ensuring that dimensions match the requirements of the operations that follow. This often requires using the correct axis parameter in `tf.reshape`, `tf.reduce_sum`, `tf.reduce_mean`, or carefully constructing layers with defined `input_shape`. Moreover, using debugging tools provided by TensorFlow is helpful in identifying where the shapes go wrong.

For resources, I'd strongly recommend the TensorFlow official documentation. This includes guides and tutorials on model construction and tensor manipulation. There are also textbooks that provide detailed explanations of neural network architectures, helping you understand the theoretical context for these tensor operations. Furthermore, the numerous online courses on deep learning platforms offer structured lessons on TensorFlow, often focusing on practical implementation with case studies, which can help in building a robust understanding of tensor shapes and manipulations within neural networks. Remember, precise shape handling is paramount for successful deep learning implementation.
