BERT, a transformative model in Natural Language Processing, is structured as a deep neural network, primarily composed of multiple Transformer encoder layers. Accessing intermediate layer outputs is crucial when one needs to go beyond the final classification or sequence output typically provided by the standard Hugging Face `transformers` library. I've frequently needed this capability during experiments involving representation learning and fine-grained analysis of the model's internal states.

The core challenge stems from the fact that the default behavior of a BERT model, when invoked, usually returns the final hidden states (the output from the last layer), pooled output (for sentence classification), or attention weights, depending on the task and configuration. Directly accessing the hidden states of every layer requires manipulating the model's output format and retrieving the hidden state tensors at those intermediate points. This is not exposed by default, necessitating a careful approach using the `output_hidden_states` configuration parameter.

To obtain all the layer outputs, one must first instantiate the model with the configuration option `output_hidden_states=True`. This modifies the output structure to include a tuple of hidden state tensors, each representing the output of a specific layer. Crucially, this tuple is ordered such that index 0 refers to the embedding layer output, followed by the output from each subsequent Transformer encoder layer. The final element, naturally, corresponds to the last Transformer encoder layer. Without setting this configuration option during model instantiation, only the final layer outputs will be returned, and attempts to access intermediate layer outputs will fail.

The `transformers` library provides a straightforward method to achieve this. First, the model needs to be loaded with the specified configuration change. Then, a tokenizer must process the text input, preparing it for the BERT model's consumption. Finally, upon processing the tokenized input, the model's output will be structured to facilitate extraction of intermediate layer hidden states. The following code examples illustrate this process:

**Code Example 1: Basic Hidden State Retrieval**

```python
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = BertModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", output_hidden_states=True)

input_text = "This is an example sentence."
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

outputs = model(**inputs)

# Outputs is a tuple, the first element contains the last layer's output. The second is the tuple of the hidden states.
hidden_states = outputs.hidden_states

# The first element (index 0) of 'hidden_states' corresponds to the embeddings layer
embeddings = hidden_states[0]

# The last element (index -1) contains the last layer's output (same as outputs.last_hidden_state).
last_layer_output = hidden_states[-1]

# Access the hidden state of the 5th layer
fifth_layer_output = hidden_states[5]

print(f"Shape of embeddings: {embeddings.shape}")
print(f"Shape of last layer output: {last_layer_output.shape}")
print(f"Shape of fifth layer output: {fifth_layer_output.shape}")
```

In this example, after loading the model with the `output_hidden_states=True` setting, I tokenize the input text and then invoke the model. The output structure is now a tuple, and the `hidden_states` field contains a tuple of tensors. Each tensor inside corresponds to an output from one specific layer. As shown, index `0` holds the embedding layer output, `last_layer_output` (index `-1`) contains the output of the final layer (equivalent to `outputs.last_hidden_state`), and `fifth_layer_output` (index `5`) retrieves the output from the fifth layer in the stack. The printed shapes illustrate the tensor dimensions, which represent the sequence length, batch size, and hidden size of the corresponding layer. This is fundamental for ensuring that the outputs are accessed correctly and that operations are applied to the appropriate dimensions.

**Code Example 2: Accessing Specific Layers with Iteration**

```python
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = BertModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", output_hidden_states=True)

input_texts = ["This is sentence one.", "This is sentence two."]
inputs = tokenizer(input_texts, padding=True, return_tensors="pt")

outputs = model(**inputs)
hidden_states = outputs.hidden_states

# Iterate over the hidden states from each layer for analysis
for i, hidden_state in enumerate(hidden_states):
    print(f"Shape of layer {i} hidden states: {hidden_state.shape}")

# Extract all layers for sentence one only
layer_outputs_sentence_one = [layer_output[0, :, :] for layer_output in hidden_states]

# Stack the layers of sentence one into a single tensor
stacked_layers = torch.stack(layer_outputs_sentence_one)

print(f"Stacked layers for first sentence shape: {stacked_layers.shape}")
```

This example demonstrates an important use case. Instead of accessing individual layers by a fixed index, I use a loop to iterate over all the hidden states, printing each layer's tensor shape. I then proceed to extract the output for the first sentence across all layers, a common procedure when working with sentence-specific layer outputs. Finally, these layer-specific outputs are stacked into a single tensor for further analysis, showcasing how one might compile specific subsets of the model's output for targeted feature extraction or downstream tasks. Note the padding applied to the input, which ensures that sequences are processed correctly, even when of varying lengths. This aligns with best practices for working with batch inputs, ensuring that no sequence or padding tokens are dropped unintentionally.

**Code Example 3: Selective Layer Output with Custom Logic**

```python
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = BertModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", output_hidden_states=True)

input_text = "This is another sentence."
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

outputs = model(**inputs)
hidden_states = outputs.hidden_states

selected_layers = [0, 3, 7, -1]

# Using list comprehension to select layers
selected_outputs = [hidden_states[i] for i in selected_layers]


#Concatenate the selected hidden states across layers
concat_outputs = torch.cat(selected_outputs, dim=-1)
print(f"Shape of the concatenated output is: {concat_outputs.shape}")

# Extracting the first token representation across multiple layers
first_token_representations = [layer_output[:,0,:] for layer_output in selected_outputs]
stacked_first_token = torch.stack(first_token_representations, dim=-1)

print(f"Shape of the stacked first token representations: {stacked_first_token.shape}")
```

This final example showcases how I often apply custom logic when extracting layer outputs. I explicitly choose specific layers using a list of indices (embedding, 3rd, 7th, and last layers). By using a list comprehension, the correct outputs are selected, avoiding explicit loop management. Furthermore, I demonstrate concatenating the selected layer outputs along the hidden dimension, creating a new representation combining features from chosen layers. Similarly, I show extraction of first token embeddings across those layers and then stacking them. These operations allow for targeted analysis and manipulation, common when constructing models incorporating diverse hierarchical representations from BERT. Such selection and combination of layer outputs are crucial when attempting to harness the full potential of BERT’s representations.

For further study on accessing and interpreting BERT’s hidden states, I suggest researching papers on BERT's layerwise probing and understanding, which details how the representations change throughout the network. The official Hugging Face `transformers` documentation and tutorials are also excellent resources for understanding model configuration and output structures. In addition, exploring advanced use cases, like contextualized word embeddings or layerwise attention analysis will illuminate practical applications of manipulating hidden states. Finally, studying the architectural details of the Transformer network will clarify the nature of intermediate representations.
