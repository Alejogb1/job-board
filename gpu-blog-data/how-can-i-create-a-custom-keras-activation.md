Custom Keras activation functions incorporating additional parameters necessitate a nuanced understanding of Keras's backend and the limitations imposed by its automatic differentiation mechanism.  My experience developing neural networks for high-frequency trading applications highlighted this precisely â€“ the need for a custom activation function with a dynamically adjustable parameter influencing the network's sensitivity to specific market conditions.  This parameter couldn't be simply added as an argument to the activation function itself;  it had to be incorporated into the function's internal computation while maintaining Keras's ability to calculate gradients during backpropagation.

The core principle lies in leveraging the Keras backend, typically TensorFlow or Theano (depending on your Keras installation), to define the activation function and its derivative.  This allows for the parameter to be treated as a tensor, thus enabling the automatic differentiation process.  The challenge isn't in defining the function itself, but ensuring the gradient calculation remains compatible with Keras's automatic differentiation framework.  Failure to do so results in errors during training, typically related to incompatible tensor shapes or undefined gradients.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A custom Keras activation function with an additional parameter is implemented by creating a function that takes two arguments: the input tensor (`x`) and the additional parameter (`param`).  This function must then return the activated output tensor.  Crucially, a second function, the derivative of the activation function with respect to the input, must also be defined.  This derivative is required for backpropagation.  Both functions utilize the Keras backend to ensure compatibility with automatic differentiation.  The additional parameter `param` is treated as a constant during the forward pass, but its influence is accounted for during gradient calculation.

The inclusion of the parameter within the activation function's computation requires careful consideration of its interaction with the input tensor's shape.  Broadcasting rules will usually apply; the parameter should be broadcastable to match the shape of the input tensor if it's not already compatible.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  A Simple Scaled ReLU**

This example demonstrates a scaled Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) where the scaling factor is the additional parameter.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def scaled_relu(x, alpha):
    # Ensure alpha is a tensor
    alpha = tf.cast(alpha, dtype=x.dtype)

    #Apply broadcasting if necessary
    alpha = tf.broadcast_to(alpha, tf.shape(x))

    def scaled_relu_forward(x):
        return tf.keras.activations.relu(x) * alpha

    def scaled_relu_backward(x):
        return tf.cast(tf.greater(x, 0), dtype=x.dtype) * alpha

    return scaled_relu_forward(x), scaled_relu_backward(x)

# Example usage:
alpha = 0.5
layer = keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: scaled_relu(x, alpha)[0])
```

This code defines `scaled_relu` which handles both the forward and backward pass. The `alpha` parameter scales the output of the ReLU function. The `Lambda` layer in Keras applies this custom function.  The crucial aspect is that the `scaled_relu_backward` function correctly computes the gradient.



**Example 2:  A Parameterized Sigmoid**

This example showcases a sigmoid function modified by a parameter influencing its steepness.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def parameterized_sigmoid(x, k):
    k = tf.cast(k, dtype=x.dtype)
    k = tf.broadcast_to(k, tf.shape(x))

    def parameterized_sigmoid_forward(x):
        return tf.math.sigmoid(k * x)

    def parameterized_sigmoid_backward(x):
        s = tf.math.sigmoid(k * x)
        return k * s * (1 - s)

    return parameterized_sigmoid_forward(x), parameterized_sigmoid_backward(x)

#Example Usage
k = 2.0
layer = keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: parameterized_sigmoid(x, k)[0])
```

Here, the `k` parameter controls the steepness of the sigmoid curve.  The backward pass accurately calculates the gradient using the chain rule, taking into account the influence of `k`. The Lambda layer cleanly integrates the custom function.


**Example 3:  A More Complex Example with Tensor Manipulation**

This example demonstrates a custom activation function where the parameter interacts more intricately with the input tensor.  It assumes familiarity with tensor manipulation in TensorFlow/Theano.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

def complex_activation(x, param_tensor):
    param_tensor = tf.cast(param_tensor, dtype=x.dtype)
    param_tensor = tf.reshape(param_tensor, [-1, 1]) # Reshape to ensure correct broadcasting

    def forward_pass(x):
        return tf.math.tanh(x + tf.math.multiply(x, param_tensor))

    def backward_pass(x):
        # Calculation of the gradient needs to consider the complex interaction
        # This part requires careful mathematical derivation specific to the forward pass
        intermediate = tf.math.tanh(x + tf.math.multiply(x, param_tensor))
        gradient = (1 - tf.math.square(intermediate)) * (1 + param_tensor)
        return gradient

    return forward_pass(x), backward_pass(x)

# Example usage
param_tensor = tf.constant([0.2, 0.5, 0.8], shape=(3,1))
layer = keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: complex_activation(x, param_tensor)[0])
```


This example highlights the need for a meticulously derived backward pass, emphasizing the importance of mathematical correctness. The reshaping of the `param_tensor` ensures proper broadcasting.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The Keras documentation, specifically the sections on custom layers and backend usage, provides essential information.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning (e.g.,  Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville's "Deep Learning") provides the mathematical background necessary for correctly deriving gradients.  Furthermore, understanding of automatic differentiation principles and how they are implemented in TensorFlow/Theano is crucial for debugging and preventing errors.  Finally, practical experience with tensor manipulations within the chosen backend is invaluable.
