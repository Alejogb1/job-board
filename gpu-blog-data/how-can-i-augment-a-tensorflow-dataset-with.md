TensorFlow Datasets frequently require manipulation beyond basic transformations. Specifically, the challenge lies in modifying elements in a dataset dynamically, adding new data derived from the existing structure of each element. This often arises in scenarios such as creating synthetic training data or adding supplementary features based on existing ones, for example, augmenting image datasets with bounding box metadata or calculating complex statistics from input tensors.

The core principle involves utilizing the `tf.data.Dataset.map` function. This function applies a transformation to each element of the dataset. Crucially, within the `map` function, I can access the original element's structure, extract relevant attributes, and then construct new data to be included in the transformed element. This leverages TensorFlow's computational graph efficiently, performing the augmentations in a distributed and parallel manner, a design philosophy that is paramount for training performance.

Let's illustrate this with three practical code examples, drawing from my experience building custom models and pipelines.

**Example 1: Image Augmentation with Synthetic Bounding Boxes**

Imagine you have a dataset of images represented as tensors with the shape `(height, width, channels)`. Your data pipeline requires augmenting this with bounding box data. Let's assume for this example that I’ve already pre-processed the images and have an associated text file that contains information about which category each image belongs to.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def create_synthetic_bboxes(image):
    # Assume a simplified bounding box generation.
    height = tf.shape(image)[0]
    width = tf.shape(image)[1]
    bbox = tf.stack([
        tf.cast(0.1 * tf.cast(width, tf.float32), tf.int32), # x_min
        tf.cast(0.1 * tf.cast(height, tf.float32), tf.int32), # y_min
        tf.cast(0.8 * tf.cast(width, tf.float32), tf.int32), # x_max
        tf.cast(0.8 * tf.cast(height, tf.float32), tf.int32), # y_max
    ])

    return (image, bbox) # Return as a tuple

# Create a dummy image dataset using random data for demonstration
images = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 64, 64, 3))
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(images)

# Augment the dataset
augmented_dataset = dataset.map(create_synthetic_bboxes)

# Iterate and print results for demonstration.
for image, bbox in augmented_dataset:
    print("Image shape:", image.shape, "Bounding box:", bbox.numpy())

```

In this snippet, the `create_synthetic_bboxes` function receives a single image tensor. It computes a synthetic bounding box using arbitrary percentages of the image dimensions. It’s important to note that the bounding box coordinates are kept as integers, reflecting the pixel address space of an image. The function then returns both the original image and the calculated bounding box as a tuple.  The key part here is applying this function through the `dataset.map` call. I can then access each element as an image and associated bounding box. It's trivial to expand this to return multiple bounding boxes, or to vary the generation parameters based on image attributes if that’s the desired augmentation.

**Example 2:  Time Series Data Augmentation with Lagged Features**

Working with time-series data frequently necessitates incorporating lagged information. Suppose your dataset consists of time series represented as sequences of scalar values of type float. I often need to append lagged values to each element.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def add_lagged_features(sequence, lag_length = 3):
    # Construct a slice of the existing sequence from lag_length steps before the end
    lagged_values = sequence[:tf.size(sequence) - lag_length]
    
    # Pad the lagged values with zeros for the first 'lag_length' steps
    lagged_values = tf.pad(lagged_values, [[lag_length,0]], constant_values = 0.0)
    
    # Concatenate the sequence and its lagged values
    return tf.stack([sequence, lagged_values], axis = 1)


# Create a sample time series dataset (for demonstration)
time_series = tf.random.normal(shape=(10, 20))  # 10 sequences, each with 20 time steps
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(time_series)

# Augment the dataset
augmented_dataset = dataset.map(add_lagged_features)


# Iterate and print results for demonstration
for augmented_seq in augmented_dataset:
    print("Augmented sequence shape:", augmented_seq.shape)
    # Each augmented sequence is now of shape (20, 2) where second column contains lagged data
```
In this example, the `add_lagged_features` function takes a time series and a lag parameter as input. I’ve structured the function such that it slices the sequence to obtain a lagged version of it, shifting it ‘lag_length’ number of steps. The beginning of the lagged sequence is then padded with zeros to ensure it matches the length of the original time series, and I then vertically stack the original sequence and the lagged features. This returns an augmented sequence, with the lagged sequence contained as an additional channel along a user specified axis. This enables any subsequent layers to consider both current and past data.

**Example 3: Text Data Augmentation with Embedding Lookups**

It's common to deal with text data represented as sequences of integers corresponding to word indices. Often, it’s beneficial to include precomputed embeddings for each word when training language models. This can be incorporated directly into the dataset by augmenting the data with the embedding for each word in the sequence. This assumes I already have an embedding matrix or a function that can return an embedding for each word index.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def add_embeddings(sequence, embedding_matrix):
  # Embed the integer sequence using a look up matrix.
  embedded_sequence = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embedding_matrix, sequence)
  # Concatenate the integer sequence with the corresponding embeddings
  return (sequence, embedded_sequence)


# Create a dummy vocabulary and embedding matrix
vocab_size = 100
embedding_dim = 50
embedding_matrix = tf.random.normal(shape = (vocab_size, embedding_dim))

# Create a sample dataset of integer sequences (for demonstration)
text_sequences = tf.random.uniform(shape = (10, 15), maxval = vocab_size, dtype = tf.int32) # 10 sequences, each with 15 word IDs
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(text_sequences)

# Augment the dataset
augmented_dataset = dataset.map(lambda x: add_embeddings(x, embedding_matrix))

# Iterate and print results for demonstration
for seq, emb in augmented_dataset:
  print("Original sequence shape:", seq.shape, "Embedded sequence shape:", emb.shape)
  # Original is shape (15,) whilst embedded sequence is shape (15, 50)

```

In this snippet, the `add_embeddings` function accepts a sequence of word indices and the embedding matrix. I use TensorFlow’s `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` function which then returns the embedding for each word index in the provided sequence. The original integer sequence and its embeddings are returned as a tuple. Now each element in the augmented dataset contains both the original integer sequence and its embeddings. This provides an enriched representation for downstream model training.

In each of these examples, I have shown the ability to incorporate new information into an element by modifying the output of the function passed to `dataset.map`. The underlying structure remains compatible with TensorFlow’s dataset API.

For further study, I recommend focusing on several key resources. The official TensorFlow documentation provides thorough explanations of the `tf.data.Dataset` API and related functionalities. Additionally, research papers and tutorials focusing on data augmentation techniques for specific data types such as images, time series, and text data can offer deeper insights. Open source repositories, particularly those offering complete model implementation, are also helpful when analyzing practical applications of these concepts. When implementing data augmentation, it is critical to have a clear understanding of how data transformations affect the downstream model and therefore, a methodical, experimental approach is recommended.
