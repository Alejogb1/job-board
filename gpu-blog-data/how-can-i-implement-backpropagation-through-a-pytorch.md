Implementing backpropagation through a custom PyTorch LSTM built from tensor operations requires a meticulous understanding of the underlying LSTM equations and PyTorch's autograd system.  My experience developing high-performance recurrent neural networks for natural language processing has highlighted the crucial role of careful tensor manipulation in achieving efficient and numerically stable backpropagation.  The key lies in correctly calculating and propagating gradients through each gate and cell state update within the LSTM's recursive structure.  Failing to do so leads to incorrect gradient updates and ultimately, poor model performance.


**1.  Clear Explanation:**

A standard LSTM cell comprises four gates: input, forget, output, and cell.  These gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell state, which acts as a long-term memory component.  The equations governing these gates are:

* **Forget Gate:**  `f_t = σ(W_f ⋅ [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)`
* **Input Gate:** `i_t = σ(W_i ⋅ [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)`
* **Candidate Cell State:** `C̃_t = tanh(W_C ⋅ [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)`
* **Cell State:** `C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * C̃_t`
* **Output Gate:** `o_t = σ(W_o ⋅ [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)`
* **Hidden State:** `h_t = o_t * tanh(C_t)`

where:

* `x_t` is the input at time step `t`.
* `h_{t-1}` is the hidden state from the previous time step.
* `C_{t-1}` is the cell state from the previous time step.
* `W_f`, `W_i`, `W_C`, `W_o` are weight matrices for the forget, input, candidate cell, and output gates respectively.
* `b_f`, `b_i`, `b_C`, `b_o` are bias vectors.
* `σ` is the sigmoid activation function.
* `tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent activation function.
* `*` represents element-wise multiplication.

Implementing backpropagation involves computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to all the weights and biases.  PyTorch's autograd system automatically handles this, provided that the forward pass is constructed using operations supported by autograd.  Crucially, we must ensure that all intermediate tensors are retained for the backward pass by setting `requires_grad=True` on the tensors involved.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic LSTM Cell Implementation:**

```python
import torch

class LSTMCell(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super(LSTMCell, self).__init__()
        self.input_size = input_size
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.Wf = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(hidden_size, input_size + hidden_size))
        self.Wi = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(hidden_size, input_size + hidden_size))
        self.Wc = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(hidden_size, input_size + hidden_size))
        self.Wo = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(hidden_size, input_size + hidden_size))
        self.bf = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(hidden_size))
        self.bi = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(hidden_size))
        self.bc = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(hidden_size))
        self.bo = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(hidden_size))

    def forward(self, x, h, c):
        gates = torch.mm(torch.cat((h, x), dim=1), torch.cat((self.Wf, self.Wi, self.Wc, self.Wo),dim=0))
        f, i, g, o = torch.chunk(gates, 4, dim=1)
        f = torch.sigmoid(f + self.bf)
        i = torch.sigmoid(i + self.bi)
        g = torch.tanh(g + self.bc)
        o = torch.sigmoid(o + self.bo)
        c = f * c + i * g
        h = o * torch.tanh(c)
        return h, c

# Example usage:
lstm_cell = LSTMCell(input_size=10, hidden_size=20)
x = torch.randn(1,10)
h = torch.randn(1,20)
c = torch.randn(1,20)
h, c = lstm_cell(x,h,c)
```
This example demonstrates a basic LSTM cell implementation using explicit matrix multiplications and chunk operations.  The `requires_grad=True` is implicitly handled by PyTorch's parameter definition.

**Example 2:  Handling Sequences:**

```python
import torch

# ... (LSTMCell definition from Example 1) ...

def lstm_forward(lstm_cell, input_seq, h0, c0):
    h_seq = []
    c_t = c0
    h_t = h0
    for x_t in input_seq:
        h_t, c_t = lstm_cell(x_t, h_t, c_t)
        h_seq.append(h_t)
    return torch.stack(h_seq, dim=0)

# Example usage:
input_seq = torch.randn(10, 1, 10)  # sequence of 10 time steps, batch size 1
h0 = torch.randn(1, 20)
c0 = torch.randn(1, 20)
outputs = lstm_forward(lstm_cell, input_seq, h0, c0)
```
This illustrates processing an entire sequence. The `lstm_forward` function iterates through each time step, maintaining the hidden and cell states. The outputs are stacked for use in further processing.


**Example 3: Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT):**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# ... (LSTMCell and lstm_forward definitions from previous examples) ...

# Example Usage with BPTT
input_seq = torch.randn(10, 1, 10, requires_grad=True)
h0 = torch.randn(1, 20, requires_grad=True)
c0 = torch.randn(1, 20, requires_grad=True)
outputs = lstm_forward(lstm_cell, input_seq, h0, c0)
loss = F.mse_loss(outputs, torch.randn(10, 1, 20)) # Example loss function
loss.backward()

# Access Gradients
print(input_seq.grad)
print(h0.grad)
print(c0.grad)
for p in lstm_cell.parameters():
  print(p.grad)
```

Here, `requires_grad=True` is explicitly set for the input sequence, initial hidden and cell states to enable gradient calculation during backpropagation.  The example demonstrates a simple Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, but any differentiable loss function is applicable.  The gradients are then accessed to observe the effect of backpropagation.
