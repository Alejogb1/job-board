TensorFlow, even after a seemingly successful removal via pip or conda, can leave behind residual files and configurations that cause unexpected behavior in subsequent installations or when working with other Python environments. This persistence often stems from incomplete uninstallation procedures or cached package data. I've personally encountered this issue multiple times when managing various machine learning projects, necessitating a more hands-on approach to completely remove the library.

The primary issue arises because standard package managers, like pip and conda, are designed to handle the core package files and their declared dependencies. However, they may not always remove configuration files placed in user directories, compiled extensions, or cached build artifacts used by TensorFlow and its associated tools. These lingering elements can lead to conflicts during future TensorFlow installations or interfere with related libraries like Keras. In my experience, these ghost installations most commonly manifest as import errors or runtime inconsistencies after a supposed uninstallation. A comprehensive solution requires a multi-pronged strategy targeting not only the core package files, but also the common locations for these often overlooked residual components.

The initial step involves ensuring a clean slate using the package manager itself. I would always start by explicitly uninstalling the specific TensorFlow variants that were installed. If I had a GPU-enabled version installed, such as `tensorflow-gpu`, I must explicitly use that name rather than just `tensorflow`. Similarly, if I used the nightly builds, I would need to specify `tf-nightly`. This is fundamental since simply running `pip uninstall tensorflow` or `conda remove tensorflow` does not guarantee removal of a GPU enabled or nightly version of the library. Running the appropriate command first can avoid complications down the line. These commands would normally look like:

```python
# Example 1: Uninstalling tensorflow-gpu
pip uninstall tensorflow-gpu
# or
conda remove tensorflow-gpu
```

This should be followed by uninstalling related packages that might be installed along with TensorFlow. Often these include libraries like `tensorboard`, `tensorflow-estimator`, and `keras`. Even though these may be installed as dependencies of tensorflow, sometimes they are installed on their own and, thus, will need to be removed explicitly. This is critical, as those packages can cause conflicts with a fresh tensorflow installation if they are not removed. For example:

```python
# Example 2: Uninstalling related TensorFlow packages
pip uninstall tensorboard tensorflow-estimator keras
# or
conda remove tensorboard tensorflow-estimator keras
```

However, standard uninstallations rarely get rid of all components, so the next step I find to be the most critical. This process entails manual directory cleanup. TensorFlow, like many complex libraries, stores files in user-specific directories for configuration, caching, and build artifacts. I would start by searching the Python environments and deleting any folders that contain files associated with TensorFlow. Specifically, these usually include the following directories, which need to be checked in every environment that has used tensorflow:
* `~/.keras/`
* `~/anaconda3/envs/<my_env>/lib/python<version>/site-packages/tensorflow`
* `~/anaconda3/envs/<my_env>/lib/python<version>/site-packages/tensorflow_datasets`
* `~/anaconda3/envs/<my_env>/lib/python<version>/site-packages/tensorboard`
* `~/anaconda3/envs/<my_env>/lib/python<version>/site-packages/tensorflow_estimator`
* `~/anaconda3/envs/<my_env>/lib/python<version>/site-packages/keras`

Similarly, one must check for files created in build directories or cached directories. These directories can depend on the operating system and the tools used for building tensorflow, but a few locations are generally common:
* `/tmp`
* `~/.cache/`

In the case of custom builds of TensorFlow, or if you have compiled TensorFlow extensions, you might also need to manually search for and remove the shared libraries from the Python site-packages directories. These tend to end in `.so` or `.dylib` and are usually located inside the tensorflow and keras site-packages folders. This can be a bit more involved and can require a deeper understanding of your own system, as sometimes the names of the libraries are not as self-explanatory as the tensorflow folder. This is necessary to avoid conflicts when building and installing TensorFlow from source. The directories above are often created in the root of one's home directory, or in the python installations folder. The location of those folders depends on the installation method, the operating system, and the specific python environment used. One must check in all the relevant locations. This step, though manual, is critical for a completely clean slate.

After manual directory cleanup, the next stage I would take involves addressing the potential for cached package metadata and build artifacts. These caches are used by both `pip` and `conda` to speed up package installations, but can sometimes store incorrect or incomplete information, which leads to problems. This can manifest itself if, for instance, one has uninstalled all the files, but pip or conda still thinks that it is installed. The first step in cleaning those caches is usually to clear the relevant folders by using package manager commands. These commands are usually the following:

```python
# Example 3: Clearing pip and conda caches
pip cache purge
# or
conda clean --all
```

The command `pip cache purge` removes all the packages that were downloaded previously and are stored in the `pip` cache. Similarly, the command `conda clean --all` removes all of the packages stored by `conda`, as well as index data, lock files, and all other types of cache and associated files. This usually removes the potential of cached files being used when installing `tensorflow` again. I have found this step to be crucial after manually removing the residual files, as otherwise the package managers might still remember partial data and cause issues in the subsequent installation.

Finally, I would recommend performing a thorough system search for any remaining TensorFlow-related files or folders. These can be leftover configuration files or custom extensions installed by external tools. However, this has to be done with care, as this process can be dangerous if the wrong files are removed, as files unrelated to tensorflow can sometimes share names. The best approach is to do this process after the previous manual processes and use this final step as a safeguard. After all of these steps, the environment is ready for a fresh installation of TensorFlow.

For further information on these troubleshooting steps, I would suggest exploring the official documentation of `pip` and `conda`. These resources provide extensive details on package management and often include sections on troubleshooting installation and uninstallation issues. Additionally, the TensorFlow documentation includes sections on installation and dependencies, which can be useful for understanding how to properly install and uninstall the library. Finally, numerous blog posts and Stack Overflow threads address similar issues and contain useful advice for advanced cases. Accessing these resources will improve your knowledge of how the package manager functions, and can provide crucial help on dealing with common issues.
