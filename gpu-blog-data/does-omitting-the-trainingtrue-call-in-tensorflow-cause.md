Omitting the `training=True` argument in TensorFlow's layer calls during model training fundamentally alters the behavior of layers incorporating training-specific operations, such as Batch Normalization and Dropout.  This oversight can lead to suboptimal or entirely incorrect model training, ultimately impacting performance and generalization capabilities.  I've encountered this issue numerous times during my work on large-scale image recognition projects, frequently resulting in unexpectedly poor validation results.  The core issue stems from the fact that many layers behave differently during training and inference.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow layers often incorporate mechanisms that are only relevant during the training phase.  These include:

* **Batch Normalization:** This technique normalizes activations within a batch, significantly improving training stability and convergence speed.  During training, it computes running statistics (mean and variance) of activations across batches, using these statistics to normalize activations.  During inference, it uses the *learned* running statistics, ensuring consistent behavior across different input batches.  Omitting `training=True` during training prevents the layer from updating these running statistics, leading to incorrect normalization and potentially impacting the network's performance.

* **Dropout:** This regularization technique randomly drops out neurons during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features.  It's crucial for preventing overfitting.  During inference, all neurons are active.  Omitting `training=True` effectively disables dropout during training, rendering it useless for regularization. This often leads to overfitting and poor generalization to unseen data.

* **Layer-Specific Training Behaviors:** Beyond these common layers, other layers might include training-specific logic. For instance, a custom layer might implement dynamic weight updates based on training loss or other metrics.  Without explicitly setting `training=True`, these functionalities will be bypassed, leading to incomplete or incorrect training.

The `training` argument acts as a boolean switch controlling the operational mode of the layer.  It's not merely a flag; it dictates the internal computations performed, ensuring the appropriate behavior for each phase of the model lifecycle.  Failing to provide this argument correctly can lead to subtle bugs difficult to diagnose, often manifested as poor model accuracy or unexpected behavior.  In my experience, troubleshooting these issues invariably involved carefully examining the layer-specific documentation and confirming the proper use of the `training` argument.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Batch Normalization**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Correct usage during training:
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(images, training=True) #Crucial for updating running statistics
    loss = loss_function(labels, predictions)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))


# Incorrect usage (running statistics will not update):
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(images, training=False) # Running statistics remain unchanged
    loss = loss_function(labels, predictions)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

This example showcases the critical role of `training=True` in updating the running statistics of the Batch Normalization layer.  The incorrect usage will result in the network using the initial (likely incorrect) statistics, significantly hampering performance.  I've seen this directly lead to instability during training, with gradients exploding or vanishing due to improperly normalized activations.

**Example 2: Dropout**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5), # Dropout layer
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Correct usage during training:
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(images, training=True) # Dropout is active
    loss = loss_function(labels, predictions)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

# Incorrect usage (dropout is inactive):
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(images, training=False) # Dropout is inactive during training. This is incorrect.
    loss = loss_function(labels, predictions)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

Here, omitting `training=True` disables dropout during training. The model will not benefit from the regularization effect, leading to overfitting and poorer generalization.  In one project involving sentiment analysis, this oversight caused the model to memorize the training data, resulting in very high training accuracy but abysmal performance on unseen data.


**Example 3: Custom Layer with Training Logic**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyCustomLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.w = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([units, units]))

    def call(self, inputs, training=None):
        if training:
            self.w.assign(tf.math.l2_normalize(self.w)) #Normalize weights during training only
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Correct usage:
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(inputs, training=True) #Weight normalization happens
    loss = ...

#Incorrect usage:
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(inputs, training=False) #Weight normalization is skipped
    loss = ...
```

This demonstrates how a custom layer might incorporate training-specific operations. Without `training=True`, the weight normalization step is skipped, impacting the learning process.  I've used similar custom layers in object detection tasks, where this kind of conditional logic is common for adaptive learning rates or dynamic feature selection.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation, specifically sections on `tf.keras.layers` and the training API.  Furthermore, exploring advanced topics on regularization techniques within the context of deep learning will provide a deeper understanding of the need for controlled training behavior.  Finally, I strongly advise reviewing example code and tutorials focusing on custom layer implementations in TensorFlow.  Careful study of these resources will solidify your understanding and avoid this common pitfall.
