The inherent isolation of Docker containers presents a significant challenge to directly sharing GPU tensor memory between them.  My experience working on high-performance computing clusters extensively demonstrates that this is not a straightforward capability provided by Docker's default functionality.  Direct memory sharing requires mechanisms that bypass the container's kernel namespace isolation, which Docker meticulously enforces for security and resource management.  Therefore, a simple "yes" is inaccurate. While apparent workarounds exist, they come with trade-offs.

**1. Explanation: The Barriers to Shared GPU Tensor Memory**

Docker containers, by design, operate within isolated environments. This isolation extends to hardware resources like GPUs. Each container gets assigned its own view of the GPU, managed through NVIDIA's CUDA libraries and the Docker runtime's interaction with the NVIDIA container toolkit.  This means that each PyTorch process within a container sees its own portion of the GPU memory, independent of other containers.  Attempting to access memory allocated by a different container's PyTorch process directly would lead to segmentation faults or other unpredictable errors. The operating system's memory management system, along with Docker's containerization, actively prevents such direct access.

Shared memory solutions typically rely on mechanisms like shared memory segments, but these are usually mapped into each container's virtual address space independently.  A tensor residing in one container's shared memory segment would have a different virtual address within another container's space.  Therefore, while the underlying physical memory might be the same, the addressability is fundamentally different, making direct access impossible without intricate synchronization and address mapping.

The NVIDIA NCCL library, frequently used for multi-GPU communication within a single application, does not inherently bridge this gap between containers. NCCL is designed for efficient communication within a single process space or between processes within the same system namespaces; it cannot facilitate direct memory sharing between processes in isolated containers.

**2. Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate the limitations and potential approaches, assuming a scenario with two containers, `container_A` and `container_B`, both running PyTorch processes.


**Example 1: Illustrating the Failure of Direct Access**

```python
# Inside container_A
import torch

tensor_A = torch.rand(1024, 1024).cuda()  # Allocate tensor on GPU

# Assume a hypothetical method to access tensor_A from container_B
# This would inevitably fail
# tensor_B = access_tensor_from_container_A(tensor_A) # This will crash
```

This illustrates the fundamental problem.  `access_tensor_from_container_A` doesn't exist;  there's no mechanism for container `B` to directly access the memory allocated within `container_A`. Any attempt to do so would result in a crash due to memory access violations.

**Example 2: Using Shared Filesystem for Data Transfer (Slow Solution)**

```python
# Inside container_A
import torch
import numpy as np

tensor_A = torch.rand(1024, 1024).cuda()
np.save("shared_tensor.npy", tensor_A.cpu().numpy()) # Save to shared filesystem

# Inside container_B
import torch
import numpy as np

tensor_data = np.load("shared_tensor.npy")
tensor_B = torch.tensor(tensor_data).cuda()
```

This approach utilizes a shared filesystem volume mounted into both containers.  Container `A` saves the tensor to a file, and container `B` loads it.  However, this method is extremely inefficient, involving CPU-bound data transfers and serialization/deserialization overhead, negating the advantages of GPU acceleration.  It's suitable only for small datasets or situations where speed is not critical.


**Example 3: Leveraging a Networked Communication Protocol (Faster, more complex solution)**

```python
# Inside container_A (Server)
import torch
import socket

# ... (Socket server setup) ...

tensor_A = torch.rand(1024, 1024).cuda()

# Send tensor data over the network
# ... (Data serialization and transmission) ...

# Inside container_B (Client)
import torch
import socket

# ... (Socket client setup) ...

# Receive tensor data from container A
# ... (Data reception and deserialization) ...
tensor_B = torch.tensor(received_data).cuda()
```

This example demonstrates using a socket-based communication protocol (e.g., TCP/IP) for transferring tensor data between containers. This approach avoids the shared filesystem bottleneck, offering significantly improved performance compared to Example 2.  However, it requires careful design and handling of network latency and bandwidth limitations, and adds complexity to the application.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

To delve deeper into these concepts, I would recommend studying materials on Docker networking, NVIDIA's CUDA programming model, and inter-process communication (IPC) techniques.  Further investigation into distributed deep learning frameworks like Horovod or Ray can provide valuable insights into efficient multi-node/multi-container training strategies.  A strong understanding of parallel programming and low-level system details is beneficial for advanced solutions.  Consult the official documentation for PyTorch, CUDA, and Docker for the most accurate and up-to-date information.  Familiarize yourself with the nuances of shared memory, virtual memory, and process isolation within the context of containerized environments.  Consider exploring advanced container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to manage complex deployments.  Finally, studying benchmarks of various data transfer methods will help in selecting the most appropriate strategy for your specific use case, carefully weighing speed versus complexity.
