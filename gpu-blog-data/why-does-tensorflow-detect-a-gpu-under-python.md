The discrepancy in GPU detection between Python 2.7 and Python 3.6.9 with TensorFlow stems primarily from differing library compatibility and build configurations, not necessarily an inherent limitation within TensorFlow itself.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, including a large-scale image recognition system deployed on a heterogeneous cluster, points towards several potential culprits.  While TensorFlow officially dropped support for Python 2.7 some time ago,  legacy projects often persist, making this compatibility issue particularly relevant.  Let's analyze the key factors.

**1.  CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN Version Mismatches:**

The most frequent cause of this behavior is a conflict between the CUDA Toolkit version installed on the system and the TensorFlow version compiled against a specific CUDA version. Python 2.7 might coincidentally have been installed or configured with a CUDA setup compatible with the specific TensorFlow wheel file used.  Python 3.6.9, especially if installed subsequently, might have a different CUDA Toolkit version, leading to incompatibility. TensorFlow wheels are often compiled for specific CUDA versions; installing an incompatible version may cause detection failure.  Furthermore, the CUDA Driver version is another crucial factor. Discrepancies between the driver, the toolkit, and the TensorFlow build can result in GPU invisibility.  This is compounded if the cuDNN library (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) is not correctly installed or has a version mismatch with the CUDA Toolkit.  Verification of these versions is paramount; they must form a coherent, supported chain.

**2.  Environment Variable Conflicts:**

Environment variables like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (Linux) or `PATH` (Windows) play a critical role in directing the operating system to the correct CUDA libraries.  If these are incorrectly configured, or if there are multiple, conflicting CUDA installations on the system, the TensorFlow runtime might fail to locate the necessary libraries, resulting in a GPU not being detected. This is especially problematic in environments with multiple Python installations, virtual environments (venv, virtualenv, conda), or when system-level installations clash with user-level installations. Carefully examining the environment variable configurations for both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6.9 is crucial. A systematic approach, involving comparing the output of `echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or equivalent), can highlight discrepancies.

**3.  TensorFlow Installation Method and Package Conflicts:**

The method of TensorFlow installation can also introduce subtle inconsistencies.  Using pip with a pre-built wheel file (`.whl`) versus compiling TensorFlow from source can lead to vastly different outcomes, especially regarding GPU support. Pre-built wheels offer convenience but may not always accommodate specific system configurations. Compiling from source provides flexibility but demands a thorough understanding of dependencies and build process. This could be a source of the observed disparity: perhaps Python 2.7 leveraged a source build (and correctly set up CUDA libraries during the compilation process), whereas the Python 3.6.9 installation relied on a pre-built wheel with different CUDA expectations.  Furthermore, package conflicts arising from other libraries are possible. For instance, incorrect or outdated versions of NumPy or other numerical computation libraries could interfere with TensorFlow's ability to access the GPU.


**Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Verifying CUDA Installation and Versions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import os

print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

print("CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES:", os.environ.get('CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'))

print("TensorFlow Version:", tf.__version__)

#Add further checks for CUDA and cuDNN versions using subprocess to call nvidia-smi.  This will avoid issues with cross-platform compatibility.
```

This code snippet initially checks if GPUs are visible to TensorFlow using the new TensorFlow 2.x API.  It also prints the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable which determines which GPUs TensorFlow can use.  Finally, it prints the TensorFlow version number, providing a clue about compatibility with specific CUDA versions.  Further checks for CUDA and cuDNN can be added using system commands called through the `subprocess` module, for a robust cross-platform solution.

**Example 2:  Illustrating Environment Variable Inspection (Linux)**

```bash
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# examine the output for paths containing CUDA libraries
grep -i cuda $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

This shell script shows how to examine the critical `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.  The `grep` command searches the output for lines containing "cuda", helping pinpoint the presence (or absence) of the CUDA libraries in the search paths.  Equivalent commands for Windows' `PATH` variable exist and would be essential to examine there.

**Example 3:  Testing GPU Access within a TensorFlow Session**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

with tf.device('/GPU:0'): #attempt to place operations on GPU 0
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3])
    b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2])
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)
    print(c)

```

This code attempts to perform a matrix multiplication on the GPU (device `/GPU:0`).  If the GPU is not detected correctly, this operation will likely default to the CPU, potentially resulting in a considerable performance slowdown or an error.  The success of this execution confirms GPU accessibility within the TensorFlow session.


**Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official TensorFlow documentation on GPU support and installation. Review the CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN documentation for version compatibility and installation instructions.  Explore relevant Stack Overflow discussions and community forums focusing on TensorFlow GPU issues. Examine the troubleshooting sections of your operating system's GPU driver documentation.  Study guides covering virtual environment management (venv, conda) and package management for your Python versions.

In conclusion, troubleshooting GPU detection issues in TensorFlow requires a methodical approach, focusing on CUDA version consistency, environmental variable configuration, and the installation method used.  Addressing these factors comprehensively will often resolve the discrepancies observed between different Python versions.  By systematically verifying each of these aspects, you can greatly increase your likelihood of successful GPU utilization within TensorFlow.
