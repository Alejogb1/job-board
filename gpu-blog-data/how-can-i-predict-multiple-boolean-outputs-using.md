Predicting multiple boolean outputs in Keras/TensorFlow hinges on understanding the model's output layer configuration.  Crucially, for multiple independent binary classifications, you require a separate sigmoid activation unit for each output, rather than attempting a single multi-class classification.  My experience building recommendation systems underscored this point; attempting a single softmax output for recommending multiple, independent items (e.g., movies, books) led to significant accuracy issues compared to using individual sigmoid units for each recommendation.

The core principle involves framing the problem as several independent binary classification tasks.  Each output neuron will predict the probability of a specific boolean outcome.  This differs from multi-class classification, where a single neuron (or set of neurons using one-hot encoding) predicts a single class from a set of mutually exclusive options.

1. **Clear Explanation:**

The architecture should consist of an input layer, potentially multiple hidden layers with appropriate activation functions (ReLU being a common choice), and an output layer. The critical element is the output layer.  For *n* boolean outputs, you need *n* neurons, each with a sigmoid activation function. The sigmoid function maps the neuron's output to a probability between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the corresponding boolean outcome being true.  A threshold (typically 0.5) is then applied; values above the threshold are classified as true, and values below are classified as false.

During training, the model learns to adjust its weights to minimize the difference between its predicted probabilities and the actual boolean values in the training data.  Suitable loss functions for this task include binary cross-entropy for each output, often computed independently.  The optimizer (e.g., Adam, RMSprop) updates weights to reduce the overall loss across all outputs.

The model's predictions will be a vector of probabilities, one for each boolean output.  These probabilities can then be thresholded to obtain the final boolean predictions.

2. **Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Predicting three boolean features from numerical input**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), #10 input features
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='sigmoid') # 3 outputs, each a probability
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Sample training data (replace with your own)
X_train = tf.random.normal((1000, 10))
y_train = tf.random.uniform((1000, 3), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32) #3 boolean features

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

predictions = model.predict(X_train)
# predictions will be a numpy array of shape (1000, 3), each row representing 3 probabilities
# Apply threshold to convert probabilities to booleans.
boolean_predictions = (predictions > 0.5).astype(int)
```

This example showcases a straightforward network architecture.  Note the use of 'binary_crossentropy' as the loss function, appropriate for multiple binary classifications. The `input_shape` parameter specifies the number of input features.  The `model.predict` method returns probabilities which are then thresholded.


**Example 2:  Handling categorical input features**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, Flatten, concatenate

# Assuming categorical features are represented as integers
num_categories = [5, 10, 2] #Number of categories for each categorical input
num_boolean_outputs = 2

embedding_layers = []
for num_cat in num_categories:
    embedding_layers.append(Embedding(num_cat, 8)) #8-dimensional embedding

input_layers = []
for i, layer in enumerate(embedding_layers):
    input_layer = tf.keras.Input(shape=(1,), name=f"input_{i}")
    input_layers.append(input_layer)
    input_layers.append(Flatten()(layer(input_layer)))

#Concatenate categorical and numerical inputs
numerical_input = tf.keras.Input(shape=(5,), name="numerical_input")
merged_inputs = concatenate(input_layers + [numerical_input])

dense1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(merged_inputs)
dense2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu')(dense1)
output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_boolean_outputs, activation='sigmoid')(dense2)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=[*input_layers, numerical_input], outputs=output_layer)

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Sample training data (replace with your own)
# Data needs to be structured appropriately for the multiple input layers
# ... training and prediction code follows similar structure to Example 1 ...
```

This illustrates how to incorporate categorical features using embedding layers. The input layer now expects a list of tensors, one for each input. The output remains two sigmoid units.


**Example 3: Using a custom loss function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def weighted_binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred):
    #Custom loss function to handle class imbalance
    class_weights = np.array([0.8, 0.2]) #Example weights
    weights = tf.gather(class_weights, tf.cast(y_true, tf.int32))
    return tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.backend.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred) * weights)


model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # ... model architecture ...
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=weighted_binary_crossentropy,
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ...training and prediction code
```

This example demonstrates a custom loss function, which can be beneficial when dealing with class imbalance, a common scenario in binary classification.  The `weighted_binary_crossentropy` function applies weights to the individual losses based on the class labels.


3. **Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation provides comprehensive information on building and training models.  "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron offers a practical introduction to neural networks, including Keras usage.  Finally,  deep learning textbooks focusing on neural network architectures are invaluable for grasping the underlying theoretical concepts.  Reviewing published research papers on binary classification and multi-output neural networks can provide further insight into advanced techniques and best practices.
