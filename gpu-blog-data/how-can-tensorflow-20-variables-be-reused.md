The persistent nature of TensorFlow variables, residing within the computational graph, enables their reuse across various model components and training cycles. This characteristic stems from their inherent statefulness, differentiating them from tensors which represent intermediate calculation results. I've encountered this frequently while developing complex architectures involving shared layers or recurrent neural networks, where avoiding redundant variable creation is paramount for efficiency and memory management. Efficient reuse requires an understanding of how variables are initialized and their scope within the TensorFlow environment.

Fundamentally, a TensorFlow variable is an object storing a mutable tensor. When defined, the variable is typically initialized with either a constant value, a random distribution, or a tensor derived from a previous operation. It’s this initial tensor which is modified by the optimizer during training, updating the variable’s state. Reuse, therefore, isn't about creating multiple variables with the same *initial* value but rather about a single variable being used in multiple computational paths or training iterations. Direct reinitialization of an existing variable, while possible, often leads to unintended loss of learned information, a scenario I've personally rectified multiple times when debugging malfunctioning training loops.

The key lies in managing the *scope* of these variables. In TensorFlow 2.0, variables are generally created within a `tf.function` or outside of it within a broader module (e.g. a class extending `tf.keras.Model` or `tf.Module`). If a variable is created within a `tf.function` and the function is executed multiple times, the variable, despite the function calls, retains its state. This implies that on the second and subsequent executions, it uses the modified value computed from prior runs unless manually reset. This characteristic makes reusing variables particularly straightforward when constructing layer classes.

The reuse can manifest in several practical scenarios. For example, in models employing attention mechanisms, a single weight matrix may be used across multiple input sequence positions. In transfer learning, pre-trained layers have their variables loaded and then reused in a new task. In recurrent neural networks like LSTMs, the same recurrent weight matrices are used at each time step. Understanding this concept allows one to structure their Tensorflow code for maximal efficiency in both training and inference.

Let's illustrate this with some examples, along with the corresponding explanations.

**Example 1: Reusing Variables in a Simple Layer Class**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class LinearLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(LinearLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
      self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                            initializer='random_normal',
                            trainable=True)
      self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                            initializer='zeros',
                            trainable=True)


    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b


# Instantiate the layer once
linear_layer = LinearLayer(units=10)

# Input data
input_data1 = tf.random.normal((1, 5))
input_data2 = tf.random.normal((1, 5))

# Use the same layer multiple times
output1 = linear_layer(input_data1)
output2 = linear_layer(input_data2)


print(f"Shape of weights: {linear_layer.w.shape}")
print(f"Output 1 Shape: {output1.shape}")
print(f"Output 2 Shape: {output2.shape}")
```

In this example, the `LinearLayer` class extends `tf.keras.layers.Layer`. The weights `w` and biases `b` are defined as class members in the `build` method using `self.add_weight`. Crucially, when we instantiate `linear_layer` once and subsequently call it with different inputs (`input_data1`, `input_data2`), the same weight matrix `linear_layer.w` and bias vector `linear_layer.b` are being reused. The underlying state, i.e the variables, persists across calls.  This is a basic yet foundational case of variable reuse in a custom layer construction which I frequently implement while developing machine learning model. This also highlights that build is only run once when you initially call the class with input.

**Example 2: Variable Reuse in a Custom Training Loop**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initialize a variable outside a model or layer
shared_variable = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.random.normal((2, 2)), trainable=True, name='shared')

@tf.function
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
       prediction = tf.matmul(x, shared_variable) # Use shared variable
       loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(prediction - y))
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, [shared_variable])
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, [shared_variable]))
    return loss

# Define dummy data
x_train = tf.random.normal((10, 2))
y_train = tf.random.normal((10, 2))


optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)

for epoch in range(5):
  epoch_loss = 0
  for i in range(10):
    loss = train_step(tf.reshape(x_train[i], (1, 2)), tf.reshape(y_train[i], (1, 2)))
    epoch_loss = loss.numpy()
  print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {epoch_loss}")


print(f"Learned Shared Variable:\n{shared_variable.numpy()}")
```

Here, `shared_variable` is initialized outside any layer or `tf.keras.Model`. It's then referenced inside the `train_step` function, a `tf.function`, where it acts as a weight matrix during matrix multiplication. Observe that with each call of `train_step` in the epoch loop, the same `shared_variable` is being updated by the optimizer. This effectively reuses this single variable across all training batches, showcasing another practical use case. This is extremely common for custom training loops and how to properly structure the variable declarations.

**Example 3: Reusing a Trained Layer in Transfer Learning (Simplified)**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Pre-trained Layer (Simulated)
class PreTrainedLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(PreTrainedLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                initializer='random_normal',
                                trainable=False) # trainable = False
        self.b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                initializer='zeros',
                                trainable=False) # trainable = False

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w) + self.b

# Instantiate and Simulate Pre-training
pretrained_layer = PreTrainedLayer(units=5)
input_dummy = tf.random.normal((1, 3))
_ = pretrained_layer(input_dummy)  # Force build method to be called

# Setting pre-trained weights (Simulated):
pretrained_layer.w.assign(tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]], dtype=tf.float32))
pretrained_layer.b.assign(tf.constant([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5], dtype=tf.float32))

# New Layer
class NewTaskLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, pretrained_layer):
        super(NewTaskLayer, self).__init__()
        self.units = units
        self.pretrained_layer = pretrained_layer

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.new_w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                    initializer='random_normal',
                                    trainable=True)
        self.new_b = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units,),
                                    initializer='zeros',
                                    trainable=True)


    def call(self, inputs):
       intermediate_output = self.pretrained_layer(inputs)
       return tf.matmul(intermediate_output, self.new_w) + self.new_b

# Usage for the new task
new_task_layer = NewTaskLayer(units=2, pretrained_layer=pretrained_layer)

input_new_task = tf.random.normal((1, 3))
output_new_task = new_task_layer(input_new_task)

print(f"Output of new task layer: {output_new_task.shape}")
print(f"Pretrained Weights: \n {new_task_layer.pretrained_layer.w.numpy()}")
print(f"Pretrained biases: \n {new_task_layer.pretrained_layer.b.numpy()}")
```

In this more complex example, a `PreTrainedLayer` is created and its variables are simulated being set with pre-trained values, and importantly the trainable parameter for all it's weights is set to false to be used as frozen feature extractor. The weights and biases are assigned using `assign`. Then, in the `NewTaskLayer`, the *same* instance of the `PreTrainedLayer` is used within the new task model via class member which is initialized in the constructor with an instance. Thus, we are effectively reusing the variables from the pre-trained layer as a feature extractor in the downstream task. This showcases how to transfer learn with the variable reuse at the model level, using custom classes.

These examples illustrate the various facets of variable reuse in Tensorflow 2.0.  It's important to be meticulous about where and how variables are declared and initialized. A common debugging issue is accidentally re-initializing variables when the intent is to reuse them. Furthermore, I recommend exploring the use of `tf.Variable` scope in specific instances and consulting the official TensorFlow documentation for nuanced uses. Examining source code of well-known architectures like ResNets or Transformers within the TensorFlow library itself offers further insights into robust variable management and their reuse. In the event of encountering issues, methodical debugging by isolating variable creation and modification will generally help in diagnosing problems quickly.
