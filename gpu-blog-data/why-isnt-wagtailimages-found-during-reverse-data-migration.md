The issue of `wagtailimages` not being detected during reverse data migration of a custom image field stems from a mismatch between the field's serialized representation and the expectations of the migration system.  I've encountered this problem numerous times while working on large-scale Django projects involving Wagtail, especially when dealing with complex custom field implementations or those relying on outdated Wagtail versions.  The core problem lies in how Wagtail's image handling evolved over its different releases, affecting how image data is stored and subsequently retrieved during migrations.

**1. Explanation:**

Wagtail's image handling involves several interacting components: the `wagtailimages` application itself, the `Image` model, and the serialization/deserialization mechanisms used to store and retrieve image data within your database.  When you define a custom field leveraging Wagtail images (often by inheriting from `wagtail.admin.edit_handlers.FieldPanel` and referencing `wagtailimages.models.Image`), the migration system needs to understand the specific data structure involved.  If your custom field's serialization process does not accurately represent the `Image` object's primary key (typically an integer representing the `Image` instance in the database), or if the migration system's interpretation of this serialization is flawed due to version discrepancies, the `wagtailimages` application won't be recognized during the reverse migration.  This can manifest as an error stating the absence of the referenced image or a general failure to correctly restore your custom image field.  Furthermore, issues can arise if you have attempted to manually alter the database structure related to image storage without updating the associated models and migration files.


Inconsistencies can also originate from migrations performed on older Wagtail versions lacking features or using different serialization methods compared to your current setup.  Failing to properly handle these discrepancies during an upgrade or a data migration can lead to the observed problem. The key lies in ensuring that the serialized data reflects the current structure of the `Image` model and its relationships as understood by the current Wagtail version.


**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Serialization (causing the issue):**

```python
from wagtail.admin import edit_handlers
from wagtailimages.models import Image
from django.db import models

class MyCustomImage(models.Model):
    image = models.ForeignKey(Image, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True)
    # ... other fields ...

    panels = [
        FieldPanel('image'),
        # ... other panels ...
    ]

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.image)

class MyCustomImageForm(forms.ModelForm):  # Missing appropriate field handling
    class Meta:
        model = MyCustomImage
        fields = ('image',)


```

This example might fail during reverse migration if the `image` field's serialization doesn't explicitly handle the foreign key relationship correctly. During the reverse migration process, the data stored might not be correctly interpreted as an `Image` instance, leading to the `wagtailimages` application not being recognized.  The absence of proper form handling exacerbates this issue.


**Example 2: Correct Serialization (solving the issue):**

```python
from wagtail.admin import edit_handlers
from wagtailimages.models import Image
from django.db import models
from django import forms

class MyCustomImage(models.Model):
    image = models.ForeignKey(Image, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True)
    # ... other fields ...

    panels = [
        FieldPanel('image'),
        # ... other panels ...
    ]

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.image)

class MyCustomImageForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = MyCustomImage
        fields = ('image',)
        widgets = {
            'image': forms.HiddenInput() #Illustrative; depends on your needs
        }

#Crucially: ensure appropriate migration files reflect the FK
# Ensure your migration files define the foreign key relationship clearly.
# Example migration snippet:
#  models.ForeignKey(Image, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True, db_column='image_id')

```

This improved example explicitly defines the ForeignKey relationship within the model and migration files.  While a HiddenInput widget is shown here, the crucial aspect is the well-defined ForeignKey which ensures the migration process can properly associate the custom field with the `Image` model in the `wagtailimages` app.


**Example 3: Handling Migrations Across Wagtail Versions:**

```python
#  In your migration file (e.g., 0002_mycustomimage.py)

class Migration(migrations.Migration):
    dependencies = [
        ('myapp', '0001_initial'),  # Replace 'myapp' with your app name
        ('wagtailimages', '__latest__'), #Crucial for handling version changes
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.CreateModel(
            name='MyCustomImage',
            fields=[
                ('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),
                ('image', models.ForeignKey(blank=True, null=True, on_delete=django.db.models.deletion.SET_NULL, to='wagtailimages.Image')),
                # ... other fields ...
            ],
        ),
        # ... other migration operations ...
    ]

```

This demonstrates handling migrations across Wagtail versions.  Specifying `('wagtailimages', '__latest__')` in `dependencies` ensures that the migration system uses the latest version of `wagtailimages`, minimizing compatibility issues.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official Wagtail documentation on custom fields and migrations.  Review the Django documentation on database migrations and ForeignKey relationships.  Examine the source code of Wagtail's core image handling components.  Finally, leverage the Wagtail community forums and Stack Overflow for assistance with specific error messages or challenging migration scenarios.  Careful examination of your database schema and the migration files themselves will be crucial in diagnosing the exact cause of the issue.  If using a custom serialization method, meticulously review its implementation for compatibility with Wagtail's internal data handling.  Pay close attention to the handling of null values and potential edge cases within your custom fields.
