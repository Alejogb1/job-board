The crux of the issue arises from the interaction between CUDA’s relocatable device code generation and the template metaprogramming techniques frequently employed within libraries like Thrust, specifically in its sorting algorithms. I’ve personally debugged this scenario several times over the years, most recently when porting a complex particle simulation across different CUDA architectures. The crash typically manifests as a segmentation fault or an unrecoverable kernel launch failure. Let's break down why this happens.

The “generate relocatable device code” option (often enabled by flags like `-rdc=true` in the NVCC compiler) alters how device code is compiled. Ordinarily, when compiling for a specific architecture (e.g., compute_70, compute_80), the compiler generates self-contained, executable PTX or cubin (binary) code for the target GPU. Each compilation unit produces an independent code module. With relocatable device code, the compiler instead generates an intermediate object file, akin to a .o file in traditional compilation, containing unlinked PTX or cubin. This object file contains relocation information, allowing these individual modules to be linked together during the final linking stage or at runtime by the CUDA driver. This deferred linking process is central to the problem.

Libraries like Thrust, to achieve performance and generality, utilize extensive template metaprogramming. This involves generating specialized code based on the data types and comparison functions passed during compilation. For example, `thrust::sort` relies on template instantiations to adapt its sorting algorithm for integers, floats, or user-defined structures. When relocatable device code is not enabled, the compiler instantiates these templates, compiling all necessary functions and kernels directly into each compilation unit where they're used. If the same `thrust::sort` is used in multiple .cu files with the same data types, each file effectively has its own independent copy of the specialized sort implementation.

However, when relocatable device code is enabled, the compiler generates the template instantiations as separate objects. Now, instead of each compilation unit having a full copy of the specialized sort implementation, each references what effectively becomes a placeholder. These placeholders need to be resolved and linked correctly during the final linking stage.

The crash during `thrust::sort` occurs because the Thrust library might not be explicitly compiled or linked in such a way that it correctly handles this linking process. Specifically, the compiler might not correctly identify where to resolve the necessary specialized sorting kernels from the individual object files when linked into an executable. The relocation entries in these object files may point to incorrect addresses due to how Thrust was compiled and how the linker is interpreting them. This leads to undefined function calls during the actual execution of the CUDA kernel, triggering segmentation faults or other kernel launch failures. There can also be ABI (application binary interface) incompatibilities, especially with older versions of CUDA toolkits, and with specific compilation setups. The final linked binary could be missing important symbols, or have incorrect assumptions about the device code.

Here are a few examples demonstrating this behavior.

**Example 1: Simple Sorting Without Relocatable Device Code**

```cpp
#include <thrust/sort.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    thrust::device_vector<int> d_vec(10);
    d_vec[0] = 5; d_vec[1] = 2; d_vec[2] = 9; d_vec[3] = 1; d_vec[4] = 5;
    d_vec[5] = 6; d_vec[6] = 4; d_vec[7] = 8; d_vec[8] = 3; d_vec[9] = 7;

    thrust::sort(d_vec.begin(), d_vec.end());

    thrust::host_vector<int> h_vec = d_vec;
    for (int val : h_vec) {
        std::cout << val << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
This simple code will compile and execute correctly using a standard NVCC command such as `nvcc example1.cu -o example1`. The `thrust::sort` call is handled by the compiler generating a fully self-contained kernel within the compiled code. This approach works fine as long as `rdc=true` is not set.

**Example 2: Sorting with Relocatable Device Code Enabled (Potential Crash)**

```cpp
#include <thrust/sort.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    thrust::device_vector<int> d_vec(10);
    d_vec[0] = 5; d_vec[1] = 2; d_vec[2] = 9; d_vec[3] = 1; d_vec[4] = 5;
    d_vec[5] = 6; d_vec[6] = 4; d_vec[7] = 8; d_vec[8] = 3; d_vec[9] = 7;

    thrust::sort(d_vec.begin(), d_vec.end());

    thrust::host_vector<int> h_vec = d_vec;
     for (int val : h_vec) {
        std::cout << val << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Compiling this with `nvcc example2.cu -o example2 -rdc=true` *can* result in a crash during program execution. This happens when the linker fails to properly locate the compiled template specializations of the `thrust::sort` kernel.  The specific error message may vary depending on the CUDA version and linker configuration, but it usually points to issues with device function calls or memory corruption resulting from the incorrect linking of device code. The code compiles, but the execution will fail with a kernel launch error, or segmentation fault, or a CUDA error message.

**Example 3: Workaround for Relocatable Device Code using Explicit Template Instantiation**

```cpp
#include <thrust/sort.h>
#include <thrust/device_vector.h>
#include <iostream>

// Explicit instantiation in a dedicated cpp file.
namespace thrust {
  template
  void sort(thrust::device_vector<int>::iterator first, thrust::device_vector<int>::iterator last);
}
```

```cpp
#include "sort_header.h"
int main() {
    thrust::device_vector<int> d_vec(10);
    d_vec[0] = 5; d_vec[1] = 2; d_vec[2] = 9; d_vec[3] = 1; d_vec[4] = 5;
    d_vec[5] = 6; d_vec[6] = 4; d_vec[7] = 8; d_vec[8] = 3; d_vec[9] = 7;

    thrust::sort(d_vec.begin(), d_vec.end());

    thrust::host_vector<int> h_vec = d_vec;
     for (int val : h_vec) {
        std::cout << val << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
Here, I've separated the example into two files, `sort_header.h` and `example3.cu`, where `sort_header.h` contains the explicit template instantiations in a separate namespace which will be then compiled into a separate `.o` file which will then be linked into the final executable. This explicit template instantiation approach forces the compiler to create the specialized versions of `thrust::sort`, allowing it to link correctly with the code that actually calls `thrust::sort` inside `example3.cu` when compiled with `nvcc example3.cu sort_header.cu -o example3 -rdc=true`. While it works, explicit instantiation must cover *every* template usage case. This solution quickly becomes cumbersome, and more robust strategies should be prioritized.

To mitigate this issue effectively, it's often better to avoid using relocatable device code when working with libraries that rely heavily on templates such as Thrust, if practical for the project. Consider if linking at runtime is truly necessary. If relocatable device code *is* a necessity for project constraints, ensuring the correct compilation and linking of Thrust's template specializations can be challenging. This often involves a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Careful Compilation:** Ensure that Thrust itself (or at least its necessary template instantiations) is compiled with relocatable device code enabled (`-rdc=true`).

2. **Linker Flags:** Utilize appropriate linker flags, often through NVCC or a build system, to instruct the linker to properly resolve device code symbols. This might involve specifying paths to Thrust object files or using options specific to the linker.

3. **Explicit Template Instantiation:** As demonstrated in the third example, while tedious, is sometimes necessary to ensure that the relevant Thrust template functions are compiled in a relocatable manner.  This requires a deep understanding of the templates Thrust is using.

4. **Modern CUDA Toolkits:** Use an updated CUDA toolkit version. Newer toolkits often include better support for relocatable device code and improved compatibility with templated libraries like Thrust.

5. **Build System Management:**  When possible, carefully manage library dependencies and their compilation settings via a build system such as CMake or similar. These systems allow for greater control over the compilation and linking stages, including flags for managing relocatable device code.

Regarding further learning, I would strongly advise delving into: “CUDA Programming: A Developer's Guide to Parallel Computing with GPUs” by Shane Cook for a deeper understanding of device code compilation and linking. Then, consult the official CUDA documentation (available from NVIDIA) on topics such as device code compilation options, runtime linking, and specifically on flags controlling relocatable device code generation. Finally, reviewing template metaprogramming techniques using a comprehensive C++ book on metaprogramming could provide valuable insight as to the template-heavy behavior of libraries like Thrust. This should offer a holistic understanding of the complexities and pitfalls associated with CUDA, Thrust, and their interactions.
