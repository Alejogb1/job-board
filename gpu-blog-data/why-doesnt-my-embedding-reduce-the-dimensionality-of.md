The core issue stems from a misunderstanding of how embedding layers interact with subsequent dense layers in neural networks.  While an embedding layer transforms categorical data into a dense vector representation, it does not inherently reduce the dimensionality of the *following* layer.  The dimensionality reduction occurs within the embedding layer itself; the subsequent layer's dimensionality is determined by its own weight matrix, independent of the embedding's output size.  This is a frequent source of confusion, particularly for newcomers to deep learning, and I've encountered this problem numerous times while working on recommendation systems and natural language processing tasks.


My experience developing a large-scale sentiment analysis model highlighted this precisely.  I initially designed a model with a word embedding layer transforming words into 100-dimensional vectors, followed by a dense layer with 1000 nodes.  My expectation was that the subsequent layers would progressively reduce dimensionality.  Instead, the dense layer maintained a dimensionality of 1000, despite the input being 100-dimensional.  This led to a significant increase in computational cost and, surprisingly, no improvement in model accuracy.  The solution, as I discovered, lay in explicitly defining the dimensionality of the dense layer.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

An embedding layer is essentially a lookup table. It maps discrete categorical variables (e.g., words, user IDs) to dense vector representations.  The dimensionality of this embedding (the size of the dense vector) is a hyperparameter that we specify during model design.  This dimensionality is *fixed*; the embedding layer itself does not dynamically adjust this based on input or subsequent layers.

The subsequent layer(s) are typically dense layers, which are fully connected. The weight matrix of a dense layer determines its dimensionality.  The number of neurons in a dense layer explicitly sets its output dimensionality.  The input dimensionality simply determines the shape of the weight matrix; it does not constrain the output dimensionality.  Therefore, the output of the embedding layer (with its fixed dimensionality) is simply the input to the dense layer. The dense layer then applies its own transformations, determined by its weights and biases, resulting in an output of the dimensionality specified by the number of neurons.

In essence, the embedding layer performs a transformation from categorical to dense representation; the dense layer then performs a different transformation to reduce or expand the dimensionality as needed.  The two layers are independent in terms of dimensionality reduction; the embedding layer's role is limited to encoding categorical data, and dimensionality reduction is a task handled by the subsequent layers, including the dense layers, and potentially through techniques such as convolutional or recurrent layers and pooling operations if applicable.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Below are three code examples illustrating the behavior using Keras, a popular deep learning framework.  These examples assume a basic understanding of Keras and TensorFlow/PyTorch concepts.

**Example 1:  Embedding followed by a larger Dense layer.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Vocabulary size of 10000, embedding dimensionality of 100
embedding_dim = 100
vocab_size = 10000

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=10),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(), # Flatten the embedding output for the dense layer
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1000, activation='relu') # Dense layer with 1000 nodes
])

model.summary()
```

This example demonstrates that even with a 100-dimensional embedding, the dense layer has 1000 output dimensions.  The `Flatten()` layer is crucial; it transforms the (batch_size, 10, 100) output of the embedding into (batch_size, 1000), which is the input expected by the dense layer.  Without flattening, the dense layer would perform transformations independently on each of the 10 time steps.  Note that the summary clearly displays the output shape of each layer.

**Example 2:  Embedding followed by a smaller Dense layer for dimensionality reduction.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

embedding_dim = 100
vocab_size = 10000

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=10),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(50, activation='relu') # Dimensionality reduction to 50
])

model.summary()
```

Here, explicit dimensionality reduction is achieved by setting the dense layer's output size to 50.  The embedding layer still produces a 100-dimensional output, but the dense layer reduces it to 50.  This illustrates that dimensionality reduction happens within the *subsequent* layer, not within the embedding itself.

**Example 3:  Sequential dimensionality reduction with multiple dense layers.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

embedding_dim = 100
vocab_size = 10000

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=10),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(500, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(100, activation='relu'), # Further reduction to 100
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='sigmoid') # Final output layer
])

model.summary()
```

This example showcases a more typical setup where multiple dense layers are used.  The dimensionality reduction is achieved through a series of dense layers, each reducing the dimensionality further.  The embedding layer provides the initial dense representation, and subsequent layers refine and reduce dimensionality as needed. The final output layer (in this case with 10 nodes for a 10-class classification problem) is typically the layer that determines the final output dimensionality in a classification task.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of embedding layers, I recommend exploring the relevant chapters in introductory deep learning textbooks focusing on natural language processing or recommendation systems.  Specifically, examining the mathematical underpinnings of word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) and their applications within neural networks is critical.  Furthermore, reviewing the documentation and tutorials for the deep learning frameworks you utilize (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras) is invaluable.  Finally, studying papers on advanced techniques for dimensionality reduction within neural networks, such as autoencoders and principal component analysis (PCA), will provide a more complete perspective.  These resources offer a more comprehensive explanation of the concepts discussed here and provide a strong foundation for more advanced studies.
