The `None` return from PyTorch's `.grad` attribute typically indicates that the tensor for which you're requesting gradients hasn't been part of a computation graph that involved a backward pass.  This frequently stems from a misunderstanding of how PyTorch's automatic differentiation operates, specifically regarding the `requires_grad` flag and the execution of `backward()`.  Over the years, I've encountered this issue countless times while working on various deep learning projects, ranging from simple regression models to complex generative adversarial networks.  My experience has shown that resolving this almost always involves a careful review of the tensor creation, computational flow, and the gradient calculation itself.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's automatic differentiation relies on building a computational graph.  Each tensor participates in this graph depending on its `requires_grad` attribute.  If `requires_grad` is `True`, operations on this tensor are tracked, allowing PyTorch to compute gradients later. If it's `False`, the tensor is treated as a constant, and no gradient information is recorded.  Crucially, the `backward()` function initiates the backpropagation process through this graph.  Only after `backward()` has been called on a scalar (a single value) – often a loss function – are gradients computed and stored within the `.grad` attribute of the tensors involved in the graph.  If `.grad` returns `None`, it implies either that `requires_grad` was `False` for the tensor in question, or that `backward()` was not called on a relevant scalar value connected to that tensor.

Furthermore, the gradient is only calculated for the leaf nodes of the computational graph. Intermediate tensors might participate in the computation but not directly store their gradients, which can cause confusion.  The gradient is accumulated; subsequent calls to `backward()` will add gradients to the existing `.grad` values. Thus, it's crucial to zero the gradients using `.zero_grad()` before each iteration of training if you are accumulating gradients across multiple steps.  Failure to do so will lead to incorrect gradient calculations and potentially unexpected results.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect `requires_grad` Setting**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=False)  # crucial error here
y = x**2
print(x.grad)  # Output: None
```

In this example, `x` is explicitly set to `requires_grad=False`. Therefore, no gradient information is tracked for `x`, even though it participates in the computation.  The subsequent `y = x**2` operation doesn't register `x` in the computational graph for gradient calculations.  Hence, `x.grad` returns `None`.


**Example 2: Missing `backward()` Call**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x**2
z = y.sum()  # z is a scalar; essential for backward()
print(x.grad)  # Output: None

z.backward()
print(x.grad)  # Output: tensor([4., 6.])
```

This example illustrates the necessity of the `backward()` call.  Initially, `x.grad` is `None` because, although `x` has `requires_grad=True`, the backward pass hasn't been executed. After `z.backward()`, the gradients are computed and stored in `x.grad`.  Note that `z` must be a scalar, which the loss function will generally be.


**Example 3:  Accumulation and `zero_grad()`**

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
for i in range(3):
    y = x**2
    z = y.sum()
    z.backward()
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: x.grad = {x.grad}")  # Gradients accumulate
    x.grad.zero_() # crucial for resetting to 0 for next iteration


```
This demonstrates gradient accumulation.  Without `x.grad.zero_()`,  the gradients would accumulate across iterations, resulting in incorrect values.  The output will show an increasing gradient in each iteration before being reset to zero. This is essential in training loops to prevent incorrect gradient updates over many iterations.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I strongly recommend consulting the official PyTorch documentation.  In addition, working through well-structured tutorials focusing on automatic differentiation and backpropagation will significantly solidify your understanding.  Finally,  reviewing the source code of relevant PyTorch functions (though this is more advanced) can provide deep insights into their operation.  Pay particular attention to the subtleties of computational graphs and how tensors are connected. Consistent practice implementing these concepts in varied projects is key to mastering them.
