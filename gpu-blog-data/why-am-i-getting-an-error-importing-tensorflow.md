TensorFlow import failures frequently stem from mismatched dependencies, particularly concerning the Python version, CUDA toolkit (if using GPU acceleration), and the specific TensorFlow version itself.  In my experience resolving these issues across numerous projects – ranging from embedded systems image processing to large-scale distributed training – consistent attention to these dependencies proves crucial.  The error messages themselves are often unhelpful, demanding a systematic diagnostic approach.

**1. Understanding the Root Causes:**

TensorFlow, being a sophisticated library built upon other libraries like NumPy,  requires a carefully orchestrated environment. A mismatch anywhere in this dependency chain can lead to import errors. The most common culprits are:

* **Python Version Incompatibility:** TensorFlow releases are often explicitly tied to specific Python versions (e.g., TensorFlow 2.11 might only support Python 3.8-3.11). Using an unsupported Python version is a primary reason for import errors.

* **Missing or Incorrect CUDA/cuDNN Installation (GPU usage):** If you intend to leverage GPU acceleration with TensorFlow, you need a compatible CUDA toolkit and cuDNN library installed.  A missing or incorrectly configured CUDA toolkit is a major source of import problems.  Furthermore, the versions of CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorFlow must align perfectly; otherwise, incompatibilities will surface.

* **Conflicting Package Versions:**  Using `pip` or `conda` to manage packages can sometimes lead to conflicting package versions.  A previous installation of TensorFlow might have left behind outdated or incompatible dependencies that interfere with a new installation.

* **System Path Issues:** The system's `PYTHONPATH` environment variable might be incorrectly configured, preventing the interpreter from finding the necessary TensorFlow libraries.

* **Permissions Issues:**  Improper file permissions on directories or files related to TensorFlow installation can also block successful import attempts.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Here are three illustrative scenarios and code snippets demonstrating how to diagnose and resolve TensorFlow import errors.  I've tailored these from my experiences debugging in diverse development contexts.

**Example 1:  Python Version Mismatch:**

```python
# Attempting to import TensorFlow with an incompatible Python version.
import tensorflow as tf

# This will likely result in an ImportError if the Python version is not supported.
# The error message will typically highlight the incompatibility.

# Solution:
# Check the TensorFlow documentation for supported Python versions.
# Use a Python version manager (like pyenv or conda) to switch to a compatible version.
# Reinstall TensorFlow after switching Python versions.

# Example demonstrating version check (after switching to a compatible Python version):
import sys
import tensorflow as tf
print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
```


**Example 2:  CUDA/cuDNN Configuration Issues (GPU):**

```python
# Attempting to import TensorFlow with GPU acceleration, but CUDA/cuDNN are incorrectly configured.
import tensorflow as tf

# This might lead to errors relating to CUDA libraries not being found,
# or incompatibility between CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorFlow versions.

# Solution:
# Verify the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN are correctly installed and configured.
# Ensure the versions of CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorFlow are compatible.
# Check your system's environment variables (CUDA_HOME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc.) to ensure they point to the correct directories.
# For CUDA, I found it helpful to utilize NVIDIA's installer; using apt or similar package managers can be less reliable.

# Example (after ensuring CUDA/cuDNN are configured correctly):
import tensorflow as tf
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```

**Example 3:  Conflicting Package Versions using Conda:**

```python
#  Import error due to conflicting TensorFlow packages within a conda environment.

# Solution:
# Create a new conda environment using `conda create -n tf_env python=3.9`.
# Activate the new environment using `conda activate tf_env`.
# Install TensorFlow within the new, isolated environment: `conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow`.
#  This isolates TensorFlow and its dependencies from other potential conflicts.


# Example showcasing successful import in a clean environment:
import tensorflow as tf
print(f"TensorFlow successfully imported in a clean conda environment.")
```

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation is your primary resource. Consult it for detailed installation instructions, troubleshooting guides, and version compatibility information.  Also, refer to the documentation for your specific CUDA toolkit version if you are utilizing GPU acceleration.  Beyond these, I've found that engaging with online communities (such as Stack Overflow)  and checking the release notes for each version of TensorFlow and its dependent libraries are consistently valuable.  Finally, understanding the basics of Python packaging and virtual environments will significantly reduce the incidence of dependency-related errors.  Proficient use of tools like `pip` or `conda` is essential for managing dependencies efficiently.
