Calculating loss values within Chainer's update rules requires a nuanced understanding of the framework's computational graph and its interaction with optimizer functionalities.  My experience optimizing large-scale neural networks for image recognition heavily involved custom update rules, and the accurate calculation of loss values consistently proved critical for convergence and overall model performance.  The key is recognizing that Chainer doesn't directly provide a single, unified "loss value" variable; instead, the loss is implicitly represented within the computational graph.  Understanding this distinction is fundamental.

**1.  Understanding Chainer's Computational Graph and Loss Calculation**

Chainer constructs a computational graph dynamically.  Each operation, from a simple matrix multiplication to a complex activation function, adds a node to this graph.  The loss function itself is simply another node in this graph, dependent on the output of the network and the target values.  Crucially, this loss node doesn't inherently hold a numerical loss value until the `backward()` method is called.

The `backward()` method initiates the backpropagation algorithm, traversing the computational graph backwards from the loss node. During this traversal, gradients are calculated for each node, based on the chain rule of calculus. These gradients are then used by the optimizer to update the model's parameters.  Therefore, the "loss value" isn't accessed directly but is implicitly embedded within the gradient calculations.  Accessing the loss value itself requires explicitly extracting it from the loss node *before* calling `backward()`.

**2.  Code Examples and Commentary**

The following examples illustrate how to extract and handle loss values within custom Chainer update rules. These examples assume familiarity with fundamental Chainer concepts such as `Chain`, `Link`, `Optimizer`, and `Variable`.


**Example 1:  Simple Mean Squared Error Loss**

```python
import chainer
import chainer.functions as F
import chainer.links as L
import numpy as np

class MyChain(chainer.Chain):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyChain, self).__init__()
        with self.init_scope():
            self.l1 = L.Linear(None, 10)
            self.l2 = L.Linear(10, 1)

    def __call__(self, x, t):
        h = F.relu(self.l1(x))
        y = self.l2(h)
        loss = F.mean_squared_error(y, t)  # Loss calculation
        return loss

# ... (Optimizer setup, training loop) ...
model = MyChain()
optimizer = chainer.optimizers.Adam()
optimizer.setup(model)

x = np.random.rand(1,10).astype(np.float32)
t = np.random.rand(1,1).astype(np.float32)
loss = model(x, t)
print("Loss before backward:", loss.array) # Access the loss value here
loss.backward()
optimizer.update()
```

In this example, the loss is computed using `F.mean_squared_error`.  The crucial line is `print("Loss before backward:", loss.array)`, which extracts the numerical value of the loss *before* calling `backward()`.  This ensures we're observing the loss computed on the forward pass.


**Example 2:  Custom Loss Function with Regularization**

```python
import chainer
import chainer.functions as F
import chainer.links as L
import numpy as np

def custom_loss(y, t, model):
    loss = F.mean_squared_error(y, t)
    reg = 0.01 * F.sum(model.l1.W ** 2) # L2 regularization on weights
    return loss + reg

class MyChain(chainer.Chain):
    # ... (same as Example 1) ...

# ... (Optimizer setup) ...

x = np.random.rand(1,10).astype(np.float32)
t = np.random.rand(1,1).astype(np.float32)

h = F.relu(model.l1(x))
y = model.l2(h)
loss = custom_loss(y, t, model)
print("Loss (with regularization) before backward:", loss.array)
loss.backward()
optimizer.update()
```

Here, we demonstrate a custom loss function incorporating L2 regularization. Again, the loss is explicitly calculated and accessed before backpropagation.  This allows for complex loss functions incorporating multiple terms or regularization components.


**Example 3:  Handling Multiple Losses in a Custom Update Rule**

```python
import chainer
import chainer.functions as F
import chainer.links as L
import numpy as np

class MyChain(chainer.Chain):
    # ... (same as Example 1) ...

    def __call__(self, x, t1, t2):
        h = F.relu(self.l1(x))
        y1 = self.l2(h)
        y2 = self.l2(h) #simplified example for multiple outputs
        loss1 = F.mean_squared_error(y1, t1)
        loss2 = F.mean_absolute_error(y2, t2)
        loss = loss1 + loss2
        chainer.report({'loss1': loss1, 'loss2': loss2, 'loss': loss}, self) #Reporting for monitoring
        return loss

# ... (Optimizer setup) ...

x = np.random.rand(1,10).astype(np.float32)
t1 = np.random.rand(1,1).astype(np.float32)
t2 = np.random.rand(1,1).astype(np.float32)
loss = model(x, t1, t2)
print("Total Loss before backward:", loss.array)
loss.backward()
optimizer.update()
```

This example showcases handling multiple losses, which might arise in multi-task learning or when different loss functions are applied to different parts of the network. The `chainer.report` function is used for effective logging of individual loss values during training.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For deeper understanding, I recommend consulting the official Chainer documentation, particularly sections on optimizers, automatic differentiation, and computational graphs.  Reviewing examples of custom update rules and loss functions within the Chainer community's contributions and code repositories would be beneficial.  Finally, a strong grasp of the mathematical foundations of backpropagation and gradient descent is crucial for advanced usage.  Working through exercises in a calculus-based machine learning textbook will further solidify these concepts.
