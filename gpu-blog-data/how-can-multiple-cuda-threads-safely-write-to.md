The fundamental challenge in having multiple CUDA threads concurrently write to a sequential array lies in the inherent race conditions.  Without careful synchronization, unpredictable and erroneous results are guaranteed.  Over fifteen years of working on high-performance computing projects, I've encountered this issue numerous times, and the solution always hinges on managing memory access through atomic operations or carefully constructed reduction algorithms.  Directly accessing a shared array without synchronization from multiple threads leads to data corruption; the final array contents will not reflect the intended result of individual thread operations.

My approach to resolving this centers around avoiding direct concurrent writes altogether. While techniques like atomic operations offer a seemingly straightforward solution, they suffer from performance limitations, especially for large arrays.  Instead, I favor strategies that minimize contention by utilizing intermediate storage, allowing independent thread execution followed by a controlled aggregation phase. This strategy improves scalability and reduces the overhead associated with frequent atomic instructions.

**1. Explanation: The Atomic Approach (Limited Scalability)**

Atomic operations provide a built-in mechanism for thread-safe writing.  CUDA provides functions like `atomicAdd`, `atomicExch`, and `atomicMin` which guarantee that only one thread can modify a specific memory location at any given time.  However, the serialization inherent in atomic operations introduces a performance bottleneck.  As the number of threads contending for the same memory locations increases, the performance gains from parallelization diminish rapidly, often leading to slower execution than a single-threaded approach.

Despite this limitation, understanding atomic operations is crucial. They serve as a building block for more sophisticated solutions, and they are indispensable when dealing with smaller arrays or scenarios where other techniques are impractical.

**Code Example 1: Atomic Addition**

```c++
__global__ void atomic_array_add(int* array, int* values, int size) {
  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  if (i < size) {
    atomicAdd(array + i, values[i]);
  }
}

//Host Code:
int *d_array, *d_values;
cudaMalloc((void**)&d_array, size * sizeof(int));
cudaMalloc((void**)&d_values, size * sizeof(int));

//Initialize d_values on host and copy to device

int threadsPerBlock = 256;
int blocksPerGrid = (size + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;
atomic_array_add<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_array, d_values, size);

//Copy results from device to host

cudaFree(d_array);
cudaFree(d_values);
```

This example shows how each thread atomically adds its corresponding `values` element to the `array`.  Note the crucial `if (i < size)` check to prevent out-of-bounds memory access. The choice of `threadsPerBlock` and `blocksPerGrid` is critical for optimal performance and should be tuned based on the hardware. The performance limitations become evident when `size` is very large and many threads compete for the same array locations.


**2. Explanation:  Using Shared Memory for Reduction (Improved Scalability)**

A more efficient approach involves leveraging shared memory. Each block of threads can write to its own portion of shared memory, thereby eliminating global memory contention within the block.  Then, a reduction operation is performed within each block to consolidate the results. Finally, the results from each block are aggregated to produce the final array. This method drastically reduces global memory access contention.

**Code Example 2: Reduction using Shared Memory**

```c++
__global__ void shared_memory_reduction(int* array, int* values, int size) {
  __shared__ int shared_array[256]; // Assumes block size of 256

  int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
  int tid = threadIdx.x;

  if (i < size) {
    shared_array[tid] = values[i];
  } else {
    shared_array[tid] = 0; // Initialize unused elements to 0
  }

  __syncthreads(); // Synchronize threads within the block

  for (int s = blockDim.x / 2; s > 0; s >>= 1) {
    if (tid < s) {
      shared_array[tid] += shared_array[tid + s];
    }
    __syncthreads();
  }

  if (tid == 0) {
    atomicAdd(array + blockIdx.x, shared_array[0]);
  }
}
```

Here, each thread initially writes to shared memory. The reduction step sums the values in shared memory, with only the thread with `tid == 0` in each block performing an atomic operation to update the global array. This minimizes atomic operations significantly, leading to better performance.  This approach still utilizes atomic operations, but at a greatly reduced frequency.


**3. Explanation: Scatter/Gather Approach (Optimal Scalability for Large Arrays)**

For very large arrays, even the shared memory approach might show limitations.  A scatter/gather method offers superior scalability. Each thread is assigned a unique index into a much larger temporary array. The threads independently write to this temporary array, eliminating all concurrent writes.  A final gather step combines the results into the final output array.

**Code Example 3: Scatter/Gather**

```c++
__global__ void scatter_gather(int* array, int* values, int size, int* temp_array, int temp_size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
        temp_array[i * 2] = i; //Store index for gather
        temp_array[i * 2 + 1] = values[i]; // Store value. Ensure sufficient temp_size
    }
}

__global__ void gather(int* array, int* temp_array, int size) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (i < size) {
        array[temp_array[i * 2]] = temp_array[i * 2 + 1]; //Gather from temporary array
    }
}
```

This code first scatters the data into a significantly larger temporary array, ensuring no concurrent writes.  The `gather` kernel then reconstructs the final array. The `temp_size` must be at least twice the original array size to hold both indices and values. This solution scales exceptionally well but requires substantially more memory.

Careful consideration of thread hierarchy and block size selection is crucial for performance tuning.  Profiling tools should be employed to identify bottlenecks and optimize code.  The choice of approach depends heavily on the specific application requirements, array size, and available memory.  In my experience, the selection often involves a tradeoff between memory consumption and execution time, and careful performance evaluation is mandatory.
