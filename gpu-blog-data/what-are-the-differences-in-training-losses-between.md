The discrepancies observed in training losses between `model.fit()` and `model.train_on_batch()` stem primarily from their differing approaches to data handling and backpropagation within the TensorFlow framework. Having spent considerable time optimizing large language models, I've encountered this distinction frequently and understand its nuances impact on training behavior.

`model.fit()`, the higher-level API, abstracts away the low-level details of training. It accepts entire datasets or data generators, iterating through them batch by batch, and automatically managing batching, shuffling, and epoch tracking. Crucially, `model.fit()` calculates gradients and applies optimizer updates *at the end of each batch*, effectively averaging losses computed across all examples within that batch. This batch-averaged loss is what you typically observe and monitor during training when employing `model.fit()`. It inherently provides a more stable view of training progression due to this averaging effect, smoothing out fluctuations that might occur from individual samples. In essence, `model.fit()` is designed for convenience and stability in standard training scenarios, allowing the framework to handle the complex mechanics of gradient descent.

In contrast, `model.train_on_batch()` provides a much finer-grained approach to training. I've used this in various bespoke implementations where I needed direct control. As its name suggests, `model.train_on_batch()` executes a single training step, updating the model’s parameters using only one batch of data that’s fed directly. Consequently, it’s my responsibility to prepare the batches, ensuring they're of the correct size and type before calling this function repeatedly within a loop. Critically, the loss returned by `train_on_batch()` is the *raw loss* computed on that specific batch. It does not perform any averaging, nor is it intended to. This raw, un-averaged loss is more susceptible to noise as individual samples can have a disproportionate impact on gradients. Furthermore, with `train_on_batch()`, concepts like epoch management, callbacks, and data shuffling become my responsibility rather than being handled by the TensorFlow API. This method is optimal when requiring highly customized training routines, such as implementing sophisticated techniques not directly supported by the higher-level interface.

The essential divergence, therefore, lies in how these methods present loss values: `model.fit()` reports an *averaged* batch loss, whereas `model.train_on_batch()` reports the *raw* batch loss. This results in different observed values and potentially different training behavior, especially at the beginning of training when individual batches may vary wildly in information content.

Now, let’s illustrate this with some code examples. I'll use a simple sequential model as it's easier to understand the implications within the code. First, consider training using `model.fit()`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate dummy data
x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10).astype(np.float32)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(1000, 1)).astype(np.float32)

# Define the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Define the optimizer and loss
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=loss_fn)

# Train the model using model.fit()
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=0)

# Print the losses of the last epoch
print(f"Average training losses from model.fit(): {history.history['loss'][-1]}")

```

In this example, `model.fit()` handles the data batching internally. The training loss printed is the *averaged* loss across each batch of 32 samples for each epoch. The verbose=0 option suppresses the usual output so that only the end results are displayed.

Now let’s look at how to achieve training using `model.train_on_batch()`. Observe how the user assumes control over batch preparation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate dummy data
x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10).astype(np.float32)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(1000, 1)).astype(np.float32)

# Define the model (same as before)
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Define the optimizer and loss (same as before)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()

# Initialize loss and number of batches
losses = []
batch_size = 32
num_batches = len(x_train) // batch_size

# Train the model using model.train_on_batch()
for epoch in range(10):
    for i in range(num_batches):
        start = i * batch_size
        end = start + batch_size
        batch_x = x_train[start:end]
        batch_y = y_train[start:end]
        loss = model.train_on_batch(batch_x, batch_y)
        losses.append(loss)
    # Average losses per epoch
    avg_epoch_loss = np.mean(losses)
    print(f"Average training losses from model.train_on_batch(): {avg_epoch_loss}")
    losses = [] # Reset loss tracking for next epoch

```

Here, I manually constructed batches and executed `model.train_on_batch()` repeatedly. I collected the *raw* losses from each batch, and then averaged these *raw* losses across all batches in an epoch before printing. I then reset the list to collect the values of the next epoch. The main takeaway here is that the user is in charge of every training step.

Now, let’s demonstrate one more method and also show what happens if one neglects averaging in `model.train_on_batch()`. I'll demonstrate only a single epoch to highlight the fluctuations.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate dummy data
x_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10).astype(np.float32)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(1000, 1)).astype(np.float32)

# Define the model (same as before)
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Define the optimizer and loss (same as before)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()


batch_size = 32
num_batches = len(x_train) // batch_size

# Train the model using model.train_on_batch() and show raw output
print("Raw losses per batch from train_on_batch:")
for i in range(num_batches):
    start = i * batch_size
    end = start + batch_size
    batch_x = x_train[start:end]
    batch_y = y_train[start:end]
    loss = model.train_on_batch(batch_x, batch_y)
    print(f"Batch {i+1} loss: {loss}")


```
This final example outputs the raw loss per batch, demonstrating how much more volatile it is compared to the averaged losses of the previous two examples. This is the exact reason why `model.fit()` does not report the raw loss and instead gives the averaged result for smoother tracking.

In terms of resource recommendations, I would advise anyone using these methods to consult the TensorFlow documentation for both `model.fit()` and `model.train_on_batch()` carefully. Additionally, the TensorFlow tutorials that cover custom training loops are highly beneficial in understanding the subtleties of low-level training. Finally, studying the source code for these functions in the tensorflow Github repository can also give an even deeper insight into the underlying mechanisms. Understanding the difference between the raw and averaged loss is fundamental to debugging problems during model training. Choosing the right method depends on the specific training needs, trading between simplicity with `model.fit()` and increased control with `model.train_on_batch()`.
