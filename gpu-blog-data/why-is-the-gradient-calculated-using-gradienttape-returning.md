The primary cause for NaN (Not a Number) values in gradients calculated using TensorFlow's `tf.GradientTape` stems from numerical instability during backpropagation, particularly when operations result in infinities or undefined values. I’ve frequently encountered this during my time working on complex deep learning architectures, often when dealing with activation functions and loss calculations that aren’t inherently robust to extreme input values.

Numerical instability generally arises from three main scenarios: division by zero, the logarithm of zero or a negative number, and large exponential computations that exceed floating-point representation limits. When these operations are placed within the computational graph tracked by `GradientTape`, their consequences can propagate backwards and manifest as NaN gradients.

Let's break down how `GradientTape` operates. It records every operation involving `tf.Variable` objects. When you call `tape.gradient(loss, variables)`, TensorFlow traces back through that recorded graph, applying the chain rule of calculus to calculate gradients of the `loss` with respect to each specified variable. This process amplifies any instability encountered along the path.

Specifically, let's consider a common scenario with the logarithm. The logarithm of zero is undefined, and the logarithm of a very small number results in a large negative value. If these values are encountered during gradient computation, they can lead to NaN. Similarly, large values being exponentiated or squared can also result in overflow, producing an infinite value that subsequently propagates to NaN during gradient calculation.

Here's an example where the sigmoid activation function can cause this behavior, coupled with a poorly designed loss function:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def bad_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return -tf.math.log(y_pred) * y_true  # Potential division by zero, log(0) issues

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + tf.exp(-x))

class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.dense(x)
        return sigmoid(x) # Sigmoid output could be zero

model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1)

x = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
y = tf.constant([[1.0], [0.0], [1.0]])

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = bad_loss(y, y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

print("Gradients:", gradients)
```

In this example, the `bad_loss` function uses a logarithm directly on the output of the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function can produce values close to zero. When combined with negative values from `y_true` and the negative sign, this calculation makes a division by zero when you calculate a gradient. When this occurs, the gradients become NaN. The initial weight initialization also plays a role in this particular case. If the initial output of the model are too close to zero, this effect will exacerbate.

Here’s a modified example that demonstrates how using the proper cross-entropy loss function, designed to handle such issues, mitigates the problem:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def cross_entropy_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred) # Robust alternative

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + tf.exp(-x))

class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.dense(x)
        return sigmoid(x)

model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1)

x = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
y = tf.constant([[1.0], [0.0], [1.0]])

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = cross_entropy_loss(y, y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

print("Gradients:", gradients)
```

By using `tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy`, which internally handles edge cases using the log-sum-exp trick, we obtain stable gradients and avoid NaNs. This is because the cross-entropy loss is designed to work well with probabilities and avoid situations where taking logs becomes problematic, by adding small number to the log to prevent it from becoming undefine.

Furthermore, gradient clipping can be utilized to manage exceptionally large gradients that might trigger overflows. It works by limiting the magnitude of each gradient to a defined threshold. Here's a basic implementation showing gradient clipping:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def cross_entropy_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + tf.exp(-x))

class SimpleModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.dense(x)
        return sigmoid(x)

model = SimpleModel()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.1)
clip_norm = 1.0  # Define the threshold

x = tf.constant([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
y = tf.constant([[1.0], [0.0], [1.0]])


with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    y_pred = model(x)
    loss = cross_entropy_loss(y, y_pred)

gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)

clipped_gradients, _ = tf.clip_by_global_norm(gradients, clip_norm)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(clipped_gradients, model.trainable_variables))
print("Clipped Gradients:", clipped_gradients)
```

The function `tf.clip_by_global_norm` calculates the L2 norm of all gradients and, if this norm exceeds `clip_norm`, scales down all gradients proportionally such that the norm becomes equal to `clip_norm`. This prevents excessively large updates to the model parameters and helps with numerical stability. The `apply_gradients` method of the optimizer still needs to be used for parameter update.

Debugging NaN issues typically begins with examining the loss and intermediate values in the computational graph. `tf.print` or TensorFlow's debugger can be invaluable. Another common tactic is reducing the learning rate, as it may contribute to diverging gradients. It can also reveal that the underlying issue is in the data itself. Preprocessing to avoid very small values may be required for stability.

When designing custom layers and loss functions, it's crucial to consider numerical stability directly. Libraries like TensorFlow offer numerous tools for this: using the log-sum-exp trick for probabilities, employing numerically stable activation functions (e.g., Swish instead of ReLU), and leveraging batch normalization. These techniques can prevent instabilities before they affect the gradient calculation.

In summary, when encountering NaN gradients using `tf.GradientTape`, scrutinize the implemented functions for operations prone to numerical instability: divisions by zero, logarithms of zero or negative numbers, and exponential or power calculations resulting in excessively large values. Ensure that loss functions and activation functions are inherently numerically stable and that your data pre-processing is also numerically stable. If all else fails, consider employing gradient clipping and check data for any extreme outliers.

Recommended resources for further study: the TensorFlow documentation, publications on numerical optimization for deep learning, and research papers on advanced activation functions and loss functions. Textbooks on numerical computation can also provide a solid theoretical foundation. These resources detail the best practices I've found crucial for managing numerical stability in deep learning.
