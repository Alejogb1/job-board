A Keras layer's name, assigned during its instantiation, functions solely as a string identifier within the model's symbolic graph; it has *no direct influence* on the layer’s internal weight initialization process or the subsequent seeded values. The weights themselves are generated upon the layer's first build (often implicit during model compilation or when the input shape is first defined), and this process relies on separate mechanisms, typically the chosen weight initializer and the random number generator's seed. Changing the name after instantiation or even after the layer is built will not cause any alterations to the already initialized parameters. My experience debugging complex model architectures has repeatedly shown this, particularly in situations where dynamic layer naming was employed for clarity and debugging.

Let me clarify this behavior by diving into the Keras layer lifecycle and how weights are actually created and managed. When you define a layer, say, `Dense(units=64, name="initial_dense")`, Keras essentially creates a symbolic representation of this operation. The core logic, residing in the `Layer` class's `build` method (or derived classes’ overridings), which is invoked when the shape of the layer's input is determined, will only trigger the actual allocation of memory for the weights. The naming happens at construction time, or in specific circumstances where manual naming is desired. At the same point, before returning control to the calling context, the random number generation routines are used with the configured initializer to come up with the initial matrix values. Keras does employ name-based lookup strategies for layer access and model manipulation, but these are external to the weight variables. Changing the name is an act of changing that identifier, not touching the actual variables themselves. Keras models store their topology in graphs, and the names provide unique identifiers within that graph. The parameters of the layer, on the other hand, are TensorFlow variables, and they are indexed via Python objects, not textual names. This distinction is paramount to understanding why renaming does not cause a reset.

To illustrate, let's consider a series of examples that show that renaming, before or after model building, has no affect on internal values. These tests, which I've often employed in unit tests of complex models, will focus on verifying the consistency of seeded weights across these scenarios:

**Example 1: Renaming before build.**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Set seed for reproducibility
tf.random.set_seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)

# Define a simple dense layer with an initial name
dense_layer_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=32, kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', name='layer_a')

# Provide an input to trigger the build (and weight initialization)
input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
output_1 = dense_layer_1(input_tensor)

# Change the layer name
dense_layer_1.name = 'layer_b'

# Provide input again. Weights should be unchanged, hence, the output should also be unchanged
output_2 = dense_layer_1(input_tensor)

# Compare the outputs
tf.debugging.assert_equal(output_1, output_2, message="Output changed after renaming before access.")

print("Output remains consistent after renaming, before rebuild (no change)")

# We can check also by comparing the weights.

w_1 = dense_layer_1.kernel
tf.debugging.assert_equal(w_1, dense_layer_1.kernel, message = "Weight was not retained on rename before access")

print ("Weights also remain consistent after renaming before access")

```

In this case, the `dense_layer_1`'s name is changed after the first forward pass, which caused the layer to build and initialize its weights. Even with the name change, the subsequent forward pass produces the same output, reflecting that the weights have not been reinitialized. The assertions explicitly confirm that both weights and the output stay consistent. The initial weight generation process only happens once, when `build` is called by Keras. Subsequent modifications to the name field do not alter previously created weights.

**Example 2: Renaming after model is built**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Set seed for reproducibility
tf.random.set_seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)

# Define a model with a dense layer
inputs = tf.keras.Input(shape=(10,))
dense_layer_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=32, kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', name='layer_c')(inputs)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=dense_layer_1)

# Obtain the weights of the dense layer.
layer_c_weights = model.layers[1].kernel

# Change the layer name
model.layers[1].name = 'layer_d'
new_layer_name = model.layers[1].name
#The weights should still be the same, since renaming does not influence this.

layer_d_weights = model.layers[1].kernel
tf.debugging.assert_equal(layer_c_weights, layer_d_weights, message="Weights changed after renaming after building the model.")

print("Weights remain consistent after renaming after building the model.")

# Test that the output stays the same:

input_tensor = tf.random.normal((1, 10))
output_before = model(input_tensor)

# Use the same model and get new output
output_after = model(input_tensor)

tf.debugging.assert_equal(output_before, output_after, message="Output changed after renaming after building the model")

print("Output remains consistent after renaming, after building the model.")

```

This example constructs a simple Keras model incorporating the same `Dense` layer. After the model is built, and the layer initialized, the `name` attribute of the layer is modified directly within the model. Despite this, accessing the layer weights before and after the change reveals no alteration. Similarly, the output is identical before and after, since the parameter tensors have remained untouched. This case highlights that even after a layer is integrated into a full model, a name alteration has no impact on its initialized values. I've employed similar strategies in large systems where layer naming conventions changed mid-project, demonstrating the non-destructive nature of renaming.

**Example 3: Manual build and renaming**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Set seed for reproducibility
tf.random.set_seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)

# Manually build a dense layer
dense_layer_1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=32, kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform', name='layer_e')
input_shape = (1, 10)
dense_layer_1.build(input_shape=input_shape)

# Store the initial weights
w_1 = dense_layer_1.kernel

# Change the layer's name.
dense_layer_1.name = "layer_f"

# Store weights again and check if they are consistent
w_2 = dense_layer_1.kernel
tf.debugging.assert_equal(w_1, w_2, message = "Weights changed after manual build and rename")

print("Weights remain consistent after manual build and rename")
```
This final example further emphasizes the same conclusion. Here, the layer's build method is called explicitly, separating its creation from the execution and from being implicitly tied to any specific model architecture.  The name change, even immediately following this manual build process, does not cause weight changes. The equality assertion reinforces that naming is an operation completely distinct from the layer's core state data. It also mirrors situations where custom model constructions might be required.

In summary, these examples demonstrate that the name of a Keras layer functions primarily as an organizational and retrieval mechanism within the model graph. Altering it will not lead to a re-initialization of the layer’s weights. The initial weight values are computed using the configured weight initializer and a seeded random number generator during the `build` method. Renaming is a purely symbolic operation, with zero ramifications to the underlying numerical parameters.

For further study on Keras layers and model construction, I recommend exploring the TensorFlow documentation, particularly sections on custom layer creation and the `Layer` class API. Additionally, the official Keras examples, typically found on the project's website or Github repositories, are invaluable for learning best practices. Studying design patterns for large systems involving multiple layers and complex model architectures will further underscore this key distinction between layer names and their internal parameter data.
