The `packaging.version` module, a core component for robust version handling, is often absent after a seemingly successful `setuptools` installation due to how `setuptools` itself structures its dependencies and how those dependencies are resolved or, in some cases, not resolved. The issue stems from the fact that while `setuptools` might install `packaging`, it doesn't automatically expose the `packaging.version` submodule as part of its public API or consistently ensure that `packaging`'s module tree is accessible in a way that user code expects. This can be particularly confounding for developers accustomed to the straightforward import procedures of most Python libraries.

From my experience building several large-scale Python deployment pipelines, I've frequently encountered this issue, especially in environments where package management is not meticulously controlled or where installation is layered on top of existing virtual environments. The crux of the matter is that `setuptools` relies on `packaging` for its own internal version management processes. Therefore, when `setuptools` is installed, `packaging` is typically installed as well, but it is primarily intended as an internal dependency. `packaging.version` itself is not necessarily designed to be directly accessible via a top-level import path related to `setuptools`. Instead, it's intended to be imported directly from `packaging` itself.

Specifically, the issue arises due to how Python's import mechanism works and how `setuptools` organizes its namespace. After installing `setuptools`, you will find the `packaging` package located in your Python environment's `site-packages` directory. However, trying to import `packaging.version` directly after this will fail because, while `packaging` is there, its submodules are not necessarily implicitly added to `setuptools`' namespace. You must import `packaging` directly first. Incorrect assumptions about how these modules are intended to be accessed lead to common “ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'packaging.version'” exceptions.

The following examples demonstrate the issue and its proper resolution.

**Example 1: Incorrect Import (Fails)**

```python
# This approach will fail because setuptools does not expose packaging.version directly.
try:
    from setuptools import packaging
    version = packaging.version.Version("1.2.3")
    print(version)
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"ImportError: {e}")

try:
    from setuptools.version import Version
    version = Version("1.2.3")
    print(version)
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"ImportError: {e}")
```

In this first code snippet, I’ve attempted to import `packaging` and then `packaging.version` from the `setuptools` namespace. This fails with an `ImportError` because `packaging` is not a submodule of `setuptools`. Additionally, I tried to import directly from `setuptools.version`, a common misconception, which also fails. The `setuptools` package, while dependent on `packaging`, does not directly expose its submodules. This is a frequent point of misunderstanding and results in the error in the initial question.

**Example 2: Correct Import (Works)**

```python
# This is the correct way to import and use packaging.version.
try:
    from packaging.version import Version
    version = Version("1.2.3")
    print(version)
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"ImportError: {e}")
```

This second example illustrates the correct way to access `packaging.version`. Here, I directly import `Version` from the `packaging.version` module. This is the intended usage, where you bypass any indirect attempts through `setuptools` and work directly with the library supplying the version parsing functionalities. This correctly parses the provided string “1.2.3” into a `packaging.version.Version` object, as intended.

**Example 3: Correct Import within a Packaging Context (Works)**

```python
# Shows usage of the Version class with packaging
import packaging.version as pkgver

def is_version_greater(current_version_str, target_version_str):
    current_version = pkgver.Version(current_version_str)
    target_version = pkgver.Version(target_version_str)
    return current_version > target_version


if is_version_greater("1.2.0", "1.1.0"):
    print("Version 1.2.0 is greater than 1.1.0")
else:
    print("Version 1.2.0 is not greater than 1.1.0")

if is_version_greater("1.0.0", "1.2.0"):
    print("Version 1.0.0 is greater than 1.2.0")
else:
    print("Version 1.0.0 is not greater than 1.2.0")
```

This final example expands upon the correct import by creating a small function to use packaging to compare software versions.  By importing `packaging.version` as `pkgver`, we clearly show that accessing the functionality is independent of setuptools. The function `is_version_greater` demonstrates a use-case of the `packaging.version.Version` class and its built in comparison operators. This illustrates its practical application for tasks such as version checks during software upgrades.

To avoid this issue, always ensure to directly import the `packaging` library and its modules. Do not rely on `setuptools` to expose the `packaging` module or its submodules. It's imperative to remember that `setuptools` is simply a consumer of `packaging`, not an intermediary intended for external access to `packaging`’s functionalities.

For further exploration and reference, I recommend consulting the official Python documentation related to package management, especially for modules such as `setuptools` and `packaging`. Reading the PyPA (Python Packaging Authority) documentation on these subjects is also highly useful. Specifically, examining the `packaging` project documentation directly will provide details on its API usage. Consider studying advanced topics in virtual environment management (e.g., `venv` and `virtualenv`) as these tools impact how Python environments are structured and how packages are resolved. Lastly, familiarize yourself with the specifics of the `pip` package manager; understanding its operation is crucial for mastering Python package installation nuances. These resources collectively provide a solid foundation for navigating Python’s package landscape. Understanding how packages and their dependencies are structured in Python can greatly reduce time spent troubleshooting import errors.
