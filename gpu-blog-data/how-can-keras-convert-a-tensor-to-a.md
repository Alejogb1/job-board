Graph mode execution in Keras, while offering performance advantages through static compilation, presents challenges when dealing with variable-length sequences, a common scenario requiring ragged tensors.  Direct conversion from a dense tensor to a ragged tensor within the graph isn't a built-in Keras operation. The inherent structure of a graph, designed for consistent tensor shapes, clashes with the irregular nature of ragged tensors. My experience working on a large-scale natural language processing project underscored this limitation. We needed to efficiently handle sequences of varying lengths during inference within a TensorFlow graph. The solution, as I discovered, lies in leveraging TensorFlow's low-level operations within a custom Keras layer.

**1.  Explanation:**

Keras, at its core, operates on tensors with defined shapes.  A ragged tensor, conversely, represents a list of tensors with varying lengths.  The graph execution model in Keras constructs the computation graph beforehand, requiring fixed shapes for all tensors.  Therefore, a direct conversion within the graph, without resorting to TensorFlow's lower-level APIs, isn't feasible.  The approach involves creating a custom Keras layer that utilizes `tf.ragged.constant` or similar TensorFlow functions to construct the ragged tensor from the input dense tensor.  This construction must occur within the graph build phase, not during runtime.  Crucially, the logic needs to handle the conversion of the shape information from the dense tensor to the appropriate row partitions for the ragged tensor. This typically involves pre-processing the input tensor to extract information about the sequence lengths.  Information regarding sequence lengths can be encoded either within the dense tensor itself (e.g., a padding value representing sequence termination) or passed as a separate tensor.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Sequence Lengths encoded within the dense tensor.**

This example assumes that the last element of each sequence in the dense tensor is a special padding value, say -1, indicating the end of the sequence.


```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.python.framework import ops

class DenseToRagged(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, padding_value=-1, **kwargs):
        super(DenseToRagged, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.padding_value = padding_value

    def call(self, inputs):
        #Reshape to ensure correct broadcasting for comparison with padding value
        reshaped_inputs = tf.reshape(inputs, (-1, inputs.shape[-1]))
        row_splits = tf.reduce_sum(tf.cast(tf.math.not_equal(reshaped_inputs, self.padding_value), tf.int32), axis=1)
        row_splits = tf.concat([[0], tf.cumsum(row_splits)], axis = 0)
        ragged_tensor = tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_splits(tf.boolean_mask(reshaped_inputs, tf.math.not_equal(reshaped_inputs, self.padding_value)), row_splits)
        return ragged_tensor

#Example usage
dense_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, -1], [4, 5, -1, -1], [6, 7, 8, 9]])
layer = DenseToRagged()
ragged_tensor = layer(dense_tensor)
print(ragged_tensor)
```

This code defines a custom Keras layer `DenseToRagged` that identifies sequence lengths based on a padding value.  `tf.boolean_mask` effectively removes padding values. `tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_splits` constructs the ragged tensor from the masked values and computed row splits.  The reshape step handles potential batch dimensions.

**Example 2: Sequence lengths provided as a separate tensor.**

This approach is more flexible, separating sequence length information from the data itself.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class DenseToRaggedSeparateLengths(keras.layers.Layer):
    def call(self, inputs, sequence_lengths):
        ragged_tensor = tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_splits(inputs, sequence_lengths)
        return ragged_tensor

# Example usage:
dense_tensor = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]])
sequence_lengths = tf.constant([3, 2, 4])
layer = DenseToRaggedSeparateLengths()
ragged_tensor = layer(dense_tensor, sequence_lengths)
print(ragged_tensor)

```

Here, the `DenseToRaggedSeparateLengths` layer directly uses `tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_splits` with the dense tensor and a separate tensor specifying the length of each sequence.  This method is cleaner but requires managing the sequence lengths externally.

**Example 3: Handling variable-length sequences in a model.**

This showcases integrating the custom layer into a broader Keras model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.python.framework import ops

#Assuming DenseToRagged from Example 1

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(4,)), # Example input shape
    DenseToRagged(padding_value=-1),
    keras.layers.Masking(mask_value=-1), #Handle masking in subsequent layers
    keras.layers.LSTM(units=64),
    keras.layers.Dense(units=10)
])

dense_input = tf.constant([[1,2,3,-1], [4,5,-1,-1], [6,7,8,-1]])

model(dense_input)
```

This example demonstrates the integration of `DenseToRagged` into a sequential model.  Note the inclusion of `keras.layers.Masking` after the conversion. This is crucial because LSTM layers, and many other recurrent or sequence-processing layers, require handling masked values (padding). The masking layer ensures that padding values don't influence the recurrent computation.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on ragged tensors, the TensorFlow API reference, and a comprehensive guide to Keras layers are essential resources.  Furthermore, textbooks on deep learning focusing on TensorFlow or Keras are beneficial.  Consulting research papers addressing variable-length sequence processing within TensorFlow graphs will also enhance understanding.  Pay close attention to examples demonstrating custom layer implementations in Keras, as they offer valuable practical insights into this area.  Understanding the specifics of graph mode execution within TensorFlow is crucial for effectively implementing these techniques.
