The output dimensionality of a bidirectional stacked LSTM in TensorFlow isn't immediately intuitive; it's crucial to understand that the concatenation of forward and backward passes happens *at each layer*, not just at the final layer. This nuanced behavior significantly impacts how you interpret and utilize the model's output.  I've encountered this issue numerous times in my work on time-series anomaly detection, and the subtle distinctions can lead to significant debugging headaches.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

A standard LSTM processes sequential data in one direction. A bidirectional LSTM augments this by processing the same sequence in both forward and backward directions.  The stacked variant extends this further by layering multiple bidirectional LSTM cells.  Let's break down the output structure:

* **Single Bidirectional LSTM:**  A single layer bidirectional LSTM takes a sequence of shape `(timesteps, features)` as input. The forward pass processes the sequence as is, while the backward pass processes it in reverse.  The output at each timestep is a concatenation of the forward and backward hidden states. Therefore, if the hidden state size of the LSTM is `units`, the output shape will be `(timesteps, 2 * units)`.

* **Stacked Bidirectional LSTM:** The key is in understanding how the stacking occurs.  Each layer receives the concatenated output of the preceding layer.  Imagine three stacked bidirectional LSTM layers with `units` hidden units per layer.

    * **Layer 1:** Takes input `(timesteps, features)`, produces output `(timesteps, 2 * units)`.
    * **Layer 2:** Takes input `(timesteps, 2 * units)` (the output of Layer 1), produces output `(timesteps, 2 * units)`. Note the output shape remains consistent because concatenation happens within each layer.  This isn't a summation or averaging; it's a direct concatenation of the forward and backward hidden states from this specific layer.
    * **Layer 3:** Takes input `(timesteps, 2 * units)`, produces output `(timesteps, 2 * units)`. The final output also maintains this shape.

In essence, each layer's bidirectional LSTM independently processes the input (either the original input sequence or the concatenated output from the previous layer) and outputs a concatenation of its forward and backward hidden states. The final output reflects the concatenated hidden states of the topmost layer, but the information from all previous layers is integrated through the sequential concatenation process.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

These examples use TensorFlow/Keras for clarity.  Remember to adjust `units`, `features`, and `timesteps` according to your specific data.

**Example 1: Single Bidirectional LSTM**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True)),
])

input_shape = (100, 3) # timesteps, features
model.build(input_shape)
model.summary()
```

The `return_sequences=True` argument is crucial. It ensures that the output at each timestep is returned, resulting in the `(timesteps, 2 * units)` output shape.  Without it, only the final hidden state is returned. The model summary will clearly show the output shape.


**Example 2: Stacked Bidirectional LSTM**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True)),
    tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True)),
])

input_shape = (100, 3)
model.build(input_shape)
model.summary()
```

Observe the output shape of each layer in the summary.  Both layers have an output shape of `(None, 128)` reflecting the concatenation within each bidirectional layer.


**Example 3: Stacked Bidirectional LSTM with Dense Output Layer**

This demonstrates how to utilize the output for a classification task, for instance.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True)),
    tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units=64, return_sequences=True)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='softmax') #Example classification with 10 classes
])

input_shape = (100, 3)
model.build(input_shape)
model.summary()
```

Here, the final Dense layer processes the sequence output from the stacked Bidirectional LSTM layers.  If you require a single prediction, you might consider using `GlobalAveragePooling1D` or `GlobalMaxPooling1D` before the Dense layer to reduce the dimensionality from `(timesteps, 128)` to `(128,)`.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I strongly recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation on recurrent layers.  Deep learning textbooks that thoroughly cover recurrent neural networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and bidirectional LSTMs are invaluable for a deeper understanding. Pay close attention to the details of layer configuration options, especially `return_sequences` and `return_state` in TensorFlow/Keras.  Furthermore,  carefully examining code examples from reputable sources, particularly those demonstrating the use of stacked bidirectional LSTMs in various applications, can provide practical insights into managing their output.  Finally, thoroughly reviewing the output shapes provided by the `model.summary()` method is crucial for debugging discrepancies between expected and actual output dimensions.
