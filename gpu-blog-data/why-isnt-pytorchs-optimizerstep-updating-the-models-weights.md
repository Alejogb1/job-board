The absence of weight updates after calling `optimizer.step()` in PyTorch frequently stems from a mismatch between the optimizer's expected gradient accumulation behavior and the actual gradient computation within the training loop.  Over the years, I've debugged numerous instances of this, often tracing the issue to either a missing gradient calculation, improper gradient accumulation, or an incorrectly configured optimizer.

**1.  Explanation:**

PyTorch's optimizers, such as `torch.optim.Adam`, `torch.optim.SGD`, etc., rely on gradients computed with respect to the model's parameters.  The `optimizer.step()` function uses these accumulated gradients to update the model's weights according to the chosen optimization algorithm.  If gradients are not correctly calculated and accumulated before calling `optimizer.step()`, the weights remain unchanged.  This usually manifests in one of three primary ways:

a) **Missing Gradient Calculation:**  The most common cause is neglecting to explicitly compute gradients.  PyTorch's `autograd` engine, responsible for automatic differentiation, only computes gradients when `backward()` is called on a loss tensor. This loss tensor must be a scalar; using a multi-dimensional loss directly with `backward()` will lead to an error or unexpected behavior.  Omitting this step results in zero gradients, and thus no weight updates.

b) **Incorrect Gradient Accumulation:** Certain training strategies, such as gradient accumulation for handling large batches that don't fit in memory, require explicit gradient clearing.  Failing to zero the gradients before accumulating gradients from multiple mini-batches will lead to incorrect gradient accumulation, potentially resulting in erratic or no updates.  This applies less to standard single-batch training but is a crucial aspect for large-scale model training.

c) **Optimizer Misconfiguration:** While less frequent, it's possible to misconfigure the optimizer itself.  For example, providing incorrect parameters during initialization or inadvertently setting the learning rate to zero will prevent any weight updates.

Let's examine these scenarios through code examples.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Missing `backward()` call**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Model definition
model = nn.Linear(10, 1)

# Optimizer definition
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Sample input and target
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
target_tensor = torch.randn(1, 1)

# Forward pass
output = model(input_tensor)

# Loss calculation - Note the missing backward() call
loss = nn.MSELoss()(output, target_tensor)

# Optimizer step - No update occurs
optimizer.step()

# Verify weights haven't changed (compare to model's initial weights)
print("Weights after optimizer.step():", list(model.parameters()))
```

In this example, the crucial `loss.backward()` call is absent.  Consequently, the optimizer receives no gradients, leading to no weight updates.  Adding `loss.backward()` before `optimizer.step()` rectifies this.

**Example 2: Incorrect Gradient Accumulation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

for i in range(5):
    input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
    target_tensor = torch.randn(1, 1)
    output = model(input_tensor)
    loss = nn.MSELoss()(output, target_tensor)
    loss.backward()  # Accumulates gradients each iteration
    # Missing optimizer.zero_grad()
    optimizer.step()

print("Weights after optimizer.step():", list(model.parameters()))
```

Here, gradients are accumulated over five iterations without clearing them using `optimizer.zero_grad()`.  This leads to incorrect weight updates, potentially preventing proper convergence. Adding `optimizer.zero_grad()` before `loss.backward()` in each iteration is essential for accurate gradient accumulation.

**Example 3: Optimizer Misconfiguration (Zero Learning Rate)**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)

# Optimizer with zero learning rate
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.0)  # Learning rate is zero

input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
target_tensor = torch.randn(1, 1)

output = model(input_tensor)
loss = nn.MSELoss()(output, target_tensor)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

print("Weights after optimizer.step():", list(model.parameters()))
```

This example demonstrates the effect of a zero learning rate.  Even with correct gradient calculation and accumulation, the weights will not update because the update rule is scaled by zero.  Verify the learning rate's value during optimizer initialization to avoid this issue.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I recommend carefully reviewing the PyTorch documentation on optimizers and automatic differentiation.  A thorough understanding of how `autograd` functions and how gradients flow through the computational graph is critical.  Supplement this with a robust understanding of backpropagation and various optimization algorithms.  Examine examples from well-established repositories and tutorials; focusing on detailed explanations of each step in the training loop is crucial for understanding the nuances of gradient calculations and optimization.  Finally, using a debugger to step through the code line by line during training will reveal the exact point where gradients are not being handled as expected.
