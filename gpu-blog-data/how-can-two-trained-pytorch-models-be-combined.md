Combining two pre-trained PyTorch models presents several avenues, each with its own trade-offs regarding computational cost, model flexibility, and ultimate performance. The optimal approach heavily depends on the task at hand and the architectures of the models being combined. Based on my experience, ranging from simple image classification enhancements to more intricate multimodal setups, I have found that careful consideration of the specific problem is paramount. Simply concatenating the final layers, for example, often leads to suboptimal results.

The most straightforward methods focus on leveraging pre-trained feature extractors. This often involves treating one or both models as a frozen component, retaining their learned weights, and constructing a new model on top. This process effectively turns them into sophisticated feature engineering modules. Alternatively, joint training, which involves simultaneously optimizing the weights of both models, offers the potential for more sophisticated interactions but carries a higher computational burden and risks overfitting.  The key is determining the level of interaction needed between the models to achieve the desired outcome. I've found a modular approach usually works best â€“ break it into manageable parts.

Let's examine some specific strategies I've used.

**1. Feature Concatenation with a New Classifier:**

This method assumes that both pre-trained models, let's call them Model A and Model B, output meaningful feature vectors. We can freeze the weights of Model A and Model B, extract their respective feature representations from some intermediate layer, concatenate those feature vectors, and feed the result into a new trainable classifier. This avoids modifying the internal workings of Model A and Model B, saving time and computational expense.

For example, consider a situation where Model A is trained for image recognition and Model B for audio classification. We want to classify images and audio samples together into a joint class. We can extract the penultimate layers from each model, concatenate them, and train a linear layer.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision.models import resnet18
from torchaudio.models import wav2vec2_base

#Assume Model A is a pre-trained ResNet18
model_a = resnet18(pretrained=True)
# Remove the final fully connected layer (classifier) from ResNet18 to obtain a feature extractor.
model_a = nn.Sequential(*list(model_a.children())[:-1])  # Remove final fc layer
for param in model_a.parameters(): # Freeze the weights for faster computation
    param.requires_grad = False

# Assume Model B is a pre-trained wav2vec2_base
model_b = wav2vec2_base(pretrained=True)
# Extract features from wav2vec using a projection layer, freezing weights
model_b.feature_projection.requires_grad_(False)
for param in model_b.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Define a new classifier
class CombinedClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, feature_size_a, feature_size_b, num_classes):
        super(CombinedClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(feature_size_a + feature_size_b, num_classes)

    def forward(self, features_a, features_b):
        combined_features = torch.cat((features_a, features_b), dim=1)
        output = self.fc(combined_features)
        return output

#Placeholder for feature dimensions
feature_size_a = 512 # Output size of the model A
feature_size_b = 768 # Output size of the model B
num_classes = 5 # Number of joint classes

classifier = CombinedClassifier(feature_size_a, feature_size_b, num_classes)

#Example Forward pass
input_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
input_audio = torch.randn(1, 16000) #example audio sample

features_a = model_a(input_image).view(1, -1) #flattening layer needed to obtain the features
features_b = model_b(input_audio).last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1) # Using mean pooling from the outputs

output = classifier(features_a, features_b)
print(output.shape)
```

In this case,  we're treating both models as feature extraction units; we take their outputs as inputs to a custom `CombinedClassifier`. The key here is that parameters of the existing networks are frozen. This method works well when computational resources are constrained or you need to rapidly prototype a combined approach.

**2. Fine-tuning a Pre-trained Model with a New Input Branch:**

This strategy assumes that one pre-trained model (let's say Model A) performs the bulk of the task, and we want to augment it with the information from a secondary input processed by Model B. In this approach, we might freeze most of the weights of Model A, except for some later layers, while fully training the parameters of model B, and a bridging network to incorporate the outputs of the second model. This approach is useful when one model has a more established and robust architecture and is closer to the overall task at hand.

Imagine Model A is a ResNet for image segmentation and Model B is a lightweight CNN to extract depth information from a different input sensor. We want the depth information to improve the segmentation.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision.models.segmentation import fcn_resnet50
from torchvision.models import resnet18

# Assume model A is a pre-trained FCN for segmentation
model_a = fcn_resnet50(pretrained=True)
num_classes = 20 # Number of segmentation classes
model_a.classifier[4] = nn.Conv2d(512, num_classes, kernel_size=(1, 1), stride=(1, 1))

# Freeze the feature extraction layers of Model A
for param in model_a.backbone.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Assume Model B is a lightweight resnet
model_b = resnet18()
model_b.fc = nn.Identity()
# New layer for processing the depth map
model_b = nn.Sequential(model_b,
                       nn.Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),
                       nn.ReLU()
                       )


# Define a bridging network to combine the outputs of B with A's intermediate layers.
class BridgeNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, feature_size_a, feature_size_b):
        super(BridgeNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(feature_size_a + feature_size_b, feature_size_a, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)

    def forward(self, features_a, features_b):
        combined_features = torch.cat((features_a, features_b), dim=1)
        return self.conv(combined_features)

# We choose one specific stage in model A (layer 4), for feature fusion
# Assume it's the output before the final classifier.
feature_size_a = 512 # Output size of the layer selected from model A
feature_size_b = 512  # Output size from model B
bridge_network = BridgeNetwork(feature_size_a,feature_size_b)

# Custom class to combine the models
class CombinedSegmentationModel(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, model_a, model_b, bridge_network):
    super(CombinedSegmentationModel, self).__init__()
    self.model_a = model_a
    self.model_b = model_b
    self.bridge_network = bridge_network
  def forward(self, input_image, depth_map):
    features_b = self.model_b(depth_map) #extract depth features
    x=self.model_a.backbone(input_image) # get feature maps up to the desired layer
    features_a=x['out']
    combined_features = self.bridge_network(features_a, features_b) # fuse features
    output = self.model_a.classifier(combined_features) #pass combined features into last layers
    return output

# Instantiate the combined model
combined_model = CombinedSegmentationModel(model_a, model_b, bridge_network)

# Example forward pass
input_image = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)
depth_map = torch.randn(1,3,224,224)

output = combined_model(input_image, depth_map)
print(output.shape)

```
Here, the `BridgeNetwork` allows us to fuse model B's output with a specific layer of model A, demonstrating a more nuanced interaction compared to simple concatenation.  The important part is the careful insertion of Model B's output into A's pipeline. I have found that this method allows for more contextual awareness when combining the two models.

**3. Shared Feature Space via Contrastive Learning:**

This more advanced method aims to train both models to project their inputs into a shared feature space, guided by a contrastive loss. In this setup, neither model is entirely frozen. The goal is for similar inputs to have closer representations in the shared space, regardless of their input modality. This approach is more resource-intensive but can lead to models that better understand the underlying relationships between different types of data.

Consider two models: Model A takes image data, and model B takes corresponding text captions. The objective is to ensure that images and their corresponding captions map to similar points in the feature space.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torchvision.models import resnet18
from transformers import BertModel

# Assume Model A is a pre-trained ResNet18
model_a = resnet18(pretrained=True)
model_a = nn.Sequential(*list(model_a.children())[:-1]) #Remove final fully connected layer
model_a.avgpool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1) # Ensure consistent feature vector length
for param in model_a.parameters():
    param.requires_grad=True

# Assume Model B is a pre-trained BERT model
model_b = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
for param in model_b.parameters():
    param.requires_grad=True


# Define a projection layer for each model to map into a shared space.
class ProjectionLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(ProjectionLayer, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
      return self.fc(x)


shared_dim = 128 #dimension of shared space
proj_a = ProjectionLayer(512, shared_dim)
proj_b = ProjectionLayer(768, shared_dim)


# Contrastive loss function
def contrastive_loss(embeddings_a, embeddings_b, labels):
    #  labels indicate which embeddings should be close together.
    # e.g., 1 indicates a matching image and text, 0 indicates different inputs
    diffs = embeddings_a.unsqueeze(1) - embeddings_b.unsqueeze(0)
    distances = torch.sum(diffs ** 2, dim=2)
    loss = (labels* distances) + ((1-labels)* torch.clamp(1-distances, min=0.0) ) # Contrastive loss
    return loss.mean()


#Example forward pass and loss calculation

input_images = torch.randn(3, 3, 224, 224)
input_text_ids = torch.randint(0,100, (3, 20)) #example text tokenized
input_text_masks = torch.ones((3, 20), dtype=torch.int) #create the text attention mask
labels = torch.tensor([1,0,0], dtype=torch.float) # Example labels: [image1,text1], [image2,text3]..

image_features = model_a(input_images).view(input_images.shape[0], -1) #flatten the output from CNN
text_features = model_b(input_text_ids, input_text_masks).last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)

projected_features_a = proj_a(image_features)
projected_features_b = proj_b(text_features)

loss = contrastive_loss(projected_features_a, projected_features_b, labels)
print("Contrastive Loss:",loss.item())
```
The key here is that both model A and B are fine-tuned (all their weights are set to requires_grad=True); this is necessary for contrastive learning. This shared feature space facilitates more advanced tasks and allows for zero-shot learning capabilities, but requires careful hyperparameter tuning and a suitable training dataset containing correspondence between the different modalities.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For those seeking further information, numerous resources exist within the deep learning community, beyond the basic PyTorch documentation itself. There are many books dedicated to practical deep learning, which often include case studies involving model combinations. Additionally, several online platforms provide tutorials and code snippets that illustrate these techniques. Lastly, engaging with academic publications focused on multi-modal learning and transfer learning can offer valuable insights and alternative approaches. By utilizing these resources in combination with experimentation, the optimal model combination strategy for any specific task can be found.
