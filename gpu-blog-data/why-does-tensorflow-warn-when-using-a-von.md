The warning encountered when using a Von Mises distribution within a TensorFlow neural network's output layer stems from the inherent difficulties in optimizing probability distributions that are not inherently location-scale families, and particularly, the challenges posed by the circular nature of the Von Mises distribution. I've wrestled with this several times while building models for directional data, and the issues are often more nuanced than a simple implementation error.

The core of the problem lies in the mechanics of neural network training, which typically relies on gradient-based optimization techniques like stochastic gradient descent. These methods work most effectively when the output layer parameters directly map to the location and scale of the desired distribution, often via a parameterized mean and standard deviation (for example). The parameters of the Von Mises distribution, namely its mean direction (μ) and concentration parameter (κ), do not directly translate to the familiar location and scale interpretation used by standard likelihood optimization.

Unlike, say, a normal distribution where the mean parameter directly influences the central tendency, and the variance parameter controls the spread, the relationship between the parameters of the Von Mises distribution and its shape is more complex. The concentration parameter, κ, has a non-linear effect on the distribution's spread. A low κ signifies a near-uniform distribution, whereas large values indicate high concentration around the mean direction, μ. Crucially, optimizing these parameters directly using standard backpropagation can lead to unstable training and difficulties converging to the desired distribution. For this reason, attempting to directly optimize the negative log-likelihood loss of a Von Mises distribution can result in the mentioned warning, usually hinting that the numerical optimization can become unstable.

Furthermore, the periodic nature of the Von Mises distribution (defined on a circle) requires careful handling during optimization. The mean direction, μ, is an angle, usually between 0 and 2π, or -π and π. Standard gradient updates don't inherently respect this circular space, and a naive update can lead to a value for μ that no longer makes physical sense if it goes outside of the expected range.

I've found that a critical step is to parameterize the parameters more strategically. Instead of directly outputting μ and κ, it's often beneficial to output values which are then passed through a transformation function. For the mean direction, μ, I parameterize it as an output of two values that are the cosine and sine of μ. This avoids the issue of updating μ outside of its circular range.

Here are three examples illustrating this, along with commentary.

**Example 1: Naive Implementation (Problematic)**

This initial example demonstrates the problematic, yet common, approach of directly outputting parameters μ and κ.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

class NaiveVonMisesLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=1, **kwargs):
        super(NaiveVonMisesLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.mu_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=units, activation=None) # outputs mu directly
        self.kappa_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=units, activation=tf.nn.softplus) # ensures positive kappa

    def call(self, inputs):
        mu = self.mu_layer(inputs)
        kappa = self.kappa_layer(inputs)
        return tfd.VonMises(loc=mu, concentration=kappa)


# Dummy Data
inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 10)) # 32 samples, 10 features

# Build model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    NaiveVonMisesLayer()
])

# Example usage
dist = model(inputs)

# Dummy target, this would require a separate model or target processing
target_locations = tf.random.uniform(shape=(32,1), minval = 0.0, maxval= 2 * 3.14159)


# Loss calculation is still problematic, use a custom loss function
def negative_log_likelihood(y_true, y_pred):
    return -y_pred.log_prob(y_true)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=negative_log_likelihood)
# Train the model
model.fit(target_locations, dist, epochs=1) # this will likely give a warning or instability

```

*Commentary*: This naive example attempts to directly output the mean direction, `mu`, and the concentration parameter, `kappa`. While the `kappa_layer` uses `softplus` to ensure a positive `kappa`, no specific constraint is enforced for `mu` which will lead to numerical issues. This approach will often generate the mentioned warning and is generally not a stable implementation for optimizing the network. The loss function is also naively used on the distribution instance and would also not work with categorical targets, which might be an edge case in some projects using directional statistics.

**Example 2: Parameterization for Mean Direction**

This example introduces parameterization for the mean direction by mapping two outputs to the cosine and sine of `mu` respectively.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions

class ParameterizedVonMisesLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=1, **kwargs):
        super(ParameterizedVonMisesLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.cos_sin_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=2*units, activation=None) # output cos(mu) and sin(mu)
        self.kappa_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=units, activation=tf.nn.softplus) # ensures positive kappa


    def call(self, inputs):
        cos_sin = self.cos_sin_layer(inputs)
        kappa = self.kappa_layer(inputs)
        cos_mu = cos_sin[..., :self.units]
        sin_mu = cos_sin[..., self.units:]
        mu = tf.math.atan2(sin_mu, cos_mu)
        return tfd.VonMises(loc=mu, concentration=kappa)



# Dummy Data
inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 10))

# Build model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    ParameterizedVonMisesLayer()
])

# Example usage
dist = model(inputs)


# Dummy target, this would require a separate model or target processing
target_locations = tf.random.uniform(shape=(32,1), minval = 0.0, maxval= 2 * 3.14159)

# Loss calculation is still problematic, use a custom loss function
def negative_log_likelihood(y_true, y_pred):
    return -y_pred.log_prob(y_true)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=negative_log_likelihood)

# Train the model
model.fit(target_locations, dist, epochs=1) # less likely to give a warning here

```

*Commentary*: Here, the `cos_sin_layer` outputs two values, the first set corresponds to `cos(mu)` and the second set to `sin(mu)`. We then calculate `mu` via the `atan2` function, which correctly computes the angle from the cosine and sine values. This parameterization mitigates the issue of the mean direction parameter moving outside the valid range and also helps to provide smoother gradients during optimization.

**Example 3: Fully Parameterized Implementation and Custom Loss**

This example shows a complete implementation, including a custom loss function that is more robust for the training. I'm parameterizing both the mean and concentration, further simplifying learning. Also, in this case the target is an angular value, which is common in practice.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

tfd = tfp.distributions


class FullParameterizedVonMisesLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=1, **kwargs):
        super(FullParameterizedVonMisesLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.cos_sin_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=2 * units, activation=None)  # output cos(mu) and sin(mu)
        self.log_kappa_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=units, activation=None)  # output log(kappa)


    def call(self, inputs):
        cos_sin = self.cos_sin_layer(inputs)
        log_kappa = self.log_kappa_layer(inputs)
        cos_mu = cos_sin[..., :self.units]
        sin_mu = cos_sin[..., self.units:]
        mu = tf.math.atan2(sin_mu, cos_mu)
        kappa = tf.math.exp(log_kappa)
        return tfd.VonMises(loc=mu, concentration=kappa)


# Dummy Data
inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 10))


# Build model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    FullParameterizedVonMisesLayer()
])

# Dummy Target
target_locations = tf.random.uniform(shape=(32, 1), minval=0.0, maxval=2 * 3.14159)

# Custom Loss
def von_mises_neg_log_likelihood(y_true, y_pred):
    dist = y_pred
    return -dist.log_prob(y_true)

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=von_mises_neg_log_likelihood)
# Train the model
model.fit(target_locations, dist, epochs=1)

```

*Commentary*: This full parameterized version provides more stability to the learning process. The `log_kappa_layer` directly outputs log of the concentration parameter, and `kappa` is computed via `exp(log_kappa)`. In conjunction with the target having a realistic range (angular values), this setup is substantially more robust. Finally, a well defined custom loss function is included which allows one to properly train the model.

For deeper study of this subject, I would recommend exploring textbooks specializing in directional statistics. Works from Mardia and Jupp on "Directional Statistics" or Pewsey and colleagues "Circular Statistics in R" provide a theoretical foundation. Researching literature on maximum likelihood estimation, especially as it applies to non-location-scale distributions, will offer insight into the numerical challenges involved. Finally, delving into the TensorFlow Probability documentation, specifically the details of distribution implementations, will be very helpful. It will show you the underlying math and algorithms that can help when constructing a more robust statistical model.
