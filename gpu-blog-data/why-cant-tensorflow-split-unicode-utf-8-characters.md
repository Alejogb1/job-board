TensorFlow's inability to directly split UTF-8 encoded Unicode strings character-by-character stems from its core computational model, which prioritizes efficiency through vectorized operations on fixed-size tensors. Individual Unicode code points, particularly those beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), can occupy varying byte lengths (1 to 4 bytes in UTF-8). This variability fundamentally clashes with TensorFlow's design, where most operations expect uniform data types and dimensions within tensors.

TensorFlow's tensor representation is inherently memory-aligned and optimized for numerical computation. Strings, however, are inherently sequences of variable-length data. Representing strings in their raw byte representation presents a series of difficulties. Indexing and slicing operations become problematic because a single character may not correspond to a fixed number of bytes. Moreover, vectorized operations, designed to act in parallel on elements within tensors, become inefficient if each element (character) possesses a different byte length. Consequently, treating strings directly within the computational graph often necessitates transformations before operations can be applied effectively.

The primary reason character-level manipulation of UTF-8 strings is not natively supported lies in how TensorFlow handles tensors and computational graphs. The framework is architected around efficient computations on dense, homogeneous data structures. When dealing with byte representations of strings, variable-length characters mean the size of a single 'character' is unknown without decoding, which introduces variable computational cost. If we force individual UTF-8 bytes into separate tensor elements, we end up with a sequence of bytes that are not semantically meaningful without further processing, like identifying individual characters using specific patterns inherent to UTF-8. This processing must be performed outside the core vectorized operations that make TensorFlow fast.

The crucial distinction is between a "character" as a human-readable unit and the bytes representing that character. TensorFlow's computational graph primarily handles bytes directly, or fixed-length numeric representations derived from these bytes, not the higher-level concept of a character. While you could theoretically represent each byte individually as a number in a tensor, that approach would fail to consider that the actual characters may be coded using several consecutive bytes. Decoding and recognizing that sequence of bytes that constitute a character requires custom code and would make it difficult to take advantage of the performance optimizations available for tensors. Therefore, while you can certainly put a tensor of raw bytes into the graph, TensorFlow is not designed to natively process such a tensor of bytes as a sequence of meaningful UTF-8 characters.

My own experience highlights this issue. When working on a natural language processing (NLP) project involving multilingual text, I initially attempted to directly split a string tensor representing a multi-language sentence into character-level tensors. This failed, forcing me to utilize `tf.strings.unicode_decode_utf8` and `tf.RaggedTensor` which allows for a variable number of elements in each dimension. This operation performs the decoding, converting bytes into a tensor of Unicode code points which are represented by integer values. This code point representation, is internally represented as an integer tensor where each entry corresponds to a character. However, this code point tensor is not string, and it still needs to be further processed in order to do string manipulation.

Here are three practical code examples demonstrating how you can process strings, specifically how to split into Unicode code points, and then how to reassemble them back into string tensors.

**Example 1: Decoding a string into code points and back:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

text_tensor = tf.constant("你好世界") # Example string (Chinese)

# Decoding UTF-8 to Unicode code points
decoded_tensor = tf.strings.unicode_decode_utf8(text_tensor,
                                                    errors='replace')

# Encoding code points back to UTF-8
encoded_tensor = tf.strings.unicode_encode_utf8(decoded_tensor)

print("Original Text:", text_tensor.numpy().decode('utf-8')) # Decoding bytes into readable string before printing
print("Decoded Code Points:", decoded_tensor.numpy())
print("Encoded Text:", encoded_tensor.numpy().decode('utf-8')) # Decoding bytes into readable string before printing

```

This code snippet first creates a string tensor with the Chinese phrase "你好世界". It then utilizes `tf.strings.unicode_decode_utf8` to decode it into a `tf.Tensor` containing the Unicode code point for each character. Notice that the output shows the individual code points as integers. Finally, the `tf.strings.unicode_encode_utf8` re-encodes the code points into a UTF-8 string. Note that the decoded tensor is not a string, but rather it is an integer tensor.

**Example 2: Character-wise operations with ragged tensors**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

text_tensor = tf.constant(["hello", "world", "你好世界"])

decoded_tensor = tf.strings.unicode_decode_utf8(text_tensor, errors='replace')

# Convert to ragged tensor, where each element is a sequence of code points
decoded_ragged = tf.RaggedTensor.from_tensor(decoded_tensor)

# Map over each individual code point, adding 10 to each
modified_ragged = decoded_ragged + 10

# Convert back to dense tensor
modified_dense = modified_ragged.to_tensor()


# Re-encode
encoded_tensor = tf.strings.unicode_encode_utf8(modified_dense)


print("Original Text:", [t.decode('utf-8') for t in text_tensor.numpy()])
print("Modified Text (Unicode points encoded):", [t.decode('utf-8') for t in encoded_tensor.numpy()])


```

In this example, we process a batch of strings and then encode the new string into bytes. The example shows how to decode into a tensor, and then convert this tensor into a ragged tensor. The ragged tensor allows for each string to have different lengths. Then, we can apply a transformation on all the code points, in this case add 10 to it, and then re-encode the code points back to UTF-8. While adding 10 to code points would not produce text, it demonstrates how individual characters can be manipulated using this approach. The key takeaway here is that we must work with code points, not bytes.

**Example 3: String splitting for processing**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

text_tensor = tf.constant("The quick brown fox.")

# Split into words (simple space delimiter)
split_words = tf.strings.split(text_tensor, sep=' ')

# Split each word into individual UTF-8 characters
decoded_tensor = tf.strings.unicode_decode_utf8(split_words, errors='replace')

print("Original Text:", text_tensor.numpy().decode('utf-8'))
print("Split words:", [t.decode('utf-8') for t in split_words.numpy()])
print("Decoded characters (RaggedTensor):", decoded_tensor)

```

This example shows how to first split a string tensor into sub-tensors, which are in this case delimited by spaces. Once the words are split into a separate tensors, these can then be decoded into code points. This provides a way to access and work with individual characters, however, it is important to note that the characters are not represented as strings, but rather they are represented by the integer values that represent their code points. The RaggedTensor will store the code points for each word.

To further enhance understanding of string processing within TensorFlow, I would recommend studying the `tf.strings` module extensively. There are functions like `tf.strings.substr`, `tf.strings.regex_replace`, `tf.strings.reduce_join`, and others which are essential for efficient text preprocessing within a TensorFlow pipeline. Focus on the usage of `tf.RaggedTensor` which is designed to handle variably-sized sequences of data, and `tf.Tensor` when dealing with tensors that are uniform. Additionally, the `tf.io.decode_csv` is incredibly useful when working with textual data. Understanding these core mechanisms is critical for dealing with strings in TensorFlow efficiently. It’s crucial to internalize that TensorFlow is fundamentally designed to work with numerically represented data, necessitating encoding, decoding, and handling of string data in ways that account for the varying byte lengths of UTF-8 characters.
