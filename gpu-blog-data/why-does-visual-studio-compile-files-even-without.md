Visual Studio, under certain conditions, performs builds even when source code appears unaltered; this behavior arises from a combination of dependency tracking, timestamp management, and configured build system rules. My experience maintaining large C++ solutions has provided extensive exposure to this phenomenon. It is not a bug, but rather an essential aspect of ensuring build correctness and consistency, especially in complex projects involving numerous header files, precompiled headers, and external libraries.

The core issue stems from the fact that a compiler does not solely rely on source file modification dates to determine if compilation is required. Instead, it employs a dependency graph, meticulously tracking all files that contribute to the final output. This graph includes not only source files (`.cpp`, `.c`, etc.) but also header files (`.h`, `.hpp`), resource files, and even intermediate build products. When any element within this graph that a specific compilation unit depends upon changes, that unit is marked for recompilation, irrespective of whether its source code has been modified. This mechanism is crucial to prevent stale or inconsistent build outputs.

The build system, typically MSBuild in Visual Studio, maintains a series of timestamps associated with input and output files. During a build, these timestamps are compared against each other. If the timestamp of an input file is newer than the timestamp of the associated output file, a rebuild is triggered. However, this is not a straightforward comparison of source code timestamps versus output executable or object file timestamps. The dependency graph complicates matters by introducing several layers of potential “input” files.

For example, consider a header file shared by multiple source files. If this header file is modified, *every* source file that includes it will be marked as out-of-date because they all depend on that header. This leads to a full recompile of multiple compilation units, even if the source code within each unit itself has not changed. Furthermore, precompiled headers, while intended to speed up compilation, can also contribute to these unnecessary rebuilds. If the precompiled header file is invalidated (perhaps because a global definition changed), then all source files that depend upon it will be recompiled. Finally, build tools and other build system actions can update these files, causing subsequent builds to recompile.

Let’s illustrate this with a few code examples and scenarios:

**Example 1: Header File Dependency**

Consider these two C++ files:

`my_module.h`:
```cpp
#pragma once
int get_value();
```

`my_module.cpp`:
```cpp
#include "my_module.h"

int get_value() {
   return 10;
}
```

`main.cpp`:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "my_module.h"

int main() {
   std::cout << "Value: " << get_value() << std::endl;
   return 0;
}
```

Initially, after a successful build, timestamps of `my_module.obj` and `main.obj` will be newer than their corresponding source files `my_module.cpp` and `main.cpp`. Now, if I make no changes to the source files but only add a comment within `my_module.h`, for instance `#pragma once // Header file for my_module` then subsequent builds will cause both `my_module.cpp` and `main.cpp` to be recompiled. The timestamps of the modified `my_module.h` file trigger the compilation system to recompile both `.obj` files that are dependent on the file, even if the content of the source code within the `.cpp` files did not change. This is because the change to `my_module.h` invalidates the compiled output, as the preprocessor must consume the modified header file, potentially leading to different compiled results, at least in theory.

**Example 2: Precompiled Header Influence**

Now consider a project using precompiled headers. Assume we have `pch.h` and `pch.cpp` files.

`pch.h`
```cpp
#pragma once
#include <iostream>
```

`pch.cpp`
```cpp
#include "pch.h"
```

`my_app.cpp`
```cpp
#include "pch.h"

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, precompiled world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

On initial build `pch.obj` (or similar intermediate file name used to store the precompiled header data) and `my_app.obj` will be generated. Next, suppose a single `#include` statement is added to `pch.h`. For instance,

`pch.h`
```cpp
#pragma once
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
```
Even though the `my_app.cpp` code didn't change, the precompiled header `pch.obj` must now be rebuilt, and crucially, `my_app.cpp` will also be recompiled. The changes to `pch.h` affect the precompiled header content, therefore forcing `my_app.cpp` to be recompiled to ensure consistency with the updated precompiled header.  This is because all files that include `pch.h` use the *contents* of the precompiled header. The recompile can be mitigated if precompiled headers are set to "create" mode for PCH.cpp files and the rest of the source files are set to "use" mode for the PCH.

**Example 3: Build Tool Actions**

Let us now consider the scenario where a custom build tool or an action during the build process modifies some files involved in compilation.
Imagine a project with `.txt` files that get processed into `.inc` files which are included into a `.cpp` source file.
For example we have `input_data.txt`:

```text
10
20
30
```

We also have `generate_inc.bat`:

```batch
@echo off
echo #pragma once > generated_data.inc
echo static const int data[] = { >> generated_data.inc
for /f "tokens=*" %%a in (input_data.txt) do (
  echo  %%a, >> generated_data.inc
)
echo }; >> generated_data.inc
```
and `main.cpp`:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "generated_data.inc"

int main() {
   for (int val : data) {
        std::cout << val << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Suppose that a custom build step runs `generate_inc.bat` and generates `generated_data.inc` before the compilation. If a modification is made to `input_data.txt` this build step *always* results in `generated_data.inc` being updated. Even when the modification does not affect the content, (e.g., adding extra whitespace lines to the end of the file) the modification timestamp is changed. Consequently, the `main.cpp` is recompiled as its dependency has changed. Note the same occurs if the modification time of the batch file itself has changed. This is due to the build system correctly identifying dependency changes, as a modification to `input_data.txt` or to the batch file will lead to a different output of `generated_data.inc`.

These examples demonstrate that Visual Studio's build system is designed for robust and correct builds. While this might feel like an unnecessary recompilation in certain scenarios, the system's behavior is fundamental in preventing silent errors due to outdated intermediate files. The build system uses timestamp comparisons and dependency tracking to ensure consistency. It is better for the system to err on the side of extra compilations.

For further exploration and control over build behavior I suggest consulting the official Microsoft documentation on MSBuild, particularly the sections related to dependency tracking, incremental builds, and precompiled headers. Understanding the details of project file settings (.vcxproj) can also provide valuable insights into build system behavior. Consider also resources and articles available on build system design principles and understanding the structure of dependency graphs and how changes are propagated through them. Examining MSBuild logs is also invaluable when troubleshooting build-related problems. Specifically, the verbose logging mode provides a detailed view of the build process, revealing what exactly causes a compilation to be invoked.
