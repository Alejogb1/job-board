The discrepancy you're observing between your custom expression and TensorFlow's output likely stems from subtle differences in numerical precision and the order of operations, especially when dealing with floating-point numbers and potentially large tensors.  My experience debugging similar issues across numerous projects, including a large-scale recommendation system built with TensorFlow and a custom loss function implemented in C++, highlighted these nuances repeatedly.  Let's examine this systematically.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

TensorFlow, at its core, relies on highly optimized linear algebra libraries (typically Eigen or cuBLAS) for its computations. These libraries utilize specific algorithms and data structures designed for performance and parallelism.  Your custom expression, depending on the implementation language (Python, C++, etc.), may utilize a different underlying library or rely on standard arithmetic operators that might not exhibit identical precision or ordering characteristics.

Floating-point numbers inherently have limited precision.  Operations on them can accumulate small rounding errors, especially when numerous computations are chained together. These errors, though individually insignificant, can compound and lead to noticeable discrepancies, particularly with complex expressions involving trigonometric functions, exponentials, or divisions.  The order in which operations are performed (even seemingly equivalent sequences) can also influence the final result due to how these rounding errors propagate.

Furthermore, TensorFlow's automatic differentiation (utilized in gradient calculations) employs techniques like computational graphs and backpropagation. These techniques, while efficient, introduce their own subtleties in how intermediate results are computed and stored, potentially contributing to discrepancies when compared to a straightforward, forward-pass evaluation in a custom expression.  Finally, different libraries might employ different methods for handling overflow or underflow situations, leading to further divergence in the output.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

Let's consider three illustrative examples highlighting potential sources of error:

**Example 1:  Subtleties of Floating-Point Arithmetic**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

a = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], dtype=np.float32)
b = np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6], dtype=np.float32)

# Custom expression
custom_result = (a + b) * (a - b)

# TensorFlow expression
tf_result = tf.multiply(tf.add(a, b), tf.subtract(a, b))

print("Custom Result:", custom_result)
print("TensorFlow Result:", tf_result.numpy())
```

This example, seemingly straightforward, might already reveal minute differences due to the inherent limitations of floating-point representation.  The discrepancies might be amplified if the arrays `a` and `b` were significantly larger or involved more complex operations.


**Example 2:  Order of Operations and Associativity**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

x = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=np.float32)
y = np.array([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=np.float32)
z = np.array([7.0, 8.0, 9.0], dtype=np.float32)

# Custom expression (potentially different associativity)
custom_result = (x + y) + z

# TensorFlow expression
tf_result = tf.add(tf.add(x,y), z)

print("Custom Result:", custom_result)
print("TensorFlow Result:", tf_result.numpy())
```

While mathematically equivalent, the order of addition in the custom expression versus TensorFlow's might slightly differ in the accumulation of rounding errors, leading to minor discrepancies.  This is particularly important when dealing with a longer sequence of additions or other associative operations.

**Example 3:  Trigonometric Functions and Large Tensors**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

x = np.random.rand(1000, 1000).astype(np.float32) # Large tensor

# Custom expression
custom_result = np.sin(np.cos(x))

# TensorFlow expression
tf_result = tf.sin(tf.cos(x))

print("Custom Result (max difference):", np.max(np.abs(custom_result - tf_result.numpy())))
```

This example demonstrates the potential for significant accumulated error when dealing with trigonometric functions and large tensors.  The differences here will likely be more pronounced due to the iterative nature of these functions and the compounding effect of numerous floating-point calculations. The difference can be assessed through a comparison of maximum absolute differences.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

I'd suggest reviewing the documentation for the specific linear algebra libraries used by TensorFlow (Eigen, cuBLAS, etc.).  Understanding their internal workings and potential limitations in numerical precision is crucial. Consult numerical analysis textbooks focusing on floating-point arithmetic and error propagation.  Finally, thorough testing and comparison with known results (or alternative implementations) will help you identify and isolate the root causes of the discrepancies you observe.  Paying close attention to data types (e.g., `float32` vs. `float64`) can also significantly impact precision.  Remember, the choice of data type should align with the required accuracy and computational constraints of your project.
