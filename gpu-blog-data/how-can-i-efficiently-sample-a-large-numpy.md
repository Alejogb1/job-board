Efficiently sampling a large NumPy array multiple times hinges on understanding NumPy's broadcasting capabilities and leveraging its random number generation functionality in conjunction with optimized indexing techniques.  My experience optimizing high-throughput data processing pipelines for geophysical simulations highlighted the critical need for avoiding unnecessary array copies and redundant calculations when working with large datasets.  Directly manipulating array indices, rather than iteratively reshaping or copying the data, proved significantly faster.

**1.  Understanding the Bottleneck:**

The naive approach – looping through the sampling process and using `numpy.random.choice` repeatedly – is computationally expensive. This is primarily due to repeated random number generation and inefficient indexing for each sample.  Generating a large number of random indices upfront and then using advanced indexing to extract those indices is the key to optimization. The computational overhead is shifted from repeated random number generation and indexing within the loop to a single, more efficient operation.


**2. Efficient Sampling Strategy:**

The most effective strategy involves generating a single array of random indices sufficient for all samples beforehand. This leverages NumPy's vectorized operations for significantly improved performance, especially with larger arrays and more sampling iterations. This approach minimizes the repeated computations inherent in repeated calls to random number generation functions within a loop.

**3. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Inefficient (Naive) Approach:**

```python
import numpy as np

def inefficient_sampling(array, sample_size, num_samples):
    """
    Inefficient sampling using a loop.  Avoid this for large arrays.
    """
    samples = []
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        sample = np.random.choice(array, size=sample_size, replace=False)
        samples.append(sample)
    return np.array(samples)


large_array = np.arange(1000000)  # Example large array
sample_size = 1000
num_samples = 100

# This will be significantly slower for larger arrays and more samples
inefficient_samples = inefficient_sampling(large_array, sample_size, num_samples)
```

This approach is demonstrably slower due to the repeated calls within the loop.  The overhead from repeatedly generating random numbers and accessing array elements individually is substantial.


**Example 2: Efficient Approach with Advanced Indexing:**

```python
import numpy as np

def efficient_sampling(array, sample_size, num_samples):
    """
    Efficient sampling using advanced indexing and pre-generated indices.
    """
    array_size = len(array)
    indices = np.random.choice(array_size, size=(num_samples, sample_size), replace=False)
    samples = array[indices]
    return samples

large_array = np.arange(1000000)
sample_size = 1000
num_samples = 100

# Significantly faster, especially for larger arrays and more samples
efficient_samples = efficient_sampling(large_array, sample_size, num_samples)
```

Here, `np.random.choice` generates all required indices at once.  The subsequent indexing operation `array[indices]` leverages NumPy's broadcasting to extract the samples efficiently.  This avoids the overhead of the loop and the repeated calls to the random number generator.

**Example 3: Handling Replacement and Larger Datasets:**

For scenarios requiring replacement or dealing with arrays exceeding available memory, a different strategy is necessary. Generating indices in chunks and processing them iteratively is more memory efficient.  However, this introduces a slight performance trade-off.

```python
import numpy as np

def chunked_sampling(array, sample_size, num_samples, chunk_size=10000):
    """
    Efficient sampling with replacement, handling large datasets in chunks.
    """
    array_size = len(array)
    num_chunks = (num_samples * sample_size + chunk_size -1) // chunk_size
    samples = np.empty((num_samples, sample_size), dtype=array.dtype)

    for i in range(num_chunks):
        start = i * chunk_size
        end = min((i+1) * chunk_size, num_samples * sample_size)
        indices = np.random.choice(array_size, size=end-start, replace=True)
        samples.reshape(-1)[start:end] = array[indices]
    return samples

large_array = np.arange(1000000)
sample_size = 1000
num_samples = 100

#Efficient for very large datasets where memory is a constraint.
chunked_samples = chunked_sampling(large_array, sample_size, num_samples)

```

This example demonstrates how to handle sampling with replacement and manage memory usage for exceptionally large arrays.  The `chunk_size` parameter allows control over memory consumption, trading off some speed for memory efficiency.


**4. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of NumPy's advanced indexing, refer to the official NumPy documentation.  Consult resources on algorithm complexity and performance optimization in Python for further insights into efficient array manipulations. A thorough understanding of vectorization and broadcasting within NumPy is essential for optimizing array operations significantly.  Exploring the `numba` library can provide additional performance gains for computationally intensive tasks, but only if the code structure is compatible.  Carefully profiling your code with tools like `cProfile` will pinpoint performance bottlenecks specific to your environment and hardware.
