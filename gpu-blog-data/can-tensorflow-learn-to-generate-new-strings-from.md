TensorFlow's capacity to generate novel strings from a training set hinges on its ability to model the underlying probabilistic distribution of the input sequences.  My experience working on sequence-to-sequence models for natural language processing – specifically, developing a system for generating realistic-sounding product descriptions – has shown that while TensorFlow isn't inherently designed for string generation *per se*, its recurrent neural network (RNN) and transformer architectures are exceptionally well-suited to this task, provided the data is appropriately prepared and the model is carefully designed.  The key lies in representing strings as numerical sequences that the network can process.


**1. Explanation**

The fundamental approach involves converting each string in the input list into a numerical representation.  This is typically accomplished through techniques like one-hot encoding, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), or character-level embeddings.  Once the strings are encoded, they are fed into a recurrent neural network (RNN), such as a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network or a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, or a transformer architecture.  These architectures excel at handling sequential data due to their ability to maintain internal state information across time steps.  The network learns the statistical relationships between characters or words within the input strings.  After training, the network can generate new sequences by taking an initial input (e.g., a start token) and iteratively predicting the next character or word in the sequence, based on its learned probability distribution.


The choice of embedding method significantly impacts performance.  One-hot encoding, while simple, suffers from the curse of dimensionality, particularly for large vocabularies.  Word embeddings, on the other hand, capture semantic relationships between words, leading to better generalization.  Character-level embeddings offer a compromise, allowing the network to handle unseen words while avoiding the dimensionality problem associated with large word vocabularies.  For shorter strings with less complex structure, character-level embeddings often suffice.


The network architecture also plays a crucial role.  LSTMs and GRUs are effective at handling long-range dependencies within sequences, while transformers, with their attention mechanisms, can capture relationships between distant parts of the sequence more efficiently, particularly crucial for longer strings.  The choice depends on the length and complexity of the input strings and the computational resources available.  Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., number of layers, hidden units, learning rate) is essential to optimize the model's performance.


Finally, the output layer of the network typically uses a softmax activation function to produce a probability distribution over the vocabulary (characters or words).  The character or word with the highest probability is selected as the next element in the generated sequence, and the process is repeated until a termination token is generated or a maximum sequence length is reached.


**2. Code Examples**

The following examples illustrate the process using TensorFlow/Keras.  Note these are simplified for demonstration; real-world applications require more sophisticated preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning and model architecture choices.

**Example 1: Character-level generation using LSTM**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
strings = ["hello", "world", "python", "tensorflow"]

# Create character vocabulary
vocab = sorted(list(set("".join(strings))))
char_to_idx = {u:i for i, u in enumerate(vocab)}
idx_to_char = np.array(vocab)

# Data preprocessing
seq_length = 5
X = []
y = []
for string in strings:
    for i in range(0, len(string) - seq_length):
        in_seq = string[i:i + seq_length]
        out_seq = string[i + seq_length]
        X.append([char_to_idx[char] for char in in_seq])
        y.append(char_to_idx[out_seq])
X = np.reshape(X, (len(X), seq_length, 1))
X = X / float(len(vocab))
y = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y, num_classes=len(vocab))

# Build the LSTM model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(256, input_shape=(X.shape[1], X.shape[2])),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(len(vocab), activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=100) # Adjust epochs as needed

# Generate text
start = "hell"
pattern = [char_to_idx[char] for char in start]
pattern = np.reshape(pattern, (1, len(pattern), 1))
pattern = pattern / float(len(vocab))
for i in range(10):
    x = model.predict(pattern)
    index = np.argmax(x)
    result = idx_to_char[index]
    seq_in = [idx_to_char[value] for value in pattern[0,:,0]]
    print(seq_in, result)
    pattern = np.reshape(np.append(pattern[0,1:,0],index), (1,len(pattern),1))
    pattern = pattern/float(len(vocab))
```

This example demonstrates a simple character-level LSTM model.  The crucial steps are vocabulary creation, data preparation (into sequences), model building, training, and text generation.


**Example 2: Word-level generation using an embedding layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Sample data (replace with your actual data)
strings = ["This is a sentence.", "Another sentence here.", "A short one."]

tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(strings)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(strings)
word_index = tokenizer.word_index
vocab_size = len(word_index) + 1
max_len = max(len(seq) for seq in sequences)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=max_len, padding='post')

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, 128, input_length=max_len),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(128),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
model.fit(padded_sequences, sequences, epochs=100)


#Generation (requires more sophisticated handling for word-level) - Omitted for brevity
```

This example uses word embeddings, offering better generalization but requiring a tokenizer to map words to indices. Generation is more complex in the word-level case and is omitted here due to space constraints.


**Example 3:  A conceptual outline of a Transformer-based approach**

A transformer-based model would replace the LSTM layer in Example 2 with a transformer encoder-decoder structure.  The encoder processes the input sequence, and the decoder generates the output sequence using self-attention and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms.  The specifics would involve using `tf.keras.layers.TransformerEncoder` and `tf.keras.layers.TransformerDecoder` layers, along with positional encoding to account for the sequential nature of the data.  Detailed implementation is beyond the scope of this concise response, but the core principle remains the same: numerical encoding of strings, followed by a powerful sequence modeling architecture capable of learning complex relationships within the data.
