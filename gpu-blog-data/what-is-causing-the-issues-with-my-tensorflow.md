Batch normalization issues in TensorFlow often stem from a mismatch between the training and inference phases, a problem I've debugged countless times in my own deep learning projects, particularly in complex architectures involving recurrent layers. The core challenge arises from the way batch normalization layers accumulate statistics during training. These accumulated statistics – the moving mean and moving variance – are crucial for normalizing activations during inference. When these statistics are either incorrectly updated or not used appropriately, it results in performance degradation, often manifested as drastic drops in validation accuracy.

The batch normalization layer during training computes the mean and variance based on the current batch of input data. Simultaneously, it maintains exponential moving averages of these batch means and variances, referred to as the "moving mean" and "moving variance." These moving averages are not used for normalization during training; instead, they're updated using a decay parameter. Critically, these moving averages *are* used for normalization during inference (evaluation and deployment). The crux of the problem is ensuring that these moving averages are properly updated during training and correctly utilized during inference. Failure to properly handle these updates or switches often leads to the aforementioned issues. A common misconception is that batch normalization is always beneficial without careful consideration of how it operates. Incorrect usage manifests primarily in inconsistent outputs across training and inference as well as unstable training.

Several scenarios can contribute to these discrepancies. First, not properly setting the `training` argument in the layer can cause problems. TensorFlow's API requires explicitly stating when the layer is in training mode vs. inference. If you forget to toggle this parameter, especially during evaluation, the moving averages will be ignored, and the layer will continue calculating batch means and variances using mini-batches from validation or test sets. These batch statistics will likely differ significantly from the accumulated moving averages during training. This leads to outputs that are normalized differently during different phases, hence affecting predictions and performance. Second, using a small batch size during training can result in unreliable estimates of batch means and variances. The moving averages, based on these noisy estimates, will also be less stable, impairing the effectiveness of batch normalization. This instability is particularly prevalent in computationally limited environments with small batch processing. Third, errors often emerge during the loading process of trained models. If saved weights of a model are not loaded correctly with their associated batch normalization statistics, then inference won't operate as it was intended. This is particularly true when dealing with custom layers or saving mechanisms. Finally, not understanding how batch norm operates across distributed training strategies can cause inconsistencies. Synchronizing batch norms across different devices or machines requires special considerations. Let’s examine how to handle these issues through code examples.

**Example 1: Correct Usage of the `training` Argument**

Consider a scenario involving a convolutional neural network. The following code demonstrates how to correctly apply batch normalization in both the training and inference phases.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')
        self.bn1 = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
        self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

    def call(self, inputs, training=False): #Training argument correctly specified
        x = self.conv1(inputs)
        x = self.bn1(x, training=training) # Use training flag here as well
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.dense(x)
        return x

model = MyModel()

# Dummy data
inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(32, 28, 28, 3))

# Training phase
with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
    predictions = model(inputs, training=True) # training = True during train
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.keras.losses.sparse_categorical_crossentropy(tf.random.uniform(shape=(32,), maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32), predictions, from_logits=True))
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

# Inference phase
predictions = model(inputs, training=False) # training = False during evaluation
print(predictions)
```

Here, the `training` parameter is explicitly passed to the `BatchNormalization` layer within the `call` method. This ensures that during the training phase (`training=True`), the layer computes batch statistics and updates the moving averages. Conversely, during inference (`training=False`), the layer uses the accumulated moving averages for normalization, avoiding the discrepancies that I mentioned. The `training` parameter on the model `call` method, allows for the proper handling. It's essential to maintain this consistency across all layers within the model. Not doing so causes the common errors.

**Example 2: Impact of Small Batch Size**

This example demonstrates that using a large enough batch size is needed for reliable updates to moving average statistics:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def create_data(batch_size):
    return tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, 100))

def train_and_eval(batch_size, epochs = 10):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, use_bias = False), #Bias excluded to isolate normalization
        tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
    ])
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
    loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.MeanSquaredError()

    # Training Loop
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        inputs = create_data(batch_size)
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            outputs = model(inputs, training = True)
            loss = loss_fn(outputs, tf.zeros_like(outputs))
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    
    #Evaluation
    eval_inputs = create_data(10) #Evaluation batch
    eval_outputs = model(eval_inputs, training = False)

    return eval_outputs.numpy()

#Run with large batch size
large_batch_outputs = train_and_eval(128)
print(f"Outputs with large batch size (128):\n {large_batch_outputs[:2]}")
#Run with small batch size
small_batch_outputs = train_and_eval(4)
print(f"Outputs with small batch size (4):\n {small_batch_outputs[:2]}")
```

In this setup, we create a simple model consisting of a dense layer followed by a batch normalization layer. The `train_and_eval` function first trains the model for a fixed number of epochs using the provided batch size and then evaluates the model on a separate evaluation batch. When you run the code with a larger batch size (e.g., 128), the output activations after evaluation tend to converge to a smaller range, and exhibit more stability. The mean and variance of the batch are estimated on larger samples during training, which, in turn, results in more stable updates to the moving averages. On the contrary, with small batches (e.g., 4), these outputs are significantly more variable due to noisy estimates of mean and variance during training.

**Example 3: Correct Loading and Saving**

Consider a case where the batch normalization statistics must be correctly loaded after saving weights. Let’s use keras to accomplish this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate a random training dataset
def get_random_dataset(size, batch_size):
    x = np.random.rand(size, 28, 28, 3).astype(np.float32)
    y = np.random.randint(0, 10, size).astype(np.int32)
    return tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x, y)).batch(batch_size)

# Custom Model with Batch Normalization
class MyModel(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', padding='same')
        self.bn1 = tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization()
        self.flatten = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()
        self.dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)

    def call(self, inputs, training=False):
        x = self.conv1(inputs)
        x = self.bn1(x, training=training)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.dense(x)
        return x

model = MyModel()

# Training the model
train_dataset = get_random_dataset(1000, 32)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
epochs = 2
for epoch in range(epochs):
  for x_batch, y_batch in train_dataset:
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = model(x_batch, training = True)
        loss = loss_fn(y_batch, predictions)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

#Save the model using .save() method which preserves structure and weights
model.save('saved_model')

#Load the model
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('saved_model')

#Evaluation. Compare to a new, non-trained model.
eval_data = get_random_dataset(100, 32).take(1)
for x,y in eval_data:
    loaded_preds = loaded_model(x, training = False)
    fresh_model = MyModel()
    fresh_preds = fresh_model(x, training = False)

#Compare the loaded model outputs with the outputs of a new model.
print(f"Output of loaded model: {loaded_preds[0,:5]}")
print(f"Output of fresh (untrained) model: {fresh_preds[0,:5]}")
```

In this example, I first create, train, and save a model that contains batch norm layers. Crucially, when I load the model from disk using `tf.keras.models.load_model()`, I ensure that the loaded model retains not only the network structure, but also the trained weights and moving statistics from the batch norm layers. Evaluating a random input with the loaded model produces different output from the outputs from a freshly initialized model. In older TF versions, one has to use a custom saving/loading mechanism and correctly update batch norm moving statistics. The `save()` and `load_model()` methods handle these issues.

When debugging batch normalization problems, I usually begin by verifying that the `training` argument is correctly toggled between training and inference. Then I check the batch size being used and ensure it’s large enough to guarantee reliable updates to the moving averages. Finally, I thoroughly examine the loading process to verify that weights, including batch norm statistics, are loaded accurately.

For further exploration into batch normalization and its practical applications, I recommend consulting textbooks focused on deep learning and convolutional neural networks. Official TensorFlow documentation offers detailed guidance on usage. Papers on the original batch normalization algorithm and its variations are a valuable resource. Examining well-structured code repositories from established deep learning frameworks can also help understand best practices for implementing batch normalization. By paying close attention to these details, you can confidently leverage batch normalization for robust and efficient deep learning systems.
