The discrepancy in the `PATH` environment variable between SSH connections and `exec`/`attach` connections to a Docker container stems fundamentally from how each method inherits and manages the environment.  My experience troubleshooting this across numerous production and development environments, involving diverse containerization strategies and orchestration tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm, highlighted this critical difference.  SSH establishes a new shell session, effectively inheriting the host machine's `PATH`, while `exec` and `attach` directly integrate into the container's already defined environment, resulting in the container's `PATH` taking precedence. This distinction is often overlooked, leading to inconsistent behavior in scripts and applications deployed within the container.

**1. Explanation of the Underlying Mechanism:**

When you SSH into a host machine, you're creating a new shell process on that machine.  The shell initializes its environment variables, including `PATH`, based on the system's configuration files (e.g., `/etc/profile`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`).  Therefore, the `PATH` you observe within the SSH session reflects the host's system `PATH`.

In contrast, the `docker exec` and `docker attach` commands interact directly with the running container. They do not create a new shell process on the host; instead, they interface with the existing process within the container.  The container's `PATH` is defined during its build process, specifically within the Dockerfile.  This `PATH` is determined by the environment variables set during the `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD` instruction, or potentially through environment variables passed at runtime via `docker run`.  If no explicit `PATH` is specified, the container inherits a default `PATH` from the base image, often a minimal set of essential binaries.

This crucial difference in how the environment is inherited—a new shell session from the host versus direct access to the container's existing process—directly explains the variation in the `PATH` observed between these two connection methods.  The inconsistency manifests when scripts or programs within the container rely on specific executables located in directories not included in the container's `PATH`, but present in the host's `PATH`.

**2. Code Examples Illustrating the Difference:**

**Example 1:  Dockerfile with a customized PATH**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Customize the PATH environment variable
ENV PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin"

# Install a custom tool (for demonstration)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

COPY my_script.sh /usr/local/bin/

CMD ["/usr/local/bin/my_script.sh"]
```

`my_script.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "My PATH: $PATH"
curl -v https://www.example.com  # uses curl from customized path
```

In this example, the `PATH` is explicitly set within the Dockerfile.  `docker exec` and `docker attach` will show the customized `PATH`, while SSH into the host machine will show the host's `PATH`.


**Example 2:  Using docker run with -e flag to override PATH**

```bash
docker run -it -e PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH" ubuntu:latest bash
```

Here, we're launching an Ubuntu container and explicitly adding `/usr/local/bin` to the beginning of the inherited `PATH` using the `-e` flag.  This demonstrates overriding the default PATH within the container at runtime.  However, `docker exec` or `docker attach` into this container afterward will still exhibit this overridden `PATH`, contrasting with an SSH connection to the host.

**Example 3:  Demonstrating the Problem and its Solution**

Let's assume a scenario where the container needs to use a tool called `mytool`, located in `/opt/mytools/bin` which is in the host's `PATH`, but not in the container's.

* **Failing Approach:** A script inside the container tries to execute `mytool` without considering the `PATH` difference.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
mytool some_arguments
```

* **Successful Approach (modifying the container's `PATH`):** The container's Dockerfile or `docker run` command modifies the `PATH` to include `/opt/mytools/bin`.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
ENV PATH="/opt/mytools/bin:$PATH"
# ... rest of the Dockerfile
```

Alternatively, the script itself can be modified to specify the full path:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
/opt/mytools/bin/mytool some_arguments
```

This demonstrates a pragmatic solution, avoiding reliance on the host's environment variables.  This approach provides robustness and consistency across different connection methods.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

Consult the official Docker documentation for detailed explanations of the `docker run`, `docker exec`, and `docker attach` commands, paying close attention to environment variable handling.  Review the documentation for your chosen base images to understand their default `PATH` configurations.  Familiarize yourself with shell scripting and environment variable management best practices, including methods for explicitly setting and manipulating `PATH` within scripts.  Explore advanced containerization topics like building custom images and managing environment variables using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.  These resources provide comprehensive coverage of these important concepts.
