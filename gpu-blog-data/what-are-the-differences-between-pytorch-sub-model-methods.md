The core distinction between PyTorch sub-model methods hinges on their interaction with the computational graph and the degree of parameter sharing.  My experience working on large-scale natural language processing models, specifically those involving multi-task learning and transfer learning, has highlighted the nuanced differences between approaches like `nn.ModuleList`, `nn.Sequential`, and custom sub-model instantiation.  While seemingly interchangeable for simple architectures, their behavior diverges significantly when dealing with complex model configurations or gradient-based optimization strategies.

**1. Clear Explanation of PyTorch Sub-Model Methods:**

PyTorch offers several ways to create and manage sub-models within a larger neural network. The choice depends on whether you need independent parameter sets, sequential execution, or more complex relationships between components.  Improper selection can lead to unexpected training behavior, including incorrect gradient calculations or inefficient memory usage.

* **`nn.ModuleList`:** This container class maintains a list of `nn.Module` instances. Importantly, each module in the list possesses its own set of parameters, independent of the others.  This is crucial when you want separate parameter updates for different parts of your model.  For instance, in multi-task learning, each task might benefit from having its own dedicated sub-network.  The modules within `nn.ModuleList` are not implicitly connected in a sequential manner; you explicitly manage their interactions during the forward pass.

* **`nn.Sequential`:** This class provides a straightforward way to create a linear sequence of modules. The output of one module becomes the input of the next.  This is suitable for architectures with a clear, linear flow of information. The parameter sets of all modules within `nn.Sequential` are still separate, enabling independent optimization.  However, unlike `nn.ModuleList`, the forward pass is automatically handled by calling the `forward` method of the `nn.Sequential` instance, implicitly applying each module in the defined order.

* **Custom Sub-Model Instantiation:**  For more complex scenarios beyond linear sequences or independent modules, direct instantiation of `nn.Module` subclasses provides the greatest flexibility.  This enables intricate connections and information flow between modules, including conditional execution and the creation of non-linear or recursive structures.  This approach requires more manual coding but facilitates modeling of intricate architectural designs not easily expressed with `nn.ModuleList` or `nn.Sequential`.  Careful management of parameter sharing and forward pass logic is essential to avoid errors.  This often involves using techniques like `torch.nn.Parameter` to explicitly define trainable parameters within the custom module and employing conditional statements within the `forward` method to control data flow.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  `nn.ModuleList` for Multi-Task Learning:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MultiTaskNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dims):
        super(MultiTaskNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.shared_layer = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.task_layers = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(hidden_dim, dim) for dim in output_dims])

    def forward(self, x, task_index):
        x = torch.relu(self.shared_layer(x))
        return self.task_layers[task_index](x)

# Example usage:
input_dim = 10
hidden_dim = 5
output_dims = [2, 3, 1] # Three tasks with different output dimensions

model = MultiTaskNetwork(input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dims)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, input_dim)

# Forward pass for task 0
output_task0 = model(input_tensor, 0)
# Forward pass for task 1
output_task1 = model(input_tensor, 1)

print(f"Output for task 0: {output_task0.shape}")
print(f"Output for task 1: {output_task1.shape}")
```

This example demonstrates using `nn.ModuleList` to create separate linear layers for different tasks, sharing a common initial layer.  Each task's layer has its own parameters, enabling independent optimization tailored to its specific objective.

**Example 2: `nn.Sequential` for a Simple CNN:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleCNN, self).__init__()
        self.features = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2),
            nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        )
        self.classifier = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Linear(32 * 8 * 8, 128), # Assuming input image is 32x32
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 10)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.features(x)
        x = self.classifier(x)
        return x

# Example usage:
model = SimpleCNN()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 3, 32, 32)
output = model(input_tensor)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

Here, `nn.Sequential` simplifies the definition of a convolutional neural network. The convolutional and fully connected layers are arranged sequentially, leveraging the automatic forward pass execution of `nn.Sequential`.

**Example 3: Custom Sub-Model for Residual Connection:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, 3, padding=1)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, 3, padding=1)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)

    def forward(self, x):
        identity = x
        out = self.conv1(x)
        out = self.bn1(out)
        out = self.relu(out)
        out = self.conv2(out)
        out = self.bn2(out)
        out += identity # Residual connection
        out = self.relu(out)
        return out

# Example usage within a larger network:
class ResNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ResNet, self).__init__()
        self.block1 = ResidualBlock(3, 64)
        self.block2 = ResidualBlock(64, 128)
        # ... more blocks

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.block1(x)
        x = self.block2(x)
        # ... more blocks
        return x

```

This exemplifies a custom residual block, showcasing the flexibility afforded by direct `nn.Module` subclassing.  The residual connection, a key architectural component, requires manual implementation, highlighting the need for fine-grained control over module interactions not readily achievable with pre-defined containers.
