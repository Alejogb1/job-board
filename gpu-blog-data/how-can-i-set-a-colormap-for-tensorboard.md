Understanding how to control colormaps within TensorBoard when visualizing PyTorch tensors is crucial for effective analysis and interpretation, especially with image-like data or when examining distributions. TensorBoard, by default, often applies its own colormaps, which might not be optimal for specific data types or analytical goals. We need to explicitly configure how these numerical values are mapped to colors.

The key to controlling colormaps lies in the way we log data using `torch.utils.tensorboard.SummaryWriter`. While the writer itself doesn't directly expose colormap arguments during tensor logging, the solution involves two primary techniques. First, when dealing with images, we exploit the fact that TensorBoard interprets single-channel data as grayscale and automatically applies a heatmap, making the mapping implicit and not modifiable. Second, for other types of tensor data like histograms, scalars, or distributions, we leverage matplotlibâ€™s colormaps by explicitly transforming and logging the tensor as a three-channel RGB image. Effectively, we are generating a colored visualization by hand, giving us precise control over the color mapping.

Specifically, to map our single channel data to a colorized image, we will need to use `matplotlib` to perform the mapping before sending the image to Tensorboard.
The procedure is:
1. Import the relevant modules: `torch`, `matplotlib.cm`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `torch.utils.tensorboard`.
2.  Load or generate the tensors that need to be visualized.
3. Utilize a `matplotlib.cm` colormap function (e.g. `viridis`, `magma`, `jet`, etc) to map the tensor data to an RGB color.
4. Convert this output from the colormap to a `numpy` array, and then to a `torch` tensor.
5. Log this tensor using the SummaryWriter, so it appears as an image in Tensorboard.

I will now describe these techniques in detail and give three different code examples, illustrating typical scenarios and the application of colormaps.
In my experience, I encountered a situation when visualizing saliency maps for convolutional neural networks using TensorBoard. The default colormap washed out the low-activation regions, making it hard to discern where the network was focusing. I needed to explicitly use a colormap with a good perceptual range and a clear color gradient to get the information I needed to debug my model.

**Example 1: Applying a colormap to a grayscale image**

This example focuses on displaying a single-channel image (simulating a saliency map) with a `viridis` colormap.

```python
import torch
import matplotlib.cm as cm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
import numpy as np

writer = SummaryWriter("runs/colormap_example_1")

# Generate dummy data simulating a saliency map
dummy_saliency = torch.rand(1, 28, 28)

# Get matplotlib colormap
colormap = cm.get_cmap('viridis')

# Map the tensor values to color using matplotlib
image_np = (colormap(dummy_saliency.squeeze().numpy())[:,:,:3] * 255).astype(np.uint8)

# convert to pytorch tensor and bring channels first
image_tensor = torch.from_numpy(image_np).permute(2, 0, 1).float()/255.0


writer.add_image("Saliency_Map_viridis", image_tensor, 0)
writer.close()
```

In this first example:
1. A random tensor of shape `(1, 28, 28)` simulates a grayscale image or saliency map.
2. `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap('viridis')` retrieves the `viridis` colormap, a commonly used and perceptually uniform color scheme.
3. We take our single channel tensor, make it a `numpy` array and squeeze the channel dimension to be two dimensional `(28, 28)`.
4. The colormap is applied using the `colormap(data)` call, where `data` is our squeezed 2D `numpy` array. This outputs an RGBA array, we select just the RGB data `[:,:,:3]`. We also multiply by 255 and convert to an `uint8` data type to fit within an 8bit pixel range.
5. The `numpy` array is converted back into a `torch` tensor. We transpose to place the channels first `(C, H, W)` and normalize by dividing by 255 to get a range between 0 and 1.
6. Finally, the processed image is added to TensorBoard via `add_image`, which will display the colorized image instead of a grayscale one when viewed in TensorBoard.

**Example 2: Using a custom colormap for distribution analysis**

This scenario focuses on visualizing a tensor representing a distribution, where a custom colormap is useful for highlighting data ranges. Here, I'm using a custom sequential colormap for clarity.

```python
import torch
import matplotlib.cm as cm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
import numpy as np

writer = SummaryWriter("runs/colormap_example_2")

# Generate a distribution
distribution = torch.randn(100, 100)

# Make a custom colormap
cmap = cm.get_cmap('coolwarm')

# Map the tensor values to color using matplotlib
image_np = (cmap(distribution.numpy())[:,:,:3] * 255).astype(np.uint8)

# convert to pytorch tensor and bring channels first
image_tensor = torch.from_numpy(image_np).permute(2, 0, 1).float()/255.0

writer.add_image("Distribution_Custom_Colormap", image_tensor, 0)
writer.close()
```
In the second example, I'm visualizing a 2D distribution using a `coolwarm` colormap. The process is similar to Example 1:
1. A random tensor with dimensions `(100, 100)` is created, representing data that needs to be visualized.
2.  The `coolwarm` colormap is chosen. This provides a diverging colormap, great for displaying distributions.
3.  The same procedure as in example one is followed to create the 3 channel RGB array from the distribution array by applying the `coolwarm` colormap.
4.  Finally, the generated RGB `torch` tensor is logged using `add_image` to tensorboard.

**Example 3: Visualizing a heatmap of scalar values**
This scenario focuses on scalar values, where you might want a gradient, similar to a heatmap. I'm using a custom `jet` colormap for a more 'classic' heatmap look.

```python
import torch
import matplotlib.cm as cm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
import numpy as np

writer = SummaryWriter("runs/colormap_example_3")

# Generate data representing scalar values
scalars = torch.randn(1, 100) # or any shape 1,N

# Make a custom colormap
cmap = cm.get_cmap('jet')

# Create a 2d tensor for use with the colormap
scalars_2d = scalars.reshape(-1, 1) * torch.ones(1,100)

# Map the tensor values to color using matplotlib
image_np = (cmap(scalars_2d.numpy())[:,:,:3] * 255).astype(np.uint8)

# convert to pytorch tensor and bring channels first
image_tensor = torch.from_numpy(image_np).permute(2, 0, 1).float()/255.0

writer.add_image("Scalars_Heatmap", image_tensor, 0)
writer.close()
```

In Example 3:
1. A random tensor with dimensions `(1, 100)` is created, representing scalar values that need to be visualized as a gradient.
2.  The `jet` colormap is chosen, which creates a more traditional heatmap look.
3. The single row tensor of scalar data is turned into a 2D tensor so it can be rendered using the colormap. This is done by multiplying our single row by a matrix of ones.
4.  The same procedure as in the previous examples is followed to create the 3 channel RGB array from the scalars by applying the `jet` colormap.
5.  Finally, the generated RGB `torch` tensor is logged using `add_image` to tensorboard.

In all examples, the key takeaway is the need to use `matplotlib.cm` to handle the mapping from a tensor value to a color, and then to convert the result to an RGB image that can be displayed by TensorBoard. This method gives precise control over the color scheme.

**Resource Recommendations**
For a more comprehensive understanding of colormaps and their applications, consult the following resources:

*   The matplotlib documentation provides detailed explanations of colormap options and customization. Specifically, review the `matplotlib.cm` section and its examples.
*   For a theoretical background, research the concepts of perceptual uniformity in colormaps, especially if you're dealing with data that requires careful interpretation of gradients. This will help in selecting the correct color map for a given situation. There are online resources detailing best practices for scientific visualizations.
*   Consider scientific visualization libraries and tools that often include more advanced colormap options and related techniques.

By combining these resources and the examples provided, you can effectively control colormaps within TensorBoard to get the most out of your visualizations. Remember that choosing the correct colormap can significantly affect how the data is interpreted, so carefully consider what is most appropriate for your specific analysis.
