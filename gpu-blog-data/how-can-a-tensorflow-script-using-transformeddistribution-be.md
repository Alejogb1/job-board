TensorFlow's `TransformedDistribution` offers a powerful way to construct complex probability distributions from simpler base distributions through a series of transformations.  Directly translating this functionality to PyTorch requires understanding the underlying mechanics and leveraging PyTorch's equivalent tools, primarily `torch.distributions`.  My experience porting numerous Bayesian models across these frameworks highlights the importance of focusing on the transformation sequence rather than a one-to-one mapping of class names.


**1. Understanding the Transformation Sequence:**

The core concept behind `TransformedDistribution` is the sequential application of transformations to a base distribution.  This sequence defines the final, often intricate, probability distribution.  In TensorFlow, this is explicitly represented by the transformation chain. PyTorch's approach is more implicit; it requires reconstructing the equivalent transformation sequence using individual transformation classes within `torch.distributions.transforms`. This involves identifying each transformation in the TensorFlow script (e.g., `tfp.distributions.AffineScalarTransform`, `tfp.distributions.ExpTransform`) and finding their corresponding PyTorch equivalents (e.g., `torch.distributions.transforms.AffineTransform`, `torch.distributions.transforms.ExpTransform`).

Crucially, understanding the order of these transformations is paramount.  The transformations are applied sequentially, and a change in order alters the resulting distribution.  Thorough examination of the TensorFlow code's transformation sequence is the initial, and often most challenging, step.



**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

Let's illustrate the conversion process with three examples, increasing in complexity:


**Example 1: Simple Affine Transformation**

This example demonstrates converting a TensorFlow `TransformedDistribution` with a single affine transformation to its PyTorch counterpart.

```python
# TensorFlow Code
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
import tensorflow as tf

loc = tf.constant(0.0)
scale = tf.constant(1.0)
normal = tfp.distributions.Normal(loc=loc, scale=scale)
affine_transform = tfp.distributions.AffineScalarTransform(scale=2.0, shift=1.0)
transformed_normal = tfp.distributions.TransformedDistribution(normal, affine_transform)

# PyTorch Code
import torch
import torch.distributions as dist

loc = torch.tensor(0.0)
scale = torch.tensor(1.0)
normal = dist.Normal(loc=loc, scale=scale)
affine_transform = dist.transforms.AffineTransform(loc=1.0, scale=2.0) # Note order
transformed_normal = dist.TransformedDistribution(normal, affine_transform)

# Verification (Sampling for comparison)
tf_samples = transformed_normal.sample(1000).numpy()
pt_samples = transformed_normal.sample((1000)).numpy()

# Compare the samples (e.g., using statistical tests)
```

**Commentary:** The key difference lies in the `AffineTransform` initialization. In TensorFlow, the constructor arguments are `scale` and `shift`, whereas PyTorch uses `loc` (shift) and `scale`.  Careful attention to argument order and names is essential for correct transformation application.  The sampling and subsequent comparison helps validate the conversionâ€™s accuracy.


**Example 2:  Composition of Transformations**

This example builds on the previous one by adding an exponential transformation.

```python
# TensorFlow Code
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
import tensorflow as tf

loc = tf.constant(0.0)
scale = tf.constant(1.0)
normal = tfp.distributions.Normal(loc=loc, scale=scale)
affine_transform = tfp.distributions.AffineScalarTransform(scale=2.0, shift=1.0)
exp_transform = tfp.distributions.ExpTransform()
transformed_normal = tfp.distributions.TransformedDistribution(normal, [affine_transform, exp_transform])


# PyTorch Code
import torch
import torch.distributions as dist

loc = torch.tensor(0.0)
scale = torch.tensor(1.0)
normal = dist.Normal(loc=loc, scale=scale)
affine_transform = dist.transforms.AffineTransform(loc=1.0, scale=2.0)
exp_transform = dist.transforms.ExpTransform()
transformed_normal = dist.TransformedDistribution(normal, dist.transforms.ComposeTransform([affine_transform, exp_transform]))

#Verification (Sampling for comparison)
tf_samples = transformed_normal.sample(1000).numpy()
pt_samples = transformed_normal.sample((1000)).numpy()
```

**Commentary:** Here, we introduce `tfp.distributions.ExpTransform` and its PyTorch equivalent `dist.transforms.ExpTransform`.  Notice the use of `dist.transforms.ComposeTransform` in PyTorch to explicitly define the sequence of transformations. This is crucial for handling multiple transformations. The order of transformations within `ComposeTransform` must strictly match the TensorFlow original.


**Example 3:  Custom Transformation**

This example showcases how to handle a custom transformation, which might be a more complex scenario encountered during real-world model porting.

```python
# TensorFlow Code
import tensorflow_probability as tfp
import tensorflow as tf

class MyTransform(tfp.distributions.bijectors.Bijector):
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        super().__init__(forward_min_event_ndims=0, validate_args=True, name="my_transform")
        self.a = a
        self.b = b

    def _forward(self, x):
        return self.a * tf.math.log(x) + self.b

    def _inverse(self, y):
        return tf.exp((y - self.b) / self.a)

    def _forward_log_det_jacobian(self, x):
        return -tf.math.log(x) - tf.math.log(self.a)


# PyTorch Code
import torch
import torch.distributions as dist

class MyTransform(dist.Transform):
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        super().__init__(cache_size=1)
        self.a = a
        self.b = b

    def _call(self, x):
        return self.a * torch.log(x) + self.b

    def _inverse(self, y):
        return torch.exp((y - self.b) / self.a)

    def log_abs_det_jacobian(self, x, y):
        return -torch.log(x) - torch.log(self.a)


# ... rest of the code remains similar to Example 2, using the custom transform ...
```

**Commentary:** This demonstrates building a custom transformation.  Both TensorFlow and PyTorch examples define the `forward`, `inverse`, and Jacobian functions, albeit with slightly different naming conventions.  The `cache_size` parameter in PyTorch's `__init__` optimizes repeated calls to the transformation for improved performance.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official documentation for TensorFlow Probability and PyTorch's `torch.distributions` are invaluable resources.  Referencing the API documentation for each transformation class ensures correct usage and parameter mapping. Consulting published papers and code examples of Bayesian models implemented in both frameworks can provide insightful comparisons and conversion strategies.  Working through tutorials focusing on probability distributions and transformations in both frameworks solidifies the understanding of core concepts.  Beyond these, exploring textbooks and online courses specializing in probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference is highly recommended.
