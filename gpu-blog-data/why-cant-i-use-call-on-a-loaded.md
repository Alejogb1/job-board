The inability to directly use `call()` on a loaded Keras model after incorporating custom objects stems from the serialization limitations of the Keras `save_model` function, specifically regarding the handling of custom classes and their associated attributes.  My experience debugging similar issues in large-scale model deployments for image recognition highlighted this critical point.  The standard serialization process doesn't inherently know how to reconstruct these custom components, leading to a mismatch between the saved model's structure and the runtime environment.  This discrepancy manifests as an error when attempting to use the `call()` method, as the model lacks the necessary contextual information to execute its forward pass.  This isn't an issue with `call()` itself, but rather a problem with the model's reconstruction during the loading process.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The `call()` method in a Keras model defines the forward pass, outlining how input data is processed through layers to produce the output.  When you save a model using `save_model`, Keras attempts to serialize its architecture and weights.  However, if your model uses custom layers, activation functions, or loss functions defined as classes outside the standard Keras library, their definitions aren't automatically included in the saved file (typically an HDF5 file).  During loading with `load_model`, Keras reconstructs the model's architecture based on the saved data.  Since the custom class definitions are missing, the loaded model has placeholders instead of the actual custom object instances.  Calling `call()` then fails because these placeholder objects lack the methods and attributes necessary for the forward pass to execute correctly. The interpreter simply doesn't know how to handle these unknown classes.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Custom Layer Failure**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(units,), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    MyCustomLayer(32),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.save('custom_layer_model.h5')

loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('custom_layer_model.h5', custom_objects={'MyCustomLayer': MyCustomLayer})

#This will work because we provide the custom object during loading.
loaded_model.call(tf.random.normal((1,10)))

# If we attempt without providing custom objects:
# loaded_model_incorrect = keras.models.load_model('custom_layer_model.h5')
# loaded_model_incorrect.call(tf.random.normal((1,10)))  # This will raise an error.
```

**Commentary:** This example demonstrates the crucial role of the `custom_objects` argument in `load_model`.  By specifying `{'MyCustomLayer': MyCustomLayer}`, we explicitly map the placeholder in the loaded model to the actual definition of our custom layer.  Without this mapping, the `call()` method will fail.


**Example 2: Custom Activation Function Failure**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

def my_activation(x):
    return tf.nn.relu(x) + tf.sin(x)

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation=my_activation)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.save('custom_activation_model.h5')

#Failure Case:
#loaded_model_fail = keras.models.load_model('custom_activation_model.h5')
#loaded_model_fail.call(tf.random.normal((1,10)))

#Success Case:
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('custom_activation_model.h5', custom_objects={'my_activation': my_activation})
loaded_model.call(tf.random.normal((1,10)))
```

**Commentary:** This example highlights that even simple custom functions, not classes, require explicit registration during model loading.  The `custom_objects` dictionary must correctly map the name used in the model's definition (`my_activation`) to the function itself.  Failure to do so results in a runtime error when `call()` is invoked.



**Example 3:  Custom Loss Function Failure**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

class MyCustomLoss(keras.losses.Loss):
    def call(self, y_true, y_pred):
        return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_true - y_pred)) + tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(y_true - y_pred))

model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=MyCustomLoss())
model.save('custom_loss_model.h5')

# Failure case:
#loaded_model_fail = keras.models.load_model('custom_loss_model.h5')
#loaded_model_fail.call(tf.random.normal((1,10))) # This will still work since call is in the model but evaluating the loss would fail

#Success Case:
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('custom_loss_model.h5', custom_objects={'MyCustomLoss': MyCustomLoss})
loaded_model.call(tf.random.normal((1,10)))
```

**Commentary:**  This example shows that custom loss functions, defined as classes, also need to be registered within `custom_objects`.  While the `call` method on the model might still work without this, attempting to use the model for training or evaluation would fail as Keras wouldn't be able to correctly compute the loss.



**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation on Keras model saving and loading.  A comprehensive textbook on deep learning covering model persistence techniques.  Relevant Stack Overflow threads and community forums discussing custom object handling in Keras.  Consult the documentation for your specific Keras version as the handling of custom objects might have minor variations across releases.
