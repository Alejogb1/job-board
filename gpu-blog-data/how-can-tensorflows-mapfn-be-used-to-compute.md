TensorFlow's `tf.map_fn`, while versatile, doesn’t natively handle pairwise computations between two tensors without further manipulation. It operates element-wise across a single tensor's first dimension. Achieving a pairwise calculation, often needed for similarity matrices or interaction terms, necessitates a strategic expansion of the input tensors before invoking `map_fn`. My prior experience developing recommendation systems and custom loss functions has repeatedly highlighted this specific need and guided the following methods.

The fundamental challenge is transforming two tensors, typically of shapes `(A, D)` and `(B, D)`, into a suitable format for `tf.map_fn`. The target is an operation that calculates some function `f` for all combinations of rows between these two tensors, producing a resulting tensor of shape `(A, B)`. This contrasts with `tf.map_fn`'s inherent processing of a sequence of individual elements. I commonly address this through tensor expansion and reshaping.

A common pattern involves expanding both input tensors. If we have `tensor_A` of shape `(A, D)` and `tensor_B` of shape `(B, D)`, first, `tensor_A` is expanded to shape `(A, 1, D)`, and `tensor_B` to shape `(1, B, D)`. Subsequent broadcasting enables pairwise operations via a vectorized function passed to map_fn after reshaping.

Here’s an example to illustrate the procedure:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def pairwise_computation_example(tensor_a, tensor_b, operation):
    """
    Computes an operation on all pairwise combinations of two tensors using tf.map_fn.

    Args:
        tensor_a: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (A, D).
        tensor_b: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (B, D).
        operation: A function that takes two tensors of shape (D,) as input and
        returns a scalar tensor.

    Returns:
        A TensorFlow tensor of shape (A, B), where each element is the result of
        the operation on the corresponding pairwise combination.
    """
    A = tf.shape(tensor_a)[0]
    B = tf.shape(tensor_b)[0]
    D = tf.shape(tensor_a)[1] # Assumes both tensors have same dimensionality D

    # Reshape for broadcasting
    tensor_a_expanded = tf.reshape(tensor_a, (A, 1, D))
    tensor_b_expanded = tf.reshape(tensor_b, (1, B, D))

    # Create a tensor of all combinations
    combinations = tf.concat([
        tf.broadcast_to(tensor_a_expanded, (A, B, D)) , 
        tf.broadcast_to(tensor_b_expanded, (A, B, D))
        ], axis=2) # Shape (A,B,2*D)

    # Reshape for map_fn processing
    reshaped_combinations = tf.reshape(combinations, (A*B, 2*D))

    # Apply the operation on each combination using map_fn
    results_flat = tf.map_fn(
        lambda combo: operation(combo[:D], combo[D:]),
        reshaped_combinations,
        fn_output_signature=tf.float32
    )

    # Reshape to desired output shape
    pairwise_results = tf.reshape(results_flat, (A, B))

    return pairwise_results

# Example Usage
tensor_a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
tensor_b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0], [9.0, 10.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

def dot_product(vec_1, vec_2):
    return tf.reduce_sum(tf.multiply(vec_1, vec_2))

pairwise_results = pairwise_computation_example(tensor_a, tensor_b, dot_product)
print(pairwise_results)
```
In the code above, `tensor_a` and `tensor_b` are reshaped to facilitate broadcasting of all possible combinations during the `tf.concat` step. The concatenated result, `combinations`, is then reshaped for consumption by `tf.map_fn`.  The `operation` is a user-defined function taking two D-dimensional vectors. Finally, the result of `tf.map_fn` is reshaped back into a matrix of `(A, B)` for the final output. `fn_output_signature` is crucial to tell `tf.map_fn` the output type, improving runtime performance.

A different approach avoids concatenation by directly applying a function using a nested structure of `tf.map_fn` calls:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def pairwise_computation_nested_map(tensor_a, tensor_b, operation):
  """
  Computes an operation on all pairwise combinations of two tensors using nested tf.map_fn.

  Args:
      tensor_a: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (A, D).
      tensor_b: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (B, D).
      operation: A function that takes two tensors of shape (D,) as input and
      returns a scalar tensor.

  Returns:
      A TensorFlow tensor of shape (A, B), where each element is the result of
      the operation on the corresponding pairwise combination.
  """
  A = tf.shape(tensor_a)[0]
  B = tf.shape(tensor_b)[0]

  pairwise_results = tf.map_fn(
      lambda vec_a: tf.map_fn(
        lambda vec_b: operation(vec_a, vec_b),
          tensor_b,
          fn_output_signature=tf.float32
      ),
      tensor_a,
      fn_output_signature=tf.float32
  )

  return pairwise_results

# Example Usage
tensor_a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
tensor_b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0], [9.0, 10.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

def euclidean_distance(vec_1, vec_2):
    return tf.sqrt(tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(vec_1 - vec_2)))

pairwise_results = pairwise_computation_nested_map(tensor_a, tensor_b, euclidean_distance)
print(pairwise_results)
```
This second method uses nested `tf.map_fn` calls. The outer `tf.map_fn` iterates over the rows of `tensor_a`. The inner `tf.map_fn`, within each outer loop iteration, iterates over `tensor_b`’s rows and applies the `operation`, thereby producing pairwise combinations. This approach may be less performant in scenarios where `A` is significantly smaller than `B` due to the overhead of function calls. In my experience, this method is easier to conceptualize, as it directly expresses the required nested iteration.  `fn_output_signature` usage again optimizes performance by declaring return types for each map operation.

A third alternative leverages `tf.einsum`, a more concise method for tensor operations. While not directly using `tf.map_fn`, it provides a different mechanism for expressing pairwise computations:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def pairwise_computation_einsum(tensor_a, tensor_b, operation_str):
    """
     Computes an operation on all pairwise combinations of two tensors using tf.einsum.

    Args:
        tensor_a: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (A, D).
        tensor_b: A TensorFlow tensor of shape (B, D).
        operation_str: A string specifying the einsum operation to perform on the two tensors
    Returns:
        A TensorFlow tensor of shape (A, B) resulting from the pairwise operations

    """
    pairwise_results = tf.einsum(operation_str, tensor_a, tensor_b)
    return pairwise_results

# Example usage
tensor_a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
tensor_b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0], [9.0, 10.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
# To achieve dot product equivalent, we use einsum('ij,kj->ik') where i is A, j is D, k is B
dot_product_results = pairwise_computation_einsum(tensor_a, tensor_b, 'ij,kj->ik')
print(dot_product_results)

tensor_a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]], dtype=tf.float32)
tensor_b = tf.constant([[7.0, 8.0, 9.0], [10.0, 11.0, 12.0], [13.0, 14.0, 15.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# To achieve element-wise subtraction and sum we use einsum('ij,kj->ik')
elementwise_difference_results= pairwise_computation_einsum(tensor_a, tensor_b, 'ij,kj->ik')
print(elementwise_difference_results)

```
`tf.einsum` uses a string notation to describe how tensors should be multiplied and summed. In the example, `'ij,kj->ik'` specifies that the rows of `tensor_a` and `tensor_b` are multiplied element-wise and summed, resulting in a matrix product. While not directly using `tf.map_fn`, it accomplishes the goal of pairwise computation.  The function takes the einsum operation as a string for flexibility and returns the resulting matrix of pairwise interactions. The second example shows that this method can implement more complex interactions than dot-product. In practice I find this method more efficient for dot products and related operations when `operation` is a matrix multiplication.

For further learning and best practices related to these methods, I recommend exploring resources on TensorFlow performance optimization, broadcasting semantics, and the application of map functions in numerical computation. Additionally, resources detailing the various capabilities and string notation of `tf.einsum` will also be helpful. Publications and online courses that focus on TensorFlow internals often provide a deeper understanding of how these operations are executed at lower levels, which can influence decisions when optimizing complex operations. Textbooks on linear algebra and tensor calculus frequently detail the mathematical foundations of operations which translate directly to the TensorFlow implementations.
