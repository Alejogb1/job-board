The crucial aspect concerning `retain_grad()` in PyTorch lies not solely in its presence but in its precise placement within the computation graph.  Its effect is fundamentally tied to the automatic differentiation mechanism PyTorch employs, specifically its reliance on the reverse-mode accumulation of gradients during backpropagation.  My experience debugging complex neural network architectures, particularly recurrent models and those involving custom autograd functions, has highlighted the subtle but significant impact of this function's position.  Misplacement can lead to incorrect gradient calculations, silently propagating errors that manifest as unexpectedly poor model performance or complete training failures.

The `retain_grad()` function prevents PyTorch from releasing the gradient buffers of a tensor after a backward pass.  By default, PyTorch releases these buffers to conserve memory, as gradients are typically only needed for a single step of backpropagation.  However, in certain scenarios, specifically when a tensor's gradient is required multiple times, for example, in higher-order gradient calculations or in custom loss functions involving intermediate tensor gradients, `retain_grad()` becomes essential.  Failing to use it correctly leads to `RuntimeError` exceptions related to accessing freed memory.

**1.  Clear Explanation:**

PyTorch's automatic differentiation operates by constructing a computational graph representing the forward pass. During the backward pass, gradients are computed recursively, starting from the loss function and traversing back through this graph.  Each tensor in the graph has an associated gradient buffer, storing the accumulated gradient.  When backpropagation reaches a node (tensor), the gradient is calculated and added to its buffer. After the backward pass completes, PyTorch, by default, releases the gradient buffers, freeing memory.

`retain_grad()` explicitly instructs PyTorch to *not* release the gradient buffer of the specified tensor. This is vital when the same tensor is part of multiple computational branches contributing to the final loss.  Without `retain_grad()`, the gradient from the first branch would overwrite any subsequent contributions, leading to an inaccurate gradient.

The position of `retain_grad()` directly determines which gradients are retained.  If placed *before* a computation where the tensor's gradient is needed, the gradient will be preserved. If placed *after*, the gradient will be released *before* it can be used, causing errors.  Furthermore, the placement affects the order in which gradients are accumulated, potentially influencing the final gradient values in scenarios with complex dependencies within the computation graph.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Correct Usage**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
y.retain_grad() # Retain gradient of y before further computation
z = y + 3
loss = z.mean()
loss.backward()

print(y.grad)  # Gradient of y is correctly computed and available
```

In this example, `retain_grad()` on `y` ensures the gradient is retained *before* the calculation of `z` and the subsequent backpropagation.  This allows us to access `y.grad` after the `backward()` pass.  Removing `y.retain_grad()` would result in an error because `y`'s gradient buffer would be deallocated.


**Example 2: Incorrect Usage (leading to error)**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(10, requires_grad=True)
y = x * 2
z = y + 3
y.retain_grad() # Retain gradient AFTER computation
loss = z.mean()
loss.backward()

print(y.grad)  # Raises a RuntimeError: Trying to access freed memory
```

Here, `retain_grad()` is called *after* `z` has already been calculated.  By the time `backward()` is called, the gradient buffer for `y` has been released, resulting in a `RuntimeError`.


**Example 3: Demonstrating Gradient Accumulation (Higher-Order Gradients)**

```python
import torch

x = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True)
y = x**2
y.retain_grad()
z = y**2
loss = z
loss.backward()
print("First backprop:", y.grad)
y.grad.zero_() # Clear gradients to demonstrate separate accumulation
loss.backward()
print("Second backprop:", y.grad)

```

This example demonstrates the accumulation of gradients across multiple backpropagation calls.  `retain_grad()` allows us to observe the different gradient values calculated in each backward pass, accumulating information for advanced optimization methods or higher-order gradient calculation.  Without `retain_grad()`, the second `loss.backward()` would fail due to the deallocation of `y`'s gradient buffer after the first backward pass.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official PyTorch documentation is the primary resource.  Consult the sections on automatic differentiation and the `torch.autograd` module.  Furthermore, a comprehensive textbook on deep learning that covers automatic differentiation and backpropagation in detail would provide a strong foundation. Finally, reviewing relevant research papers focusing on higher-order optimization or custom autograd function implementation would provide valuable insights for advanced uses of `retain_grad()`.  Careful consideration of memory management best practices within PyTorch is also crucial.  Proper understanding of the computation graph structure and gradient flow is paramount in applying `retain_grad()` effectively.
