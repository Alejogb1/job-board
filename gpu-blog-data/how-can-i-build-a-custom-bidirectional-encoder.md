Building a custom bidirectional encoder for a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model in TensorFlow 2 necessitates a deep understanding of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their bidirectional variants, particularly within the TensorFlow framework.  My experience optimizing speech recognition models has highlighted the crucial role of efficient bidirectional encoders in capturing contextual information from both forward and backward sequences.  Failing to properly implement bidirectional encoding can lead to significant performance degradation, especially in tasks demanding nuanced understanding of temporal dependencies.

The core principle lies in processing the input sequence in both directions simultaneously, then concatenating or averaging the resulting hidden states.  This allows the encoder to incorporate both preceding and succeeding contextual information at each timestep.  A naive approach might simply use two separate unidirectional RNNs, but more sophisticated techniques leverage TensorFlow's built-in capabilities for improved efficiency and performance.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Constructing a custom bidirectional encoder typically involves choosing an RNN cell type (LSTM or GRU are common choices), stacking multiple layers for enhanced representational power, and managing the output appropriately for subsequent decoder input.  The process begins by defining the RNN cell(s).  For example, two LSTM layers could be stacked for a bidirectional LSTM network. Then, the bidirectional wrapper provided by TensorFlow is utilized, which handles the concurrent forward and backward pass implicitly.  The output of the bidirectional wrapper, which contains both forward and backward hidden states for each timestep, must then be handled. Common strategies include concatenation, where the forward and backward hidden states are concatenated to produce a doubled-sized hidden state, or averaging, where the two hidden states are averaged to create a single hidden state.  The choice between concatenation and averaging depends on the specific application and often requires experimental validation.  Finally, this processed output feeds into the decoder.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Simple Bidirectional LSTM Encoder:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def bidirectional_lstm_encoder(input_sequence, units):
    """
    Builds a simple bidirectional LSTM encoder.

    Args:
        input_sequence: Input sequence tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim).
        units: Number of LSTM units.

    Returns:
        Output tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, 2 * units).
    """
    lstm_layer = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=True, return_state=False)  #Single layer LSTM
    bidirectional_lstm = tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(lstm_layer)
    output = bidirectional_lstm(input_sequence)
    return output

# Example usage:
input_sequence = tf.random.normal((32, 10, 50))  # Batch size 32, sequence length 10, embedding dim 50
encoder_output = bidirectional_lstm_encoder(input_sequence, 64)  # 64 LSTM units
print(encoder_output.shape)  # Output shape: (32, 10, 128)
```

This example demonstrates a straightforward bidirectional LSTM encoder with a single layer.  The `return_sequences=True` argument ensures that the output is a sequence of hidden states, and `return_state=False` prevents the return of cell and hidden states, simplifying the example. The output shape is (batch_size, sequence_length, 2 * units) because of the concatenation of forward and backward hidden states.

**Example 2: Multi-layered Bidirectional GRU Encoder with Averaging:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def multi_layer_bidirectional_gru_encoder(input_sequence, units, num_layers):
    """
    Builds a multi-layered bidirectional GRU encoder with averaging.

    Args:
        input_sequence: Input sequence tensor.
        units: Number of GRU units per layer.
        num_layers: Number of GRU layers.

    Returns:
        Output tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, units).
    """
    gru_layers = [tf.keras.layers.GRU(units, return_sequences=True, return_state=False) for _ in range(num_layers)]
    bidirectional_gru = tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(tf.keras.Sequential(gru_layers))
    forward_output, backward_output = tf.split(bidirectional_gru(input_sequence), num_or_size_splits=2, axis=-1)
    output = tf.math.add(forward_output,backward_output) /2.0
    return output

# Example usage
input_sequence = tf.random.normal((32, 10, 50))
encoder_output = multi_layer_bidirectional_gru_encoder(input_sequence, 64, 2) #2 layers, 64 units per layer
print(encoder_output.shape) # Output shape: (32, 10, 64)
```

This example showcases a multi-layered bidirectional GRU encoder. The output is averaged to create a single hidden state vector.  The use of `tf.keras.Sequential` allows for easy stacking of multiple GRU layers.  Note the averaging step, which reduces the output dimensionality compared to concatenation.

**Example 3:  Bidirectional Encoder with Attention Mechanism:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class BahdanauAttention(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units):
        super(BahdanauAttention, self).__init__()
        self.W1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)
        self.W2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(units)
        self.V = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)

    def call(self, query, values):
        # query hidden state shape == (batch_size, hidden size)
        # query_with_time_axis shape == (batch_size, 1, hidden size)
        # values shape == (batch_size, max_len, hidden size)
        # we are doing this to perform addition to calculate the score.
        query_with_time_axis = tf.expand_dims(query, 1)
        # score shape == (batch_size, max_length, 1)
        # we get 1 at the last axis because we are applying score to self.V
        score = self.V(tf.nn.tanh(
            self.W1(query_with_time_axis) + self.W2(values)))
        # attention_weights shape == (batch_size, max_length, 1)
        attention_weights = tf.nn.softmax(score, axis=1)
        # context_vector shape after sum == (batch_size, hidden_size)
        context_vector = attention_weights * values
        context_vector = tf.reduce_sum(context_vector, axis=1)
        return context_vector, attention_weights


def bidirectional_encoder_with_attention(input_sequence, units):
  """
  Builds a bidirectional encoder with an attention mechanism.

  Args:
    input_sequence: Input sequence tensor.
    units: Number of LSTM units.

  Returns:
    context vector of shape (batch_size, units).
  """
  encoder_lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(units, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
  bidirectional_lstm = tf.keras.layers.Bidirectional(encoder_lstm)
  output, forward_h, forward_c, backward_h, backward_c = bidirectional_lstm(input_sequence)
  # Concatenate forward and backward hidden states.  Could be averaged.
  state = tf.concat([forward_h, backward_h], axis=-1)
  attention_layer = BahdanauAttention(units)
  context_vector, attention_weights = attention_layer(state, output)
  return context_vector, attention_weights

# Example usage:
input_sequence = tf.random.normal((32, 10, 50))
context_vector, attention_weights = bidirectional_encoder_with_attention(input_sequence, 64)
print(context_vector.shape) # Output shape: (32, 128)
```

This advanced example incorporates an attention mechanism (Bahdanau attention), allowing the decoder to focus on specific parts of the input sequence.  The attention mechanism weights the hidden states from the bidirectional LSTM, producing a context vector that summarizes the most relevant information.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding, I would recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation,  research papers on seq2seq models and attention mechanisms, and textbooks covering advanced deep learning topics.  Specific attention should be given to the various RNN cell types and their properties. Thoroughly understanding backpropagation through time and gradient clipping techniques is also beneficial.  Finally, reviewing examples and tutorials focusing on sequence modeling in TensorFlow will reinforce the concepts.
