Window resize jitter in a wgpu-rs application, manifested as inconsistent or delayed frame rendering during window resizing, stems primarily from the asynchronous nature of window events and the GPU's rendering pipeline.  My experience working on a high-performance visualization tool using wgpu-rs highlighted this issue acutely.  Effective mitigation requires careful synchronization between the windowing system (winit) and the rendering loop, ensuring that the swap chain is appropriately recreated and the rendering logic adapts to the new window dimensions before attempting to render.  Failure to do so results in dropped frames, visual artifacts, and an overall negative user experience.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

The core problem lies in the timing mismatch.  `winit` emits `Event::WindowEvent::Resized` events asynchronously.  The main thread, which manages the wgpu-rs rendering loop, may not immediately receive this event, leading to attempts to render to a swap chain with outdated dimensions. This results in errors, often silently handled, but leading to the observed jitter.  Furthermore, recreating the swap chain, which is necessary after a resize, is not instantaneous.  If rendering continues before the swap chain is fully recreated, rendering commands will fail, again contributing to the jitter.

Mitigation focuses on two key areas:

* **Event Handling and Synchronization:**  The application must robustly handle `Resized` events and ensure no rendering occurs until the swap chain is correctly updated to reflect the new window dimensions.  This frequently involves blocking the rendering loop until confirmation of successful swap chain recreation.

* **Efficient Swap Chain Recreation:**  The process of creating a new swap chain should be optimized. This includes minimizing unnecessary allocations and leveraging any available asynchronous operations to reduce the blocking time required by the main thread.  However, true asynchronicity can be tricky due to the inherent sequential nature of GPU commands.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate different approaches to mitigating resize jitter, each with varying levels of complexity and performance characteristics.  These are simplified for clarity, and a production-ready solution would require more robust error handling and potentially more advanced synchronization primitives.

**Example 1:  Simple Blocking Approach**

```rust
use wgpu::*;
use winit::*;

// ... other code ...

let mut resized = false;
let mut new_size = PhysicalSize::new(0,0);

event_loop.run(move |event, _, control_flow| {
    match event {
        Event::WindowEvent {
            event: WindowEvent::Resized(size),
            ..
        } => {
            resized = true;
            new_size = size;
        }
        Event::MainEventsCleared => {
            if resized {
                resized = false;
                let surface_configuration = SurfaceConfiguration {
                    usage: TextureUsages::RENDER_ATTACHMENT,
                    format: surface.get_supported_formats(&adapter)[0],
                    width: new_size.width,
                    height: new_size.height,
                    present_mode: PresentMode::Fifo,
                };
                surface.configure(&device, &surface_configuration);
                // Block rendering until swap chain is recreated
            } else {
                // Render frame here
            }
        }
        _ => {}
    }
    *control_flow = ControlFlow::Wait;
});
```

This example uses a boolean flag (`resized`) to signal a resize event.  The rendering loop is effectively paused (via `ControlFlow::Wait`) until the swap chain is reconfigured.  This is the simplest approach but can introduce noticeable pauses during resizing.

**Example 2:  Using a Channel for Synchronization**

```rust
use wgpu::*;
use winit::*;
use std::sync::mpsc;

// ... other code ...

let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

event_loop.run(move |event, _, control_flow| {
    match event {
        Event::WindowEvent {
            event: WindowEvent::Resized(size),
            ..
        } => {
            tx.send(size).unwrap();
        }
        Event::MainEventsCleared => {
            match rx.try_recv() {
                Ok(size) => {
                    let surface_configuration = SurfaceConfiguration {
                        // ... configuration ...
                        width: size.width,
                        height: size.height,
                        // ...
                    };
                    surface.configure(&device, &surface_configuration);
                }
                Err(_) => {
                    // Render frame here
                }
            }
        }
        _ => {}
    }
    *control_flow = ControlFlow::Wait;
});
```

This example introduces a channel for communication between the event loop and the rendering loop. This improves responsiveness by decoupling the event handling from the rendering, although `try_recv` still requires polling.


**Example 3:  More sophisticated approach using futures (requires additional crates)**

```rust
use wgpu::*;
use winit::*;
use futures::channel::oneshot;

// ... other code ...

event_loop.run(move |event, _, control_flow| {
    match event {
        Event::WindowEvent {
            event: WindowEvent::Resized(size),
            ..
        } => {
            let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel();
            tokio::spawn(async move {
                let surface_configuration = SurfaceConfiguration {
                    // ... configuration ...
                    width: size.width,
                    height: size.height,
                    // ...
                };
                surface.configure(&device, &surface_configuration);
                tx.send(()).unwrap();
            });
            rx.await.unwrap();
        }
        Event::MainEventsCleared => {
            // Render Frame Here
        }
        _ => {}
    }
    *control_flow = ControlFlow::WaitUntil(Instant::now() + Duration::from_millis(1));
});

```

This example leverages Tokio and futures to handle the swap chain recreation asynchronously. The resize event triggers a background task to reconfigure the surface. The main thread waits on a `oneshot` channel to receive a completion signal.  This offers the best potential for smoothness but increases complexity. Note that proper error handling and potentially a more robust synchronization mechanism would be needed in a production environment.



**3. Resource Recommendations**

The `wgpu` and `winit` documentations are essential.  Understanding the nuances of asynchronous programming in Rust, including concepts like channels and futures, is critical for advanced solutions.  Furthermore, exploring articles and blog posts specifically addressing rendering optimizations and efficient event handling within the context of Rust game development or graphical applications will prove invaluable.  Finally, examining example projects utilizing `wgpu-rs` and `winit` for similar tasks will provide practical insight and working code examples.  Focusing on understanding the underlying concepts of event loops, asynchronous operations, and GPU synchronization is key to developing a robust and performant solution.
