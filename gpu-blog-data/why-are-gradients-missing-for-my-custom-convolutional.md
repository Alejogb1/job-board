The absence of gradients in a custom convolutional layer typically stems from a mismatch between the layer's forward and backward pass implementations, often related to the handling of intermediate activations and the application of the chain rule.  Over the years, debugging this issue has formed a significant portion of my work with neural networks, particularly when venturing beyond standard layer implementations.  Let's systematically analyze the potential causes and their solutions.

**1.  Clear Explanation of the Gradient Vanishing/Exploding Problem in Custom Convolutional Layers**

The backpropagation algorithm relies on calculating gradients efficiently.  Each layer's gradient is computed as the product of the gradient from the subsequent layer and the derivative of the layer's activation function with respect to its input.  In convolutional layers, this involves spatial convolutions of gradients.  If the layer's forward pass employs operations that aren't differentiable or if the backpropagation process doesn't correctly account for all intermediate computations, the gradient will be incorrectly calculated, potentially resulting in zero or extremely large gradient values (vanishing or exploding gradients).  This often manifests as non-updating weights during the training process, as the optimizer receives no information on how to adjust the parameters to minimize loss.

Common culprits include:

* **Incorrect derivative calculation:** The most frequent mistake is an inaccurate calculation of the derivative of the layer's activation function or the convolution operation itself.  For example, using a non-differentiable activation function (like a step function) directly within the convolutional process will halt backpropagation.

* **Incorrect shape handling:**  Tensor shapes are crucial. Mismatched dimensions between the forward and backward pass computations will lead to errors in gradient calculation. This often happens when dealing with padding, strides, or dilation in the convolutional operation.

* **Missing intermediate activations:** The backward pass often needs to access intermediate results from the forward pass. If these are not stored, the chain rule cannot be applied correctly, resulting in incomplete or erroneous gradients.

* **Issues with custom activation functions:** Implementing a custom activation function requires paying close attention to its derivative.  A poorly implemented derivative can lead to incorrect gradient updates.

* **Numerical instability:** Using unstable numerical methods during either the forward or backward passes can lead to numerical errors that severely affect the calculation of the gradient, leading to apparent vanishing or exploding gradients.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

Let's illustrate these issues with three code examples, focusing on Python and TensorFlow/Keras.  For simplicity, I'll omit aspects like bias terms, but their inclusion is straightforward and shouldn't significantly alter the core concepts.


**Example 1: Incorrect Derivative of a Custom Activation Function**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomConv2D(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, filters, kernel_size):
        super(CustomConv2D, self).__init__()
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(kernel_size, kernel_size, 1, filters),
                                      initializer='random_normal',
                                      trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        # Custom activation function with an incorrect derivative
        def custom_activation(x):
            return tf.nn.relu(x) # Correct activation
            #return tf.cast(x > 0, tf.float32) # Incorrect:  Non-differentiable step function

        conv = tf.nn.conv2d(inputs, self.kernel, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')
        activated = custom_activation(conv)
        return activated

    def get_config(self):
        config = super().get_config().copy()
        config.update({
            'filters': self.kernel.shape[3],
            'kernel_size': self.kernel.shape[0],
        })
        return config
```

In this example, uncommenting the `tf.cast(x > 0, tf.float32)` line will lead to missing gradients because the step function is non-differentiable. The `tf.nn.relu` provides a differentiable alternative.  This highlights the crucial role of differentiable activation functions.


**Example 2: Mismatched Shapes in the Backward Pass**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class ShapeErrorConv2D(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, filters, kernel_size):
        super(ShapeErrorConv2D, self).__init__()
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(kernel_size, kernel_size, 1, filters),
                                      initializer='random_normal',
                                      trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        conv = tf.nn.conv2d(inputs, self.kernel, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')
        return conv

    def get_config(self):
        config = super().get_config().copy()
        config.update({
            'filters': self.kernel.shape[3],
            'kernel_size': self.kernel.shape[0],
        })
        return config

    def build(self, input_shape):
        super().build(input_shape)

    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
      return input_shape[:-1] + (self.kernel.shape[3],)

```

This example (though unlikely to actually fail on a modern TF/Keras setup due to automatic shape handling) is meant to illustrate the potential for shape mismatches.  A poorly implemented `compute_output_shape`  (or a missing one) could lead to inconsistencies between forward and backward pass shape expectations, leading to gradient errors. The crucial aspect is ensuring consistency between the output shape declared and the actual shape produced during the forward pass.

**Example 3:  Ignoring Intermediate Activations**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class MissingActivationConv2D(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, filters, kernel_size):
        super(MissingActivationConv2D, self).__init__()
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(kernel_size, kernel_size, 1, filters),
                                      initializer='random_normal',
                                      trainable=True)

    def call(self, inputs):
        conv = tf.nn.conv2d(inputs, self.kernel, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')
        return conv  # No intermediate activation storage

    def get_config(self):
      config = super().get_config().copy()
      config.update({
          'filters': self.kernel.shape[3],
          'kernel_size': self.kernel.shape[0],
      })
      return config


```

This example showcases a simplified convolutional layer without explicit activation function. While functional, if more complex operations were performed within the `call` method, omitting intermediate storage could severely impact gradient calculation during backpropagation.  The automatic differentiation might not be able to reconstruct the necessary intermediate values for the chain rule.

**3. Resource Recommendations**

For a comprehensive understanding of automatic differentiation and backpropagation, I recommend studying textbooks on advanced calculus, linear algebra, and deep learning.  Familiarizing yourself with the source code of established deep learning frameworks (like TensorFlow or PyTorch) can offer valuable insights into efficient gradient calculation techniques.  Reviewing research papers on novel convolutional architectures and their implementations will expose you to advanced techniques and potential pitfalls to avoid.  Finally, consistent experimentation and methodical debugging using print statements and debugging tools are vital for uncovering the root cause of gradient issues.
