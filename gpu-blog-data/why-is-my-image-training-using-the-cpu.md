The core issue frequently encountered when image training occurs on a CPU despite a detected GPU and installed libraries lies in the framework's default configuration or an explicit instruction to utilize the CPU. I have encountered this scenario multiple times, typically following a new environment setup or after making changes to library versions. The presence of a compatible CUDA-enabled GPU and correctly installed libraries (e.g., TensorFlow with GPU support, PyTorch with CUDA) does not automatically guarantee GPU utilization; explicit steps within the code are often necessary.

Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, by design, attempt to use the most readily available computational resource. If not configured otherwise, and if a usable CPU is present, this becomes the default fallback. The problem, in my experience, stems from a failure to actively inform the framework to prioritize or exclusively use the GPU. This can manifest through several avenues: lacking specific device placement commands, issues with CUDA version compatibility, or improper environment variable settings. Furthermore, other processes can occasionally monopolize the GPU, effectively preventing the training script from accessing it.

The first critical step in forcing GPU utilization involves explicit device placement, commonly done at the tensor level. Frameworks generally provide abstractions for selecting device placement, and neglecting this step leads to default execution on the CPU. Let's consider an example using TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check for GPU availability
gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if gpus:
    print("GPU detected:", gpus)
    # Explicitly place tensors and operations on the GPU
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
        # Example: Simple tensor operation
        a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
        b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
        c = tf.matmul(a, b)
        print("Result on GPU:\n", c)

else:
    print("No GPU detected. Running on CPU.")
    # Operations will default to CPU in this case.
    a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
    b = tf.constant([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]])
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)
    print("Result on CPU:\n", c)
```

In this TensorFlow example, the crucial part is `with tf.device('/GPU:0'):`. This context manager dictates that all operations within its scope should be performed on the first available GPU. If `'/GPU:0'` were absent, the matrix multiplication would default to the CPU. This demonstrates the necessity of explicitly defining device usage. The initial check for GPU availability using `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` allows you to provide feedback to the user if no GPU is present, but it doesn't enforce GPU usage automatically.

Now, consider an analogous situation in PyTorch:

```python
import torch

# Check if CUDA (GPU support) is available
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print("CUDA available, using GPU.")
    device = torch.device("cuda")

    # Example: Simple tensor operation on the GPU
    a = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]).to(device)
    b = torch.tensor([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]]).to(device)
    c = torch.matmul(a, b)
    print("Result on GPU:\n", c)
else:
    print("CUDA not available, using CPU.")
    device = torch.device("cpu")

    a = torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]).to(device)
    b = torch.tensor([[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]]).to(device)
    c = torch.matmul(a, b)
    print("Result on CPU:\n", c)
```

Here, the `torch.cuda.is_available()` function verifies the presence of CUDA support. If available, we create a `device` object set to "cuda" and use the `.to(device)` method to transfer tensors to the GPU. Without this crucial `.to(device)` call, the tensors default to the CPU, even if CUDA is available. The `device` object helps avoid hardcoded 'cuda' strings and supports both CPU and GPU execution in a unified way.

Beyond explicit device placement, another significant source of the problem stems from incorrect CUDA installations or version mismatches. A prevalent issue I've often seen is the installation of TensorFlow or PyTorch versions that are incompatible with the installed CUDA toolkit version. In this case, the framework cannot properly interact with the GPU, even if it's detected. Compatibility between CUDA, the NVIDIA drivers, and the framework's specific requirements is critical. Another frequent problem involves a CUDA installation process that omits necessary components or paths. This often presents as a failure to locate the CUDA libraries during runtime, which in turn leads to CPU fallback.

To prevent versioning issues, it's often beneficial to rely on virtual environments like `venv` or `conda` that allow for isolated project-specific library versions. This reduces the potential for conflicting library versions within the system. For instance, if one project relies on CUDA version 11.2, and another on CUDA 12, two separate virtual environments can be used to manage these requirements without impacting other projects. These virtual environments also help manage environment variable configurations specific to each project.

To demonstrate a configuration using PyTorch in a more complex situation – training a basic neural network – consider the following simplified example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Check and assign device as shown before
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    print("CUDA available, using GPU.")
    device = torch.device("cuda")
else:
    print("CUDA not available, using CPU.")
    device = torch.device("cpu")

# Define a simple neural network
class SimpleNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

# Instantiate model and transfer to device
model = SimpleNet().to(device)

# Generate sample data
inputs = torch.randn(1, 10).to(device)
target = torch.tensor([1]).to(device)

# Define loss and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)


# Training step
optimizer.zero_grad()
outputs = model(inputs)
loss = criterion(outputs, target)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

print("Loss:", loss.item())
```

This example demonstrates how all the trainable parameters of a simple neural network are transferred to the device using `.to(device)`. Additionally, the input data and targets are explicitly transferred to the device before being used in the training step. Without these explicit moves, the model training would revert to the CPU, even though CUDA is available. The practice of transferring the model and all the associated data is critical for optimal performance during GPU-accelerated training.

For a deeper understanding, resources that detail the specific API usage of each framework are invaluable. The official TensorFlow documentation provides detailed examples of GPU usage and best practices. The PyTorch documentation also provides comprehensive guides on CUDA setup, device management, and optimization of GPU utilization. Furthermore, consulting the CUDA documentation itself will clarify versioning information. Lastly, checking the release notes for the specific versions of your chosen framework is useful in avoiding compatibility issues and is something I always check before undertaking an update. Following these recommendations should significantly improve the likelihood of successfully leveraging the GPU for image training.
