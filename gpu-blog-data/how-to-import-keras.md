The seemingly simple question of importing Keras masks a crucial underlying complexity stemming from its multifaceted integration within the broader TensorFlow ecosystem.  My experience developing large-scale deep learning models has repeatedly highlighted the importance of understanding the specific Keras import method dependent on the TensorFlow version and installation configuration.  Simply stating `import keras` is often insufficient and can lead to frustrating `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions.

**1.  Explanation of Keras Import Variations and Dependencies:**

Keras's evolution has involved significant restructuring. Initially, it existed as a standalone library.  However, since TensorFlow 2.0, Keras has been tightly integrated as its high-level API. This integration impacts the import process.  Understanding this history is key to avoiding common import issues.

There are three primary ways to import Keras, each with its own implications:

* **`import tensorflow as tf` (and then `tf.keras`):** This is the recommended approach for TensorFlow 2.x and later.  TensorFlow's `keras` module provides a consistent and optimized implementation.  Importantly, this method leverages TensorFlow's backend, ensuring optimized performance.  This is the method I've found to be the most robust and reliable in my work on production-level systems.  It ensures compatibility across different TensorFlow versions and eliminates potential conflicts with standalone Keras installations.

* **`import keras` (standalone Keras):**  This approach works only if Keras is installed independently of TensorFlow – a less common scenario now but still possible in specific legacy projects or environments with constrained dependency management.  However, it's crucial to understand that this method might be incompatible with newer TensorFlow versions and lacks the performance optimizations afforded by the integration within TensorFlow.  In my early career, I encountered numerous instances where relying on this standalone import resulted in unpredictable behavior and performance bottlenecks.  I strongly advise against this method in new projects.

* **`from tensorflow.keras import ...` (selective imports):** Instead of importing the entire `tf.keras` module, you can import specific components as needed. This approach enhances code readability and reduces import overhead, particularly useful when dealing with very large models or memory-constrained environments.  For instance,  `from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential` only imports the `Sequential` model class. This is a strategy I frequently employ in optimizing large-scale model training pipelines.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Recommended Import (TensorFlow 2.x):**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Verify TensorFlow and Keras versions (good practice)
print(f"TensorFlow Version: {tf.__version__}")
print(f"Keras Version: {tf.keras.__version__}")

# Access Keras functionalities
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# ... rest of your model training code ...
```

This example showcases the preferred method. The initial `import` statement clearly identifies the TensorFlow library, followed by version verification – a crucial step for debugging compatibility issues. This ensures that you're working with a known and consistent environment, preventing unexpected behavior arising from version mismatches. The subsequent lines demonstrate straightforward access to Keras functionalities.


**Example 2:  Standalone Keras Import (Generally Discouraged):**

```python
# ONLY if you have a standalone Keras installation (strongly discouraged for new projects)
try:
    import keras
    print(f"Keras Version (Standalone): {keras.__version__}")
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    # ...rest of code...
except ImportError:
    print("Error: Keras not found. Ensure Keras is installed independently.")
```

This example demonstrates the standalone import, but the `try-except` block is crucial.  It handles the potential `ImportError`, providing a user-friendly error message.  This robust error handling is essential for production-ready code. This approach is primarily useful for maintaining compatibility with older projects, but for new initiatives, the TensorFlow integrated approach should always be prioritized.

**Example 3: Selective Imports:**

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras.losses import CategoricalCrossentropy
from tensorflow.keras.metrics import Accuracy

model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(),
              loss=CategoricalCrossentropy(),
              metrics=[Accuracy()])
# ...rest of code...

```

This approach minimizes import size and improves code clarity by specifically targeting only required Keras components. This selective import strategy is especially beneficial when working with resource-intensive models or when minimizing external dependencies is paramount. I have consistently employed this technique to streamline model building and reduce runtime overhead.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For comprehensive understanding, I recommend consulting the official TensorFlow documentation.  Furthermore, reviewing introductory and advanced tutorials on deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras will greatly enhance your practical understanding.  Finally, exploring well-regarded textbooks on deep learning principles will provide a strong theoretical foundation.  Understanding the underlying mathematics and architecture significantly helps in debugging and resolving issues related to Keras and TensorFlow.
