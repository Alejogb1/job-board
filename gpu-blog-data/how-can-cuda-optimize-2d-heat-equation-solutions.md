The inherent parallelism present in the 2D heat equation lends itself exceptionally well to CUDA optimization.  My experience working on high-performance computing simulations for fluid dynamics, specifically involving Navier-Stokes solvers with coupled thermal models, highlights the significant performance gains achievable through judicious application of CUDA.  The key is to effectively map the spatial discretization of the heat equation onto the parallel architecture of the GPU, minimizing memory transfers and maximizing computational throughput.

**1.  Clear Explanation**

The 2D heat equation, often expressed as:

∂u/∂t = α(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²)

where 'u' represents temperature, 't' represents time, and 'α' is the thermal diffusivity, describes the diffusion of heat over time.  Numerically solving this equation typically involves discretizing the spatial domain into a grid and employing a finite difference method (e.g., explicit or implicit Euler, Crank-Nicolson).  This discretization leads to a system of equations that can be expressed as a matrix operation, particularly well-suited for parallel processing.

CUDA excels at handling such matrix operations by distributing the computational workload across numerous GPU cores.  The explicit method, for instance, involves updating each grid point's temperature based on its neighboring points' temperatures at the previous time step. This local dependency structure maps cleanly onto a GPU's architecture.  Each thread can be assigned a grid point, independently calculating its new temperature based on its immediate neighbors.  However, careful consideration must be given to memory access patterns to avoid bank conflicts and maximize memory coalescing.

Implicit methods, while offering better stability for larger time steps, require solving a large linear system at each time step.  This can be accelerated using CUDA through iterative solvers like Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel, where each iteration can be massively parallelized.  Alternatively, libraries such as cuSPARSE can leverage optimized algorithms for linear system solutions.  The choice between explicit and implicit methods depends on the desired accuracy, stability, and computational cost trade-offs.  In my experience, explicit methods offer a simpler implementation for CUDA parallelization, especially for moderately sized grids, while implicit methods necessitate more sophisticated algorithms and potentially higher memory consumption.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples demonstrate different approaches to CUDA optimization for solving the 2D heat equation using an explicit finite difference method.  These are simplified illustrative examples, and real-world applications require more robust error handling and potentially more advanced techniques such as asynchronous operations and shared memory optimization.

**Example 1:  Naive Implementation (Illustrative)**

```c++
__global__ void heatEquationKernel(float* u, float* u_new, int nx, int ny, float alpha, float dt, float dx, float dy) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

    if (i >= 1 && i < nx - 1 && j >= 1 && j < ny - 1) {
        u_new[i * ny + j] = u[i * ny + j] + alpha * dt * ((u[(i + 1) * ny + j] - 2 * u[i * ny + j] + u[(i - 1) * ny + j]) / (dx * dx) + (u[i * ny + j + 1] - 2 * u[i * ny + j] + u[i * ny + j - 1]) / (dy * dy));
    }
}
```

This kernel demonstrates a basic parallelization.  Each thread updates a single grid point.  However, memory access may not be optimal.

**Example 2:  Optimized Memory Access**

```c++
__global__ void heatEquationKernelOptimized(float* u, float* u_new, int nx, int ny, float alpha, float dt, float dx, float dy) {
    __shared__ float shared_u[BLOCK_SIZE_X][BLOCK_SIZE_Y + 2]; //Shared memory for better coalescing

    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int i_shared = threadIdx.x;
    int j_shared = threadIdx.y + 1;

    //Load data into shared memory
    shared_u[i_shared][j_shared] = u[i * ny + j];
    // ... (load neighbors into shared memory)...

    __syncthreads(); //Synchronize threads within the block

    //Perform calculation using shared memory
    // ... (calculations similar to Example 1, using shared_u) ...

    //Store results back into global memory
    u_new[i * ny + j] = ...;
}
```

This example introduces shared memory to improve memory coalescing.  Data is loaded into shared memory, calculations are performed, and results are written back to global memory.  This significantly reduces memory access latency.

**Example 3:  Using cuBLAS (for Implicit Methods)**

```c++
// ... (Setup of A matrix and b vector representing the linear system)...

cublasHandle_t handle;
cublasCreate(&handle);

//Solve the linear system using cuBLAS (e.g., using iterative solvers)
// ... (cuBLAS calls for iterative solver, e.g., CG or BiCGSTAB) ...

cublasDestroy(handle);
```

This example showcases the use of cuBLAS for solving the linear system arising from an implicit method.  cuBLAS provides highly optimized routines for linear algebra operations, leading to considerable performance improvements.  Appropriate preconditioning techniques might be necessary for optimal convergence.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

"Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach" by David B. Kirk and Wen-mei W. Hwu provides a comprehensive introduction to CUDA programming.  The CUDA C++ Programming Guide and the cuBLAS library documentation are essential resources for detailed information on CUDA functionalities and linear algebra routines.  Understanding numerical methods for partial differential equations, including finite difference schemes and iterative solvers, is crucial for effective implementation.  Finally, familiarity with performance profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight Compute is vital for identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks in CUDA code.
