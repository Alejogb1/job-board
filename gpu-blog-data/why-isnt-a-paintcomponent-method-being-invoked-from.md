The core issue lies in the intricacies of Java's event dispatch thread (EDT) and the proper handling of Swing components.  My experience debugging similar problems across numerous large-scale Java applications has consistently highlighted this as the primary culprit.  A `paintComponent` method, being responsible for rendering a component's visual representation, will only be called by the EDT. Invoking it directly from another thread invariably results in undefined behavior, often manifesting as the method simply not being executed or exceptions being thrown.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Swing, the GUI toolkit used in Java, operates on a single-threaded model.  All UI updates, including repainting, must happen on the EDT.  When an action initiated from a separate thread needs to cause a repaint, it's imperative to marshal the repaint request back to the EDT.  Failure to do so results in the `paintComponent` method not being invoked as expected from the other class. This stems from the fundamental principle that Swing components are not thread-safe.  Direct manipulation from non-EDT threads can corrupt the component's internal state, leading to unpredictable visual glitches or even application crashes.  The system attempts to safeguard against this by ignoring UI updates coming from non-EDT threads, hence the seemingly missing invocation of `paintComponent`.

Therefore, the solution involves using SwingUtilities' `invokeLater` or `invokeAndWait` methods. `invokeLater` posts a runnable to the EDT's event queue for later execution, ensuring thread safety and proper invocation of `paintComponent`.  `invokeAndWait` achieves the same result but blocks the calling thread until the task on the EDT completes.  The choice between the two depends on whether the calling thread needs to wait for the repaint to finish before proceeding.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Incorrect Approach (Non-EDT Update):**

```java
public class MyOtherClass {
    private MyPanel myPanel;

    public MyOtherClass(MyPanel panel) {
        this.myPanel = panel;
    }

    public void updatePanel() {
        // INCORRECT: Directly calling paintComponent from a non-EDT thread
        myPanel.paintComponent(myPanel.getGraphics());  
    }
}

public class MyPanel extends JPanel {
    @Override
    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        g.setColor(Color.RED);
        g.fillRect(0, 0, 100, 100);
    }
}
```

This code will likely not result in the red square being drawn, as `paintComponent` is called directly from `updatePanel`, which runs on a separate thread and hence will likely be ignored by the EDT.


**Example 2: Correct Approach using `invokeLater`:**

```java
public class MyOtherClass {
    private MyPanel myPanel;

    public MyOtherClass(MyPanel panel) {
        this.myPanel = panel;
    }

    public void updatePanel() {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
            // Correct: Repaint request is marshaled to the EDT
            myPanel.repaint(); // or myPanel.revalidate(); if layout changes involved
        });
    }
}

public class MyPanel extends JPanel {
    // ... (paintComponent method remains unchanged)
}
```

Here, `invokeLater` ensures that `repaint()` (which internally triggers `paintComponent`) is executed on the EDT.  `repaint()` schedules a repaint of the component.


**Example 3: Correct Approach using `invokeAndWait` (with conditional repaint):**

```java
public class MyOtherClass {
    private MyPanel myPanel;
    private boolean panelNeedsUpdate = false;

    public MyOtherClass(MyPanel panel) {
        this.myPanel = panel;
    }

    public void updatePanel(boolean needsUpdate) {
        panelNeedsUpdate = needsUpdate;
        try {
            SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(() -> {
                if (panelNeedsUpdate) {
                    myPanel.repaint();
                }
            });
        } catch (InterruptedException | InvocationTargetException e) {
            //Handle Exceptions appropriately - Log or re-throw
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

public class MyPanel extends JPanel {
    // ... (paintComponent method remains unchanged)
    public void updatePanelData(Graphics g) { //Example method to potentially update internal data affecting paintComponent
        //update internal data based on condition
        repaint();
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates conditional repainting using `invokeAndWait`. It ensures that the calling thread blocks until the repaint is completed on the EDT.  The `try-catch` block handles potential exceptions during the EDT invocation.  The boolean flag `panelNeedsUpdate` avoids unnecessary repaints if the condition is false.  This is crucial for performance in scenarios where multiple updates might be requested.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

* **The Java Tutorial (Swing section):**  Provides comprehensive information on Swing programming, including detailed explanations of the EDT and thread safety.
* **Effective Java (Joshua Bloch):**  Offers valuable insights into concurrency and thread safety, which are crucial for understanding and resolving this type of issue.
* **Java Concurrency in Practice (Brian Goetz et al.):** A more advanced text focusing on concurrent programming in Java, invaluable for in-depth understanding of threads and synchronization.


By adhering to these guidelines and understanding the underlying principles of Swing's single-threaded model, you can effectively resolve issues related to the invocation of `paintComponent` from other classes.  The critical element is always ensuring that any interaction with Swing components happens solely on the EDT, using appropriate mechanisms like `invokeLater` or `invokeAndWait` to maintain thread safety and consistent visual rendering.  Ignoring this principle consistently leads to unpredictable behavior and difficult-to-debug problems in Swing applications.
