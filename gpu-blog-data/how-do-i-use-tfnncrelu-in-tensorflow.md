The core concept behind `tf.nn.crelu` in TensorFlow lies in its application of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function to both positive and negative components of an input tensor, followed by concatenating these results along a specified axis. This effectively doubles the output feature map dimension along the chosen axis, providing a form of feature expansion while retaining information about both positive and negative activations. I've found this particularly useful in scenarios where capturing the full spectrum of input signals, both above and below zero, is crucial for effective model learning.

Let me clarify by detailing the function's mechanism. Unlike a standard ReLU, which simply outputs zero for negative inputs, `tf.nn.crelu` first separates the input tensor into its positive and negative parts. For an input `x`, the positive component is `max(0, x)`, equivalent to ReLU, and the negative component is `-min(0, x)`, which is equivalent to the ReLU applied to the negative input. After these operations, the results are concatenated, by default along the last axis. This doubling of dimensions can lead to a more robust feature space that can be beneficial in specific architectures.

One typical use case I encountered was in an image classification task with particularly noisy input. Standard ReLU operations often lost information from negative pixel intensity deviations, while `tf.nn.crelu` allowed the network to separately process and learn from these deviations. The concatenated outputs provided a higher dimensionality that allowed the network to model more complex patterns and nuances in the data. I saw improved accuracy especially in conditions with varying lighting where negative pixel values were significant. This convinced me of its utility under more complex and varied scenarios.

Now, let's illustrate this with some code examples. The key to correctly using `tf.nn.crelu` lies in understanding the impact of the `axis` parameter on the concatenation of ReLU outputs.

**Example 1: Basic Application on a 2D Tensor**

Here's how you might apply `tf.nn.crelu` to a basic 2D input tensor:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a 2D input tensor
input_tensor = tf.constant([[-1.0, 2.0, -3.0],
                           [4.0, -5.0, 6.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Apply tf.nn.crelu with default axis (-1)
crelu_output = tf.nn.crelu(input_tensor)

# Evaluate the output
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  output_value = sess.run(crelu_output)
  print(output_value)
  print(output_value.shape)
```
In this example, the `axis` parameter is not explicitly set, so the default value of -1 (the last axis) is used. The input tensor is `(2, 3)`. The positive parts for example are `[0, 2, 0]` and `[4, 0, 6]`. The negative parts are `[1, 0, 3]` and `[0, 5, 0]`. The output tensor's shape has doubled the last axis, transforming the initial `(2, 3)` into `(2, 6)`. The output clearly shows the concatenation of the positive (ReLU) and negative parts of the tensor along the last dimension.

**Example 2: Applying `tf.nn.crelu` with a Specified Axis**

This example demonstrates how to control the concatenation axis:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define a 3D input tensor
input_tensor = tf.constant([[[1.0, -2.0],
                            [-3.0, 4.0]],

                           [[5.0, -6.0],
                            [-7.0, 8.0]]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Apply tf.nn.crelu, concatenating along axis 0
crelu_output = tf.nn.crelu(input_tensor, axis=0)

# Evaluate the output
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  output_value = sess.run(crelu_output)
  print(output_value)
  print(output_value.shape)
```

Here, the `axis` parameter is explicitly set to `0`. The original tensor has the shape `(2, 2, 2)`. As we are concatenating along `axis=0`, the output shape becomes `(4, 2, 2)`. This demonstrates how the function extends dimensions along a chosen axis, providing greater flexibility and control of how features are expanded. The resulting tensor has its initial axis concatenated with the negative and positive parts of its input.

**Example 3: Use in a Simple Network Layer**

I have personally found this useful within a convolutional neural network. Here's a basic layer illustration, but it doesn't necessarily have to be a CNN:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define input shape
input_shape = (None, 28, 28, 3)

# Create a placeholder for the input image
input_placeholder = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=input_shape)

# Define a convolutional layer with 16 filters
conv_layer = tf.compat.v1.layers.conv2d(
    inputs=input_placeholder,
    filters=16,
    kernel_size=[3, 3],
    padding="same",
    activation=None  # No activation yet
)

# Apply tf.nn.crelu after the convolution
crelu_output = tf.nn.crelu(conv_layer)

# Evaluate the output (placeholder not yet fed, but we can get output shape)
print(crelu_output.shape)

```

In this third example, `tf.nn.crelu` is utilized following a convolutional layer. Assume a grayscale input, where input_shape has the typical dimensions representing `(batch_size, height, width, channels)`. The convolutional layer yields an output of `(batch_size, 28, 28, 16)`.  Subsequently, applying `tf.nn.crelu` without specifying the `axis`, it will, by default, double the number of channels and the output is of shape `(batch_size, 28, 28, 32)`. This increased dimensionality can enable the subsequent layers to capture a richer set of features.  This simple example highlights the typical position of `tf.nn.crelu` in a convolutional network or in any situation where we need feature expansion.

For a comprehensive understanding, I would suggest referring to the TensorFlow API documentation, available on their official website. Additionally, research papers discussing alternative activation functions or strategies for feature expansion in neural networks will be greatly beneficial. Resources that provide detailed explanations of convolutional neural network architectures, along with practical implementations, are also excellent for deepening understanding. I have personally found the official TensorFlow tutorials and examples to be the most helpful when applying `tf.nn.crelu` in my work. Also, look at the source code of different neural networks in github repositories to see how they implemented their neural layers. These types of resources offer both the foundational understanding and specific coding examples needed for efficient use of this function.
