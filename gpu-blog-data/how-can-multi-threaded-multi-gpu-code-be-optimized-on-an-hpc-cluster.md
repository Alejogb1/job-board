The challenge in optimizing multi-threaded multi-GPU code on an HPC cluster primarily stems from the complex interplay between CPU-based task scheduling, data transfer overhead, and the utilization of multiple heterogeneous processing units. I've personally wrestled with this issue on numerous scientific simulations involving coupled fluid dynamics and radiative transfer, and a naive implementation often leads to severe performance bottlenecks rather than linear scaling.

First, one needs to consider the distinct roles of CPUs and GPUs within this context. The CPU threads are generally responsible for orchestrating the overall workflow, managing data I/O, and preparing data for processing. GPUs, on the other hand, execute highly parallelizable compute kernels. Optimization, therefore, requires careful balancing of these responsibilities and minimizing bottlenecks associated with data movement and synchronization.

A key factor is the overhead associated with data transfers between CPU host memory and GPU device memory. Even with fast interconnects, the time spent moving data can easily dwarf the computation time on the GPU, especially for smaller data sets. To mitigate this, techniques like data staging, asynchronous transfers, and minimizing redundant memory copies become critical. Asynchronous transfers, specifically, allow the CPU to continue other processing while data is being transferred to the GPU, potentially hiding the transfer latency.

Another vital aspect involves how computation is distributed across the available GPUs. Data parallelism is typically the approach, where the problem domain is subdivided and each GPU processes a portion. However, load imbalance, where some GPUs finish their work faster than others, creates idle time. Sophisticated domain decomposition and dynamic load balancing techniques are crucial in ensuring uniform workload distribution.

Furthermore, proper thread management on the CPU side influences performance significantly. Over-subscribing CPU cores with threads vying for the same resources can negatively impact data transfer and GPU kernel launch times. Careful configuration of the threading model, such as using a thread pool or task-based parallelism, becomes crucial for maintaining low overhead and efficient scheduling.

Synchronization between CPU threads and GPU computations also introduces bottlenecks. Excessive synchronization can negate the benefits of parallel execution by serializing access to critical resources or memory regions. Fine-grained synchronization, typically accomplished with atomic operations and thread-local memory, needs to be considered carefully to minimize the performance cost.

Finally, efficient usage of GPU memory is essential. Copying larger chunks of data at a time reduces the overhead associated with each copy operation. Proper memory allocation and deallocation strategies, including re-using allocated memory, are important for optimizing memory usage and minimizing the frequency of memory allocation system calls.

Here are three code examples illustrating some of these optimizations:

**Example 1: Asynchronous Data Transfer with CUDA Streams**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <vector>

void processData(float* hostData, float* deviceData, int size, int deviceId) {
  cudaSetDevice(deviceId);
  cudaStream_t stream;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

  // Allocate device memory
  float* d_data;
  cudaMalloc((void**)&d_data, size * sizeof(float));

  // Asynchronously copy data to the device
  cudaMemcpyAsync(d_data, hostData, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);

  // Launch GPU kernel (assuming a function named kernel)
  kernel<<<blocks, threads, 0, stream>>>(d_data, size);

  // Asynchronously copy data back to the host
  cudaMemcpyAsync(hostData, d_data, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream);

  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);

  cudaFree(d_data);
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream);
}
```

In this example, the use of `cudaMemcpyAsync` combined with a CUDA stream allows the CPU to continue execution while data is being transferred to and from the GPU. By specifying a stream for both the memory transfer and the kernel launch, they can potentially overlap, minimizing the overall execution time.  Without streams, `cudaMemcpy` would be a blocking operation, idling the CPU until completion of the data transfer. The final `cudaStreamSynchronize(stream)` ensures that all operations within the stream have completed before proceeding. This is a crucial pattern for achieving high concurrency.

**Example 2: Dynamic Load Balancing Using a Simple Task Queue**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>
#include <vector>
#include <functional>

std::mutex queueMutex;
std::vector<std::function<void()>> taskQueue;
bool stopThreads = false;

void workerThread(int gpuId) {
    while (!stopThreads) {
        std::function<void()> task;
        {
            std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
            if (!taskQueue.empty()) {
                task = taskQueue.back();
                taskQueue.pop_back();
            } else if (stopThreads) {
               return;
            } else {
                continue; // Or use a conditional variable for better performance
            }

        }
        if (task) {
            task(); // execute the task associated with gpuId
        }
    }
}

int main(){
    int numGPUs = 2;
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;

    // Create worker threads, each associated with a GPU.
    for (int i = 0; i < numGPUs; ++i) {
        threads.emplace_back(workerThread, i);
    }


    // Assume some method exists for generating tasks, where each task 
    // processes a subset of data on the assigned GPU
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        auto task = [i, numGPUs](){
            int gpu = i % numGPUs;
            //Process data chunk associated with task 'i' on gpu 'gpu'
            processData(hostDataForTask(i), deviceDataForTask(i), sizeForTask(i), gpu);
        };
        
        {
             std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(queueMutex);
             taskQueue.push_back(task);
        }

    }


    // Signal threads to stop once all tasks are complete.
    stopThreads = true;
    for(auto& thread: threads){
        thread.join();
    }

}
```
This demonstrates a simple task queue approach for dynamic load balancing. Tasks, each responsible for processing a different data chunk on a specific GPU, are added to a queue. Worker threads (one per GPU) pull tasks from this queue and execute them. The key aspect here is that tasks can be dynamically assigned, and the worker threads will continue to execute them as long as there are tasks available in the queue. This provides load balancing, and the number of tasks can be greater than the number of GPUs, allowing for better distribution of the workload. This approach prevents situations where a GPU finishes early and then sits idle. However, more sophisticated load balancing schemes can be implemented for even more optimized performance, which may utilize dynamic domain decomposition.

**Example 3: Avoiding Redundant Memory Allocations**

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <vector>

void processDataOptimized(float* hostData, float* deviceData, int size, int deviceId, float* reusableDeviceBuffer) {

  cudaSetDevice(deviceId);
  cudaStream_t stream;
  cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

  // Reuse pre-allocated device memory (reusableDeviceBuffer)
    // Asynchronously copy data to the device
  cudaMemcpyAsync(reusableDeviceBuffer, hostData, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);

  // Launch GPU kernel
    kernel<<<blocks, threads, 0, stream>>>(reusableDeviceBuffer, size);

    // Asynchronously copy data back to the host
  cudaMemcpyAsync(hostData, reusableDeviceBuffer, size * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream);

  cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);
  cudaStreamDestroy(stream);
}


int main(){
   
  int numGPUs = 2;
  int maxDataSize = 1024; // Define a maximum data size for reuse purposes
   std::vector<float*> reusableDeviceBuffers;

   for(int i=0; i < numGPUs; ++i){
     float * deviceBuffer;
     cudaSetDevice(i);
     cudaMalloc((void**)&deviceBuffer, maxDataSize * sizeof(float));
     reusableDeviceBuffers.push_back(deviceBuffer);
   }


    for(int i=0; i < 100; ++i){
        int dataSize = computeDataSizeForTask(i);
        int gpuId = i % numGPUs;

      processDataOptimized(hostDataForTask(i), deviceDataForTask(i), dataSize, gpuId, reusableDeviceBuffers[gpuId]);
    }

     for(int i=0; i < numGPUs; ++i){
       cudaFree(reusableDeviceBuffers[i]);
   }
}
```

This example shows how to avoid repeated allocations and deallocations of device memory. Instead of allocating memory inside the function, which would require a call to the memory manager every time a function is called, the example pre-allocates the buffers once and reuses them. This reduces the overhead, particularly when a large number of tasks are to be executed, as frequently calling memory allocation functions on GPUs can create significant overhead. It is important to understand that there is some trade off as one might need to allocate a large buffer for every device upfront.

For further study in this area, I recommend consulting resources on parallel computing paradigms like task-based parallelism, and reading extensively on GPU architecture and CUDA programming. Exploring advanced threading models and memory management techniques pertinent to your specific computing environment is also beneficial. Resources detailing performance analysis using profiling tools, typically associated with CUDA or other parallel programming frameworks, is essential. Careful attention to these concepts will contribute to building high-performance applications on HPC clusters. Finally, exploring concepts of domain decomposition, and dynamic load balancing as mentioned above, are also critical for achieving good scaling of multi-GPU workloads.
