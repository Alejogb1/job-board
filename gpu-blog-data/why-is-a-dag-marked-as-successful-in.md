The apparent success of an Airflow DAG without task execution often stems from a misinterpretation of the DAG's state relative to its constituent tasks.  My experience troubleshooting this issue, spanning numerous production deployments over the past five years, has consistently pointed to a few key areas:  incorrectly configured dependencies, scheduler issues, and flawed task instantiation within the DAG definition. The DAG itself represents a directed acyclic graph of tasks; its success indicates the *DAG's* successful parsing and scheduling by the Airflow scheduler, not necessarily the successful execution of *all* tasks within that graph.

Let's analyze this phenomenon systematically.  A DAG is marked successful if the scheduler successfully processes its definition, determines the execution order, and registers it for potential execution. This doesn't imply that the scheduler has already *executed* the tasks. The scheduler operates asynchronously; it pushes tasks to workers based on their dependencies and available resources.  A variety of factors can prevent task execution even after a successful DAG registration.


**1. Incorrectly Configured Dependencies:**

Airflow's power lies in its ability to define complex task dependencies. A common source of the described problem is an improperly configured dependency chain.  If tasks are dependent on others that haven't completed or haven't been scheduled correctly, the dependent tasks will remain in a 'queued' or 'skipped' state, even while the DAG itself is marked successful.  This frequently manifests with tasks implicitly depending on the success of preceding tasks, but the dependency not being explicitly defined in the DAG.

**Example 1: Implicit vs. Explicit Dependencies**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
    dag_id='incorrect_dependencies',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 26),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    task1 = BashOperator(task_id='task1', bash_command='sleep 10')
    task2 = BashOperator(task_id='task2', bash_command='echo "Task 2 executed"')

    # INCORRECT: Implicit dependency, likely leading to task2 not running
    # task2 will run only if task1 completes successfully, but this is not enforced
    # task2 >> task1  This is a common mistake.

    # CORRECT: Explicit dependency, task2 runs only after task1
    task1 >> task2


```

In this example, the commented-out line represents a frequent mistake. Although intending task 2 to run after task 1, the incorrect dependency definition prevents the scheduler from properly sequencing the tasks.  The DAG will appear successful, but `task2` might not run.  The corrected code explicitly defines the dependency using the `>>` operator.


**2. Scheduler Issues:**

Airflow's scheduler plays a vital role in orchestrating the execution of tasks.  Several scheduler-related problems can hinder task execution even with a successfully parsed DAG. Insufficient resources (CPU, memory) allocated to the scheduler or worker nodes, network connectivity issues preventing communication between the scheduler and workers, or a scheduler malfunction could all contribute to this problem.  Additionally, a backlog of tasks could prevent the scheduler from picking up your tasks in a timely manner. Examining the scheduler logs is crucial in such scenarios.


**Example 2:  Resource Constraints**

This scenario isn't directly demonstrable in code, but it highlights the importance of monitoring Airflow's resource utilization.  Suppose a DAG consists of many CPU-intensive tasks. If the Airflow worker nodes lack sufficient processing power or memory, tasks might remain queued indefinitely, even though the DAG itself is marked as successful. This situation necessitates careful resource provisioning and monitoring of resource consumption metrics within Airflow and the underlying infrastructure.


**3. Flawed Task Instantiation:**

Errors within the task definitions themselves can prevent their execution. This includes incorrect parameters, missing dependencies external to the DAG, or exceptions raised during task initialization.  For instance, a `BashOperator` might be configured with an invalid bash command, leading to an immediate failure without clear indication in the DAG's status.

**Example 3: Exception Handling**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.decorators import task
from datetime import datetime

def my_failing_function():
    raise ValueError("This function will fail.")

with DAG(
    dag_id='failing_task',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 10, 26),
    schedule=None,
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    failing_task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='failing_task',
        python_callable=my_failing_function
    )

```

This example showcases a `PythonOperator` calling a function that intentionally raises a `ValueError`.  While the DAG might be marked successful, `failing_task` will fail silently, potentially not even logging appropriately without proper exception handling within the `PythonOperator`.  Robust error handling, including `try...except` blocks within your task functions and the use of appropriate logging mechanisms, is essential for debugging such scenarios.  Adding a `try-except` block within `my_failing_function` and logging the exception would drastically improve troubleshooting this case.  


**Debugging Strategies:**

Beyond the code examples, several strategies are crucial for resolving this issue:

* **Examine Airflow Logs:**  Airflow logs contain invaluable information about the scheduler's actions, task execution attempts (or failures), and resource usage.  Thoroughly reviewing these logs is the primary method for diagnosing this type of problem.

* **Check Task Instances:** The Airflow UI provides detailed information about individual task instances. Pay close attention to the task's state (e.g., 'queued', 'running', 'failed', 'skipped', 'success').  This offers a granular view of individual task executions within the DAG.

* **Review DAG Dependencies Visually:**  The Airflow UI's graph view allows for visual inspection of task dependencies. This can quickly highlight missing or incorrect dependencies that might be hindering task execution.

* **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor the CPU, memory, and network usage of both the Airflow scheduler and worker nodes.  Resource constraints can significantly impact task execution.
