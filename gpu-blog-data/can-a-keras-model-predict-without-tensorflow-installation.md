The assertion that a Keras model necessitates TensorFlow for prediction is inaccurate.  While TensorFlow is the most common backend for Keras, it's not a strict requirement for inference. Keras provides flexibility in choosing backends, allowing deployment independent of the training environment.  Over my years developing and deploying machine learning models, I've encountered numerous scenarios requiring this decoupling, particularly in resource-constrained environments or when deploying to systems where TensorFlow is impractical or undesirable.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

Keras, at its core, is a high-level API for building and training neural networks.  It acts as an abstraction layer, simplifying the complexities of underlying deep learning frameworks.  This abstraction is crucial for its portability.  While TensorFlow (and Theano before it) were originally its primary backends, Keras now supports others, notably PlaidML and CNTK.  The backend selection happens during model construction or at runtime, depending on the configuration.  The key point here is that the *model itself*, once trained and saved, contains the architecture and weights, irrespective of the backend used during training.  The crucial step is selecting a compatible backend for prediction, and ensuring that the necessary runtime dependencies for that backend are available.  This ensures the model's weights can be loaded and used to process input data, regardless of how the model was initially trained.  If TensorFlow was used during training, the saved model's weights are still just numerical data; they don't inherently require TensorFlow to be loaded.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using TensorFlow as Backend (for Context)**

This example demonstrates a typical workflow where TensorFlow serves as both the training and inference backend.  This clarifies the typical, albeit not mandatory, relationship between Keras and TensorFlow.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Model definition and training (simplified)
model = keras.Sequential([Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), Dense(1)])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
model.fit(training_data, training_labels, epochs=10)

# Prediction using TensorFlow backend
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
print(predictions)

# Saving the model
model.save('my_model_tf.h5')
```

In this scenario, TensorFlow is explicitly imported, the model is compiled with a TensorFlow optimizer, and predictions are made directly using the `model.predict` method. The model is saved using Keras's built-in HDF5 format.  Note that even in this case, the weights are stored independently of the TensorFlow runtime itself within the HDF5 file.


**Example 2:  Inference with a Different Backend (PlaidML)**

This example showcases deploying the model without TensorFlow. PlaidML is a hardware-accelerated backend supporting a subset of Keras functionalities and is valuable where TensorFlow installation is impractical.  This demonstrates backend independence.  Note that PlaidML support might require specific installation steps and might not cover all Keras operations.

```python
import plaidml.keras
plaidml.keras.install_backend()
from tensorflow import keras

# Load the model trained with TensorFlow (Example 1)
model = keras.models.load_model('my_model_tf.h5', compile=False) # compile=False crucial here

# Prediction using PlaidML backend
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
print(predictions)
```

Crucially, `compile=False` prevents Keras from attempting to re-compile the model with a TensorFlow backend, which would fail if TensorFlow is unavailable.  Loading the model without recompilation ensures the existing weights are used.  PlaidML handles the actual computation.


**Example 3:  Inference with ONNX Runtime**

This approach involves exporting the Keras model to the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format, a standard for representing machine learning models. This provides maximum interoperability and allows the use of different inference engines without relying on the original training framework.

```python
import keras
import onnx

# Load the Keras model
model = keras.models.load_model('my_model_tf.h5')

# Convert to ONNX format
onnx_model = onnx.shape_inference.infer_shapes(onnx.utils.extract_model(keras2onnx.convert_keras(model))) # Requires keras2onnx library

# Save the ONNX model
onnx.save_model(onnx_model, "my_model.onnx")

# Inference with ONNX Runtime (Requires separate ONNX Runtime installation and code)
# ... (ONNX Runtime specific code to load and run the model) ...
```

This involves an extra step of exporting the model using a suitable tool (e.g., `keras2onnx`).  The resulting ONNX model can then be loaded and executed using ONNX Runtime, providing complete independence from the original training environment.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of Keras internals, consult the official Keras documentation.  For backend-specific details, refer to the respective documentation for TensorFlow, PlaidML, and ONNX Runtime.  Familiarize yourself with the ONNX standard for maximum interoperability across different deep learning frameworks.  Studying advanced topics like model serialization and deployment will further solidify your understanding.  Consider exploring resources that discuss the limitations and practical considerations of different backends during inference, especially regarding hardware acceleration.  A thorough understanding of Python's package management will also benefit your deployment efforts.
