TensorFlow-rs's `ops::split` returns a `Vec<Tensor>`, not a single, directly addressable structure. Accessing individual output tensors requires treating this vector as an array, indexing into it based on the split axis, and considering the potential for varying output tensor sizes. I’ve frequently encountered situations where developers mistakenly try to handle the output as a single tensor, leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

The `ops::split` operation, as its name suggests, divides a given input tensor into multiple subtensors along a specified dimension (the split axis). The number of subtensors produced is determined by either the length of the `size_splits` argument if provided, or by equally dividing the input tensor’s dimension based on the number of requested output tensors. This distinction is important when accessing output tensors, as it impacts how you index into the result vector. Importantly, the `size_splits` argument allows for non-equal splits of the input tensor, which is a common requirement when dealing with uneven data distribution.

The returned `Vec<Tensor>` stores the resultant subtensors. Therefore, to access a specific subtensor, one must use standard vector indexing. The index corresponds to the positional order of the subtensor relative to the split axis. When `size_splits` are provided, they determine both the size of each subtensor and the number of tensors in the result vector. When `num_splits` is provided instead of `size_splits`, each split will attempt to be of uniform size, and any remainder will be placed in the last tensor of the output. This dynamic size aspect significantly affects how further operations are constructed on the returned tensors, demanding a careful accounting of the dimensions.

**Code Example 1: Equal Splits**

This example demonstrates accessing individual output tensors when `num_splits` is used to divide the input tensor equally.

```rust
use tensorflow::{Graph, Session, Tensor, ops};

fn equal_splits() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut graph = Graph::new();
    let input = Tensor::new(&[1, 100], &[0.0; 100]).into_op(&mut graph)?;
    let num_splits = 4;
    let split_axis = 1; // Split along the second dimension (index 1).

    let split_tensors = ops::split(input, split_axis.into_op(&mut graph)?, num_splits).unwrap();

    // Access the first output tensor (index 0).
    let first_tensor = &split_tensors[0];
    let first_tensor_shape = first_tensor.get_shape(&mut graph)?.unwrap();
    println!("Shape of first tensor: {:?}", first_tensor_shape); // Expected: [1, 25]

     // Access the third output tensor (index 2).
     let third_tensor = &split_tensors[2];
     let third_tensor_shape = third_tensor.get_shape(&mut graph)?.unwrap();
     println!("Shape of third tensor: {:?}", third_tensor_shape); // Expected: [1, 25]


    // Example: perform a simple operation on the first tensor
    let first_plus_one = ops::add(first_tensor, Tensor::new(&[], 1.0).into_op(&mut graph)?).unwrap();

    let mut session = Session::new(&graph, &tensorflow::SessionOptions::new())?;
    let results = session.run(
        &[first_plus_one],
        &[],
        &[],
    )?;

     println!("First result is: {:?}", results[0]);

    Ok(())
}
```

**Commentary:**

The code initializes a graph and an input tensor with dimensions [1, 100]. It then uses `ops::split` with a `num_splits` value of 4, resulting in four tensors each expected to have a shape of [1, 25].  The example then accesses the first and third tensors in the resulting `Vec<Tensor>` by indexing into it. It proceeds to construct a simple addition operation using the first tensor which is then executed by creating and running a session. The dimensions are checked after creation, which can be valuable during debugging and operation construction. This clarifies that individual operations should utilize the subtensors obtained through indexing, not directly the result of the `ops::split` operation. This approach assumes an understanding of how tensor dimensions are shaped by the split.

**Code Example 2: Unequal Splits with `size_splits`**

This example illustrates accessing output tensors when providing a `size_splits` tensor to generate non-uniform splits.

```rust
use tensorflow::{Graph, Session, Tensor, ops};

fn unequal_splits() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
     let mut graph = Graph::new();
     let input = Tensor::new(&[1, 100], &[0.0; 100]).into_op(&mut graph)?;
    let split_axis = 1;

    // Define size_splits for uneven division
    let size_splits = Tensor::new(&[3], &[20, 50, 30]).into_op(&mut graph)?;
    let split_tensors = ops::split_v(input, size_splits, split_axis.into_op(&mut graph)?).unwrap();

    // Access each resulting tensor
    let first_tensor = &split_tensors[0];
    let first_tensor_shape = first_tensor.get_shape(&mut graph)?.unwrap();
     println!("Shape of first tensor: {:?}", first_tensor_shape); // Expected: [1, 20]

    let second_tensor = &split_tensors[1];
    let second_tensor_shape = second_tensor.get_shape(&mut graph)?.unwrap();
    println!("Shape of second tensor: {:?}", second_tensor_shape); // Expected: [1, 50]

    let third_tensor = &split_tensors[2];
    let third_tensor_shape = third_tensor.get_shape(&mut graph)?.unwrap();
    println!("Shape of third tensor: {:?}", third_tensor_shape); // Expected: [1, 30]


    let mut session = Session::new(&graph, &tensorflow::SessionOptions::new())?;

        // Example: add one to the second tensor
    let second_plus_one = ops::add(second_tensor, Tensor::new(&[], 1.0).into_op(&mut graph)?).unwrap();

    let results = session.run(
        &[second_plus_one],
        &[],
        &[],
    )?;

     println!("Second result is: {:?}", results[0]);
    Ok(())
}
```

**Commentary:**

Here, `size_splits` is defined as a tensor specifying how the 100-element dimension should be divided: 20, 50, and 30 elements, respectively.  The function then uses `ops::split_v` as it takes a `size_splits` tensor. Each resulting tensor from `split_tensors` is indexed to demonstrate that each has the specified shapes. A simple addition operation with the second resulting tensor is then performed and run in a session, demonstrating how one can further interact with tensors after performing a split operation. This illustrates a critical use case where `size_splits` enables non-uniform data segmentation. As with the previous example, it highlights the importance of accessing subtensors by their index within the resulting vector.

**Code Example 3: Handling Potentially Empty Splits**

This example shows how one could gracefully handle cases where certain splits could be of size zero.

```rust
use tensorflow::{Graph, Session, Tensor, ops};

fn empty_splits() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut graph = Graph::new();
    let input = Tensor::new(&[1, 100], &[0.0; 100]).into_op(&mut graph)?;
    let split_axis = 1;

    // Define size_splits with one zero-size dimension
    let size_splits = Tensor::new(&[4], &[20, 0, 50, 30]).into_op(&mut graph)?;
     let split_tensors = ops::split_v(input, size_splits, split_axis.into_op(&mut graph)?).unwrap();

    for (index, tensor) in split_tensors.iter().enumerate() {
        let tensor_shape = tensor.get_shape(&mut graph)?.unwrap();
         println!("Shape of tensor {}: {:?}", index, tensor_shape);
    }

    // Example: Accessing the third tensor and performing an operation
      let third_tensor = &split_tensors[2];
        let third_plus_one = ops::add(third_tensor, Tensor::new(&[], 1.0).into_op(&mut graph)?).unwrap();
        let mut session = Session::new(&graph, &tensorflow::SessionOptions::new())?;
        let results = session.run(
            &[third_plus_one],
            &[],
            &[],
        )?;

        println!("Third result is: {:?}", results[0]);


     Ok(())
}
```

**Commentary:**

The code defines a `size_splits` tensor that contains the element `0`, causing the resulting vector to contain a tensor with a shape of `[1, 0]`. This could occur for various reasons, for example, when dynamically adjusting split sizes based on the data and a particular split results in zero elements along the specified axis. The example iterates through each of the returned split tensors, prints the shape of each, and demonstrates that they have varying shapes. This demonstrates a robust strategy of validating dimensions before using tensors in subsequent operations, as accessing a zero-sized dimension incorrectly is a common error. It is demonstrated that you can still access a tensor with zero size as long as you account for the zero size dimensions.

**Resource Recommendations:**

For understanding TensorFlow graph manipulation in general, consult the official TensorFlow documentation, which offers a thorough exploration of the fundamental concepts of graph construction, tensor operations, and execution via a session. The TensorFlow-rs repository itself contains numerous examples and usage notes in its source code and example directories. These examples can offer practical insight into how various operations are intended to be used. Additionally, a solid foundation in the core concepts of linear algebra, especially as they apply to tensors, can be beneficial. Resources focusing on the representation of data using multi-dimensional arrays can clarify the meaning of shape and dimensions in TensorFlow. This is vital for understanding the effects of operations like `split` on the shape of the data and how that affects further operations.
