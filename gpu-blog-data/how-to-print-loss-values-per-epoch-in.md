TensorFlow 2.x's `tf.keras` API significantly streamlined the process of monitoring training progress, but the precise method for printing loss values per epoch requires careful consideration of the chosen training loop structure.  My experience working on large-scale image classification models taught me that relying solely on the default callback mechanisms isn't always sufficient, particularly when dealing with custom training loops or the need for granular control over output formatting.

**1.  Explanation:**

The most straightforward approach leverages the `Model.fit()` method's built-in logging capabilities.  `Model.fit()` implicitly manages epoch iteration and provides callbacks for monitoring various metrics, including loss. However, customizing the output requires understanding how to access and process the history object returned by `Model.fit()`.  Alternatively, a custom training loop provides ultimate flexibility but necessitates explicit handling of epoch tracking and loss calculation.

For custom loops, employing a simple counter to track epochs and printing the loss directly after each epoch's completion is the most reliable approach.  The choice between leveraging `Model.fit()` and a custom training loop depends on the level of control and customization needed.  While `Model.fit()` is often sufficient, complex scenarios – such as those involving specialized data pipelines or non-standard training procedures – may necessitate a custom training loop.  In these situations, manually managing the epoch counter and loss printing ensures precise control.

Furthermore, it’s crucial to remember that the printed loss represents the *average* loss across all batches within that epoch.  This average provides a valuable high-level summary of training progress. For more fine-grained analysis, one might consider logging loss values for each batch individually, though this generates a significantly larger volume of output.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Using `Model.fit()` and `History` object:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... model definition ...

history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))

for epoch, loss in enumerate(history.history['loss']):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{len(history.history['loss'])}: Loss = {loss}")
```

This example demonstrates the simplest method.  The `history` object returned by `model.fit()` contains a dictionary mapping metric names (like 'loss') to lists of values across all epochs. Iterating through this dictionary provides the epoch-wise loss values.  The addition of `+1` to `epoch` ensures that the epoch number starts from 1, matching typical user expectations.  The use of f-strings enhances readability.  This method relies on the default behavior of `model.fit()` and is suitable for most basic training scenarios.


**Example 2: Custom Training Loop with Manual Epoch Tracking:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# ... model definition ...

optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
epochs = 10

for epoch in range(epochs):
    epoch_loss_avg = tf.keras.metrics.Mean()

    for x_batch, y_batch in train_dataset:  # Assuming a tf.data.Dataset
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(x_batch)
            loss = tf.keras.losses.categorical_crossentropy(y_batch, predictions)

        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
        epoch_loss_avg.update_state(loss)

    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{epochs}: Loss = {epoch_loss_avg.result().numpy()}")
```

This example showcases a custom training loop.  The `tf.keras.metrics.Mean()` metric efficiently accumulates the loss over each batch within an epoch.  The loop iterates through a `tf.data.Dataset`, ensuring efficient data handling.  The loss is calculated and updated within the gradient tape context. Crucially, the average epoch loss is only printed *after* all batches within that epoch have been processed.  This demonstrates precise control over the training process and output.


**Example 3:  `Model.fit()` with a Custom Callback for Enhanced Control:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class EpochLossPrinter(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}: Loss = {logs['loss']}")


# ... model definition ...

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, callbacks=[EpochLossPrinter()])
```

This example leverages a custom Keras callback. The `on_epoch_end` method is executed at the conclusion of each epoch.  The `logs` dictionary, provided by the framework, contains all relevant metrics, including the loss. This approach retains the convenience of `model.fit()` while providing customized logging without modifying the core training loop.  This method is particularly valuable when needing more complex logging behaviors, such as conditional output or writing to a file.  The callback pattern promotes code organization and reusability.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The TensorFlow documentation, specifically the sections on `tf.keras.Model.fit()`, custom training loops, and callbacks provide comprehensive guidance.  Exploring the Keras examples and tutorials within the TensorFlow documentation will further solidify understanding.  Furthermore, textbooks covering deep learning fundamentals and practical implementations with TensorFlow are invaluable resources for mastering advanced concepts.  Finally, peer-reviewed papers focusing on TensorFlow training techniques can provide insights into best practices and advanced strategies.
