Extracting specific data points from MediaInfo's output often presents a challenge due to its variable formatting and the absence of a standardized, readily parseable structure.  My experience working on media analysis pipelines has highlighted the crucial need for robust parsing techniques, especially when dealing with the diverse range of media containers and codecs MediaInfo encounters.  The key lies in understanding MediaInfo's output format and employing appropriate string manipulation or regular expression techniques tailored to the specific data sought.  Failing to account for variations in the output structure will invariably lead to unreliable and error-prone scripts.

**1.  Understanding MediaInfo's Output:**

MediaInfo's command-line output, while informative, isn't designed for direct programmatic consumption without preprocessing.  Its structure is generally consistent but not perfectly uniform across different media files.  The output frequently utilizes key-value pairs, but the key names can sometimes vary (e.g., "Duration" might appear as "Duration/String" or "Duration/String1" depending on the file type and MediaInfo version), and the values themselves might include units or other supplementary information needing to be stripped.  Therefore, direct assignment based on a rigid key-value assumption is unreliable.  A more robust approach involves identifying the data through pattern matching, extracting it, and then cleaning it.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

The following examples utilize Python.  I've selected Python for its rich string manipulation capabilities and readily available regular expression libraries.  Adapting these to other languages (like Perl or shell scripting) would be straightforward, though the specific functions and syntax will naturally differ.

**Example 1:  Basic Extraction using String Manipulation:**

This example focuses on extracting the video duration.  It assumes a relatively consistent output structure.  This approach is less robust than regular expressions but can be suitable for scenarios where the output format's variability is minimal.


```python
import subprocess

def get_media_duration(filepath):
    """Extracts video duration from MediaInfo output using string manipulation.
       Assumes a relatively consistent output structure.  Error handling is minimal for brevity.
    """
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['mediainfo', '--Output=XML', filepath], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        xml_output = result.stdout
        # This is a very brittle method.  XML parsing is recommended for robustness.
        duration_line = next((line for line in xml_output.splitlines() if 'Duration' in line), None) 
        if duration_line:
            duration_str = duration_line.split('>')[1].split('<')[0].strip() #Basic string split. Not robust.
            return duration_str
        else:
            return None
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error running MediaInfo: {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return None


filepath = "my_video.mp4"
duration = get_media_duration(filepath)
print(f"Video duration: {duration}")

```

**Example 2: Robust Extraction using Regular Expressions:**

This example leverages regular expressions for more robust data extraction, accommodating variations in the output format.  This approach is preferred due to its ability to handle inconsistencies and adapt to different MediaInfo versions.


```python
import subprocess
import re

def get_media_info(filepath, target_key):
    """Extracts specified information from MediaInfo output using regular expressions."""
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['mediainfo', '--Output=XML', filepath], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        xml_output = result.stdout
        #Regular expression for flexibility.  The pattern needs adjustment for each target_key.
        match = re.search(rf'<{target_key}>(.*?)</{target_key}>', xml_output, re.DOTALL)
        if match:
            return match.group(1).strip()
        else:
            return None
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error running MediaInfo: {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return None

filepath = "my_video.mp4"
duration = get_media_info(filepath, "Duration")
width = get_media_info(filepath, "Width")
height = get_media_info(filepath, "Height")

print(f"Video duration: {duration}")
print(f"Video width: {width}")
print(f"Video height: {height}")
```


**Example 3:  XML Parsing for Complex Data Structures:**

For more intricate data structures or when dealing with potentially large MediaInfo outputs, leveraging an XML parser is recommended.  This enhances readability and maintainsability, particularly for handling nested elements.


```python
import subprocess
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def get_media_info_xml(filepath):
    """Parses MediaInfo's XML output using ElementTree."""
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['mediainfo', '--Output=XML', filepath], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        root = ET.fromstring(result.stdout)
        media_info = {}
        for file in root.findall('File'):
            for stream in file.findall('Stream'):
                for element in stream:
                    key = element.tag
                    value = element.text.strip() if element.text else None
                    media_info[f"{key}_{stream.get('StreamKind')}_{stream.get('StreamOrder')}"] = value
        return media_info

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error running MediaInfo: {e}")
        return None
    except ET.ParseError as e:
        print(f"Error parsing XML: {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        return None

filepath = "my_video.mp4"
media_data = get_media_info_xml(filepath)
print(media_data)
```


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For deeper understanding of regular expressions in your chosen language, consult the relevant language documentation.  Familiarize yourself with the MediaInfo command-line options; understanding the `--Output` parameter is vital.  Comprehensive XML parsing libraries are available for most languages; explore their capabilities and error handling mechanisms to build robust applications.  Finally, invest time in error handling and validation within your code to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected program termination.  Consider exception handling and input validation best practices to deal with edge cases and unexpected file formats.
