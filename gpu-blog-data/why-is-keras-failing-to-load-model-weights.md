The most frequent cause of Keras' failure to load model weights from an HDF5 file stems from a mismatch between the model architecture defined for loading and the architecture used during the original model saving.  This discrepancy, often subtle, can manifest in various ways, leading to cryptic error messages that don't immediately pinpoint the root problem.  Over the years, I've debugged countless instances of this issue, working with everything from simple sequential models to complex convolutional neural networks.  The solution always revolves around meticulously verifying architectural consistency.

**1. Clear Explanation of the Problem and Potential Causes:**

Keras utilizes the HDF5 format to serialize model weights and architecture.  The `load_model` function attempts to reconstruct the model from the stored information within the HDF5 file. If the model's architecture – including layer types, number of layers, layer parameters (e.g., number of neurons, kernel sizes, activation functions) – doesn't perfectly align with the saved architecture, the loading process will fail.  This failure often presents as an exception, sometimes vaguely describing an incompatibility or shape mismatch.

Several factors can contribute to this architectural mismatch:

* **Different Keras Versions:**  Changes in Keras APIs across versions can subtly alter the serialization format. Loading a model saved with one version using a different version might result in errors. This is especially pertinent if custom layers were employed, as their serialization methods could vary.

* **Inconsistent Layer Parameters:**  Even a small difference, such as the number of neurons in a Dense layer or the filter size in a Convolutional layer, can lead to a failure.  This is often overlooked when modifying a model after training but before saving.

* **Custom Layers/Objects:**  If custom layers or other custom objects (e.g., loss functions, metrics) were used during training, ensuring their precise redefinition during the loading process is crucial. A slight alteration in the custom layer's implementation will invalidate the loading attempt.

* **Incorrect File Path:** A seemingly obvious error, but verifying the file path is essential.  Typos or incorrect directory references are surprisingly common causes of load failures.

* **Corrupted HDF5 File:** In rare cases, the HDF5 file itself may be corrupted.  Attempting to load from a different copy or re-saving the model can resolve this. However, this is less likely than architectural discrepancies.


**2. Code Examples and Commentary:**

**Example 1: Mismatched Layer Dimensions**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Model Saving
model_save = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model_save.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_save.save('model_save.hdf5')

# Incorrect Model Loading - Altered Layer Size
model_load = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)), #Size changed!
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

try:
    model_load.load_weights('model_save.hdf5')
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading weights: {e}") # This will raise a ValueError
```

This example illustrates a simple mismatch. Changing the number of neurons in the first Dense layer from 64 to 32 prevents the weights from being loaded.  The error message will indicate a shape mismatch.


**Example 2:  Missing Layer**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Model Saving
model_save = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model_save.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_save.save('model_save.hdf5')


# Incorrect Model Loading - Layer Removed
model_load = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

try:
    model_load.load_weights('model_save.hdf5')
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading weights: {e}") #This will raise a ValueError
```

Here, an entire layer is omitted during the loading process, causing a catastrophic failure. The error will likely be a less specific `ValueError`.


**Example 3:  Custom Layer Inconsistency**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Custom Layer Definition (Saving)
class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.sin(inputs)

# Model Saving
model_save = keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(units=32, name='custom_layer'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model_save.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_save.save('model_save.hdf5')

# Incorrect Custom Layer Definition (Loading) - Modified activation
class MyCustomLayer(keras.layers.Layer): #Same name, different implementation!
    def __init__(self, units=32, **kwargs):
        super(MyCustomLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.math.cos(inputs) # Changed activation function

model_load = keras.Sequential([
    MyCustomLayer(units=32, name='custom_layer'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
try:
    model_load.load_weights('model_save.hdf5')
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading weights: {e}") #This will probably not raise a helpful error
```

This example highlights the challenges posed by custom layers.  A seemingly minor change in the custom layer's implementation during the loading phase – altering the activation function from `sin` to `cos` – will lead to inconsistencies, potentially resulting in a silent failure or cryptic error.  Careful attention to custom layer definitions across saving and loading is essential.

**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official Keras documentation is the primary resource.  Thoroughly review the sections on model saving and loading, paying close attention to the specifics of handling custom components.  Consult the TensorFlow documentation as well, as it provides broader context on HDF5 usage within the TensorFlow ecosystem.  Furthermore, carefully examine the error messages produced by Keras during load failures; they often contain clues to the source of the incompatibility.  Debugging tools like pdb (Python Debugger) can aid in pinpointing the exact location and nature of the problem within your code.  Finally, creating a minimal, reproducible example to isolate the issue will often streamline the debugging process.
