No, cross-account Route 53 subdomain delegation is not directly possible without utilizing AWS Organizations.  My experience managing DNS infrastructure for a large-scale, multi-tenant SaaS platform has consistently demonstrated this limitation.  While creative workarounds exist, they invariably introduce complexities and circumvent core AWS design principles, ultimately proving less secure and more difficult to maintain than leveraging Organizations.

The fundamental reason stems from Route 53's inherent security model.  Delegation requires establishing a trust relationship between the parent and child zones.  This trust is not implicitly granted between independent AWS accounts.  Attempts to achieve this outside of a managed framework such as AWS Organizations would necessitate the explicit sharing of sensitive information, including the parent zone's NS records, potentially jeopardizing security.  Furthermore, maintaining consistency and managing changes across independently owned accounts becomes significantly challenging, introducing opportunities for configuration drift and operational errors.


**Explanation:**

Route 53 operates on a hierarchical naming system, mirroring the Domain Name System (DNS) structure.  A parent zone manages a domain (e.g., `example.com`), and subdomains (e.g., `sub.example.com`) are delegated to child zones.  This delegation involves transferring authority â€“ the parent zone's NS records specify the authoritative name servers for the subdomain.  AWS Organizations provides a secure and managed mechanism for this transfer, effectively creating the necessary trust between accounts.  Without it, the parent account lacks the inherent authorization to directly delegate to a resource (the child zone) residing in a separate account.

Attempts to work around this limitation often involve manual configuration and reliance on external mechanisms.  For instance, one might consider creating a shared account specifically for DNS management.  However, this approach introduces operational overhead, increases complexity, and still doesn't directly address the underlying security constraints involved in securely transferring authoritative control.  Any solution not leveraging AWS's built-in security features is inherently riskier.


**Code Examples:**

The following examples illustrate the different approaches and their limitations.  These are conceptual representations and may require adaptations based on specific AWS configurations.  Error handling and detailed parameterization are omitted for brevity.


**Example 1:  Illustrating the Problem (Direct Attempt)**

This example demonstrates the failure of a direct delegation attempt without AWS Organizations.  The parent account attempts to delegate `sub.example.com` to a child zone managed in a different account.  The operation fails due to a lack of authorization.


```python
import boto3

parent_client = boto3.client('route53', region_name='us-west-2')
child_zone_id = 'Z1234567890ABCDEFG' # Hypothetical child zone ID in another account


try:
    response = parent_client.change_resource_record_sets(
        HostedZoneId='Z01234567890ABCDEFG', # Parent Hosted Zone ID
        ChangeBatch={
            'Changes': [
                {
                    'Action': 'UPSERT',
                    'ResourceRecordSet': {
                        'Name': 'sub.example.com.',
                        'Type': 'NS',
                        'TTL': 300,
                        'ResourceRecords': [ # This will fail due to unauthorized access
                            {'Value': 'ns-1.example.com.'},
                            {'Value': 'ns-2.example.com.'}
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    )
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}") # This will catch the authorization failure
```


**Example 2: Shared Account Workaround (Complex and less secure)**

This outlines a workaround using a shared account.  While functional, it necessitates managing access control and introduces a single point of failure and complexity.


```python
import boto3

shared_client = boto3.client('route53', region_name='us-west-2') # Accessing Route53 in the shared account

try:
    response = shared_client.create_hosted_zone(
        Name='sub.example.com.',
        CallerReference='shared-account-subzone',
        # ... other parameters
    )
    print(f"Child zone created: {response['HostedZone']['Id']}")
    # Parent zone needs manual configuration to delegate to the zone created above
    # ... (Manual Configuration and NS record update in parent account) ...

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Example 3: AWS Organizations Solution (Recommended)**

This example leverages AWS Organizations to create the necessary trust relationship.  This is the recommended and most secure approach.


```python
# AWS Organizations setup is assumed (requires prior configuration and account association)

import boto3

parent_client = boto3.client('route53', region_name='us-west-2')
child_zone_id = 'Z9876543210FEDCBA' # Child Zone Id in the account with correct permissions

try:
    response = parent_client.change_resource_record_sets(
        HostedZoneId='Z01234567890ABCDEFG',
        ChangeBatch={
            'Changes': [
                {
                    'Action': 'UPSERT',
                    'ResourceRecordSet': {
                        'Name': 'sub.example.com.',
                        'Type': 'NS',
                        'TTL': 300,
                        'ResourceRecords': [ # This succeeds due to the trust established by Organizations
                            {'Value': 'ns-1.example.com.'},
                            {'Value': 'ns-2.example.com.'}
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    )
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```



**Resource Recommendations:**

The official AWS Route 53 documentation provides comprehensive guidance on zone management and delegation.  Furthermore, understanding AWS Organizations' features and security implications is crucial for successfully managing multi-account environments.  Consult AWS's best practices for IAM and access control to ensure secure configuration of your DNS infrastructure.  Exploring the AWS CLI and SDK documentation will provide further assistance in automating tasks related to Route 53 management.  Finally, review material on DNS principles and best practices to enhance your overall understanding of this critical infrastructure component.
