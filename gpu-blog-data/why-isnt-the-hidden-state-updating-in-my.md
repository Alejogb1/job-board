Recurrent neural network (RNN) cell hidden state updates, particularly within custom implementations, often falter due to a fundamental misunderstanding of tensor flow mechanics and how they interrelate with the `call()` method. I've encountered this numerous times during model development and debugging, particularly when moving beyond pre-built layers. The issue usually stems from how the hidden state, a tensor encapsulating temporal context, is being passed, modified, and returned within the custom cell’s `call` method, rather than a problem in the mathematical formulation of the RNN. The hidden state *must* be explicitly updated and returned as the second output from the `call()` method for Keras/Tensorflow to recognize and propagate the update. Failure to do so, even if internal calculations appear correct, will result in a frozen hidden state.

The core of a custom RNN cell lies in its `call` method. This method receives an input tensor (`inputs`) for the current time step and the *previous* hidden state (`states`). Within `call`, mathematical operations (often involving weight matrices) are performed on both `inputs` and `states` to generate an output tensor and a *new* hidden state tensor. Crucially, the *returned* `states` tensor from the `call()` method is what becomes the input `states` for the *next* time step. If this `states` tensor, returned by `call()`, isn't correctly modified and subsequently returned, the RNN effectively receives the same context information at every step. This is fundamentally different from how feedforward networks update their parameters; they adjust *weights*, whereas RNNs update *context*.

Let's explore this with some concrete examples.

**Example 1: Incorrect Implementation**

Imagine a simplified RNN cell designed to perform a basic additive operation. Here’s a common incorrect way I've seen it implemented, leading to a non-updating hidden state:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleAddCell(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(SimpleAddCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
        self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units, self.units), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
        self.built = True

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        previous_hidden_state = states[0] #Assume single hidden state.
        x_proj = tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel)
        h_proj = tf.matmul(previous_hidden_state, self.recurrent_kernel)
        new_hidden_state = x_proj + h_proj
        output = new_hidden_state # output and updated state are same in this case.
        return output, previous_hidden_state # Important mistake: Returning old hidden state.

    def get_config(self):
        config = super(SimpleAddCell, self).get_config()
        config.update({'units': self.units})
        return config

units = 64
simple_cell = SimpleAddCell(units)
rnn_layer = tf.keras.layers.RNN(simple_cell)

inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 5, 32)) # Batch_size, seq_len, features
output = rnn_layer(inputs)

print(output.shape)
```

The core error in this example resides in the `call()` method. While `new_hidden_state` is calculated correctly internally based on the inputs and the previous hidden state, the method returns `previous_hidden_state` as the second output (the updated state) instead of `new_hidden_state`. Consequently, the RNN layer uses the same initial state for each time step, and `new_hidden_state`, even though calculated correctly, has no effect on the sequential process. This explains the stagnant behavior I've observed; the network isn't learning from the sequences because it receives the same context information for each step of each sequence.

**Example 2: Correct Implementation**

Here's the corrected `SimpleAddCell` to demonstrate proper hidden state updates:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimpleAddCellCorrected(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(SimpleAddCellCorrected, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
        self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(self.units, self.units), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
        self.built = True

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        previous_hidden_state = states[0]
        x_proj = tf.matmul(inputs, self.kernel)
        h_proj = tf.matmul(previous_hidden_state, self.recurrent_kernel)
        new_hidden_state = x_proj + h_proj
        output = new_hidden_state
        return output, new_hidden_state # Updated state returned correctly.

    def get_config(self):
        config = super(SimpleAddCellCorrected, self).get_config()
        config.update({'units': self.units})
        return config


units = 64
simple_cell_corrected = SimpleAddCellCorrected(units)
rnn_layer = tf.keras.layers.RNN(simple_cell_corrected)

inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 5, 32)) # Batch_size, seq_len, features
output = rnn_layer(inputs)

print(output.shape)
```

The significant change is that the `call()` method now correctly returns `new_hidden_state` as the updated hidden state. The Keras RNN layer will take this returned `new_hidden_state`, pass it as the `states` input of the cell for the next time step, thus propagating the sequential context through the network.

**Example 3: Multiple Hidden States (LSTM-like)**

RNN cells, like LSTMs, may have multiple hidden states (e.g., a hidden state `h` and cell state `c`). It's crucial that *all* states are updated and returned appropriately. I've seen errors in how both are managed, where one or both can be incorrectly returned.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class SimplifiedLSTMCell(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(SimplifiedLSTMCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        input_dim = input_shape[-1]
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_dim + self.units, 4 * self.units), initializer='random_normal', trainable=True)
        self.built = True

    def call(self, inputs, states):
        previous_h, previous_c = states #previous states h and c

        concat_input = tf.concat([inputs, previous_h], axis=1)
        z = tf.matmul(concat_input, self.kernel)

        i,f,g,o = tf.split(z,num_or_size_splits=4,axis=1)

        i = tf.sigmoid(i)
        f = tf.sigmoid(f)
        g = tf.tanh(g)
        o = tf.sigmoid(o)

        c_t = f * previous_c + i * g
        h_t = o * tf.tanh(c_t)

        return h_t,(h_t, c_t)  # Correctly returning both updated h and c.

    def get_config(self):
      config = super(SimplifiedLSTMCell, self).get_config()
      config.update({'units': self.units})
      return config



units = 64
lstm_cell = SimplifiedLSTMCell(units)
rnn_layer = tf.keras.layers.RNN(lstm_cell)


inputs = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 5, 32)) # Batch_size, seq_len, features
output = rnn_layer(inputs)

print(output.shape)
```

In this 'LSTM'-like example, we have both a hidden state (`h_t`) and cell state (`c_t`).  Note how we correctly return `h_t` as the *output* and `(h_t, c_t)` as the *updated states tuple*. If, for example, `(previous_h, previous_c)` were returned instead, neither `h_t` nor `c_t` updates would be propagated, essentially freezing both hidden states and rendering the time series aspect ineffective.

**Debugging Strategy**

When faced with the problem of non-updating hidden states, I first inspect the `call()` method implementation. Using a `tf.print` statement before the return statement of the `call()` method to examine the contents of previous state, the newly calculated state and finally the returned state is crucial. Often simply seeing that the returned state is the same as the incoming state reveals the error immediately. Following that, checking the shape and data types of all relevant tensors to ensure they are compatible with the calculations further aids diagnosis.

**Resource Recommendations**

For a more comprehensive understanding of custom layer development in TensorFlow, the TensorFlow documentation itself is a primary resource. While the documentation doesn't present debug strategies directly, thorough reading of API definitions of custom layers and RNN layers can reveal key insights.  Further conceptual grounding of RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs is available in several online textbooks focusing on Deep Learning, particularly their sections on sequence modeling. These texts often provide detailed breakdowns of mathematical principles and practical applications that illuminate the underlying mechanics of these architectures. Finally, numerous examples of custom RNN cells and layers in open source repositories can serve as concrete, practical illustrations of best practices.
