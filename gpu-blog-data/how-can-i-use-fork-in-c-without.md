The `fork()` system call in C provides a mechanism for creating a new process, a nearly exact duplicate of the calling process, termed the child process. The crucial aspect of non-blocking fork usage centers on understanding the default behavior of process termination and how it relates to the parent process. Specifically, after calling `fork()`, the child process initially runs independently, but the parent doesn't inherently wait for it to complete unless explicitly programmed to do so. The child becomes a zombie process upon its own termination if the parent doesn't reclaim its resources, which is a state to avoid in robust application development.

A key concept is process reaping. When a child process terminates, it transitions into a 'zombie' state. This zombie process remains in the process table until its parent reclaims the process's exit status using the `wait()` family of system calls. If the parent process doesn't wait, the zombie process persists, consuming resources. However, if the goal is to fork and not wait, the standard approach is to deliberately ignore the child’s termination or handle it asynchronously.

There are two general approaches to implementing fork without waiting: using signal handling or using `waitpid` with the `WNOHANG` option.

**Method 1: Ignoring the Child's Termination with Signal Handling**

When a child process terminates, the operating system sends the parent process a signal, `SIGCHLD`. This signal, by default, is ignored. We can override this default behavior to catch the signal and, if desired, perform specific actions. However, if our objective is to avoid waiting and effectively not to care about the child’s exit status, then ignoring the signal is a valid and efficient strategy. To do this, we must explicitly tell the operating system to ignore `SIGCHLD` using `signal()` or `sigaction()`. The important distinction in this case is that while the signal can be *handled*, no actual resource reclamation takes place by the parent process – the child becomes a zombie momentarily but is immediately reaped by init, effectively preventing resource leaks and making the child run independent of the parent's lifecycle.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <signal.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid;
    
    // Explicitly ignore SIGCHLD signals
    signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN);

    pid = fork();

    if (pid == -1) {
        perror("Fork failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process code
        printf("Child process, PID: %d\n", getpid());
        sleep(2); // Simulate some work
        printf("Child process exiting\n");
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); 
    } else {
        // Parent process code
        printf("Parent process, PID: %d, Child PID: %d\n", getpid(), pid);
        sleep(1); // Parent does not wait, but can continue execution
        printf("Parent process continuing\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, `signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN)` tells the kernel that when a child process terminates, the parent should completely ignore the `SIGCHLD` signal. Consequently, the parent doesn't wait for the child. The child process executes and exits independently, and because `SIGCHLD` is ignored, the init process is responsible for the reaping.

**Method 2: Non-blocking Wait with `waitpid` and `WNOHANG`**

Another approach is to use the `waitpid()` system call in a non-blocking manner. `waitpid()` allows you to wait for a specific child process instead of any child process, and the `WNOHANG` option instructs it to return immediately if the child process has not yet changed state. The `waitpid` call will return 0 if the child has not terminated, and the actual child PID and process status when the child has terminated. This approach allows the parent process to periodically check for child process termination without blocking.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <errno.h>


int main() {
    pid_t pid;
    int status;

    pid = fork();

    if (pid == -1) {
        perror("Fork failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process code
        printf("Child process, PID: %d\n", getpid());
        sleep(2);
        printf("Child process exiting\n");
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    } else {
        // Parent process code
        printf("Parent process, PID: %d, Child PID: %d\n", getpid(), pid);
      
       // Non-Blocking wait loop
        do {
           pid_t result = waitpid(pid, &status, WNOHANG);
            if(result == -1 && errno != ECHILD){
               perror("waitpid failure");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
            }else if (result == 0){
               printf("Child %d not finished yet.\n", pid);
               sleep(1); //Optional wait to avoid a tight loop
            }else{
               printf("Child %d completed.\n", pid);
               if (WIFEXITED(status)){
                   printf("Child exited with status: %d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));
               }
               break;
            }

         } while(1);

        printf("Parent process continuing.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `do...while` loop repeatedly calls `waitpid()` with the `WNOHANG` flag. If the child hasn't exited, `waitpid()` returns 0, and the parent can continue doing other work, or re-check later. When the child exits, `waitpid` returns the child's process ID and the exit status. It’s vital to check `errno` in the -1 return case to handle instances where `waitpid` is called on an already completed process (which can happen if multiple children are forked and their completion races with the parent’s non-blocking checks). The `WIFEXITED` and `WEXITSTATUS` macros are used to extract information about child termination status.

**Method 3: Detaching Child Processes with `setsid()`**

While not directly preventing waiting in the sense of `wait()` calls, detaching a child process is another method of ensuring the parent's lifecycle is separate. This is especially useful in daemon creation where the child should continue running after the parent exits. This is commonly achieved using the `setsid()` system call, which makes the process a session leader of a new session, dissociating it from the parent's terminal and therefore, its lifecycle.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid;

    pid = fork();

    if (pid == -1) {
        perror("Fork failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    } else if (pid == 0) {
         // Child process code
        printf("Child process (before detachment), PID: %d\n", getpid());

        //Create a new session
        if(setsid() == -1)
        {
           perror("setsid failed");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }
           
        printf("Child process (after detachment), PID: %d, Session ID: %d\n", getpid(), getsid(getpid()));

          // Optionally close standard file descriptors 
        close(STDIN_FILENO);
        close(STDOUT_FILENO);
        close(STDERR_FILENO);
    
        // Set umask
        umask(0); // To ensure files are created with the permissions desired
        chdir("/"); // change directory to root
        
        // Do some work as a detached process
        sleep(5);
        printf("Child process completing.\n");
        
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    } else {
         // Parent process code
        printf("Parent process, PID: %d, Child PID: %d\n", getpid(), pid);
        printf("Parent exiting.\n");
        // Parent process can exit now since child is detached
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This snippet first forks a child. Then inside the child, `setsid()` makes the process a session leader of a new session, effectively detaching it from the parent’s control. Note that this also makes the child a process group leader of a new process group. Afterwards, standard file descriptors are closed, a umask is set and then working directory is changed. Then the child executes its logic independently of the parent, as the parent is free to continue its own execution or exit. The child is now a daemon-like process running independently and unassociated from the parent's lifecycle.

In summary, while the `fork()` call does not inherently involve parent waiting, proper process management requires addressing child termination. The three methods illustrated – ignoring `SIGCHLD`, non-blocking `waitpid` with `WNOHANG`, and detaching processes using `setsid` – provide practical mechanisms for executing fork without the parent being explicitly blocked by child process completion. The method of choice usually depends on the required application behavior and the level of parental oversight desired over child processes.

For additional information, refer to textbooks covering operating system principles, specifically process management, signals, and inter-process communication. Explore the manual pages for system calls such as `fork`, `wait`, `waitpid`, `signal`, `sigaction`, and `setsid`, readily available on most UNIX-like systems using the `man` command, providing explicit details regarding their parameters, return values, and behaviors. Finally, any high quality introductory textbook on programming in C that includes a chapter on system calls should be able to provide additional insights and context.
