The core challenge in dynamically adjusting the input shape of a TensorFlow 2 layer lies in the inherent tension between TensorFlow's graph execution model and the need for runtime flexibility.  Static shape inference, optimized for performance, clashes with the requirement of adapting layer input dimensions during the execution phase.  My experience working on large-scale image processing pipelines underscored this limitation; initial attempts using solely `tf.keras.layers` often resulted in shape mismatches and runtime errors.  Overcoming this involved a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's underlying mechanisms and the strategic application of specific techniques.

**1. Clear Explanation:**

The problem stems from TensorFlow's eager execution and graph building modes.  In eager execution, operations are evaluated immediately, offering immediate feedback but sacrificing some optimization potential. In graph mode, the computation is defined as a graph before execution, enabling significant performance gains through optimization, but demanding static shape definition.  To dynamically adapt a layer's input shape, we need to bypass the limitations of static shape inference while retaining performance benefits wherever possible.

This is achievable using a combination of techniques:

* **`tf.TensorShape` and `None`:**  Employing `None` as a dimension in `tf.TensorShape` signals a variable dimension.  This allows the layer to accept inputs of varying sizes along that axis.  However, this alone is insufficient if the variability affects more than one dimension or involves a more complex shape transformation.

* **Reshape Layers:**  Strategically placing `tf.keras.layers.Reshape` layers before the target layer enables dynamic reshaping of the input tensor to match the target layer's expected input shape at runtime. This requires calculating the required shape dynamically within the model.

* **Custom Layers:**  For the most intricate scenarios, creating a custom layer offers complete control. This involves overriding the `call` method to handle diverse input shapes and incorporate the necessary reshaping or processing logic within the layer itself.  This approach offers the greatest flexibility but demands a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's internals.

Each approach has its trade-offs in terms of performance and implementation complexity. The choice depends on the specific application and the degree of dynamic shape adjustment required.

**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1: Using `None` in `tf.TensorShape`**

This example demonstrates the simplest approach, suitable when only one dimension needs to be variable.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, input_shape=(None, 10)),  # Variable first dimension
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

# Example inputs with different batch sizes
input1 = tf.random.normal((32, 10))
input2 = tf.random.normal((64, 10))

output1 = model(input1)
output2 = model(input2)

print(output1.shape)  # Output: (32, 10)
print(output2.shape)  # Output: (64, 10)
```

This code utilizes `None` in the `input_shape` to allow variable batch sizes.  The layer handles inputs of different batch sizes gracefully. However, any other dimension's variability will cause an error.

**Example 2: Employing `tf.keras.layers.Reshape`**

This example showcases the use of `Reshape` to handle more complex dynamic input scenarios.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def dynamic_reshape_model(input_shape):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(None,)), # Accept variable length vector
        tf.keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: tf.reshape(x, (-1, input_shape[0], input_shape[1]))),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(32, 3, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
    ])
    return model

# Example usage
input_shape = (100, 3)
model = dynamic_reshape_model(input_shape)
input_data = tf.random.normal((32, 300)) # Input is a 32 x 300 vector
output = model(input_data)
print(output.shape)
```

This dynamically reshapes the input to a shape suitable for the Conv1D layer. The lambda layer performs the runtime shape adjustment.  This is crucial when dealing with varying sequence lengths or other multi-dimensional dynamic inputs. Note the reliance on knowing the `input_shape` before model instantiation, which limits total dynamism.

**Example 3:  Creating a Custom Layer**

For the highest degree of control, a custom layer is necessary.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class DynamicInputLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        super(DynamicInputLayer, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.units = units

    def call(self, inputs):
        input_shape = tf.shape(inputs)
        batch_size = input_shape[0]
        reshaped_input = tf.reshape(inputs, (batch_size, -1)) # Reshapes to 2D
        output = tf.keras.layers.Dense(self.units)(reshaped_input)
        return output

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    DynamicInputLayer(64),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
])

input1 = tf.random.normal((32, 5, 10)) # variable dimensions
input2 = tf.random.normal((64, 7, 10)) # variable dimensions
output1 = model(input1)
output2 = model(input2)
print(output1.shape)
print(output2.shape)
```

This custom layer dynamically reshapes the input to a 2D tensor before feeding it to the dense layer.  The `call` method handles various input shapes at runtime.  This solution provides maximum flexibility but increases complexity.
