The core challenge in concurrently running multiple graphs within a single session, without termination, lies in effective resource management and inter-process communication.  My experience optimizing high-throughput data processing pipelines has highlighted the necessity of employing asynchronous programming models and robust inter-process communication strategies to achieve this.  Failure to address these aspects typically results in deadlocks, resource starvation, or inefficient utilization of available processing units.

**1. Clear Explanation**

Concurrent graph execution necessitates a paradigm shift from traditional sequential programming.  A single process managing multiple graphs simultaneously would quickly become a bottleneck. The optimal solution involves leveraging multiple processes or threads, each responsible for executing a single graph.  However, the coordination between these processes demands careful consideration.

The approach I've found most effective utilizes asynchronous programming with a task queue.  Each graph is treated as an independent task. A central process manages a queue, assigning tasks to available worker processes or threads.  This allows for dynamic resource allocation, adapting to fluctuating computational demands. The central process also handles inter-process communication, facilitating data exchange between graphs if needed.  Careful design of this communication mechanism, employing techniques like message queues or shared memory, is crucial for performance and avoiding race conditions.  Furthermore, appropriate error handling and monitoring mechanisms must be implemented to ensure robustness and facilitate debugging.

To manage multiple graphs concurrently without session closure, a sophisticated architecture is required, typically including:

* **A Task Scheduler:**  This component manages the queue of graph execution tasks, assigning them to available resources. It should incorporate strategies for prioritizing tasks based on urgency or resource requirements.

* **Worker Processes/Threads:** These are the units responsible for executing individual graphs.  The number of worker processes/threads should be configurable and optimized based on the system's available resources (CPU cores, memory).

* **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Mechanism:**  Facilitates data exchange between graphs, the task scheduler, and other components, adhering to established synchronization protocols to prevent data corruption.

* **Monitoring and Logging System:** Tracks the status of each graph, logs errors, and provides insights into overall system performance.  This is vital for proactive identification of bottlenecks and debugging complex issues.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary**

The following examples illustrate key aspects of this architecture.  Note these are simplified illustrations and would need substantial adaptation for production environments.  Iâ€™ve used Python for its clarity and extensive library support in concurrent programming.

**Example 1: Asynchronous Task Queue with `asyncio`**

```python
import asyncio

async def execute_graph(graph_id, data):
    # Simulate graph execution
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Replace with actual graph computation
    print(f"Graph {graph_id} completed with data: {data}")
    return data

async def main():
    tasks = [execute_graph(i, f"Data for graph {i}") for i in range(5)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(f"All graphs completed. Results: {results}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This example demonstrates the use of `asyncio` for asynchronous task execution. Multiple graph execution functions (`execute_graph`) are launched concurrently using `asyncio.gather`, allowing efficient utilization of CPU cores.

**Example 2:  Multiprocessing with a Queue**

```python
import multiprocessing
import time

def execute_graph(graph_id, data, queue):
    time.sleep(2) # Simulate graph computation
    result = f"Result from graph {graph_id} with data: {data}"
    queue.put((graph_id, result))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    queue = multiprocessing.Queue()
    processes = []
    for i in range(5):
        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=execute_graph, args=(i, f"Data for graph {i}", queue))
        processes.append(p)
        p.start()

    results = {}
    for i in range(5):
        graph_id, result = queue.get()
        results[graph_id] = result

    for p in processes:
        p.join()

    print(f"All graphs completed. Results: {results}")
```

Here, multiprocessing is employed. Each graph is executed in a separate process, using a `multiprocessing.Queue` for communication with the main process to collect results.  The `join()` method ensures that all processes have completed before proceeding.

**Example 3:  Illustrative Inter-Process Communication with `multiprocessing.Pipe`**

```python
import multiprocessing
import time

def graph_computation(conn, data):
    time.sleep(2)
    conn.send(f"Result from graph: {data}")
    conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parent_conn, child_conn = multiprocessing.Pipe()
    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=graph_computation, args=(child_conn, "Initial Data"))
    p.start()
    result = parent_conn.recv()
    print(f"Graph computation complete. Result: {result}")
    p.join()

```
This demonstrates a basic inter-process communication setup using `multiprocessing.Pipe`.  Data is sent from the child process (graph computation) to the parent process using this unidirectional pipe. This could be extended to handle bidirectional communication and multiple graphs.


**3. Resource Recommendations**

For in-depth study of concurrent programming concepts, consult books on operating systems, concurrent programming, and distributed systems.  Textbooks covering advanced topics in parallel algorithms and high-performance computing are also highly beneficial.  For specific libraries and frameworks, review the documentation for Python's `asyncio`, `multiprocessing`, and relevant libraries for your chosen programming language.  Understanding the intricacies of message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) and shared memory mechanisms will prove invaluable.  Finally, familiarization with debugging tools and profiling techniques for concurrent systems is crucial for effective troubleshooting and performance optimization.
