PyBrain's failure to build a feedforward network typically stems from inconsistencies between the network architecture definition and the provided training data.  I've encountered this numerous times over the years, especially when transitioning between different datasets or modifying network configurations.  The root cause often lies in a mismatch of dimensions, incompatible data types, or neglecting crucial initialization steps.

My experience troubleshooting these issues has highlighted three primary areas of concern: (1)  incorrect input and output layer dimensions, (2) improper data preprocessing, and (3) inadequate handling of activation functions and biases.  Addressing these three points systematically almost always resolves the problem.

**1. Input and Output Layer Dimension Mismatch:**

The most frequent cause of build failures is the mismatch between the network's expected input and output dimensions and the actual dimensions of the training data.  PyBrain expects precise alignment here.  If the input data has, say, 10 features, your input layer must have 10 neurons.  Similarly, if your output is a binary classification, your output layer should have a single neuron (using an appropriate activation function like sigmoid); for a multi-class classification problem with 5 classes, it requires 5 output neurons (often with a softmax activation).  Failure to match these dimensions will lead to a `ValueError` or a similar exception during the network creation phase.  The error message may be cryptic, but careful examination of the dimensions will always reveal the issue.

**Code Example 1: Correct Dimension Handling:**

```python
from pybrain.tools.shortcuts import buildNetwork
from pybrain.datasets import SupervisedDataSet
from pybrain.structure import SigmoidLayer

# Define input and output dimensions based on data
input_dim = 10
output_dim = 1  # Binary classification

# Create dataset (replace with your actual data loading)
ds = SupervisedDataSet(input_dim, output_dim)
ds.addSample((0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0), (1,))
ds.addSample((1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0), (0,))


# Build the network; specify hidden layer sizes as needed.
fnn = buildNetwork(input_dim, 5, output_dim, bias=True, hiddenclass=SigmoidLayer)

# Check the network structure (optional but recommended for debugging)
print(fnn.activateOnDataset(ds))

# Further training and evaluation steps would follow here.
```


This code snippet explicitly defines input and output dimensions based on the anticipated dataset. The use of `SupervisedDataSet` ensures consistency. The `buildNetwork` function is called with the correctly specified dimensions, and a hidden layer with 5 neurons is added.  The final print statement illustrates how to verify network activation on the dataset, checking for any dimensional mismatches.

**2. Data Preprocessing Oversights:**

Raw data rarely conforms to the requirements of a neural network.  Scaling, normalization, and handling missing values are often necessary.  PyBrain doesn't implicitly handle these steps; they must be explicitly performed before feeding data to the network.  For example, feature scaling (e.g., min-max scaling or standardization) can significantly improve convergence and accuracy.  Failing to scale numerical data can lead to numerical instability or slow training, potentially masked as a build failure.  Categorical features require appropriate encoding (one-hot encoding is commonly used).

**Code Example 2: Data Preprocessing:**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from pybrain.tools.shortcuts import buildNetwork
from pybrain.datasets import SupervisedDataSet

# Sample data (replace with your data)
data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
targets = np.array([[0], [1], [0], [1]])


# Scale input features using MinMaxScaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Create the dataset
input_dim = scaled_data.shape[1]
output_dim = targets.shape[1]
ds = SupervisedDataSet(input_dim, output_dim)

for i in range(len(scaled_data)):
    ds.addSample(scaled_data[i], targets[i])


# Build and train the network
fnn = buildNetwork(input_dim, 3, output_dim, bias=True)

# ... (training and evaluation steps) ...
```

Here, we utilize scikit-learn's `MinMaxScaler` for preprocessing. This crucial step ensures that the input features are appropriately scaled, preventing potential issues stemming from disparate ranges of values within the input data.  The rest of the code then follows the principles of appropriate dimension handling.


**3. Activation Functions and Biases:**

Incorrect handling of activation functions and biases can indirectly lead to build failures.  While not always directly reported as a build error, inconsistent activation choices or the omission of biases can lead to unexpected behavior during training, potentially manifesting as convergence problems or inexplicable results, easily mistaken for network construction issues.  Always explicitly specify the activation function for each layer, ensuring consistency with the nature of your data and task (e.g., sigmoid for binary classification, softmax for multi-class classification, ReLU or tanh for hidden layers).  Also, remember to include biases unless a specific architectural requirement dictates otherwise.


**Code Example 3: Activation Function and Bias Specification:**

```python
from pybrain.tools.shortcuts import buildNetwork
from pybrain.datasets import SupervisedDataSet
from pybrain.structure import SigmoidLayer, SoftmaxLayer

# Define input, hidden, and output layers explicitly
input_layer = 3
hidden_layer = 5
output_layer = 2  # multi-class


#Create Dataset (replace with your actual data)
ds = SupervisedDataSet(input_layer, output_layer)
ds.addSample([1,2,3],[1,0])
ds.addSample([4,5,6],[0,1])

# Build network with specified activation functions and bias
fnn = buildNetwork(input_layer, hidden_layer, output_layer, bias=True, hiddenclass=SigmoidLayer, outclass=SoftmaxLayer)

# ... (training and evaluation steps) ...
```

This example demonstrates the explicit declaration of layers and their respective activation functions using `SigmoidLayer` and `SoftmaxLayer`. The `bias=True` argument ensures that biases are included in each layer, preventing potential problems that may arise from their absence.


**Resource Recommendations:**

The PyBrain documentation,  a comprehensive textbook on neural networks, and relevant scientific publications detailing feedforward network architectures and training methodologies provide further in-depth information.  Exploring these resources will deepen your understanding of neural networks and aid in troubleshooting PyBrain-specific problems.  Focusing on understanding the mathematical underpinnings of network operation and activation functions is equally critical.
