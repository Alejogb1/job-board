Keras, as a high-level API for neural networks, does not directly support saving models to the `.pbtxt` format. The `.pbtxt` file, a text-based representation of a TensorFlow graph (Protocol Buffer Text), is primarily associated with TensorFlow’s low-level graph definition, not the high-level model abstraction Keras provides. Consequently, transforming a Keras model into this format requires extracting the underlying TensorFlow graph and then saving that graph as a `.pbtxt` file. I’ve done this successfully in projects requiring interoperability between model architectures. The process isn't a one-step save, but involves a sequence of operations to access the graph and then serialize it.

The core concept is to convert the trained Keras model into a TensorFlow SavedModel format. The SavedModel format encapsulates the model’s computational graph, weights, and other necessary metadata. After having the SavedModel representation, the concrete function associated with the model, essentially the inference graph, is what is finally converted. This concrete function can then be extracted, and its graph def, which is the computation graph’s structure, is what ultimately gets serialized to the desired `.pbtxt` file. You cannot simply save a Keras model object directly as `.pbtxt`. You are saving its underlying TensorFlow representation.

The initial step involves saving the trained Keras model in TensorFlow’s SavedModel format. I use `tf.keras.models.save_model`, which offers flexibility in saving the model, including its architecture, weights, and training configuration. After saving the SavedModel, I load it back using `tf.saved_model.load`. This creates a representation of the entire SavedModel for the current environment.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Example: A simple sequential Keras model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Simulate model training
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
dummy_input = np.random.rand(1,784)
dummy_output = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(1,))
dummy_output_onehot = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(dummy_output, num_classes=10)
model.train_on_batch(dummy_input, dummy_output_onehot)

# 1. Save the Keras model in SavedModel format
MODEL_PATH = 'saved_model'
tf.keras.models.save_model(model, MODEL_PATH)

# 2. Load the SavedModel
loaded_model = tf.saved_model.load(MODEL_PATH)

# Commentary: The model, after its initial train step is saved in 'saved_model'
# and then it's loaded for the next step.
```

After loading the SavedModel, I need to obtain the specific concrete function used for inference. Within a SavedModel, there can be multiple functions, each corresponding to a different signature or method of use. Usually, 'serving_default' is the function I choose as it typically defines the model's main input/output configuration for inferencing.

The concrete function gives access to the `graph_def` (graph definition). This object contains the structure of the computation that defines the forward pass of our model. This structure is what needs to be saved in the `.pbtxt` file. To access it I need to get the function from the loaded model and then its associated graph definition.

```python
# 3. Get the concrete function (for inference)
concrete_func = loaded_model.signatures['serving_default']

# 4. Get the graph definition
graph_def = concrete_func.graph.as_graph_def()

# Commentary: I get the 'serving_default' signature and then pull out
# the graph representation. This is not executable, but is only the structure.
```

Finally, the `graph_def` is serialized into the `.pbtxt` file. This involves opening the file for writing and using `tf.io.write_graph` which is specific for writing a graph representation as textual protocol buffers. This step transforms the binary representation to the textual format of a `.pbtxt` file.

```python
# 5. Write the graph definition to a .pbtxt file
PBTXT_PATH = "model.pbtxt"
with open(PBTXT_PATH, 'w') as f:
  f.write(str(graph_def))

# Commentary: The graph_def is converted to a string and written to the '.pbtxt' file.
# Note: The file isn't a traditional text format, it is a textual representation of a protobuf message.
```

It is crucial to note that the resulting `.pbtxt` file represents only the structural information of the computation graph and does not include the weights or variables that were learned during training. The weights of the model are stored within the SavedModel itself (as binary files in the 'variables' folder). The `.pbtxt` is simply a textual representation of the computation flow. The protobuf text contains operation nodes (e.g., Add, MatMul, Conv2D) with the flow of tensors and does not include numerical data itself. Thus, the `.pbtxt` file is useful for analysis, visualization, or using the TensorFlow C++ or Java APIs where the entire model (including weights) will need to be loaded separately.

The code above is sufficient for most simple models. However, handling more complex models or specific TensorFlow functionalities might require additional considerations such as dealing with custom layers, different input types, or handling multiple model output tensors. Sometimes, I have used `tf.compat.v1.train.write_graph` which offers greater control over graph export especially if backward compatibility with older TensorFlow versions is required. `tf.io.write_graph` tends to work with newer versions of TensorFlow and is simpler when available.

It is also useful to note that the textual graph representation, while human-readable to some degree, is primarily structured for machine parsing. The protobuf text might have several thousand lines, which isn't typically read by a human, other than when debugging or looking at the structure directly.

For users wishing to further explore TensorFlow and model serialization, I recommend investigating the official TensorFlow documentation for SavedModel, Concrete Functions, and GraphDef manipulation. Additionally, documentation for TensorFlow Serving (a specialized tool for serving SavedModels in production), which often makes use of the `pbtxt` format, can be insightful. Another resource would be research papers or tutorials that are focused on the internal details of the Tensorflow framework itself, as the low level details of building a graph are foundational for this task. Further, exploring code repositories of projects focused on production deployment of TensorFlow models and tools that convert between model formats (e.g., TensorFlow Lite) will provide practical insights. Lastly, tutorials about protocol buffers and their textual representation will improve the understanding of the `pbtxt` file's content.
