TensorFlow 2.5's C++ performance characteristics undergo a significant shift when eager execution is disabled.  My experience optimizing large-scale deep learning models for deployment within resource-constrained environments consistently revealed that disabling eager execution leads to substantial performance gains, but necessitates a more deliberate approach to code structuring and execution management.  This stems from the fundamental differences in how TensorFlow operates under these two modes.

**1. Explanation:**

Eager execution, enabled by default in TensorFlow 2.x, provides an imperative, Python-like programming style. Operations are executed immediately upon evaluation. This simplifies debugging and prototyping but sacrifices performance due to the overhead of runtime interpretation and the lack of graph optimization.  Disabling eager execution shifts the execution model to a graph-based paradigm.  The TensorFlow computational graph is constructed first, then optimized and executed. This optimization step, typically performed through XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra), significantly improves performance, particularly for computationally intensive tasks and repeated operations.  XLA compiles the graph into highly optimized machine code, leveraging hardware acceleration like GPUs and TPUs effectively.

However, this performance benefit comes at the cost of reduced flexibility.  Debugging becomes more complex, requiring the examination of the compiled graph. Dynamic control flow, heavily reliant on runtime decisions, becomes more challenging to implement efficiently within the static graph context.  Furthermore, the code requires more careful planning to avoid bottlenecks and ensure efficient data flow through the optimized graph. My past work involved migrating a complex object detection model from eager execution to graph execution, a process that initially resulted in unexpected performance regressions due to inadequate handling of tensor allocation and data transfer between CPU and GPU.

In TensorFlow 2.5's C++ API, disabling eager execution primarily involves using `tf::Graph` and related functions to construct and execute the computation graph explicitly. The absence of immediate evaluation requires a proactive approach to managing tensors and operations within the graph's context.  Efficient graph construction and careful management of resource allocation are critical for optimal performance.  This often involves utilizing techniques like tensor shape inference, constant folding, and careful placement of operations across devices.  Ignoring these details can negate the potential performance advantages offered by graph-based execution.

**2. Code Examples:**

**Example 1: Simple Matrix Multiplication (Eager Execution):**

```cpp
#include "tensorflow/core/public/session.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"

int main() {
  tensorflow::Session* session = tensorflow::NewSession(tensorflow::SessionOptions());

  tensorflow::Tensor a(tensorflow::DT_FLOAT, {2, 2});
  tensorflow::Tensor b(tensorflow::DT_FLOAT, {2, 2});
  a.matrix<float>()(0, 0) = 1.0f;  a.matrix<float>()(0, 1) = 2.0f;
  a.matrix<float>()(1, 0) = 3.0f;  a.matrix<float>()(1, 1) = 4.0f;
  b.matrix<float>()(0, 0) = 5.0f;  b.matrix<float>()(0, 1) = 6.0f;
  b.matrix<float>()(1, 0) = 7.0f;  b.matrix<float>()(1, 1) = 8.0f;

  tensorflow::Tensor result;
  tensorflow::ops::MatMul matmul_op;
  TF_CHECK_OK(matmul_op.Create(session, {a, b}, {}, &result));
  
  // ... Access and print result ...

  session->Close();
  return 0;
}

```
This uses the eager execution approach, with immediate computation. Note the direct use of TensorFlow operations and the immediate result retrieval.


**Example 2: Simple Matrix Multiplication (Graph Execution):**

```cpp
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/graph.pb.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/public/session.h"

int main() {
  tensorflow::GraphDef graph_def;
  // ... Construct the graph_def using tf::NodeDef ...  (Adding MatMul node explicitly)
  tensorflow::Session* session = tensorflow::NewSession(tensorflow::SessionOptions());
  TF_CHECK_OK(session->Create(graph_def));
  // ... Run the session with appropriate input tensors ...

  session->Close();
  return 0;
}
```
This example highlights the graph-based approach.  `graph_def` would need to be populated with nodes representing the matrix multiplication operation, input placeholders, and output tensors.  The graph is constructed separately and then executed. This allows for graph optimization before execution.

**Example 3: Incorporating XLA for Optimization:**

```cpp
#include "tensorflow/compiler/xla/client/client_library.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/common_runtime/function.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.h"
#include "tensorflow/core/public/session.h"


int main() {
  // ...  Construct the graph with a FunctionDef to leverage XLA compilation ...
  tensorflow::SessionOptions options;
  options.config.mutable_graph_options()->set_optimizer_options(optimizer_options); //Enable XLA JIT
  tensorflow::Session* session = tensorflow::NewSession(options);
  TF_CHECK_OK(session->Create(graph_def));
    // ... Run the session ...

  session->Close();
  return 0;
}

```
This code snippet showcases using XLA for optimization. `optimizer_options` within `SessionOptions` would need appropriate configuration to enable XLA compilation (JIT or AOT). This step significantly boosts performance but requires a deeper understanding of TensorFlow's graph optimization mechanisms and potential compatibility issues with certain operations.  The `FunctionDef` allows you to define subgraphs that can be compiled by XLA.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

The official TensorFlow documentation for C++ is your primary source of information. Pay close attention to the sections detailing graph construction, session management, and optimization options.  Familiarity with protocol buffers (`*.pb`) is crucial for understanding graph representation.  The TensorFlow C++ API reference provides detailed explanations of individual functions and classes.  Understanding the concepts of graph execution and optimization within TensorFlow is vital for effectively utilizing the C++ API without eager execution. Studying  resources on linear algebra and numerical computation will enhance your ability to optimize graph structures for better performance.  Deep dives into the inner workings of XLA and its interactions with TensorFlow will enable advanced performance tuning.
