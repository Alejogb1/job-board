Debugging a sequential PyTorch model requires a systematic approach, often diverging from the straightforward debugging of standard Python code. The inherent black-box nature of neural networks, combined with the potential for silent numerical instabilities and the complexities of backpropagation, necessitates a multi-faceted strategy. I’ve spent the last five years building and debugging various PyTorch models, and have found that focusing on data integrity, modular testing, and meticulous output analysis are key to success.

First, I always prioritize data verification. A model is only as good as the data it trains on, so discrepancies between expected inputs and actual inputs can manifest as puzzling training behavior or unexpected error spikes. Start by examining the input tensors before they are fed into the model. This can involve visually inspecting the data if it represents images or audio, or checking statistical properties like mean, variance, and range for numerical data. I use simple print statements coupled with the tensor’s `.shape` attribute to confirm the expected dimensionality. Furthermore, before any training run, I generate a small batch of data, manually compute the model's output using a simplified version of the forward pass (often breaking down layers individually) and verify those results against expectations. This ensures that even the initial parameter values produce sensible outputs given the initial data conditions.

The modular construction of PyTorch models lends itself well to modular debugging. Rather than treating the entire model as a monolithic block, I focus on testing each individual layer or module separately. This "divide and conquer" strategy allows for the isolation of problems, making it far easier to pinpoint the source of a bug. I often create simple test functions that take a dummy input tensor and pass it through a specific layer, comparing the resultant tensor with expected values or with the output from a trusted reference. This often highlights issues with dimension mismatches, incorrect activation function implementations, or even faulty batch normalization layers.

Additionally, careful scrutiny of the gradients during backpropagation is crucial for understanding the model's learning behavior. While error and loss values might provide a general indication of progress, the gradients reveal the specific direction in which model parameters are adjusting. Extremely large gradients can point to unstable operations, possibly related to improper weight initialization or exploding activation values. Conversely, vanishing gradients (gradients approaching zero) often indicate that a layer is not learning adequately. I frequently use `torch.autograd.grad` to inspect gradients at different layers, ensuring that they are neither too large nor too small, and are within an expected range. The gradients should generally point towards improving the model's performance.

I will now provide three code examples to illustrate some common debugging techniques.

**Example 1: Input Data Verification**

This example demonstrates how to verify the shape and content of input data before passing it through the model. This is critical to catch errors early, especially when working with custom datasets or complex data transformations.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 5)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Simulate a data batch
data = torch.randn(32, 5)  # Incorrect shape: should be (32, 10)

# Check the shape
print(f"Data shape before model: {data.shape}")

# Expected shape is (batch_size, input_features), let's create correct input
data_correct = torch.randn(32, 10)

# Create model instance
model = SimpleModel()

# Debug print before model
print("Shape Before model input:", data_correct.shape)

# Forward pass
try:
    output = model(data) #will raise error, as dimensions don't match
    print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error encountered: {e}")

# Correct input
output_correct = model(data_correct)
print(f"Output shape with correct input: {output_correct.shape}")

# Check the values range for correctness
print("Input data range [min, max] values for first sample:", data_correct[0].min(), data_correct[0].max())

```

In this case, the code simulates an error due to mismatched shapes, demonstrating how to use print statements for early detection and correction of data issues. This practice can save a lot of time later down the road, since model forward passes will be failing to run due to shape mismatches. Checking the shape of the input will greatly reduce the chance of getting unexpected errors. Additionally, print statements are used to check the range of values and ensure no NaN or infinity values are present.

**Example 2: Modular Testing of Layers**

This example showcases how to test individual layers of the network to identify potential problems in their implementations. Here, we test a linear layer.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define the linear layer and some dummy input
linear_layer = nn.Linear(10, 5)
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 10)

# Manually compute a forward pass for verification
with torch.no_grad():
  weights = linear_layer.weight
  bias = linear_layer.bias
  manual_output = torch.matmul(dummy_input, weights.T) + bias

# Forward pass through the layer
layer_output = linear_layer(dummy_input)

# Check shape of the output
print("Shape of layer output:", layer_output.shape)

# Compare with manually computed output
print("First Output manually:", manual_output)
print("First Output model   :", layer_output)
print("Are output results close?: ", torch.allclose(manual_output, layer_output, atol=1e-5))


# More complex example using a small batch
dummy_batch_input = torch.randn(4, 10)
batch_output = linear_layer(dummy_batch_input)
print("Shape of batch output:", batch_output.shape)

```

By performing a manual forward pass, and comparing it to the forward pass from the PyTorch linear layer itself, I am able to very efficiently catch errors with my layer code. For example if I did not put the transpose operator `.T` I would know something was off based on the differences between manual and model output. Furthermore, the example shows the check for a single output and also for batch input to make sure dimensions are still aligned when dealing with batch sizes larger than one.

**Example 3: Gradient Inspection**

This example demonstrates how to examine the gradients of the weights during training, which can be useful in detecting issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        return self.sigmoid(x)


# Generate a sample input and target
X = torch.randn(1, 10, requires_grad=True)
y = torch.randn(1, 1)

# Instantiate model, loss function, and optimizer
model = SimpleModel()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Zero the gradients and compute the forward pass
optimizer.zero_grad()
output = model(X)

# Calculate the loss and perform backpropagation
loss = criterion(output, y)
loss.backward()

# Inspect the gradients of the weight parameter
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if param.grad is not None:
        print(f"Gradient for {name}: min:{param.grad.min()}, max:{param.grad.max()}")
    else:
      print(f"Parameter {name} has no gradient")

# Perform optimizer step (simulate a training step)
optimizer.step()

```

In this example, I observe the gradients of the linear layer after backpropagation to ensure they are in the expected ranges. If there was an issue with loss formulation, this example would quickly reveal such problem by demonstrating large gradient numbers. The example is deliberately minimalistic, but serves to demonstrate how to use `.grad` attributes and what data to expect after backpropagation.

These three examples are by no means exhaustive, but provide some starting points on effective debugging strategies. Remember that the debugging process is iterative; it will require time and patience and will refine your debugging skills over time.

For further resources, I recommend delving into PyTorch’s official documentation, which is exceptionally well-structured and includes detailed explanations of core concepts and techniques. In addition to the primary documentation, there are several excellent online tutorials and blog posts dedicated to debugging specific neural network architectures or loss functions. These resources provide valuable insights into common problems and their solutions. Moreover, having a solid theoretical understanding of the underlying mathematical principles behind backpropagation, gradient descent, and activation functions will make the debugging process easier. I recommend textbooks focusing on deep learning theory as beneficial supplemental material. Finally, consider exploring open-source implementations of similar model architectures, which can provide additional perspective and ideas for identifying errors in your own code.
