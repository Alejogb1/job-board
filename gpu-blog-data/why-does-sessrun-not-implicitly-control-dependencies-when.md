TensorFlow's explicit dependency management via `tf.control_dependencies` stems from its graph-based computation model, a key characteristic differentiating it from immediate execution paradigms. In my experience building large-scale machine learning pipelines, I’ve observed firsthand that understanding this distinction is paramount to avoiding subtle bugs and performance bottlenecks. `sess.run` does not, and fundamentally *cannot*, implicitly handle dependencies when accessing a variable because it operates on the static computational graph, not on a dynamic, instruction-by-instruction basis.

To illustrate, consider that TensorFlow first defines the entire set of operations as a computational graph, which represents the dependencies between calculations. Variables, defined using `tf.Variable`, are nodes in this graph, distinct from the operations that modify them. When you use `sess.run` with a variable as the fetch, you're essentially asking for the current value of that variable, as it is at that point in time based on previous executions of relevant operations in the graph, *not* requesting all operations necessary to arrive at a specific state. The execution of an operation that potentially *changes* a variable, like a gradient update, must be explicitly requested via `sess.run`. This separation provides TensorFlow the ability to optimize the execution of the graph, including parallelization and distributed processing, but also necessitates explicit dependency management.

If `sess.run` were to infer all necessary dependencies for a variable, the static nature of the graph would be rendered useless. Imagine a scenario where variable 'A' depends on the outcome of computation ‘B’, and a later computation ‘C’ modifies ‘A’. If I simply called `sess.run(A)`, and if TensorFlow implicitly included all dependency operations, the computation ‘B’ and ‘C’ would be executed by default every time you ask for the value of variable A, whether you intended for it or not. This would introduce a significant performance overhead since we might intend to only read the variable rather than mutate it every single call. It could also result in inconsistent behavior where the variable's value changes unexpectedly whenever the variable itself is fetched, even without intending to modify its underlying state through an operation. The developer needs fine-grained control over when specific operations are executed and when to only retrieve a state value; the separation between fetches and operations on the graph is central to TensorFlow's design.

Moreover, consider operations that might have side effects such as reading data from a queue, or modifying external states. If `sess.run` implicitly included all dependencies for a variable, it would be challenging to manage these side effects and ensure correct behavior. You would not want data loaded from a queue, for instance, every time you read a variable, or to have model parameters inadvertently changed during a validation step if dependency was implicit.

Let's examine concrete code examples. Here’s a basic illustration:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Initialize a variable with a starting value
var_a = tf.Variable(initial_value=0, dtype=tf.int32)

# Define an operation to add 1 to the variable
increment_op = tf.assign_add(var_a, 1)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer()) # Initialize variables

    print(sess.run(var_a)) # Prints 0, as the variable is initialized and not incremented yet
    sess.run(increment_op) # Executes the operation to increment the variable
    print(sess.run(var_a)) # Prints 1, as the variable has been incremented

```

In this snippet, we initialize a variable `var_a` to zero. We then create an operation, `increment_op`, to add one to it. Notice that the first `sess.run(var_a)` prints 0, the initialized value. While we've created the *operation* to increment `var_a`, it will not execute if it is not directly requested. It's only after `sess.run(increment_op)` that the operation is executed and the subsequent `sess.run(var_a)` yields 1. This highlights that reading a variable's value does not inherently trigger all potentially associated operations. You have to request the operation explicitly via `sess.run` to alter the variable.

Now consider an example with multiple updates, demonstrating why this explicit nature is crucial:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

var_b = tf.Variable(0, dtype=tf.int32)
increment_b_op = tf.assign_add(var_b, 1)

with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
  sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

  #Execute update twice
  sess.run(increment_b_op)
  sess.run(increment_b_op)

  print(sess.run(var_b)) #prints 2

  #Execute update 3 more times
  for i in range(3):
      sess.run(increment_b_op)

  print(sess.run(var_b)) #prints 5

```

Here, the variable `var_b` is incremented first twice and then, after accessing its value, it is incremented 3 more times. We can see that value of `var_b` reflects the total number of update calls made via `sess.run(increment_b_op)`. This clear separation allows for precise control over the update frequency and order.  Without explicit control, one could unintentionally update a variable multiple times when just retrieving its current state in complex scenarios.

Finally, let's see how to use `tf.control_dependencies` to enforce an explicit dependency:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

var_c = tf.Variable(0, dtype=tf.int32)
increment_c_op = tf.assign_add(var_c, 1)
with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
    sess.run(tf.compat.v1.global_variables_initializer())

    with tf.compat.v1.control_dependencies([increment_c_op]):
        var_c_with_dep = tf.identity(var_c) # Identity is the same as using the variable itself

    print(sess.run(var_c_with_dep)) #Prints 1

    print(sess.run(var_c)) #Prints 1

    with tf.compat.v1.control_dependencies([increment_c_op]):
        var_c_with_dep2 = tf.identity(var_c) # Identity is the same as using the variable itself

    print(sess.run(var_c_with_dep2)) #prints 2


```
Here, we explicitly require that `increment_c_op` is executed before the `var_c_with_dep` node is evaluated.  The `tf.control_dependencies` ensures that the update operation is carried out, despite asking for `var_c`'s value. It's important to note that `tf.identity` does not perform any operations, it merely outputs the same input, and is only used as a hook to add dependencies to the fetch operation. If `tf.identity` is replaced with simply `var_c` then the output will not be different than the case when no dependency was specified on fetching variable. This shows that by default accessing a variable will not trigger its associated update operation, even when under `tf.control_dependencies` the dependency only gets triggered if an *operation* is requested under its context via `sess.run`.

To deepen understanding on these concepts, I would recommend focusing on the TensorFlow documentation for the computational graph concept, paying special attention to the description of `tf.Graph`, `tf.Operation`, `tf.Variable`, and `tf.Session`. Furthermore, understanding of how control flow works within a graph as covered in `tf.control_dependencies` and `tf.cond` will be helpful. Books and tutorials focused on TensorFlow's internals can further clarify these underlying design choices. The key takeaways are that TensorFlow’s reliance on a static graph necessitates explicit dependency management, and `sess.run` fetches results of operations that were directly or indirectly requested, without inferring implied operations required to achieve a particular variable state.  This is an intentional and key design feature, which provides the core of TensorFlow’s performance capabilities and flexibility.
