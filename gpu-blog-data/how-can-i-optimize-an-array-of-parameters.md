Optimizing an array of parameters using a custom loss function presents a challenge often encountered beyond textbook machine learning scenarios. I've faced this specifically when designing novel simulation algorithms, where performance isn't dictated by traditional metrics like classification accuracy. The core issue arises because standard optimization libraries are typically designed around pre-defined, differentiable loss functions. When we deviate from those, we need to explicitly provide the gradient information or use gradient-free methods, which can be computationally expensive. My experience has shown that the most efficient approach involves a combination of understanding the loss function’s properties and choosing the appropriate optimization technique.

Let's consider a scenario where we're tuning the parameters of a physical simulation. Our goal isn't to minimize an error in prediction but to maximize the stability of the simulation, which we quantify using a metric I'll call 'stability_score.' This 'stability_score' isn't differentiable in the classic sense; it's derived from a complex iterative process, making automatic differentiation unusable. Furthermore, we can't easily compute its analytical gradient.

The crucial step is to decide on an optimization algorithm. Gradient descent and its variants rely on gradients and are inappropriate here. Given the non-differentiable nature and my limited knowledge of its surface characteristics, I've typically opted for gradient-free methods. Among those, evolutionary algorithms, specifically the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), have often proved most robust for me in these cases. CMA-ES can search the parameter space effectively without relying on gradient information, and its adaptive nature is advantageous when facing a complex, potentially non-convex, landscape. However, a simpler method, like coordinate descent, can often provide sufficient optimization speed if the parameter interaction is low and can be a reasonable starting point.

Let's elaborate with a simple example. Say we have a simulation where our parameters are represented by a one-dimensional NumPy array `params` which controls the simulation's properties. Our `stability_score` function evaluates the simulation given `params`. The objective is to find the `params` array that maximizes the `stability_score`.

First, consider a basic implementation using coordinate descent for optimizing a one-dimensional parameter space:

```python
import numpy as np

def simulation(params):
  """
  A placeholder for the complex simulation that generates an output for
  analysis. We represent this as some dummy calculation for now.
  """
  return (params - 2)**2 + 1 # Example of non-trivial performance curve.

def stability_score(output):
    """
    Computes the stability score (our non-differentiable loss function).
    """
    return -output # we are minimizing

def optimize_coord_descent(initial_params, learning_rate=0.1, iterations=100):
  """
  Optimize parameters using coordinate descent.
  """
  params = np.array(initial_params, dtype=float)
  num_params = params.size
  for _ in range(iterations):
    for i in range(num_params):
      current_score = stability_score(simulation(params))
      params[i] += learning_rate
      new_score_plus = stability_score(simulation(params))
      params[i] -= 2 * learning_rate
      new_score_minus = stability_score(simulation(params))
      if new_score_plus > current_score and new_score_plus > new_score_minus:
          continue # keep move forward
      elif new_score_minus > current_score:
          learning_rate *= -1 # reverse direction
          params[i] += 2 * learning_rate
          continue
      else:
        params[i] += learning_rate

  return params

initial_params = np.array([0.0]) # Starting param value.
optimized_params = optimize_coord_descent(initial_params)
print(f"Optimized parameters: {optimized_params}")
```

In this coordinate descent example, I iteratively vary each parameter individually and check if that variation yields a better score. It’s simple but often slow for high-dimensional parameter spaces. The `simulation` function represents the actual process providing an output for analysis, while the `stability_score` function assesses that output. The core optimization is within `optimize_coord_descent` where we are cycling through individual parameters and modifying them to reduce the negative `stability_score` (maximizing it). This is a basic example and can be further modified to reduce the learning rate as optimization progresses.

For a more robust method, let's introduce CMA-ES. While implementing it from scratch is intricate, libraries like `cma` provide ready-to-use solutions. This approach often requires careful tuning of its parameters but can offer a better trade-off between performance and the ability to handle complex loss function landscapes.

```python
import cma
import numpy as np

def simulation(params):
    """
    A placeholder for the complex simulation.
    """
    return (np.sum(params) - 2)**2 + 1 # Example output

def stability_score(output):
    """
    Computes the stability score (our loss function).
    """
    return -output # we are minimizing

def objective_function(params):
    """
    Combines simulation and loss function for optimization.
    """
    output = simulation(params)
    score = stability_score(output)
    return score

initial_params = np.array([0.0, 0.0]) # Starting params.
sigma = 0.5    # Initial standard deviation.
es = cma.CMAEvolutionStrategy(initial_params, sigma) # using cma package for CMAES

optimized_params = es.optimize(objective_function).result.xbest

print(f"Optimized parameters: {optimized_params}")
```

In this CMA-ES example, `cma` handles the iterative search process, adapting the covariance matrix of the search distribution to efficiently locate the optimum. The `objective_function` is the combination of running a simulation using current parameters and calculating the `stability_score`. This library method is considerably less verbose than implementing CMA-ES from scratch. Note that I'm using a simplified simulation with `np.sum(params)`, which is more robust in higher dimensions than my earlier single parameter case.

If our parameter space has known structure, we can often improve performance by incorporating domain knowledge. For example, if we know some parameters are bounded, we can use a bounded optimization technique within the coordinate descent framework or within `cma-es`.

```python
import numpy as np
import cma

def simulation(params):
    """
    A placeholder for the complex simulation.
    """
    return (params[0] - 2)**2 + (params[1] - 2)**2 + 1

def stability_score(output):
    """
    Computes the stability score.
    """
    return -output

def objective_function(params):
    """
    Combines simulation and score for optimization.
    """
    output = simulation(params)
    score = stability_score(output)
    return score

initial_params = np.array([0.0, 0.0])
bounds = [[-5, 5], [-5, 5]] # Example bounds for each param.
sigma = 0.5
es = cma.CMAEvolutionStrategy(initial_params, sigma, {'bounds': bounds})
optimized_params = es.optimize(objective_function).result.xbest

print(f"Optimized parameters: {optimized_params}")
```

In this modified CMA-ES example, the `bounds` argument limits the search space for individual parameters, potentially speeding up optimization by preventing the algorithm from exploring irrelevant regions. This method can also improve robustness in simulations which have well defined reasonable parameters or where parameter combinations can produce invalid or very low quality outputs. The key here is that a-priori knowledge of bounds is integrated directly into the optimization process.

In conclusion, optimizing with non-standard loss functions requires a shift from automatic differentiation to gradient-free methods. Coordinate descent provides a simple entry point, but CMA-ES tends to be more robust in practical situations. Furthermore, understanding the properties of your parameter space, including bounds or constraints, can significantly improve the convergence rate and quality of the optimization.

For further study, I would recommend investigating literature on:

1.  **Gradient-Free Optimization Techniques:** Particularly research into CMA-ES, Particle Swarm Optimization, and other evolutionary algorithms. Understand their theoretical underpinnings, strengths, and weaknesses.

2.  **Parameter Tuning Strategies for Optimization Algorithms:** Pay particular attention to learning rate adjustments, population sizes in genetic algorithms, and the impact of various parameters on convergence speed. There is often a tradeoff to be made between exploration and convergence speed.

3.  **Case Studies of Custom Loss Function Optimization:** Examine real-world examples, especially those from domains similar to your application. These will give you insights into the practical challenges and effective solutions.

By combining knowledge of algorithms and a practical approach to problem-solving, it’s possible to optimize performance even in the presence of unconventional performance metrics.
