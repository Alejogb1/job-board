The core reason `loss.backward()` might fail to propagate gradients in a PyTorch neural network, despite a seemingly correct forward pass, often stems from the lack of a computation graph involving the parameters intended to be updated, typically stemming from `requires_grad` misconfigurations. I've debugged similar issues across various model architectures during my time developing deep learning systems for time-series anomaly detection, where subtle errors in tensor operations could silently disable crucial gradient flows.

To elaborate, PyTorchâ€™s automatic differentiation engine constructs a dynamic computation graph during the forward pass. This graph meticulously tracks every operation on tensors that have `requires_grad=True`, allowing it to trace back and calculate gradients using the chain rule during the backward pass. If a tensor intended to contribute to the parameter update does not have this property set correctly, or is detached inadvertently from this graph, no gradient will be calculated. The symptom is a silently non-updated model, where losses might decrease initially, but quickly stagnate as training progresses.

Three broad scenarios commonly manifest in this issue, and I will illustrate each with practical examples drawn from my experience:

**Scenario 1: Tensors without `requires_grad`**

Often, the problem lies in not explicitly setting `requires_grad=True` on the tensors corresponding to the model's parameters, especially when dealing with custom layers or parameter initializations not leveraging PyTorch's built-in components (e.g. `nn.Linear`, `nn.Conv2d`,). If the tensors holding the learnable weights and biases aren't flagged for gradient tracking, the `loss.backward()` call won't have the connection to update them.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class CustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        # Incorrect: No requires_grad
        self.weights = torch.randn(input_size, output_size)
        self.bias = torch.zeros(output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.matmul(x, self.weights) + self.bias


input_size = 10
output_size = 5
model = CustomLayer(input_size, output_size)

# Sample input
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, input_size)

# Loss & optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

output = model(input_tensor)
target = torch.randn(1, output_size)
loss = criterion(output, target)
loss.backward() # This will not update the weights

for name, param in model.named_parameters():
   if param.grad is not None:
        print(f"Parameter {name}: has gradient")
   else:
       print(f"Parameter {name}: gradient is None")

```

In this code, the weights and biases inside `CustomLayer` are created as plain tensors without `requires_grad=True`. Consequently, when `loss.backward()` is called, the gradients related to these parameters are not calculated, leaving the parameters unchanged after the optimizer step (not shown here). Checking for `.grad` attribute, would print 'Parameter None', indicating no gradient was computed for the parameters.

The fix involves modifying the initialization:

```python
class CustomLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        # Correct: Setting requires_grad=True
        self.weights = torch.randn(input_size, output_size, requires_grad=True)
        self.bias = torch.zeros(output_size, requires_grad=True)

    def forward(self, x):
         return torch.matmul(x, self.weights) + self.bias
```
By explicitly setting `requires_grad=True`, the computation graph will track the operations on these tensors, allowing backpropagation to compute gradients and update parameters.

**Scenario 2: Accidental Detachment from the Graph**

A second common issue is the inadvertent detachment of a tensor from the computation graph. PyTorch provides the `detach()` operation specifically for this purpose, but sometimes this can happen in subtle, less obvious ways, especially if tensor operations are performed outside of the forward function. This can result in no gradients propagating through that point. For instance, if a tensor used as input for a subsequent layer is modified with a `no_grad` context, then the gradient won't be calculated in any operations that depend on this tensor.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class MyModel(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
      super().__init__()
      self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
      self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

  def forward(self, x):
      x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))

      with torch.no_grad():
          #Problematic: Tensor operations under torch.no_grad
          x_manipulated = x * 2  # Example of manipulation

      x = self.fc2(x_manipulated)
      return x

input_size = 10
hidden_size = 5
output_size = 2

model = MyModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, input_size)
target = torch.randn(1, output_size)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr = 0.01)
optimizer.zero_grad()
output = model(input_tensor)
loss = criterion(output,target)
loss.backward()

for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if param.grad is not None:
        print(f"Parameter {name}: has gradient")
    else:
       print(f"Parameter {name}: gradient is None")
```

In this snippet, even though the initial `x` tensor is generated through operations involving parameters of `fc1`, all operations inside the `torch.no_grad()` context do not get tracked by the computation graph.  Therefore, when backpropagation occurs, it will be unable to trace back past the output of `torch.no_grad` block to the `fc1` layer as the dependency is severed. This effectively prevents the gradients from flowing back to the model and updating the weights of the `fc1` layer.

The fix, in this scenario, requires removing the problematic `no_grad` context (or, if intentional, modifying the architecture to appropriately handle the detached tensor).  Usually, manipulations that are not part of the model architecture can be done on CPU and then feed back as another tensor on the forward function.

**Scenario 3: Using Out-of-place Operations**

Another subtle pitfall lies in using out-of-place tensor operations.  An out-of-place operation creates a new tensor, rather than modifying it in place. This can unknowingly break the connection to the computation graph if the new tensor replaces the old one, and that replacement is used in the subsequent steps. For example, while simple arithmetic operations like addition are usually tracked correctly, some operations, especially those involving indices, might create new tensors without `requires_grad` set.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class IndexManipulator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.weights = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(5, 5))

    def forward(self, x):
         #Incorrect: Out of place indexed manipulation
        x_altered = self.weights[0:2, 0:2]
        return torch.matmul(x, x_altered)

input_size = 5
model = IndexManipulator()
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 5)
target = torch.randn(1, 2)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr = 0.01)
optimizer.zero_grad()
output = model(input_tensor)
loss = criterion(output,target)
loss.backward()

for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if param.grad is not None:
         print(f"Parameter {name}: has gradient")
    else:
        print(f"Parameter {name}: gradient is None")
```
Here, the slicing operation `self.weights[0:2, 0:2]` creates a new tensor that is not part of the computational graph. The gradient can not flow back to `self.weights`.

The fix often involves using the more explicit `torch.nn.functional` operations that are more robust regarding gradient propagation.  For example, if slicing was not intended, the intended behavior is likely the element-wise multiplication of tensors `x` and `self.weights`, therefore we should use `torch.matmul`.

To resolve this, the code should be modified as follows:

```python
class IndexManipulator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.weights = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(5, 5))

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.matmul(x, self.weights)
```

In summary, correctly setting `requires_grad`, careful handling of detached tensors, and mindful use of in-place versus out-of-place tensor operations are essential for ensuring gradients propagate properly. When faced with this type of issue, systematically examining these potential problem areas is usually the most effective approach.

For further study, I recommend consulting the PyTorch documentation specifically on Automatic Differentiation, along with resources detailing the construction of custom layers and backpropagation. Textbooks covering deep learning fundamentals often include chapters on these topics that provide a theoretical foundation. Examining the source code of commonly used PyTorch layers (`nn.Linear`, `nn.Conv2d`, etc.) will illustrate proper techniques for integrating parameters into models.
