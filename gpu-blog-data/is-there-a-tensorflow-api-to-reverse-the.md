The core issue arises from the nature of the `indices` attribute of a `tf.SparseTensor`. This attribute directly provides the coordinates of non-zero elements within the sparse tensor's defined shape. The operation `segment_ids = sp_ids.indices[:, 0]` specifically extracts the first column of these coordinates, effectively isolating the segment identifier in scenarios where each row of the sparse tensor represents a segment of a larger sequence or dataset. The question seeks a method to derive the original `indices` from just this `segment_ids` vector, a task that, without additional information, is generally not reversible in a direct, lossless fashion using TensorFlow APIs.

The reason for this irreversibility stems from the loss of information. The `segment_ids` vector only retains the first dimension (usually corresponding to batch or sequence ID) of each non-zero element's location. The subsequent dimensions, which specify the position within that segment, are discarded. Therefore, to recover the original `indices`, one needs either those other dimensions or a set of rules to infer them, which is usually not possible solely from the `segment_ids` vector itself.

Let's consider a hypothetical example. Assume a sparse tensor `sp_ids` with the following structure:

```
tf.SparseTensor(indices=[[0, 1], [0, 4], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 3]], values=[10, 20, 30, 40, 50], dense_shape=[3, 5])
```

Here, `sp_ids.indices` would be `[[0, 1], [0, 4], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 3]]`. When applying `segment_ids = sp_ids.indices[:, 0]`, the resulting `segment_ids` is `[0, 0, 1, 2, 2]`. Without knowing the original second column of the `indices` (namely `[1, 4, 2, 0, 3]`), one cannot reconstruct the full `indices`.

Consequently, TensorFlow does not offer a single API call to directly perform the reverse operation â€“ recovering the full indices from the `segment_ids`. A brute-force recovery would require knowledge of the original shape and require iterating over the known segment IDs.

However, several approaches can be used depending on what additional information is available about the original sparse tensor and the intent of the application. One common approach is to reconstruct the missing indices columns based on specific assumptions that often hold in common applications involving segmented data. These assumptions typically involve knowing how elements are arranged within each segment.

**Code Example 1: Reconstructing indices with a regular stride**

Suppose each segment within a given sequence has a consistent stride, meaning the second index increment is linear for each segment. In this case, the second column of the indices can be recovered using `tf.range` and `tf.concat`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example sparse tensor
sp_ids = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(indices=[[0, 1], [0, 4], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 3]],
                                values=[10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
                                dense_shape=[3, 5])

segment_ids = sp_ids.indices[:, 0]
num_segments = tf.reduce_max(segment_ids) + 1
num_elements = tf.size(segment_ids)

# Assuming consistent strides within each segment starting from 0
lengths = tf.math.bincount(segment_ids, minlength=num_segments, dtype=tf.int32)
max_length = tf.reduce_max(lengths)

second_indices = tf.concat([tf.range(length) for length in lengths], axis=0)
recovered_indices = tf.stack([segment_ids, second_indices], axis=1)

print("Original Indices:\n", sp_ids.indices.numpy())
print("\nRecovered Indices:\n", recovered_indices.numpy())

# Verify that the recovered indices represent valid positions in the original tensor
# in this artificial situation
```

This example works if the data is arranged contiguously, sequentially within each segment. The `tf.math.bincount` function is used to count the number of elements in each segment. `tf.range` constructs the index sequence for each segment and `tf.concat` concatenates those sequences to construct the second dimension of the recovered indices. This recovery method inherently assumes a specific structure of non-zero elements in the original sparse tensor. If the original second indices are not structured this way, this approach will fail.

**Code Example 2: Using stored original second index if available**

In some cases, the original second-dimension indices, even if initially discarded during the extraction of `segment_ids`, may have been stored or can be derived separately through another means. In this case, they can be used to reconstruct the complete `indices`.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example sparse tensor
sp_ids = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(indices=[[0, 1], [0, 4], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 3]],
                                values=[10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
                                dense_shape=[3, 5])

segment_ids = sp_ids.indices[:, 0]
original_second_indices = tf.constant([1, 4, 2, 0, 3], dtype=tf.int64) #Assume this data is available

recovered_indices = tf.stack([segment_ids, original_second_indices], axis=1)
print("Original Indices:\n", sp_ids.indices.numpy())
print("\nRecovered Indices:\n", recovered_indices.numpy())

# Verify that the recovered indices match the original indices
```

This example directly recovers the original `indices` if the second-dimension indices are available. The key here is having external information about the data. If those second column indices are available, the recovery is straightforward using `tf.stack`.

**Code Example 3: Using a map to store the original indices within each segment**

If each segment ID is associated with a specific collection of indices within each segment, a map from segment id to original second indices can be maintained. Then, during the reconstruction, these can be retrieved.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example sparse tensor
sp_ids = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(indices=[[0, 1], [0, 4], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 3]],
                                values=[10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
                                dense_shape=[3, 5])

segment_ids = sp_ids.indices[:, 0]

# Example map that stores the second index associated with each segment ID.
# Note this would usually be a custom build during the initial creation of sp_ids.
segment_map = {
    0: [1, 4],
    1: [2],
    2: [0, 3]
}


#Recover the second indices using the segment map.
recovered_second_indices = tf.concat([tf.constant(segment_map[key],dtype=tf.int64) for key in tf.unique(segment_ids)[0]],axis=0)

recovered_indices = tf.stack([segment_ids, recovered_second_indices], axis=1)
print("Original Indices:\n", sp_ids.indices.numpy())
print("\nRecovered Indices:\n", recovered_indices.numpy())
```

In this example a segment map structure is assumed and used to recover the second indices. This is typically useful in situations where the second indices are not sequential but are based on some lookup or prior knowledge. The map would need to be built at the time the `sp_ids` was created, so this solution isn't purely based on what is available from `sp_ids`. This example would only work if a map-like structure was built during the initial formation of the `sp_ids`.

In summary, there is no direct TensorFlow API that performs the reverse operation of `segment_ids = sp_ids.indices[:, 0]` due to the information loss. However, reconstruction is possible if additional information about the original structure of the indices is available or can be assumed. I suggest examining the use case and how the sparse tensors are generated to choose the correct method for reconstructing the indices if necessary.

For further study, consult documentation on TensorFlow's sparse tensor representation (`tf.sparse.SparseTensor`), specifically the properties `indices`, `values`, and `dense_shape`. Also, research the `tf.math.bincount`, `tf.range`, and `tf.stack` functions used in the examples to develop a more comprehensive understanding of their functionality. Understanding the mathematical relationship between the sparse tensor representation, segmenting and the associated index relationships is also beneficial.
