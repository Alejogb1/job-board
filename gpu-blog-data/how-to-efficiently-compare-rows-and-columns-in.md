Efficiently comparing rows and columns within a NumPy array and subsequently removing matching elements requires a nuanced approach, leveraging NumPy's vectorized operations to avoid explicit looping.  My experience optimizing large-scale data processing pipelines has highlighted the importance of understanding broadcasting and leveraging boolean indexing for such tasks.  Inefficient approaches, relying on Python's built-in loops, lead to significant performance bottlenecks, particularly with high-dimensional arrays.


**1. Clear Explanation:**

The core challenge lies in effectively identifying matches between rows and columns.  A direct comparison using standard equality operators (`==`) will fail to account for the different dimensions.  Instead, we must perform pairwise comparisons between each row and each column.  This involves generating all possible row-column pairs and evaluating equality for each element within those pairs.  The resulting boolean array then acts as a mask, indicating which elements should be removed. The removal process itself is best achieved using boolean indexing to create a filtered array, eliminating the need for manual element deletion, thereby maintaining efficiency.


The strategy unfolds in three distinct stages:

* **Pairwise Comparison:**  We'll utilize broadcasting to compare each row with each column.  This results in a three-dimensional boolean array where each `(i, j, k)` element indicates whether the `k`th element of row `i` is equal to the `k`th element of column `j`.

* **Reduction:** The three-dimensional boolean array needs to be condensed into a two-dimensional indicator array indicating whether *any* element in a given row-column pair matches.  This is efficiently done using NumPy's `any()` function along the appropriate axis.

* **Boolean Indexing:** Finally, this indicator array is used as a mask with boolean indexing to select only the elements from the original array that correspond to non-matching row-column pairs.


**2. Code Examples with Commentary:**

**Example 1:  Basic Row-Column Comparison and Removal**

```python
import numpy as np

def remove_matching_elements(array):
    rows, cols = array.shape
    #Broadcasting for pairwise comparisons.  Note the use of reshape to ensure correct broadcasting.
    comparison_array = array[:, np.newaxis, :] == array[np.newaxis, :, :]
    #Check for any match along the last axis (elements)
    match_indicator = np.any(comparison_array, axis=2)

    #Boolean indexing for efficient element removal
    filtered_array = array[~np.any(match_indicator, axis=1), :]
    return filtered_array

array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [1, 8, 9], [4,10,11]])
filtered_array = remove_matching_elements(array)
print(f"Original array:\n{array}")
print(f"Filtered array:\n{filtered_array}")
```

This example demonstrates the core logic.  The crucial point is the effective use of broadcasting to generate the `comparison_array`, followed by a reduction using `np.any()` to create the mask, and finally leveraging boolean indexing to filter the original array. The `~` operator negates the boolean mask, selecting elements where no match was found.


**Example 2: Handling Non-Square Arrays**

```python
import numpy as np

def remove_matching_elements_nonsquare(array):
    rows, cols = array.shape
    comparison_array = array[:, np.newaxis, :min(rows,cols)] == array[np.newaxis, :, :min(rows,cols)]
    match_indicator = np.any(comparison_array, axis=2)
    filtered_array = array[~np.any(match_indicator, axis=1), :]
    return filtered_array


array = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 7], [4, 5, 6, 8], [1, 8, 9, 12]])
filtered_array = remove_matching_elements_nonsquare(array)
print(f"Original array:\n{array}")
print(f"Filtered array:\n{filtered_array}")
```

This example addresses the scenario where the input array is not square.  It dynamically determines the minimum dimension for comparison, preventing errors due to incompatible shapes during broadcasting and ensures robustness across varied input dimensions.


**Example 3:  Incorporating Data Type Considerations**

```python
import numpy as np

def remove_matching_elements_dtype(array):
    array = np.array(array, dtype=np.float64) #Ensuring consistent data type
    rows, cols = array.shape
    comparison_array = array[:, np.newaxis, :] == array[np.newaxis, :, :]
    match_indicator = np.any(comparison_array, axis=2)
    filtered_array = array[~np.any(match_indicator, axis=1), :]
    return filtered_array

array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [1.0, 8, 9], [4,10,11]]) #Mixed Data Types
filtered_array = remove_matching_elements_dtype(array)
print(f"Original array:\n{array}")
print(f"Filtered array:\n{filtered_array}")

```

This addresses potential issues related to data types. By explicitly casting the input array to a consistent numerical type (like `np.float64`), we avoid potential comparison errors stemming from mixed data types (e.g., integers and floats).  Consistent data types are crucial for reliable boolean indexing.


**3. Resource Recommendations:**

For a deeper understanding of NumPy's broadcasting capabilities, consult the official NumPy documentation.  Furthermore, a strong grasp of boolean array indexing and vectorization techniques is essential.  Exploring resources focused on advanced NumPy techniques will further enhance your ability to write efficient array manipulation code.  Understanding the differences between various data types and their impact on numerical operations is also crucial.  Finally, proficiency in NumPy's performance profiling tools is recommended for identifying and addressing bottlenecks in array processing tasks, especially as the array dimensions increase.
