The "duplicate symbol" error, even without `-O2` optimization, fundamentally stems from the linker encountering multiple definitions of the same symbol within a single program's object files.  This is a classic manifestation of a build system configuration issue, rather than an optimization-specific problem, although optimization levels can sometimes *mask* the underlying issue by affecting how the compiler arranges code.  My experience debugging embedded systems for over a decade has shown this error to often arise from subtle inconsistencies in header file inclusion and build process configurations.  The compiler's optimization level simply reveals the error's presence more consistently because it often rearranges code, making conflicting definitions less likely to be silently ignored.

The core issue revolves around the linker's role. The linker's job is to combine the compiled object files (.o or .obj files) generated by the compiler into a single executable. Each object file contains a collection of symbols representing functions, variables, and data structures.  When the linker encounters multiple definitions of the same symbol (e.g., a function with the same name and signature), it flags a "duplicate symbol" error because it cannot resolve the ambiguity â€“ it doesn't know which definition to use.

This can occur even without `-O2` because the compiler still generates symbols.  The absence of optimization simply means that the compiler might not perform aggressive inlining or other code transformations that could sometimes inadvertently (and inconsistently) resolve the conflicting definitions.  Therefore, the error is more likely to surface without optimization because the raw, unoptimized object files often contain more explicit duplicate symbol instances.

Let's examine three scenarios and accompanying code examples to illuminate the typical causes:

**Scenario 1: Header File Inclusion Conflicts**

This is the most frequent cause. Multiple source files include a header file containing function declarations, but only one source file provides the actual function definition.  This results in multiple object files containing the *declaration* of the function, but only one containing the *definition*.  The linker sees the repeated declaration as duplicate symbols.

```c++
// myHeader.h
int myFunction(); // Declaration

// file1.cpp
#include "myHeader.h"
int myFunction() { return 10; } // Definition

// file2.cpp
#include "myHeader.h"
// No definition in this file - this causes the error
int main() {
    int result = myFunction();
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `myHeader.h` declares `myFunction()`, but only `file1.cpp` defines it.  If both `file1.cpp` and `file2.cpp` are compiled and linked without careful attention to which file provides the definition, the linker will report a "duplicate symbol" error because `file2.cpp`, while not providing the function, still has a symbol referencing `myFunction()` from its inclusion of `myHeader.h`.

**Scenario 2: Multiple Definitions in Separate Source Files**

This scenario involves explicitly defining the same function or variable in multiple source files without using appropriate header guards or techniques like inline functions.

```c++
// file1.cpp
int globalVariable = 10;

// file2.cpp
int globalVariable = 20; // Duplicate definition

int main() {
    return 0;
}
```

Here, `globalVariable` is defined in both `file1.cpp` and `file2.cpp`.  The linker finds two different definitions for the same symbol, resulting in the error.  This is straightforward and easily avoidable with careful coding practices.

**Scenario 3: Static Library Conflicts**

Linking against multiple static libraries that contain the same symbol can also lead to this problem.  Suppose two static libraries, `libA.a` and `libB.a`, both contain a function named `commonFunction()`.  Linking against both libraries will result in the linker encountering duplicate definitions. This becomes more problematic when the libraries are third-party and difficult to modify directly.

```bash
# Example linking command showing the problem
g++ main.o libA.a libB.a -o myprogram
```

If `libA.a` and `libB.a` both define `commonFunction()`, even without `-O2`, the linker will flag a duplicate symbol.  The solution in this case usually involves understanding the library dependencies and possibly refactoring the code to eliminate the redundancy or use only one of the libraries.


**Recommendations for Avoidance and Debugging:**

1. **Consistent Header File Inclusion:** Use header guards (`#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif`) to prevent multiple inclusions of header files.  This prevents repeated declarations of functions and variables.

2. **Single Definition Rule:** Ensure that each function and variable is defined exactly once in your project. This is crucial;  only one translation unit (`.cpp` file) should have the *definition* of a particular function or global variable.  Headers should only contain declarations.

3. **Careful Static Library Management:**  Understand the contents of all static libraries linked against your project. Use tools to inspect symbols within the libraries to identify potential conflicts before linking.  Consider dynamic linking if conflicts persist.

4. **Use a Build System:** A robust build system (Make, CMake, etc.) manages dependencies and prevents repeated compilation of source files and ensures proper linking.  A good build system's dependency tracking implicitly resolves many of these issues.

5. **Symbol Visibility:** Utilize appropriate compiler directives (e.g., `static` for function and variable declarations to restrict their scope, making them invisible outside the translation unit) when dealing with potential naming collisions.


In summary, the "duplicate symbol" error is a linking issue that can occur regardless of the optimization level.  Understanding header file management, the single definition rule, and static library dependencies is essential to resolve this problem effectively.  Proactive coding practices and the employment of a dependable build system can greatly minimize the occurrence of this error.  Remember that the compiler's optimization does not cause the error; it can only alter how easily the error is detected.
